104,Great stay close Paddington,"Exceptional customer service. Lovely receptionist Tamara is the dream of each and every hotelier. Excellent location close to Paddington train station. Room felt cosy, great selection for breakfast buffet. Love the complimentary stuff in the room.",5,2024,10,17
104,Tamara‚Äôs service in Park Grand Hyde Park,"We arrived in London on October 17th and went straight to the Park Grand Hyde Park. My family and I were very tired from the trip, but we were warmly welcomed by Tamara, who provided us with a very pleasant experience at the hotel. Thanks to her service, we felt embraced and comfortable, even after a long and tiring day! She is a perfect attendant.",5,2024,10,17
104,Great location and helpful staff,A very friendly staff from the Breakfast staff right through to our Room Housekeeper. We enjoyed the reasonably priced Breakfast in the bright modern morning room too. And it was so close to Paddington station and Hyde Park. Lots to walk to see‚Ä¶,4,2024,10,16
104,Amazing,The service was too good and they are too helpful. Although there was not Gym in the hotel but they have arranged with free of cost which is very near to the hotel. Breakfast are very nice and healthy. Room service are good. Room and bathroom are looking great.,5,2024,10,11
104,Park Grand London Hyde Park is first class,"On arrival Tamara, Nicoleta and Jeana where amazing during check in we arrived early and the ladies where very nice and welcoming. After a quick and easy check in we were able to get an early check in. Tamara gave amazing recommendations on the hotel‚Äôs breakfast in the morning.",5,2024,10,10
104,Just Right,"This small boutique hotel was just right for our trip to London. It's a short walk to the Paddington Underground and Train Station and an inexpensive trip by taxi or ride share service to the station and other areas of interest. The buffet style breakfast, which included all of the English standards, was just right to start our mornings. The neighborhood was surprisingly quiet considering the location. Note that some of the rooms require taking a short flight of stairs which may be a challenge for mobility impaired as my husband was due to twisting his ankle a few hours before check-in. The staff was very accommodating with our request to change from a room with a shower only to one with a tub, and they were very helpful with directing me to a nearby pharmacy to purchase walking sticks and with keeping our ice bucket filled! We recommend the hotel and would stay here again if the opportunity arises.",5,2024,10,08
104,"Definitely in the worst 1% of hotel experiences in over 5,000 nights.","This may be the most disappointing hotel stay I've ever had.  The location of the property was fine.  Near Paddington which is what I wanted.

Front desk was fine - but it had a 2 star (max) feel about it and when I started to walk down gloomy corridors to my room, it felt more like a hostel for those down on their luck.

The room was tiny and again, sub 2 star by the standards I've become used to over 5,000 nights in hotels.

I have no idea how this can be rated a 4 Star hotel. 

I also have deep suspicions as to how it can be as well rated here as it is and would only suggest that you look at locations and language standards of reviewers.  Hmmmmm.",1,2024,10,05
104,Thank you park grand,Thank you Tamara Stella and valee for the wonderful stay. Had a very nice time here at park grand met very nice people and enjoyed walking to central London and Hyde park which is a 20 minute walk from the hotel. Thank you for everything and for this great stay!,5,2024,10,04
104,Good but could be better,"Positives:
Friendly staff
Clean room
Good hot water and water pressure 
Nice coffee, tea and biscuits in room
Good location next to Paddington station

Negatives:
Tiny room and tinier bathroom - the smallest hotel room I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The bathroom was not much bigger than an airplane lavatory. 
Horrible Wi-Fi, does not work reliably and could not connect laptop. When we inquired with staff they did not offer any solution. 
Phone in room doesn‚Äôt work 
Refrigerator was tiny and didn‚Äôt cool properly. I had to throw away my food.",3,2024,10,03

Good room, very comfortable and affordable:) 
First time in London with family would happily come back as staff are lovely. :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))",5,2024,10,03
104,Disappointed and high ratings are not accurate,"This hotel is rated highly on tripadvisor but if you look at Google, the ratings are more accurately represented. We upgraded from
Basement level single rooms to a double but there was no elevator to the seventh floor so we had to work together to get luggage up.  My colleague and I were in separate rooms but we could hear each other.  The staff was very nice.  The phones did not work.  The room ran hot.  I would definitely stay somewhere else.",2,2024,09,28
104,Perfect,"We had really a pleasant stay at the hotel. The reception ladies Stella and Valee were super nice and very helpful.  The rooms were clean when we arrived, and the room temperature was neither cold or hot. The served food in the hotel restaurant was fresh and delicious. Ill definitely come back to the same hotel on my next visit to London.",5,2024,09,28
104,My experience to london,"Everything is excellently. Staff is so lovely, friendly and always available to satisfy all your needs.

Overall a great value for the location and quality of the room. Very close to paddington station. We were able to check in early and they were able to hold our bags on checkout day until our train time.",5,2024,09,27
104,Wonderful,"Hotel is located in nice vicinity. Paddington station is walking distance from hotel. Also has ample of bus stops around which will take you to any part of London. Breakfast is good. Rooms are neat and clean. Valee, Stella, Astonia & Jenia are the staff who are very helpful and prompt in their services.",5,2024,09,27
104,Brilliant Stay at a fantastic hotel in central London,"This is an excellent hotel in a lovely central part of London. My duplex room was seriously large and clean. When I decided to stay an extra night with a separate booking, Tamara at reception was most helpful and professional in ensuring that I would keep the same room for the second night. I also like the nice touch of providing lots of complimentary water, tea and biscuits in the room!",5,2024,09,26

It will be our first option when we will return to London.",5,2024,09,01
104,Great experience,"The stay was great, the staff, especially Stella and Jeana , welcomed us with kindness and professionality, the room was always clean and in order. I recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to come in London and have a great stay with an enjoyable environment and a nice and professional staff

Vitale",5,2024,08,27
104,"Nice hotel, horrible beds","It is a shame that our stay in London wasn't as nice as it should have been because of the stay in this hotel. The staff was nice and helpful(specially Tamara who spoke our language and was so kind, shame we met her only the last day), the installation and breakfast were ok, and the location  was good. The problem was the beds and pillows, never have I found such uncomfortable beds, double beds which would sink not standing well the weight of two adults so we fell to the middle, making it practically impossible to sleep. And pillows so high that the neck suffered. Unfortunately visiting London without getting a good night sleep is not a good experience. Of course, this is our own experience, maybe not all the beds are the same or some people may even like sinking beds...",2,2024,08,25

104,Amazing,"I book this hotel after I been declined  3 times from different hotels has I want to ask them to decorate my room so I can propose my partner, ( bring with me all decorations ) but when I book this hotel and send them a message saying if they can decorate my room so I can propose to my partner they say more than yes and they come with ideas and help from the KH team as well.

You make our stay memorable and will not go to forget this for all life. 

I want to say a massive thanks to the team from the reception ( Tamara, Valee, Easterna and Jeana) for your amazing hospitality and support and special a massive thanks to Marta from HK for make my room and decorating my room. Marta once again thank you for all your help.",5,2024,08,17
104,Amazing,"The hotel was really close to the train station and the metro as well but is not this made my stay better than I expected.

104,Sevim,Sevim is a very nice employee as he helped me with fixing my key card and he let me in my room when I had an emergency with my child. He also offered me a variotuon of tea and coffee for me to serve for myself. I hope I will enjoy the rest of my stay whilst im here as it‚Äôs been superb!!!,5,2024,08,17
104,Great Service and Comfy Room,"We had a great experience at this hotel. The bed was very comfortable, and I particularly appreciated the service of the breakfast staff. Anthony, the breakfast manager, was so kind, accommodating, and helpful every day. I would definitely return here!",5,2024,08,17
104,"Great stay, centrally located","Had a wonderful experience. It‚Äôs very centrally located, walking distance from Paddington station. The staff is warm. 
The location of the hotel is the biggest plus, can travel easily the travel to all of central London. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is good.",5,2024,08,15
104,Good service,Everything was great. The service was really good but specially the people at the front desk like jeana valee and the house keeping team. It is very close to the underground which is good and there are a lot of restaurante near by so that works too.,5,2024,08,12
104,‚ÄòDoes the job‚Äô Hotel,"Great location - 5 minute walk to Paddington station. Checked in fine (although why do they ask UK travellers for I.D? I get that you show your passport abroad but it really isn‚Äôt necessary when I‚Äôve come from a couple of hours away). Room clean. We booked a double but got put in an apartment with bedroom downstairs and a small living area upstairs - a nice surprise! Quiet in the morning as well. Yes it‚Äôs a bit tight and whilst the double shower was lovely, I‚Äôd maybe reduce it slightly so there‚Äôs a bit more room around the toilet, but overall no problems, a solid 3 star place for a night or two and I‚Äôd stay again.",4,2024,08,09

104,Nice location,"Excellent location and soo many places to eat nearby, there‚Äôs nice gardens to walk through nearby, including Kensington Gardens which is lovely. The hotel is off a quiet road off the main one but its location is great, great service from the staff too",5,2024,08,03
104,If the night staff were more like Easterna I would be giving this a 5 star review,"After a bad start, having been moved hotels and missed our pre-paid meal, we were greeted by Easterna the morning after who was able to put things right. She fully explained the situation and presented us with satisfactory options to compensate the meal we missed. If it hadn't been for Easterna our trip would have been a disaster, as the night porters were absolutley useless, only making the situation worse. I fully support some form of reward and recognition for Easterna who remained polite, professional and helpful throughout our stay, standing out amongst the crowd, and I would only return knowing she is on duty. If the night staff were more like Easterna I would be giving this a 5 star review.",3,2024,08,03
104,Not for a good night sleep.,"The location is very convenient as it walking distance to Paddington Train (and metro) station and the staff is very attentive. But the constant noise of the mini fridge, the rasp of the old wood under the carpet, and the old beds and huge pillows makes it hard to have a good night sleep.

The hotel feels and smells old. The distribution of the rooms is such that it is almost impossible to open a big luggage in other place different than the bed and there is too little storage space for your clothes.

If you select the duplex room do not expect to have a bed in the upper floor as shown in the pictures, since you will only get a sofa-bed.

Also, my son throwed a candy wrapping paper from the upper floor to the main room and it landed on a truss, and I used a sweeter to get it down along with a huge amount of accumulated dust which makes mi think it has not been cleaned in several months.",2,2024,08,02
104,Near Paddington,Great location on a quiet street just a block off Paddington station. Lots of wonderful eateries within a few blocks. Easy walk to Kensington Garden and Hyde Park. The bathrooms are tiny and you must verify the AC works in your room before you settle in. Not fancy accommodations but reasonable if you are only going to be there for sleep.,4,2024,07,30
104,a nice break from the city,"A nice break from the city the ducks are lovely we spent a couple of hours there and theres some shaded locations

Will need to come back to spend some more time but its probably one of the best green spaces in London. Highly recommmended for families and friends",4,2024,07,29
104,London,"A perfect location to stay, great staff, nice and cosy rooms with a good breakfast to start the day.

10mins walk from Paddington station.

We would stay again !

Suitable for all ages and differing nobilities.

A lift to access the floors, lifts very busy in the morning and had to wait for a long time to access the lift.",5,2024,07,27
104,A sub-par room,"An older hotel very well located near Paddington Station, Hyde Park, and numerous restaurants.  The room was tiny, with steps just inside the door that were difficult and potentially dangerous to navigate, especially with luggage.  The bathroom was likewise tiny, and the shower difficult to use.  The lighting was not good, and we had to navigate a second set of steps to get from the bed to the bathroom at night.  Check-in was somewhat disorganized, as they insisted our reservation did not include breakfast, which they only relented on after I showed them the written reservation confirmation (which they still had to confirm with their manager).  Breakfast itself was OK, with a fair variety of foods.",2,2024,07,21
104,Satisfied family stay,"All the staff is very helpful, initially, there are some issues with our room, but they managed to solved this quickly and we are happy with the final arrangement! The breakfast is yummy and lovely. Easterna and Cosmin was so attentive and helpful with our checkout procedure.",5,2024,07,21
104,Grand park london,"This hotel has some very friendly staff, centric location and a good breakfast. I will recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Hotel is located close to the train station. Your luggage can be left with them, they will make sure to keep it safe.",5,2024,07,20
104,Great breakfast,"We originally booked another hotel which I assume are linked and was given a room here as there were works at the other one. We were sceptical from some of the reviews but only needed it to sleep after the Hyde Park concerts. Although very small it was clean, had complenetary tea, coffee, biscuits, water and fresh fruits. We are used to staying in very small rooms in this area so knew the size was quite usual. We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast which was included with the room. There was a choice of full English or continental with tea,coffee and fruit juices.  Weve never had this included and done so well at other equivalent hotels in the area. Overall satisfied for a 1 night stay. ",4,2024,07,17
104,Great location for tourist trip,"Great location near Paddington station which makes it easy to take the tube to sites around town.  Hotel is in an older building and the rooms are very small and the bathroom was incredibly small.  We tried the breakfast one day and it was good (eggs, sausage, bacon, pastries, toast, etc ).  Overall the location makes up for the small room/bathroom.",4,2024,07,16
104,"Don‚Äôt book,","Room was as small as a jail cell We were given a room in the basement which had a broken window which wouldn‚Äôt close
We could hear rats outside, there was music blasting all night which the staff done nothing about, paid for room service and didn‚Äôt receive it and didn‚Äôt get a refund either, staff were uninterested in any of the problems",1,2024,07,13
104,Great experience,"The hotel was very nice and is located in a nice area close to Paddington Station. The train from the airport, The Heathrow Express, stops at Paddington. The hotel staff were very nice and helpful especially Jeana. She was very helpful.  We stayed at the hotel with family for 2 nights before getting on a cruise ship in Southampton. Our pre-paid car transport from hotel to port failed to show up at the hotel to pick up our group of 6 with lots of luggage. Jeana stepped up and arranged for a cab (van) to pick us up at the hotel ASAP so we would not miss our cruise ship. She was our hero for the day since we knew we needed transport for the 2 hour ride from London to Southampton and not miss the ship boarding time deadline. We were almost the last people to board but we did make it.",5,2024,07,11
104,Amazzziiinngggg!,"Absolutely first class stay.  Greeted after a long journey by smiles and glass of fizz and fresh strawberries.  Lots of fresh fruit available in the lobby and in our room. We booked double club with bath and our room was just next to Reception.  Really handy.  Super comfy beds, great air con and lovely bathroom products including soap.  Full range of breakfast, very tasty and not vegan but vegan choices too.  If that‚Äôs not enough pampering, one can pop across the street to the sister Montcalm hotel, for use of the spa.  Cannot recommend this hotel enough and big shout out to Jade, Marsida and Dijad - great team!  Thank you.",5,2024,07,09
104,But would I go again !!! ???,"About as much like a boutique hotel as Primark - small very drab room, total refurbishing required, a bath towel so thin and small we thought it was a hand towel. Cheap basic soap and shampoo - this is a 2/3* hotel at best. Premier far better value so no return visit for sure",2,2024,07,06
104,Horrible customer service.,"Would highly recommend NOT booking with this hotel.
I booked a stay for this coming October 2024.  I went directly to the hotel's website because i don't like to book through 3rd parties.  I prepaid my reservation months in advance.  My flights got changed and i am no longer able to stay in London.  Trying to cancel this reservation has been a nightmare.  First, I found out that their website actually DID route me to a 3rd party (Priceline.com, hotelbeds.com, getaroom.com and a labyrinth of others). Then, after more than a dozen email attempts, multiple international calls, to the 3rd parties and directly to the hotel, i very clearly asked them NOT to cancel this reservation unless i could be refunded.  They canceled it anyway and kept by $600.  None of them will tell me who exactly HAS my $600 and keep referring me back and forth.  A hotel employee told me they would allow me to use the credit at a later date and now they won't.  Can't get anyone at the hotel to help me at all.  Will never recommend this place.  wish i could leave less than 1 star.",1,2024,07,02
104,Nice enough,"The breakfast is good.
The rooms were a bit small and cramped but still comfortable.
It‚Äôs about 10 minutes walk from the nearest tube station and that was a bit of a drag, as we stayed in November and it was very cold (coming from a tropical island!)",3,2024,06,30
104,Close to Paddington,"Room was too small and hardly fit on the toilet. Bed was very comfy, room was quiet. All the pillow were pretty from and would suggest one softer one. It was clean all amenities and restaurants and Paddington station a 7 minute walk. Hyde park was close enough to walk to as well if you had an hour or two to see it.",3,2024,06,29
104,Yikes,"Since our awful stay I have researched this chain a bit more. Avoid would be a huge understatement. If they paid half as much time on their customer satisfaction as they do on the ""review system"" they might be an ok Travelodge.
Not clean, not friendly, not vfm, and sleep quality will make you yearn for home.
Avoid+",1,2024,06,29
104,June stay,"We booked for a short stay in London. The rooms are quite small, but the location is amazing; close to a metro station and several attractions. The staff is also so friendly; Mudaffar gave us lots and lots of amazing recommendations. And then Tamara and Easterna helped improve the details we did not like about our room. Will definitely choose this place again for our next stay!",5,2024,06,27
104,Not sure the 4 stars are warranted,"The staff are friendly and the check in was quick and efficient. The room is compact but clean and thank goodness for the aircon . However, for an AA 4 star hotel we expected an en-suite that we could actually use. The toilet was so close to the shower, we had to open the shower door to actually use the loo!  There is no extractor, no shelves or room to store anything. The lift is small and it takes an age. The breakfast was ok at best.",3,2024,06,24
104,London weekend break - not for single travellers,"Single rooms are clean but,very small. Window isn‚Äôt double glazed and bathroom is tiny. I‚Äôm not large but, the shower is tight. Noise from the extraction fan is intrusive at the back.Location is great for Paddington. Quiet area. Staff friendly.",2,2024,06,16
104,Conveniently located near Paddington Station,"Small rooms with thin walls. Heard our neighbors, and sure they heard us too. But the location near Paddington station was very convenient, staff were welcoming and helpful, and breakfast was enjoyable, so would consider staying again. Delightful restaurants nearby (Bizzarro and Flavors of India were our faves), and walking distance to Kensington Palace Garden.",4,2024,06,15
104,Customer service -> 0,"I chased these guys for two weeks for a simple invoice of my stay. 4 emails without answer. 7 calls. 6 times nobody even picked up, and the one time someone did, he took my request, found my booking and noted my email address. I still haven't received the invoice...",1,2024,06,14
104,Dustiest Room!,"I have two complaints with this hotel. First, it was the dustiest room I have ever stayed in. My allergies were acting up. The room was carpeted. The bed frame was 2"" off the floor, so it was impossible to vacuum underneath. The headboard was too close to the wall. Can't vacuum there either. The far side was 6"" from the wall. Vacuuming there was possible, but unlikely. The brackets and wires behind the wall mounted TV had a thick layer of dust. Clearly never vacuumed in the many years since it was installed.

There was a little reading spotlight by the bed. At night you could see the dust swirling around. I took a video of it. I showed it to the front desk the next morning. They gave me another room. I moved my luggage to the new room, and went out for a day long bike ride. On the ride I went over the handlebars, and ended up in the hospital for four days. I called the hotel and had them take my luggage from my room. It was then stored in a corner in the office in back. While stored there, $60 was stolen from my luggage.

After I got out of the hospital, it was now past my scheduled check out, so they had no room for me. I sent around the corner and found the Royal Eagle. No carpeting. Only a continental breakfast, but it was better for my gluten and dairy free diet. And no dust behind the TV.

On my next visit I will return to the Royal Eagle.",2,2024,06,14
104,"Great staff, Comfortable room, Needs were attended to promptly!","The bathroom was super neat and clean. We could take a bath or a shower and the water was as warm as you wanted! The bed was soft and comfy, pillows were amazing and we did not awake during the night! Syed was very helpful and answered any questions we had and provided us with a few needed items immediately! I highly recommend this Hotel.  All the staff we came in contact with were very kind and pleasant!",5,2024,06,03
104,Bad experience would not go back,"I booked a double room with breakfast. When I checked in I was told breakfast was not included and would be charged an extra ¬£25. Room smelt bad and had mould around the grout and cracked floor tiles. There was a large bright light shining in to the bedroom that illuminated the room through the night as the blackout curtains didn‚Äôt work. It was noisy, there was a family in the room above that were banging  and screaming until 3am. The room next door then had the TV on at 6:30am that could be heard through the paper thin walls. The ‚Äúdouble‚Äù bed were 2 singles pushed together which came apart and were very uncomfortable. Luckily we were only there for one night and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. I would have explained this on checkout but I think it was the same rude receptionist who checked us in and didn‚Äôt even ask how are stay was. Very disappointed and ruined a much needed getaway with my wife.",1,2024,06,02
104,Great Location and Value,"Great location near Piccadilly. Five minute walk to Heathrow Express.  Good restaurants in the area and neighborhood is safe.  Room was fine, but might qualify as having world‚Äôs smallest bathroom.  Clean and comfortable. Overall, great value.",4,2024,05,30
104,"Great location, avoid the basement rooms.",Small room in the basement. Comfy bed and adequate. Heating took some working out as room was cold on check in (windows open). Shame that at 05:30 some nearby machinery started up (kitchen ventilation?). Really noisy and constant until I checked out. Not what I'd expect for the price. I was told rooms on upper floors much nicer. Recommend the hotel but don't let them put you in the basement!,2,2024,05,30
104,Nice hotel and good location,"Lovely looking hotel very convenient for Paddington Station, Hyde Park and Kensington Park. The staff were really nice and gave us a free upgrade from a twin to a room with two doubles. It was really nice, although bathroom was tight and a bit cramped. Hence 4 stars. Other reason is my breakfast was ok but my friend‚Äôs was cold as she ate after me. So think that might be hit and miss.",4,2024,05,16
104,Weekend away ,"The hotel was fine, clean and tidy. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was for the fact the room was pretty small and it was difficult moving around it as the bed was taking up most of the room.

But, that aside it was reasonably priced for central London, and I probably would stay again if I was in London again.",4,2024,04,03
104,Very disappointed,"Very small ‚Äúquadruple room‚Äù with tiny bathroom.  Beds were double and very soft. We rang reception many times on second nite to request extra bedding but no one answered. Bathroom was smallest we have ever seen. The hotel was so far from what it looked like online. Net curtains had holes and curtains are stained. The main positive factor was proximity to Paddington station, otherwise we were all very disappointed.",2,2024,03,27
104,We won't use again,"Anyone else find it odd that so many 5* reviews mention staff by name?
The hotel is clean, breakfast is OK. The rooms are small, we had seven and one of us - well below 6' tall - could touch opposite walls simultaneously in his single. All the rooms had the same issue where the toilet is between a wall and the shower cubicle with 2 or 3 inches either side. OK for a pee but you will struggle with anything else. ",3,2024,03,26
104,Warning: Unsafe do not stay here,"Stayed 16/17 March 

Upon arrival the hotel had messed up the booking. We had booked a double room but were told we had a single room. After showing evidence that we had booked correctly and the mistake was on their end, we were given a double room on the basement floor. Receptionist said he‚Äôd take care of it. We thought ah well it happens, no problem..

2am that night while asleep, two people came into our room with a key. The hotel had given two guests a key to our room. Obviously 2am is an unusual time, so we assumed the worst. The poor couple who had come in did not speak English very well, and so we actually struggled to get them to leave. My boyfriend went up to reception to find out what had happened, but upon returning his door key (the only one we had been given) had been disabled and so had to go back to get a new one. 

The receptionist at the time offered us free breakfast (which we didn‚Äôt quite fancy) and told us to speak to the manager who would be in the following morning. Turned out the manager was not in the following morning and the senior receptionist (third one we‚Äôd spoken to since checking in), gave us a business card with an email and contact number and told us to sort it ourselves when we got back. We weren‚Äôt rude, shouty or aggressive throughout any of this-too easy going in hindsight, but the staff all seemed to blame each other and it was actually quite comical. 

The room itself is what we expected for the price. It was clean enough, could do with a lick of paint and new carpets like a lot of places. You can occasionally hear rats scuttling behind the wall through the crawl spaces, but we think this must be exclusive to the basement floor. 

Currently trying to call the hotel about a refund but can‚Äôt seem to get through. 

I know this is probably a one off experience, but the staff here are very incompetent. Anyone can walk in and use the lifts. The hotel is next to Paddington station. It‚Äôs just not safe. Steer clear!",1,2024,03,18
104,"Ok stay, good for transit stop...","We had an ok stay at this hotel. It's an ok stop if you are in transit from here to there but would not be ideal for a substantial stay. The location is near paddington station which is good. The building was rehabbed to add an extra floor at some point, so when you entered teh room, the bathroom was on one level and then you stepped down into the bedroom area. The room  had a huge 2 twins pushed together which was nice but this made the room hilariosuly small (even by London standards) - the foot of the bed and the desk practically touched. It might have been better without the desk lol. The luggage had a tuck away spot on the level that held the bath so it was ok. Breakfast was ample fuel but not inspired. There was a little bar-like space with taps off the lobby but it was not open at any point during our stay. the advert online indicated a bowl of fruit would be avialable on check in- it wasnt.  It was all ok, but a little meh.",3,2024,03,14
104,Disappointed,"Slightly disappointed with the hotel, This was surprise trip for my partner and I for valentines, I had opted for early check in at 2pm , arrived at 2.15pm and the room was not ready and had to wait in lobby for 30 minutes. When I asked why it was taking so long it was due to making sure the ‚Äòromance package‚Äô was ready and in the room ( Prosecco and strawberries ) which it was not, I had paid and upgraded from a superior queen room to an executive king room with sofa which we did not get, when questioned this they said there is no difference in the rooms and not all come with a sofa bed so why the extra upgraded price ? While waiting in the lobby for the room to be ready we each had a 200ml bottle of Coca Cola which was ¬£4.20 each for half a can!",2,2024,02,19
104,Perfect little stay,"I stayed at the hotel alone and as a female traveller, I was a bit nervous. As soon as I entered, I was greeted by the friendliest receptionist, and felt instantly safe and at ease. The room was perfect for a night, if you were staying for a longer duration, it might be a bit small, but for me it was perfect. I‚Äôd definitely stay again if I was travelling alone! The room was clean and cosy and the bed super comfy.",4,2024,02,17
104,"The worst room number, this is 0 star hotel","Very bad , very old , nothing works , no one care about you, staff are not friendly, we pay for twin room and got room with single queen size bed, and staff asked us for additional payment to got our already booked room, bathroom is awful, everything is dirty , we escaped from that hotel and book another one",1,2024,02,12
104,Great stay and great breakfast,"Great stay. Very clean room and staff very friendly. One of the friendliest welcomes we have had in London

Location great for King‚Äôs Cross and Euston connections too 
Thank you all we will be returning",5,2024,02,08
104,Poor morals and bad customer service,"Disappointed in the customer service at this hotel and feel quite exploited. I had booked two nights at this hotel. Unfortunately the storm meant that all trains were cancelled which I could evidence. I wanted to change the date of my booking to the following week. However the would not accommodate me by changing the date and took my payment, no refund offered. There was no alternative. Will not use again.",1,2024,02,04
104,sleep well1,"the service there was excellent. staff helps me to carry luggage, and complete the check in even I have much questions. Besides, there are many choices to choose pillows. Usually, I'm strict with sleeping quality and bed quality. In this hotel, there is no noise, the bed is soft. therefore, I sleep well.",5,2024,01,31
104,Good stay,"Booked here by my boss first time for the business trip and have to say really surprised for the quality of the rooms. Very clean and good atmosphere,  staff polite and helpful.

104,"STELLA, HUBASHIR","The hotel is clean, spacious and bright, the facilities are convenient, the gym is very good, the self-service laundry is also very convenient, which is very convenient for me to travel all year round. The main price is affordable, parking is free, live very satisfied!
the hotel service will be relatively good. Take-out is convenient, too. Another point is that when booking a room, the picture outside the window is a forest view, and the result is that the house is a picture of the scene, and the little sister explained that the direction is not the same.",5,2024,01,20
104,Jay,"The room is comfortable with all the essentials, the service is nice friendly and welcoming, also very nice to all the people who went to reception to ask for anything, in my honest opinions I think no problem at all and everything is good and worth the price, I will for sure come back the next time I visit London",5,2024,01,17

104,Don‚Äôt take a basement room.  Lots of other options out there.  Keep looking.,"The hotel is convenient to Paddington Station which is great.  Thats where great ends.  There were biscuits and tea which was nice.  We booked in August for December at just under $400 per night we were underwhelmed.  The basement room was too small to open our suitcase and be able to move in the room.  I understand why the bed cover is dirty - it‚Äôs the only spot big enough for a suitcase.
The curtains were dusty and overall we felt like we got shoved in a closet.  The bed was short and sagged in the middle.  We were expected to use a space heater.  

The last comment is the sound rodents moving through the walls/ceiling.

Lots of other options out there.  Keep looking.",2,2024,01,01
104,Friendly staff ever,"The reseption employees was the treasure of the hotel.Friendly and polite ,they help us with all the information that we needed and a lot of other needs that we had.Stella and all the other staff were absolutely wonderful.

104,"Great place for families, big breakfast included","Great location for a family. Less than a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station and short walk to Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. The kids loved the split level room and there was plenty of space for the 4 of us. The morning breakfast was a great way to start the day and the staff was very attentive. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of scrambled eggs but was able to get a couple of fried eggs and espresso to kickstart my day. 
 
After returning home, I noticed an extra fee in the credit card statement. It was handled quickly and refunded after a phone call to the hotel. They were friendly and apologized for the mistake.

The shower had Black hair on the floor, it was a disgusting, poorly kept tiny tiny room. Paid ¬£130 for a Deluxe twin, got a shoe cupboard with 1 tiny bed.l, so not a Twin ar all.

A member of my party backed out the same day, I tried to cancel through booking.com and my request went unanswered by the website and hotel for a week, even after multiple emails. I made an international call and the help desk was VERY rude, constantly cutting me off and borderline yelling, and told me they could not waive the cancellation fee as it was a Booking.com policy, but Booking.com says it is a hotel policy. Neither one wants to help and are very happy to take the $1100 for the empty room. I will NOT be using this location/chain again and would advise others to do the same.",1,2023,12,08

104,Avoid,"This is a totally honest review ,if you read my other reviews you will see how positive they tend to be . This hotel is not one I would ever recommend. It is certainly nowhere near a 4*. I have stayed with this chain several times at the Park Grand Kensington and left amazing well deserved reviews. I thought this hotel would be the same ,I was wrong .  As you can see from the photos the room was very disappointing , the dirty blind separating the bedroom from the bedroom had to be seen to be believed. The couch was stained . The socket was unsafe. This was actually an upgrade room I wouldn't like to have seen the original room.  I had to ring down to reception 2 out of 3 mornings as we only had hand towels. One morning the shower couldn't be used as the water was barely a trickle . Breakfast the first day , the only cereal available was Rice Krispies ,croissants etc were running out and were very slow to be replenished. The only yogurt available on the first morning was natural.  At over 200¬£ a night there are far better hotels .
On a positive note the staff are a credit to the hotel. ",2,2023,12,05

Brilliant. The staff were great and very well mannered. Received an upgrade to a duplex room which was very good of them.

Location
Don't trust the maps on your phone too much. Walk out of paddington underground and the walk is no more than 7 minutes. The location is nearby restaurants, take outs, shops, and Hyde park.

Room
The room is ok but let down by the draft windows. The room ceiling is high and I can see this hotel be fine in the summer. But in the winter it was cold. The room would benefit with fixing the windows or installing another heater downstairs as the temperature was zero degree Celsius. The shower, bed, etc was good. They should have switched the better TV to the bedroom.  Iron, iron board, hair dryer, shower gel, kettle, microwave in this room, sofa, etc.

He provided full details of all the options on the menu and understood what type meal I was going for. I would recommend this to friends and due to the excellent hospitality and service by this staff I plan to host my friends birthday event at this restaurant and I will be sure to look forward to it! ,5,2023,11,26
104,Don't be fooled by the website,"Don't be fooled by  the website. This hotel is variously described as: Boutique, Exquisite Elegance and Chic & Sleek. Our experience was far from any of this.
The entrance and reception are a far cry from the 'de luxe' room we stayed in.  
The room had a short flight of stairs in the room itself which would have been totally unsuitable for anyone with mobility issues.
The room was oddly configured with some space wasted and yet had an extremely small wardrobe.
The wall furnishings were grubby, there was a hole in the net curtain, a broken lampshade and a cracked tile on the bathroom floor. (see photos)
The bathroom was small, the towels very small and almost threadbare and, although the shower was powerful, on some mornings the water at best was lukewarm.
The cleaning of the room was inadequate as on at least a couple of days the carpet was not hoovered.
The room rate we paid included breakfast however every morning we had to insist that that meant a breakfast each not just one.  We heard several other guests having the same problem. Staffing was rather hit and miss. Sometimes it was hard to find anyone to take tea and coffee orders.  The breakfast itself was fine with lots of choice.
There were some positives: the location is excellent and we found the beds to be comfortable. However we would not stay here again.

104,Atrocious,"Business trip. Rooms booked as inexpensive for London but this was a false economy as they were not good value. 
Dirty, tatty room. 
Hairs in shower.
The environment would have been just tolerable if only because there was at least a bed, had the service not been appalling.
Reception team woke me at 1am by telephoning my room to ask me whether a member if our work party (who had been unable to join us), was coming. 
At 1am. Seriously. 
Avoid. 
This is not the advertised 4 stars. The standards are akin to standards expected of a backpacker hostel. . Which made it very expensive. ",1,2023,11,21

It is directly next to the train station, staff is incredibly nice and always available, especially Stella. She took care of everything and is one of the loveliest receptionists we‚Äôve ever met ! We arrived 4 hours early, but we were allowed to check in early. We also got a socket adapter after we forgot to bring one. Everything was easy and we would love to do it again sometime ! We can only recommend! Thank you so so much ",5,2023,11,21
104,My experience ,The hotel is in a nice location. I got the chance to get a early check-in thanks to the receptionist miss Stella which was very helpful. Excellent service from her side. I had a good experience üëåüëåüëåüëå,5,2023,11,21
104,Appalling ,"Appalling hotel. Deluxe double was more like a cheap basic with a constant droning from the room above. Mattresses outside small window, plug socket hanging out of the wall. Staff treated like you were stupid. Did not  even stay the first night. Whole weekend completely ruined.",1,2023,11,21
104,Staff review ,"Stayed in this hotel for a very long time and the staff were amazing and incredibly patient, friendly and attentive. Staff such as Stella, Mubarak, Xavier, Jenna and Marcel deserve an award ü•á. They are a prime example of how a hotel should treat any guests. ",5,2023,11,20

104,Great stay!,"Mubashir was great, he upgraded our room as we were on our honeymoon and even brought us a fruit platter what a nice guy! Great facilities and quite clean, although if I had to offer some constructive criticism I would recommend maybe renewing the carpets and checking the AC as it was a little warm.",5,2023,11,19
104,Paid twice for one breakfast.,"Please be aware that if booking via the web site you only get an option for a continental breakfast. When I checked in I was advised that I had not paid for breakfast, so I bought  a prepaid breakfast which was cheaper than paying in the dining room. When I went back and pointed out that I had already paid for a continental breakfast, they refused to lower the price for the full Engish brekfast, so I paid for two breakfasts!",2,2023,11,18

104,Exceptional Service and Location,"Stella and Tamara ensured that our stay was exceptional. When we had to extend our trip unexpectedly they were extremely accomodating and provided advice and care that went above and beyond. The location was second to none - so close to Paddington but surprisingly quiet! Breakfast was excellent quality too. Thanks so much for your assistance. We would highly recommend the Park Grand, London Hyde Park. ",5,2023,11,16
104,memorable experience at this fantastic hotel,"we stayed a week in London by my relatives and we had two relaxing nights in this magnificent hotel... the service was first class and the staff was always friendly and smiling... a special mention on our part would go to the young guys we had the pleasure of meeting: Stella at the reception, Mubashir and Easterna (I hope to have written them right) that have made our stay memorable.",5,2023,11,15
104,Stay at Hyde hotel London,"The staff was good and very helpful. Well mannered as well. The location was great. The food was also great. Three staff members Easterna, Stella, Musashi were excellent. Time here was worth it and I would come again",5,2023,11,15
104,Good all round experience,"Very nice room, decent breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff. Stella at reception was especially helpful. Breakfast staff also very nice, made me a pot of coffee to have at my table. Very short walk to Paddington station. ",5,2023,11,15
104,Not the best hotel!,"This hotel provided us with a comically poor experience. We've stayed in London at a variety of hotels over the past few years and this was the worst stay we've had.

We laughed (and struggled) when we reached our floor and still had to move our luggage up and down steps on the way to our room. The corridors were tight and so were the fire doors. Once we opened our room door, we howled with laughter when we saw our bathroom.

You could sit on the toilet, wash your face, bush your teeth AND shave all on the same time... it was that tight!

Breakfast was poor and although the staff tried to be helpful, It's clear this hotel chain is struggling to remain relevant.

We stayed at a sister property a few years ago (Park Grand Paddington Court) and had a much better experience.

This hotel is convenient to Paddington and many other venues, but be wary of the room they assign you!",2,2023,11,14
104,Reception staff was highlight in this hotel,"No hotel will beat Park Grand London Hyde Park  when it comes to location.  It is in the Paddington area, lots of restaurants nearby, walking distance to Portobello and a few minutes ride to Harrod, the famous Abbey Road, etc.  The reception staff with the lead of Cherie, Ashtina and Mubashiz were all pleasant and very helpful.  However, the hotel rooms may need some freshen up. Bathroom, however, has been renovated.  I have been in the hotel industry for 34 years and I will not call this hotel a 4-star.  ",5,2023,11,14
104,Jeana was amazing,"Jeana was amazing and helped me andmy mum with everything we needed 
10/10 service, from the first day to the last, I would highly recommended this hotel to my friends and family and to go to jeana also 
Thanks once again for an amazing trip it was a good",5,2023,11,14

enjoyable thanks to their excellent
hospitality",5,2023,11,11
104,Business trip,Nice cosy hotel. Good location. We stayed 1 night for a business trip with breakfast included. Breakfast was good English breakfast buffet. Service was good. Staff was welcoming. Single room was adequate but bathroom a little small. Highly recommend,5,2023,11,11
104,Not so Grand hotel,"Was interested to stay in a different part of London so selected this hotel based on its price and 4.5 rating in Tripadvisor. I don‚Äôt know how it achieved such a rating but the room my wife and I were given was an utter disappointment. The room might have been acceptable in London 30 or 40 years ago but doesn‚Äôt meet current standards. First off the room was very small ‚Äì so small that the full sized bed (not queen) was held hostage on 3 sides by walls. The mattress was comfortable enough but the bed linen didn‚Äôt fit the mattress (sheet could not be tucked under the mattress on all sides) and there was no mattress pad, with the result that in the middle of the night you found yourself sleeping on the bare mattress. 

The furniture is old and tired ‚Äì dark brown in color (almost black) and scarred by years of service. There were only 2 electrical outlets available and these were side by side behind the desk. No USB charging ports in sight, and no electrical outlets on either side of the bed. There was an air conditioning unit in the room but it didn‚Äôt work. I reported this to reception but it remained non-functioning for the 5 nights we were there.

The window was of a type that probably hasn‚Äôt been sold in the UK for 40 years ‚Äì metal framed with a single pane of glass; very dirty and badly in need of a coat of paint. At least it functioned so we could cool the room down. The bathroom was small. The toilet and sink were fine, but the shower stall was so small there was barely room to bend down if you dropped the soap on the floor.

Breakfast is served in a basement room. Food quality was just ok (tea was good), but the room was stifling with no air circulation. After 2 mornings trying to drink hot tea down there we gave up and visited one of the many coffee establishments over at the station for the remainder of our stay.
Hotel location is good, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that the tube station(s) is the easiest to figure out. The Paddington tube station entrances are identified by which line you want, and are separated by considerable distances. The entrance to the Circle line towards Kings Cross is a long walk across the mainline station from the entrance to the Circle line going towards Gloucester Rd. Perhaps a small issue unless you have kids or mobility issues.

There is a brand new Premier Inn under construction across the street from Paddington. I think the Park Grand will need to reinvent itself else it is slowly going to lose customers to these newer hotels.
",2,2023,11,10
104,My experience at Grand Park London,"Good experience I had with my wife. We received excellent service from Staff Easterna, Tamara, Xavier and Mubashir. They made our stay more enjoyable.
We had to get directions and how to move around during our trip and Easterna provided us much information, printed to us a google sheet on places but most important she notified us on payment mode in various areas. We had to get travelex card that made easy for underground, train, restaurant and other place.
",5,2023,11,10
104,A warm and friendly welcome,"I had a very enjoyable time at the Park Grand London Hyde Park. The staff were warm and welcoming - thank you Easterna and Mubashir - and my room was clean and comfortable. Little things, like having a kettle instead of an infernal coffee machine, like having an iron which worked and a shower which was easy to navigate made my visit a real joy.",5,2023,11,09
104,Nice hotel with great location ,Very nice hotel and the room was spacious.  Staff is very courteous and helpful.  Mubashir made sure that we had smooth check in and was helpful with all our requirements. Overall we had great experience.,5,2023,11,09

104,One of the best places I have chosen in a long while to stay at!,"This hotel from the very moment you step in was a warm pleasant surprise, the room was humongous and lavish in a simplistic style, the facilities were stocked up were essential goodies and the bed was literally like sleeping on a cloud. I have to also mention how friendly, professional and warm the staff were!",5,2023,11,04
104,A great stay when in London ,Good and calm location. The hotel offered great service. The contonental breakfast exceeded our expectations with a lot to choose from. It was only a five minute walk from the Paddington station. All in all good!,5,2023,11,04
104,Nice Hotel with Nice Receptionists,"The room here is impeccably clean and well-maintained. The receptionists, Stella, Easterna and Jeana, went above and beyond to provide exceptional assistance, ensuring that any inconvenience was minimized to the fullest extent.

104,It was my first time in London and I was surprised by kindness of people at the hotel particularly Ms TAMARA and STELLA.,The people working at the hotel are very professional.

104,Unique Boutique,Great location - within walking distance to Paddington Station. Easy to take Heathrow Express to Paddington then walk down the block to this hotel. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The 3-bed room is small but we were out exploring most of every day so it was sufficient. Comfy beds & quiet neighborhood so it was ok to leave the windows open for air. AC was a welcome feature. Over all a great stay--would stay again if we make it back to London.,4,2023,10,31

104,"Great location, friendly and helpful front desk, and comfortable rooms. ","I am traveling from Amsterdam, 

II got a nice upgrade from the hotel, the staff Easterna ,Xavier and mudashir, where of great help 
The beds where comfortable, 

The location is very near  Paddington station,  the electricity stock for my trimming was not working, and they sensed up some body to check and fix directly.",5,2023,10,28
104,"clean, attentive, friendly","The staff were very friendly. We were able to get our room upgraded. Thank you to Eastema and Tamara! Breakfast served fresh in the morning. Hotel was in a nice quiet area, with the Paddington tube right around the corner. ",5,2023,10,27
104,Very poor room,"I cannot explain other people‚Äôs excellent reviews of this hotel as it is very poor in my view. 

I booked a single room at a reasonable price for one night. I booked because of the hotel‚Äôs proximity to Paddington as I was leaving from there in the morning. On my arrival there were two members of staff on the desk, one ignored me as he was staring at his computer screen and the other ignored me as she had her back to me and was catching up with another member of staff about social (not work) issues. No one else was waiting and eventually I asked loudly whether I could check in. This was not a great start to my stay. 

I was allocated a single room on the 6th floor of the hotel. I have no idea why hotel owners and designers think that people occupying a single room also should only get a bathroom the size of a small wardrobe as this one was. In fact it was smaller than the clothes cupboard adjacent to it. Newsflash - people need proper size bath and shower rooms whether one, two or fifty-two people are occupying a room!! For a hotel that describes itself as four star this one isn‚Äôt in my view. 

The acoustics were poor, and I was woken by the people in the neighbouring room arriving back at about 2 a.m. They appeared to be speaking in normal tone voices but the walls must be paper-thin. The bed was uncomfortable as the mattress was as soft as jelly and the bed wasn‚Äôt made - the bottom sheet disappeared down the side of the bed during the night as it had not been tucked in. The room itself was dated with chipped furniture. There was tea making facilities, a safe and an iron but that is all that can be said. The shower was so small that once you squeezed through the opening it was impossible to turn around without opening the doors and flooding the floor of the bathroom! I will not be staying here again.",2,2023,10,27
104,Great Staff,Staff was fantastic.  Especially the front desk team.  Stella Easterna made us feel right at home. They were responsive to our needs when called and were helpful when arranging transport.  It was also extremely convenient to paddington station.  ,4,2023,10,26
104,"5 stars, even after a hiccup thanks to Stella!","I stayed at this hotel with one of my friends after we had been traveling around Europe for a month. There was one hiccup with house keeping and communication, but this one hiccup was completely removed and acknowledged by the staff at the front counter to the best of their ability. I would really love to highlight a particular staff member, an amazing lady named Stella! I have no words for her, she has been the kindest person to us the whole trip and made us feel like a home away from home family. Stella made our London experience wonderful and she held herself with confidence, grace and kindest which is what you need in customer service! Thank you!",5,2023,10,26
104,Very good stay,"Thanks to Stella for the welcoming, she is smiling and availabile. She gives us good tips. 
The bedding is nice and the breakfast is very good. 
The hotel is very closed of many transports (bus, underground).We have passed a good journey and hope come back soon.

104,Excellent ,Very polite and friendly customer support. Stella gave a warm welcome and pleasing care. Services are better and clean. Its near by the tube station and easy to access. Transport facilities are available all the time.,5,2023,10,26
104,We would come back just for Stella! ,"My friend & I have been travelling for a month now starting at Paris, then Milan, Rome, Florence with our finial destination being London & what a nice change of pace for once after travelling for so long. The Park Grand Hotel was close to Paddington station, with shops nears by & plenty of places to eat within walking distance. It was such a lovely hotel to stay in for the last week of our trip. A special mention goes to Stella who made our stay just that more enjoyable & her customer service was outstanding. We would come back just for Stella! Thank you for having us Park Grand London Hyde Park. It was a pleasure ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Kindest,
Minnah ",5,2023,10,24
104,Excellent stay,"It was a really great experience. Nice room (small, but suitable for my needs and very comfortable and silent), great breakfast, good welcoming at reception desk, specially by Stella Xavier and Mussadir, both who have kindly helped me! Really a positive experience. I would come back here with pleasure. ",5,2023,10,24
104,Stella was so lovely ,Stella was super helpful and accommodating! When we arrived we checked to see if we could store our bags as we were early and she allowed us to check into our room early which was so nice and helpful!,5,2023,10,24
104,Def not a 4 star hotel !,"We booked this hotel very last min so did not have much choice ‚Ä¶.. I did email the hotel first to request a room with a view ‚Ä¶ we got a room over looking roof tops!
The positives are that it is central (literally cross the road and walk up and you are beside Paddington station) and near shops a few streets away and it was a safe hotel.

The downside ‚Ä¶ very tired ‚Ä¶. Needs a complete overhaul (def not a luxury hotel and it is not cheap!) 

We stayed in a family room‚Ä¶everything was dated however en suite etc was clean ‚Ä¶
The breakfast was in the basement and was ok 
‚Ä¶we literally slept here as always out and about.

In conclusion I would not stay here again ‚Ä¶ premier Inn and travel lodge/Novotel probably way better value and modern and central however we did leave very late to book.",3,2023,10,22
104,People make the difference,"I have been in London many times, but it‚Äôs very hard to find such friendly and efficient staff like Stella and Xavier.
Our vacation in Park Grant Hotel was really nice and relaxing: it‚Äôs really true that people that work there, make the difference!
Thanks",5,2023,10,22
104,Staff makes the place,"In general it was a nice stay, nothing too special but more than what you‚Äôd expect. The biggest surprise was the service, in particular Stella. The help from Stella was Worth every pound, she helped us with everything we could ask for, and much much more. Thank you!",5,2023,10,21
104,"Worst hotel, best reception","Worst hotel ever, and I have travelled a lot for work so I can compare it with many other hotels. Thanks God, I have met nice people at the reception, Stella in particular, very professional, kind and helpful, who helped me make this terrible experience a bit more bearable.",1,2023,10,21
104,Good,"I liked the location and cleanliness and breakfast but somehow we could not judge the room size online and it was very very small in single room category I can't call it a room sorry , but staff was really good and helpful Marcel and Stella are awesome üíØ",3,2023,10,19
104,Great time in Park Grand Hotel,"Great place to stay, very quiet at night and very comfortable to stay. Thanks Jeana Stella for helping me to make my stay great.

104,Absolutely nothing like pictured. Not sure where the fancy doorman or nice rooms were but certainly not here,These photos are so incredibly misleading. More like a hostel room. Dingy and incredibly small. Worst bed. Did not sleep at all because i kept rolling into the sag in middle of the bed. My husband‚Äôs feet hung off the tiny bed. And the bathroom was so tiny. Where did the photos even come from because it doesn‚Äôt even look like the same place? So different!,2,2023,10,10
104,Not very grand ,"Our room was a reasonable size (superior quad it was billed as but was basically two double beds) but had no places at all to put clothes despite being a room for 4 people so we had to live out of our suitcases for the 3 nights we were there. As I say, room was for 4 people but for the first 2 days we were given 1 cup (and strangely 4 saucers) for our coffee. When we asked for more the first time nothing happened then when we mentioned it again someone left 3 takeout style cups next to our 1 existing cup as if we had asked for something additional rather than what should have been there. The light in the shower strobed violently the first two days despite us telling reception that it was happening. Apparently the caretaker did pop in but it wasn't doing it then, which I find hard to believe as it did it every single time we were in there. So my husband had to video it happening and take that to reception to get them to do anything about it. Reception staff barely acknowledged us the entire time and when we asked about where breakfast was, the lady in the bar area looked positively annoyed that we were bothering her and just pointed at another door that went to the stairs and dining room. 

On the plus side the location is great, 5 mins walk from Paddington and Hyde Park itself and the breakfast was good. 

All in all I would never choose to stay here again, I'm pretty sure that for the money there are better options (see my review of the Georgian Hotel for example). ",2,2023,10,10
104,10/10,Best hotel I‚Äôve been to in Hyde park. Room was super comfortable and clean. The staff was very accommodating. Marcel was super nice and helped me with my suitcases!! Front desk was also very friendly. I‚Äôve been to 4 other hotels around the area and this one was by far the best one. Will definitely recommend and cone here again,5,2023,10,10
104,Comfortable room and friendly service,Stella and Xavier were both very helpful and answered any questions I had. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Also the room temperature was just right and it wasn‚Äôt noisy outside. Can‚Äôt fault it really. Thank you!,5,2023,10,08
104,Good,"Small but comfortable rooms, staff were very polite and helpful, particularly Tamara.
Would happily stay again when traveling for work.
Amenities and tube are in close proximity making travel around easy.",5,2023,10,06
104,good old customer service,"Refreshingly good old customer service; polite greeting with offered refreshment drink, super attentive to requests, late check-out, neat and tidy rooms, and brilliant location. Hard to fault.  Can recommend. ",5,2023,10,06
104,Park Grand London,"Great location, close to the metro, parks, river, everything  what i've had needed! Hotel itself is very luxurious and quiet which I really needed.
 All in all, even for my next trip to London I'll pick Park Grand hotel.",5,2023,10,05
104,We'll be back,"Very friendly and helpful staff, Jeana on the front desk was great. The room was clean and well furnished. Breakfast was enjoyable. The best thing about the hotel is the location, a short stroll from Paddington.",5,2023,10,05
104,Don't stay here if you're a business traveler,Our company (a top Pharmaceutical) has had several terrible complaints about the Park Hotel London Hyde Park.  Our business travelers are getting the worst rooms. What's worst is customer care is not answering me nor is the Montcalm Sales rep who we negotiated a corp rate with. This is terrible service.,1,2023,10,04
104,Look for something nicer...,"We booked directly with the hotel to get breakfast for free, the booking was also non-refundable.  As others have commented, the hotel facility is worn and needs a re-do.  The restaurant was closed so breakfast was in the basement, was full of patrons and due to poor ventilation was very hot.  The staff were very kind and helpful, but seemed overworked.  We booked this hotel due to it's proximity to Paddington Station which is close by and the hotel is quiet; however, next time I'll spend a bit more money and get something nicer.  This is a 3 star hotel at best in my opinion.",3,2023,10,04
104,Love,I stayed at the hotel 3 nights on October 2023. The location is great and the hotel is wonderful in a very quiet and peaceful area. The special things in this hotel and make it different is the stuff specially Stella at the reception and Miarcel they are polite and helpful. I will back to this hotel cuz the great treatment I receive from the stuff.,5,2023,10,04
104,"Good location, friendly staff!","The hotel facilities were decent. Environment clean. What stood out was the friendliness and support of the staff, specially Stella and Petrus who became a reference during my staying in London.

104,Great stay,"Great temperature in the room with comfortable bed, as well as a very attentive service from Stella on directions, indications and tips. Although it was a short business trip I enjoyed it, as well as the location",5,2023,10,04
104,Great customer support,"Stayed with my young daughter and received excellent, friendly and helpful service. They helped with getting the wifi working on my laptop and couldn't be more enthusiastic to make our stay enjoyable. Particular mention to Jeana and Xavier, who were brilliant - they found my tablet that I left when I checked out, and kept it safe for me for the 2 weeks until I returned - carefully ensuring that it was mine before returning it to me.
Well done for the honesty of the staff and overall care and support!",5,2023,10,03
104,"Terrible, terrible smell","Absolutely terrible. Terrible smell in the rooms. The whole environment felt cheap. This is not, by any stretch, a 4 star hotel, it is a two star hotel at best. I think there is some misleading going on with the reviews as well.",1,2023,09,30
104,Pleasent stay ,I‚Äôm never disappointed about this hotel. I think the best thing of a hotel after the cleaningness is the service. I was with my little baby and the receptionist Stella has helped me out looking after him and giving him some chocolates. She‚Äôs soo nice. I always book here as it is close to my friends house. ,5,2023,09,30
104,Outstanding stay,"I had an outstanding experience at Park Grand London Hyde Park. Xavier's warm welcome and room upgrade made our stay memorable. The location is excellent, and the spacious, clean room exceeded our expectations. The staff's hospitality was exceptional. Highly recommend",5,2023,09,30
104,Helpful service ,"Convenient location, very good service. 
Story, Mrs.Eastema Stella gave me a big help and suggestions on the good restaurants. I was lost the way back to the hotel, she was patient on the phone and gave me location.
Thank you so much.",5,2023,09,30
104,Not very grand,The hotel is very run down and shabby. While our room came with breakfast we would certainly not have paid extra for it. We actually didn't even eat it after the first morning. On the upside it was clean and the staff were wonderful and very willing to assist. The location is excellent. Unfortunately I wouldn't stay here again.,3,2023,09,27
104,Grand yet not grand,"Very grand from outside but has a ‚Äòcheap‚Äô feel about it. I had an  upgraded room after I told them I had read poor reviews. The room was spacious , clean and comfortable with good lighting. There was no face washer and the toiletries were average. 
No note paper (first hotel in 17 days that didn‚Äôt provide it) . Breakfast was very average indeed. As I said, everything was on the cheap side. I would have liked muesli and better fruit selection. Eggs looked dry and unappetising even though I was first in to breakfast.",3,2023,09,27
104,Rate for my stay,AMAZING SERVICE RECEIVED AT THE PROPERTY. AWESOME PROPERTY AND PERFECT LOCATION FOR MY SHORT STAY. STELLA AND JEANA WERE VERY HELPFUL TRYING TO SATISFY ALL MINE AND MY FRIENDS NEEDS. THE HOTEL IS VERY WELL LOCATED. THE PRICE IS GOOD AND NOT TO EXPENSIVE. I DEFINITELY SUGGEST IT AND I DEFINITELY WILL COME BACK. It was my second time there. ,5,2023,09,26
104,"Okay as a Budget Hotel, but There's Little ""Grand"" About It","London hotels are expensive.  I was impressed when I found this TA Travelers‚Äô Choice award winner with a 4 ¬Ω bubbles designation and great reviews.  It offered attractive pricing and a great location, all backed by many beautiful photos‚Ä¶I reviewed about 30.  My wife and I spent six days in a ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù room at the Park Grand.  So did two other couples traveling with us.  
Over twenty pages of TA reviews, well over half(!) are excellent (5 bubbles) but with few or no specifics, and are from people with only one or occasionally two reviews, total.  A surprising ratio.  Also, a high proportion of the (fewer) negative ones are from frequent reviewers.
Here‚Äôs my review:  Park Grand London Hyde Park is an adequate budget hotel with a great location, a gorgeous fa√ßade and consistently fine desk staff.  The ‚Äúgrand‚Äù pretty much ends there.  The expensive breakfast is fairly good, the bed was fairly comfortable and housekeeping was adequate.  Room maintenance was poor, with a broken towel hanger and missing shower drain cover (photos).  The tiny sink, barely suitable for hand washing even small clothes, lacked a stopper; I used a handy Ziploc bag.  Sink lighting is behind you, ensuring that you shave, apply makeup or insert contacts in a shadow.  Our (Deluxe) room itself was a postage stamp, precious square footage is lost to an entrance hallway.  An ironing board was in our room, but there was nowhere to store it (the ‚Äúcloset‚Äù was a tiny cabinet), so we carried it back to the desk.  The room looked nothing like the first 30 photos on TA, including some taken by TA.  We only made it habitable by taking our bags to the desk for storage, each still half full.
	We might stay at this budget hotel again, but with more realistic expectations.  There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with two stars.  The Park Grand proved to be a good value for the market.  But it‚Äôs in no way a four-star hotel as cited by ‚ÄúThe Automobile Association,‚Äù nor did we experience the quality cited by many reviewers.

104,Good customer service,Ronny was very helpful and really made sure we got the perfect penthouse to accomondate us - balconies and furnishings slightly differ between penthouses - some half walkout balconies some large doors,5,2023,09,24
104,Disappointing,"While in a quiet location in Paddington, the hotel is barely a 3 star.  Housekeeping could have been better.  Used, empty bottles from previous guests sitting on the window sill behind the curtain.  Unusual method of payment in full upon arrival...never experienced paying the entire bill prior to check out.  Seemed it's this hotel's policy.  Find a better location and you will be happier.",3,2023,09,24
104,"Great location, nice, no sleep.","The staff at the front desk were amazing (truly, so helpful) and the location next to paddington was great. Quiet nights (outside‚Ä¶) and felt safe walking back and forth from the train station. The room was very small, but not unexpected for London. I was on the basement floor and the bed was right next to a big window. That made me a little nervous as I‚Äôm a woman traveling alone. One night I heard someone right outside my window at 2am. All good, just a little uncomfortable. 

I gave this hotel 2 stars because I stayed in a room that had loud, infrequent (but several times a minute) buzzing noises. I believe it was coming from the aircon. 

Thank goodness it was just two nights. It was so loud that I couldn‚Äôt sleep AT ALL! I didn‚Äôt say anything because I had meetings all day, everyday until the late evening and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to pack up and move rooms. If it had been more than two nights, likely would have asked to be moved.",2,2023,09,22
104,Park Grand Hyde Park,"The hotel was a very nice stay and the location was great. The breakfast was nice for the price you pay. Jeana was at the reception when I got there, she was very kind and helpful! Definitely recommend. ",5,2023,09,20
104,This was our 7th time in London and most of the times we have had hotel around Paddington.,"The hotel was clea, the staff polite and frendly. The room we go at first was far to small and inconvinient. We got a new room, thanks to Stella. And we were able to enjoy the rest of our vacation. The location was perfect for us, easy to go anywhere.",3,2023,09,20
104,Good location but tiny room and not very clean and service was poor as well.,"The good - Great location. Good neighborhood and close to the underground.
The bad - tiny room, tiny bed, tiny shower, sheets not 100% clean, towels not all replaced although they were on the floor, shampoo and soap not refilled although I ran out.",2,2023,09,20
104,Do not accept a basement room!,"Staff at check in/ out were friendly but this is where the good news ends. I stayed at this hotel last night through business. I was charged ¬£172 for a dingy room in the basement with no view at all. The room was the smallest I have encountered for some time. The chair was stained, the bathroom was equally tiny and the basin had no cold water feed so water was scalding hot -the room had a queen  bed, but it was not possible to walk around the edge of the bed, it was so tiny.  The bed was soft and spongy and on peeling the duvet back there was a stain on the inside which was disappointing. A very tired hotel indeed and  I can only hope that the rooms above ground are a little brighter and roomier. Located reasonably close to Paddington Station is a positive but if you must stay here, please insist that you are not in the basement rooms!",2,2023,09,19
104,Handy for Paddington Station,"The hotel staff were great, the hotel rooms could have been cleaner. The curtains were dirty and the windows cracked. The grout etc‚Ä¶ in the bathroom needed cleaning also, it would have been nice to have had a fridge and water replenished, but they are just minor snags. Wouldn‚Äôt say it is a 4 star, but nice enough.",4,2023,09,19
104,Great Stay,"Lovely place to stay for the weekend on a solo trip. Stella & Jeana were super great at reception. Great location close to Paddington station. Close to restaurants and shops.

Would definitely stay again. 100 percent recommended.",5,2023,09,18
104,Great value ," The location of the hotel is beyond real! It's literally 40 seconds from Paddington station and 5 min from Hyde Park. The staff was very welcoming and kind and was willing to assist us with any request we asked for. 
We want to thak each one of them, and especially Stella.
",5,2023,09,16
104,Pleasant stay,They stay was good. The staff is friendly. Rooms are small and cozy. The housekeeping staff can d better with the room floor cleaning. Wish they had more options for vegetarians and vegans in the breakfast menu. Overall connectivity to the underground is good.,5,2023,09,15
104,Tight space by great service,"The rooms were quite small, but I guess that‚Äôs the same for most hotels in downtown London. 
Staff was really friendly and helpful. Special call-out to Stella at the reception. I will always remember the excellent service and help she provided. 

Breakfast was good, though it gets a bit crowded in the restaurant. ",3,2023,09,14
104,Avoid by all means !,"Awful place ‚Ä¶ avoid absolutely
First you are welcomed by trash in front of the hotel
Then comes the reception ¬´¬† you will get good room¬†¬ª ‚Ä¶ enough place for a vacuum cleaner not for a human being
Furniture is old and crappy, bedsheets are too small
Way to the room goes in front of the toilets
Breakfast is cheap 
Receptionists cannot even provide you with an adapter
The best moment is the check out which feels like a relief !",1,2023,09,13
104,Stella and other staff is amazing and so is this hotel,"The receptionist Stella was wonderful!!! We came from a 12 hour flight and although our room wasn‚Äôt ready until 2 she made it possible for us to get a room sooner so we could rest. She was also super friendly and talked with us while we waited for our room to be ready. The rest of the staff was super helpful and nice but she stood out to us the most :) THANK YOU!!! She made this trip so easy for me and my husband, and was super understanding of our situation. ",5,2023,09,13
104,Nice standard,"Centrally located with a lot of things within walking distance and especially Paddington Station whilst coming in from Heathrow,  good and friendly staff. Rooms ordinary/normal in size and beds were good. I do not like the full carpet...but it is England! ",4,2023,09,12

",5,2023,09,09
104,A motel with mold problems at best,"It is not a 4 star hotel. In American standards, it is a motel with mold problems. If you care about the cleanness of a hotel, or have mold allergies, do not stay there. The staff there also lack the knowledge of what should be a 4-star hotel experience. I saw them requesting people to write a good review for them, so be aware that the good reviews may have been influenced. I booked two days here, but checked out and left on the first day. I stayed at Hilton instead, which is a true 4 star hotel with up to standard cleanness, as a comparison. The pricing are very similar. Meanwhile, I am still fighting the hotel management to get a refund, for the two days I didn‚Äôt stay there. They‚Äôve lied to my booking company trying to keep my money. I will not recommend this kind of experience to anyone who wants to have an enjoyable, hassle free vacation. ",1,2023,09,08

104,Hotel experience,"Xavier was the best, he was so gentle, he treated us very well and was super friendly, the hotel breakfast was very good, And the hotel in general is super clean, the rooms are spacious, comfortable, and the people who serve at the hotel are super nice.

104,Much more than adequate for the night.,"This is a very well placed hotel, just round the corner from Paddington Station but in a quiet street. Ideal for Heathrow trains then. A good welcome and introduction from Syed and Mudassir on reception and we got a duplex room with an upstairs mezzanine. It was a bit small but no problem for an overnighter. 
Breakfast was freshly cooked - real sausages. 
This is quite an old building and it‚Äôs a bit of a warren finding rooms.",5,2023,09,02
104,Nice staff and good location,"Nice and kind staff.
Clean room.

Not full stars on this review is because of the breakfast that wasn‚Äôt so very tasty in my opinion and not so many options to choose from. 
Water should be included in the room price but it was not. 

And the elevator was way to slow and the bathroom was way to small. 

Location was good and near to stores and the train station and so on. 

I would have probably chosen the same hotel if the price was low at the period of time for booking. ",3,2023,08,31
104,Disappointing/Poor,"Check in was slow, but staff polite. The room unfortunately, was extremely small with no outlook and very poor lighting, you have to be a contortionist to get around the bed. On pulling back the bed cover I was welcomed by ""human hair"", alot of it...
The bar was not open during my 2 day stay even though the hotel was busy.
The house keeping staff cudnt have been any ""noisier"", needless to I certainly will not return to this hotel.
I have stayed in the Park Grand Paddington on more than 1 occasion without complaint",2,2023,08,30
104,Amazing hotel friendly staff,Amazing beds and space enough for 3 chicks with big suitcases partying at the carnival. Xavier and the staff very friendly and always smiling. Amazing carnival and we will come back next year. Lover you alll,5,2023,08,29
104,"Cancelled but still charged, customer service a disgrace","I booked 2 rooms for a stay in July, flexible rate so cancellation without charge was allowed up until the day before the stay. I subsequently cancelled online via website in June, but didn't get a confirmation mail. I emailed the hotel to confirm the cancellation went through, never received a response. I was then charged ¬£186 as a no show for one room for one night, which was not only incorrect but made no sense when I booked 2 rooms. So it's now 5 weeks since I first complained, after 2 phone calls and 10+ emails, promises of responses from the hotel - still no response or any sign of a refund. If my experience is anything to go by, avoid this place at all costs",1,2023,08,26

104,Good value,"Out of the three hotels my family stayed in during our trip to the UK, this was the best.  Its tucked away just a little behind Paddington Station -easy walk to the train, tube, grocery, pubs, and other little travel-esq. cafes. The staff were nice, the hotel is clean and well kept, and the rooms comfortable.  They recognized that we had a 7-year-old with us and put us in a split level room that worked out great.  Our daughter slept upstairs on the fold out couch and we slept downstairs.  The room is not large by Amercian standards, but was still comfortable and provided what we needed.  Its a good value",4,2023,08,17

104,Nice location and support stuff but accessibility can be better.,"Very British-esque property located in Westbourne Terrace, Westminster, which is a very upscale neighbourhood of London. While the location is a plus just a stones throw away from Paddington station making commute easier, the room size and accessibility could be much better. Dragging two suitcases to the room turned out to be quite an extensive exercise. Otherwise room amenities are pretty decent and it‚Äôs in a quaint neighbourhood, hence guaranteeing a good nights sleep without disturbance. The support staff is quite helpful and welcoming especially Rania at the front desk.",3,2023,08,16
104,Park grand London Hyde park,Good experience. Mudassir and salsa welcome me and it‚Äôs very near to paddington station. Good place to visit. Staff is excellent.Nice  Location. Nice restaurants near by. I suggest to visit this Place.,5,2023,08,16
104,Great staff,"Lovely staff who went out of their way to be helpful, especially Marcel & Rania

During my stay they had work done on the trees  which left the cars at the front of the hotel covered in sawdust. No problem - the staff washed the cars

Breakfast is good.

Location is great, walking distance to Paddington Station

Only criticism is that the towels are designed for very small people",5,2023,08,13
104,Excellent staff but overpriced h√¥tel,Stella was a great host and warmily Welcomed us when we arrived. She was th√© winning feature of th√© h√¥tel which was really overpriced given th√© stale smoking smell in th√© room and the dirty carpet. A pity. ,2,2023,08,12
104,Brilliant place,Fantastic place a brilliant service from Syed and Antonio I couldn't ask for better reception from these guys happy to help and very professional I will certainly return again. Fantastic place 2 mins away from Paddington station,5,2023,08,11
104,As usual‚Ä¶better in pictures.,Room was not very clean. Holes in wall. Marks and scuffs on wall. Warm and old carpet. Hair left in bathroom tub. Marks on sheet. Pictures make room look larger and we had a ‚ÄúDeluxe Double‚Äù. Bathroom smallest I have ever seen. You can not keep anything in there and it Ben the toilet paper will get wet when you shower. Even when they came in to clean it was not very good and towels they left for us were stained or not clean. Had to ask for new ones. All towels are very thin and old. Pillows are thick hard foam and hurt our necks. Good location and people at front seat were friendly. Only reason I did not give one star. Look at reviews on other sites. They are much worse than on Trip Advisor. Would not recommend.,2,2023,08,11
104,My go to choice of hotel,"Comfortable stay. Excellent connectivity to rail, tube and buses. Good choice of restaurants in the vicinity. And most importantly, courteous & friendly staff - Rania, Mercel, Mudassir, Larissa.
Would love to stay here during my next visit to London. ",5,2023,08,11
104,Many thanks Rania,Tania and salwa was very helpful they helped me and my wife to change a room we asked for a quiet one they really was amazing we was happy to meet them at reception. The rooms are small but very clean and so comfortable they deserve more then 5 staff especially for the great location ,5,2023,08,11
104,Be Wary of Hotel‚Äôs Cancellation Policy ,"Avoid this hotel like the plague. 

I booked a room for one night, however, due to a faulty on line connection, the same room was booked twice and two separate payments were taken from my account.

I explained this upon arrival at the hotel and the receptionist staff were extremely helpful.

However, the hotel has refused a refund due to their strict cancellation policy.

Be very wary of this hotel as to their cancellation policy is strictly adhered too.

I would not stay there again as it appears whilst a genuine error has been made, the hotel will not consider a refund.  In this case,they have put profit before customer service.

There are other hotels in the area.

104,Great,"The location is great. Hallways can be tight with larger luggage and there isn't always access to the lift.  The walls were a bit thin and sometimes we could hear the bigger groups in nearby rooms/down the hall. This wasn't great when we were trying to get over long-haul jet lag and groups were coming in loudly in the early hours of the morning, but this isn't the hotel's fault. The adjoining restaurant was delicious and was super careful with allergies. This put those in our family with allergies at ease. Overall, the staff were really helpful and we would come back.

104,"Not so grand, but good location.","I have just spent 10 days here, using 2 deluxe Twins, 1 Deluxe Double, and 1 Superior Quad.  Just as many people ‚ÄúStage‚Äù homes for sale‚Ä¶, so this company shows you pictures that are very staged.  There is no doorman, flowers or fruit or bathrobes or roses on the bed.  The dinning sunroom is closed and stacked with storage.  Breakfast is typical English but not elaborate.   The saving grace of this place is that it is one block from Paddington station with its shops, tube, rail & bus options.   The desk folks are well trained to offer apologies, but there is little follow through.  My room and the other deluxe twin had sewer gas from sink/shower drains.  Housekeeping‚Äôs answer was to place the bath mat over the shower drain.  I requested a cover for the open shower drain 3 times and got no action.    We were grateful for cool weather, because the room AC unit in the Superior Quad barely worked.  The single pane metal frame windows slide open  only 3 inches.  The bathroom in the Superior Quad was small with a tiny circular shower.    There is one lift for 7 floors.  The bar/lounge is closed, but the tables may be used.   My room lacked a fridge, another had no ironing board.  My room‚Äôs safe was flat on the floor in the wardrobe= glad to have it, but tricky to get down there to use it.  When I asked about a cost reduction, I was told ‚Äúsome rooms have things, some rooms don‚Äôt.‚Äù.   We chose this place based on TripAdviser‚Äôs good rating.  In 2023, this place should be rated basic/average and  not more than 3 stars.",3,2023,07,22
104,Rania and Stella best staff ever,Rania and Stella are two best receptionists ever. Rania helped me to print and scanned some papers at reception that was amazing Stella was very helpful as well. It was my second stay at this hotel I enjoyed it as always,5,2023,07,21
104,If this is deluxe I‚Äôd hate to see standard,"Good location 5 mins walk from Paddington station on a lovely quiet, tree lined avenue. 
The hotel is actually hidden away with no obvious signage so was a little tricky to locate at first.
As I was a solo traveller staying down in business I opted for a single deluxe room - it was tiny! My feet hung out of the bed, the walls were so thin I could hear every word of the lady next door‚Äôs phone conversation at 3:30am and the one bath towel provided didn‚Äôt fit around my (average sized) waist.
There is no restaurant facility on an evening only a bar but this apparently only opens at 9pm?!
On arriving at breakfast I gave my room number and was asked if I‚Äôd added it to my booking. I confirmed I had but was made to wait 5 minutes standing in the middle of the restaurant whilst the man went to check.
Once seated and having seen others arrive 10 minutes after me given tea and coffee I had to get up and ask for some.
Needless to say I‚Äôll be looking for an alternative hotel for my next business trip.",2,2023,07,20

Amara and Vanessa at the check-in desk were wonderful, helping us sort through some challenges with our reservation and making sure we had a nice room. 

Hotel itself is a bit dated and cramped. Elevator is slow and tiny, certainly true of many places in London but it became an issue trying to get up and down to the room. Didn't have the breakfast but it looked nice. ",4,2023,07,08

104,AVOID,"Unreasonably small room and bathroom located in a basement area that couldn‚Äôt possibly be compliant with fire safety regulations. The room looked nothing like the pictures online, at least 30% smaller.
The light over the bed flickered like a strobe light and a strange loud buzzing noise erupted every 15 seconds.
The front desk booked a car for us to Heathrow but when we arrived, found that the fare was ¬£10 more than quoted and that they only accepted cash. When I called the hotel I was told, like other reviewers, that they would need to check with the ‚ÄúReservations Department.‚Äù I was promised a call back, which of course, never came.
Overall, this hotel is advertised falsely, unsafe, uncomfortable, unprofessional and has a business model directed at extracting as much money as possible from unsuspecting tourists.",1,2023,07,06
104,Issues with website Hotel Reservation,"I wanted to make note that while booking via the hotel‚Äôs site, I encountered an issue where my payment failed and I had to enter the information and try again. Unfortunately, it failed a second time and I had the charges show up on my credit card transactions. I reached out to the hotel and spoke with Dinesh M. and he was able to sort things out for me and take my reservation over the phone. 
I haven‚Äôt stayed here yet, but if this is the level of attention and assistance for a prospective guest, I can‚Äôt imagine how great they must be at making your stay feel extra special!",5,2023,07,05
104,good family stay!,We stayed in June just a couple nights.  We had a good size room ‚Ä¶double beds but bathroom very tiny.  also warning up a tiny steep staircase so luggage up and down a bit tough if on that 4th floor.  It was a nice hotel but kinda far from city center if Uber which we did for time to some scheduled tours.  we didn‚Äôt have time for the breakfast.  staff friendly.  Overall nice stay just kinda far from main tourist spots.,4,2023,07,04
104,During my 5 nights stay,"The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood minutes from the Paddington Station. The room is extremely small, shower area is very tight difficult to maneuver, however, the water pressure is excellent. Staff are friendly and helpful especially Stella. The room is clean with a/c and Wi-Fi. Overall, it is okay for a solo stay. ",3,2023,07,03
104,Don't book,"I am sorry to say we were extremely disappointed with this hotel, the hotel is filthy, the carpets have never been cleaned. The pictures shown here are old - this hotel is dirty and tired. The rooms are super small for very large prices. The beds felt like they were 100 years old. There is only 1 elevator (I understand European charm) and it was super slow. We stayed at other old charming hotels that modernized the interiors for the same prices. This was a roadside hotel for luxury prices. The front desk staff was generally friendly and helpful, and we loved the neighborhood feeling. ",1,2023,07,02
104,Not quite up to basic hotel standards,"We are currently experiencing the Park Grand London Hyde Park service (or lack of) as I write this review. We are still going to be stuck here another 3 days since we had to prepay the entire stay when we checked in, otherwise we would have checked out already and moved hotels.

We arrived a few days ago and had made our July 2023 reservations direct with the hotel via their website back in January 2023. We are traveling as two couples with two separate room reservations. 

When we arrived, we were informed that somehow one of the room reservations was booked twice and that it was definitely our mistake. The front desk staff stated that the ‚Äúreservation department‚Äù was a different group and they confirmed it was our mistake. So we may be charged a one night no show fee for the mistaken extra/3rd room reservation per the policy. 

We were given a reservation‚Äôs number to call and complain; but since we were already told by the front desk that reservations confirmed we were in the wrong; why would we waste one minute arguing. So we will wait for the change to hit our credit card.

The hotel is in a nice area and is in reality placed back behind Paddington Station then being Hyde Park adjacent. The rooms are old and do not look like the website photos and it‚Äôs a huge laugh to call this a ‚Äú4 Star‚Äù hotel. 

We had reserved and then paid in full a double club room. We were under the impression for some extra services like they advertised on website ‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhile in the room, guests can enjoy the complimentary wine, soft drinks, fresh fruit, tea, coffee and mineral water‚Ä¶‚Äù We have not seen any of the wine, soft drinks etc or any offer for it to be provided. So don‚Äôt waste your money on a club room.

There is also no Bar or Restaurant operating after breakfast. The hotel‚Äôs website touts the bar as ‚Äú‚Ä¶ our popular bar is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a selection of alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic drinks and savory delights in a trendy atmosphere‚Ä¶‚Äù then a paragraph down it reads - ‚ÄúClosed until further notice‚Äù‚Ä¶ So no bar!

However, the breakfast service in the morning is the only thing good about the hotel. The food is well prepared and a good start of the day.

Regarding basic services; after returning from our first day of exploring London; we found our rooms had not been serviced at 5:30pm. We called the front desk and was informed the room was not serviced because we did not hang the ‚ÄúPlease Service Room‚Äù card on our door knob.  So we then asked for at least clean towels to front desk. No one brought them to the room and so we had to ask again at the front desk when we left for dinner and someone brought them up.

The second day; we hung the ‚ÄúPlease Service Room‚Äù card and reminded front desk when we left to service the room, it had been 2 days already. When returned at 5pm the room was clean. 

On our 3rd day, we hung the ‚ÄúPlease Service Room‚Äù card and left at 8:30am for the day. We arrived back at 5:15pm and ‚Ä¶ no surprise here‚Ä¶ the room had not been serviced. I checked the door and card was still there. I called front desk and was told that it should have been done and that they would call housekeeping. And I was also informed that ‚Äúhousekeeping start cleaning the rooms after 3pm‚Äù and maybe they haven‚Äôt got to me yet. Seriously!?!?

Anyway - I asked front desk for clean towels and housekeeping staff showed up at 5:30pm or so and asked if I wanted my room serviced. I was exhausted by all the shenanigans by now and said it‚Äôs basically too late and please just give me some towels.

It isn‚Äôt the end of the world; but just some hotel basics would be appreciated. We are going to get through the next 3 days here and will never again stay at Park Grand property.",2,2023,07,02

104,Disappointing stay,"Have never written a review, but had to chime in on this hotel because my experience was so different from the reviews posted when I made my booking a few months ago. The hotel should not be classed 4 stars. It felt more like a hostel to me than a hotel, which is fine, but not what I was expecting or what I paid for. The room itself had a few security concerns (for me, at least): I was in a lower-level room and had windows that I could not lock on my own, and the door lacked any kind of security chain or bolt that could be locked from the inside. The room was clean, although the bed linens were not placed on the bed well, such that I found myself accidentally touching the mattress at points. ",3,2023,06,27
104,Lovely experience,I had a great stay at the hotel. We were in the city for our honeymoon and Vanessa the young woman at reception really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and well looked after.

Good job Marcel",5,2023,06,22
104,Poor value,"Terrible hotel for the price.  Room was small, single bed was uncomfortable with a thin worn out sheet directly on the mattress.

104,great stay at the Park Gran Hotel.,"great stay at the Park Gran Hotel. After being transferred from another hotel, possibly even more expensive, for some strange maintenance reason, I found it very nice (although quite small) and welcoming. However, if it wasn't for the lady. Sykaj, the young lady at the reception, I was never going to enjoy my stay like I did. She was very kind to me and she helped me find a solution for my relocation. I arrived from France with my friend to enjoy a two day mini break and not have it ruined! Thank you very much Mam.",5,2023,06,21
104,Nice Quiet and Convenient Stay w/ Friendly Staff,"What a great last minute find for our family.  We were in London fixing a passport issue at the US Embassy and needed a place for one more night before we headed to Heathrow to continue our vacation.  We are a family of four with two teenagers and the room fit the four of us comfortably.  Room had comfortable beds, quiet and had A/C.  The staff was great, Marcel was super helpful.

104,Property has deteriorated a lot,"I have stayed at this property several times over the years and have rated it highly.  However, this was the first trip this year.  Things certainly seem to have changed.  The service and quality of the amenities have deteriorated significantly.   The sofa of the room I stayed in was broken.  They had put the cushion of some other sofa on the sofa in this room. Despite pointing it out to the staff, they were unable to sort it out.  

The staff seemed to be over worked.  The front desk staff would try and not meet your eye, just in case you may ask them for something.

The mattresses on the beds seem to have deteriorated and were sagging.

Overall, the property seemed in a run down condition.",3,2023,06,20

104,Amazing stay and I have received best customer service ever,I booked one room for two nights. It is one of the best stay I had in London. Paddingtonstation is just 2mins far from the hotel.

I‚Äôm going to comeback.,5,2023,06,15
104,This is a 1 Star hotel,"Our stay of one night on June 9th was utterly unacceptable. While many of the things that were wrong - the fallen mirror over the desk, and the state of the couch cushions, among many others - were cosmetic, the condition of the mattress that my son had to sleep on was not cosmetic. It was unhealthy. There were metal springs poking through the cover of the mattress. He received scratches from them. 
When I explained this to Jeana Rodriguez, the manager on duty at the time of our checkout, she said that no one had ever noticed the condition of the mattress before. I find that extremely hard to believe. Once the sheets are stripped from the mattress, one can clearly see the holes and the metal springs issuing from them. I can only conclude one of two things, either the condition was known to management and ignored, or housekeeping chose not to tell management. Both options are certainly not worthy of a 4 Star hotel. 
She also said that we should have notified the front desk and that they would have moved us. By the time my son realized that the mattress was scratching him, it was 1:30 or 2:00 in the morning. He is 13 years old and did not want to wake his parents. He told us at about 4 in the morning. 
Ms. Rodriguez said that I should email them and include pictures and that they would take some remunerative steps. However, I have emailed them repeatedly and I have gotten to reply.
I have included pictures of the terrible state of the room in addition to pictures of the scratches that my son incurred from sleeping on the mattress.

104,The 2 star motel room,"I paid 630 pound for 3 nights. The hotel is overpriced. It is not 4 star hotel. It‚Äôs a 2 star motel level. There isn‚Äôt bath towels, they only have 1 meter long tower. There isn‚Äôt hook to hang tower. The closet is very dusty and the wood frames are worn out. The 30 pound English breakfast only has very limited cheap food from supermarkets. I asked for tea, I got a tea pot having cheap tea bags in. The waitress has nothing to do but playing their phone.  I have last minute plan to go London and I picked it because it is 4 star hotel with good location. It is a liar except the location. I have been 4 and 5 star hotels. It is NOT close to 4 star. I would not pick it if it isn‚Äôt stated as 4 star hotel.",1,2023,06,11

104,Four Bubbles but Do Not Really Recommend,"Let me say this up front: we had two rooms at the Park Grand London Hyde Park and one of the rooms was definitely three bubbles and the other was five bubbles; averaged out, I am giving it four bubbles.

I would also like to note that, generally speaking, I have a fairly low bar for accommodations; I am very easy to make happy. Further, when staying at independently owned hotels in Europe in old buildings, I understand that there are going to be creaks in the buildings; that they may be lacking in some creature comforts, such as elevators or great AC; and that their rooms may be small and bathrooms not updated. In large part, that is part of the charm and experience of staying at these places. I say all of this to make clear that my complaints about the Park Grand London Hyde Park are not the complaints of a persnickety traveler that is difficult to please and does not understand the nature of accommodations in Europe.

I chose the Park Grand London Hyde Park for three reasons: its ability to accommodate a party of five people in two rooms at a not-exorbitant rate (I was not looking to pay full prices for London in season) in a relatively central location.

One of the rooms we had was clearly updated, with new carpet, furnishings, and bathrooms. This room was very nice. It was room 806.

However, the other room, room 801, was not updated. The carpet was old and shabby; there were areas in which the carpet was wearing away or was lifting at the seam. The d√©cor was dated. The room was a quadruple room and it felt a bit cramped. There were also no luggage racks (the first room mentioned, 806, had two luggage racks) and only one small trash can (room 806 had two trash cans). We asked for an extra trash can and a couple of luggage racks; we got the extra trash can but never received even one luggage rack.

Room 801 had some other odd features. On one of the walls, there was a giant, plate-glass window between the room and the bathroom (it looked right into the shower); they had a thick paper shade over the window but it was still very strange. The other odd feature was a locked, double-door closet; I believe that this may have been a storage closet. I have never stayed in a room that had storage for the hotel in the room.

Room 801 was also located just off the front desk area. While we did not hear a lot of noise considering its location, we did have a couple of occasions in which it seemed like people were trying to get into our room (and one time it sounded like they were successful and immediately closed the door upon the realization that someone else was in there).

The room keys for room 801 also kept not working; we stayed there for 5 days and each of those days, we had to get new room key cards from the front desk. The reception staff kept blaming us putting the keycard next to our cell phones but, after this happened the first time, I made a point of not storing the card anywhere near my phone and it continued to happen. This did not happen with the key cards of room 806. Fortunately, they have 24-hour staffing at reception so we were able to get new keys no matter the time.

The saving grace of room 801 was its beds: they were very comfortable and we slept like rocks in them. Truly, the bed quality and the ability to sleep well is arguably one of the most important parts of a hotel, which is what boosted the score of the Park Grand London Hyde Park.

The breakfast was fine. They had hot and cold options but nothing of great quality. Compared to other breakfasts I have had in Europe, this was probably at the bottom of the list. A couple of my friends raved about the breakfast so your mileage may vary.

The location was also OK. It was on a quiet residential street; it was not a tourist area at all. It was about a 10-minute walk to Hyde Park and there were plenty of restaurants and pubs within a short walking distance. However, to get to most attractions for sightseeing, you are going to have to take the Underground, a bus, or a taxi. The hotel is very close to the Paddington Underground station and we were able to take the Circle or District line to most things that we wanted to see, though some of the sights were several stops away.

While ultimately giving the Park Grand London Hyde Park four bubbles, I would probably only recommend it to budget-minded travelers who are OK with what I describe. I will likely not stay here again (the only way I would stay here is if there is a big renovation and updating to all rooms or if I had no other option in London).",4,2023,06,10

104,Disapointing,"This property is disgusting.  Our room was tired and worn.  Shower full of grime and mildew.  When I inquired at the desk about housekeeping I was told that cleaning ""happens every other day!"" We were there for 5 days and the room was NEVER cleaned.  Never got clean towels.  I had to get new ones myself from the supply closet. Nothing ""Grand"" about this place.  There are plenty of hotels in London.  Don't give this property your money. ",1,2023,06,10
104,Amara and Rani,"The service at reception with Amara and Rania could not be better. They were very open to help on any request. I booked a Single room and requested if could be Upgraded to a bigger Room which was accepted without any problem. Room was all what i needed. Clean, spacious and nice overview of London.
Amara also was so nice to offer me a Coffee when she saw me attending some phone calls at the Breakfast room.

104,Good service and Quick check in,"I arrived at my hotel in the afternoon. Ms. Rania Gourari quickly checked me in. Check in was very quick. They even offered a complimentary orange upon May arrival. I asked Rania, if I could have the same as the last, and she made some changes and was kind enough to offer the same that I wanted. I was very happy. I really recommend this hotel. The staff is very nice. ",5,2023,06,06
104,Service above all,"As a business traveler, have stayed in a few Park Grand hotels as well as other chains in London and this is by far one of the best in terms of service. 

Rooms were standard London size (small) and a little dated and while they don‚Äôt have a restaurant aside from breakfast which makes it tricky for some, it‚Äôs really close to restaurants and cafes just 2 mins walk away. And just a few steps from Paddington station which is great for links and to Heathrow airport. 

Marcel and Rania were superb in assisting to make my stay comfortable. Had issues with my sink and it was sorted straightaway. Always happy to help which made my 8 nights stay much more comfortable. So if you value service more than anything else, highly recommend. 

Sound travels quite abit from other rooms but it was wasn‚Äôt too big a deal between 11pm and 6am. Bed was comfy. Some pillow covers had pilling while others didn‚Äôt so wasn‚Äôt standard. 

Only critique is it is a little dated for decor and furniture (only by a little really) 

Get a high floor room if you can because the sunset on good days is worth it! 
Will definitely stay again! ",5,2023,06,06

The location is quite strategic in Paddington.
The strong point is definitely the front office, especially Ms. Stella.  She was super friendly in responding to our needs, and super quick. In no time she made our stay even better. Sometimes having such a receptionist makes you love where you are even more.
I would recommend it!",5,2023,06,04
104,Helpful staff ,Specifically writing this review to mention that we checked in today and everyone here has been very friendly and extremely helpful. We needed to locate a pool for my son to practice in while on vacation and Vanessa went above and beyond while also managing several other customers to help us locate a facility for him to train. Greatly appreciate staff like Vanessa. ,5,2023,06,03
104,Business trip London,I had a fabulous stay at park grand. Very friendly staff especially Gourari R at reception. Delicious full English breakfast. Very good locations. I will definitely come back here and I recommend this hotel for the good service.,5,2023,06,03
104,Nice experience with Marcel ,I caming from Brasil for 3 days and everything was fine room are clean and tide Marcel the porter helps with my bags and give me coffee staff are professional and the place is very close to the padington station,5,2023,06,03
104,Worst experience,"Some of the furniture is damaged, the sofa in the club room is damaged and covered with a throw, the sheets has hair on it, towels and linen are kept in a room on the floor, i arrived and the toilet was dirty, the fridge was very dirty, the used soap was on the bathroom floor evidently the bathroom was not cleaned! I booked through booking and they referred me to one of the staff to solve the problem, they offered another room but I explained that this will not be accepted by me since the problem is more than just a room, she understood and talked to her manager and told me that they are going to refund me as we didn‚Äôt reach an agreement that can solve the problem, and now the hotel is refusing to refund and the manager that responded through the phone was not responding very politely, she blamed me for not accepting the other room even after the agreement we reached with the hotel, and said that the girl from the staff is not the manager!! Even though the girl told us that she needed to talk to the manager before agreeing to the refund and confirmed to us that they fully understood the situation.
Bad bad experience.

104,Great experience and staff was supportive. Thanks to MARCEL,"The hotel is great with all the facilities. Specially the staff is very supportive, helpful and kind. 
MARCEL from the staff is great man, so helpful and kind. He helped me a lot as I was here for the first time. Other staff member in hotel are supportive from kitchen. I am an Indian, they offer Aalloo paratha without saying üòÉ. It was surprise. Lovely üòä ",5,2023,06,02

104,100%,Very nice and safe location. Lots of trees around. A a metro station near the hotel. The staff was friendly and I was offered juice and coffee in the reception. Clean and pleasant rooms. The interior was very well decorated. Overall I had a pleasant experience.,5,2023,05,31
104,Great Option for Couples or Singles traveling in London,"Hotel was very centrally located for excursions from Paddington Rail Station. Rooms were very comfortable. Staff was welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was very enjoyable.  The building is older and could use a little TLC, but overall was very pleased with our stay here. Would stay here again.",4,2023,05,29
104,Human resources make all the difference,"Very central hotel, wich benefits above all from the friendliness of its employees. I emphasize here MARCEL , always kind and extremely profissional and available. Human resources really make all the difference.

2 minutes walking distance from Paddington tube station.
Perfect assistance by all the hotel staff.
A special thank to Stella, Who assisted us during all the stay with kindness and professionality.
Very recommended.",5,2023,05,29
104,A real gem of a hotel,"This hotel was chosen by us for its excellent location in London.  5 minute walk to underground Paddington station with access to all the places we wanted to see.  
I have stayed in less expensive hotels in London but the time to travel to the sites was at least an hour.  
This hotel is clean, has good air conditioning, always hot water in the showers.  The staff is a real plus; most accommodating.  Our first day after being up all night on the plane, I was extremely tired and was waiting to be able to Checkin and Tamara made my son and I coffee.  We were able to rest in the bar area with a proper coffee, served in a small coffee pot, pastries and even flowers on our tray.  It rejuvenated me and Tamara was so very friendly and helpful.  The young man who helped us with our bags Marcel was also very helpful.  Everyone on this staff is friendly and helpful no matter what shift is working.
The rooms are typical size for Europe.  It always bothers me when I hear people complain of room size . I want to tell them to book into the Ritz or Savoy if they want a big room.  These rooms are fine.  The area is in a quiet neighborhood, only .3?mile walk from Hyde park, which is worth 30 minute stroll.
The last huge plus is the amount of electrical outlets.  This is becoming an issue with the amount of devices we all have that need to be charged.  This was really nice.  I had adapters for England and all devices were able to be charged simultaneously.  
I think this hotel is worth every dollar spent on a stay  here.  We even had a taxi driver tell us it was a hidden gem.
One last thing I would suggest is to purchase an adapter that has several slots for multiple devices. I bought mine on Amazon well worth it. 
A great visit to London..",5,2023,05,28

104,Expensive and TINY,"Unfortunately I regret booking this hotel. This was our first visit to London. The hotel is close to Paddington Station which is great. The staff and breakfast was great. We had booked a Deluxe Double and paid $250/night. The hallways, our room, and bathroom were tiny--like cruiseship-tiny. There was very little room for the 2 of us to move around. The bed was small and uncomfortable. The temperature was hard to regulate. I wish now I had confirmed that this was actually the room we paid for. I wouldn't stay there again. ",2,2023,05,22
104,Good service,I can from Ukraine for 3 nights to Hyde park and I was very lucky because I don t have to wait to much for check in hotel is very nice Marcell serv me with coffee and with biscuits Paddington station is very close,5,2023,05,22
104,Visita,Excellent stay. Room was clean and quite big. Cosy and comfortable. Train station close and only 5 minyted by. Victoria coach station and hyde park. Service received from sykaj was good. I really suggest it. Nuce service ever. I would like to come with my friends this summer,5,2023,05,21
104,Don‚Äôt stay at Park Grand Hyde park,Cancelled hours before we were scheduled. Booked this hotel 4 months ago. After traveling hours from the US we arrived at the hotel and were told we were switched to another local hotel due to some maintenance issues. Curious that someone else was able to check in to a room. .?  The young lady at the reception desk said I should have gotten an email. (I got it when I arrived) not even 24 hours notice. Exhausted we had to get in a cab to move to sister property which was supposed to be a 5 star hotel. It is far from a 5 star hotel and has horrible feedback. The room at the inhibit (sister hotel ) is tiny with below ground room. I tried to contact the Park grand several times to ask them if we could get early check in as I was taking red eye and would be arriving tired. They never responded to my email and met me with being transferred to a a tiny basement hotel accommodation. To not give me advance notification is unacceptable. I‚Äôm stuck here for 4 days as there‚Äôs no way I can get my money back or reasonable accommodation at the last minute. I‚Äôm not wasting my short vacation time trying to find another room. The promised breakfast at this hotel is also not equivalent to what I was promised at the Park Grand. My only recourse is to warn others to steer clear of the park grand. There are many options.,1,2023,05,20
104,Great location kind staff,"Great hotel location, near the paddington subway station and the train station. Lots of great restaurants nearby. Marcel was very kind and eager to help us with any issues we encountered during our stay. recommend to others staying in London ",5,2023,05,18

104,Ants all over walls and bed. ,"Room infested with ants.  Told staff and just a quick apology no refund or explanation. 

Extremely small room not enough space at all for  more than one person. 
Basement room next to restaurant very noisy from 6am with smells of breakfast coming into room.
.Avoid this room at all cost.  Room was not clean for 3 days had to ask at reception for clean towels and toilet paper.  Everytime we left the room the key would not work on return so had ro go to reception for new key.",1,2023,05,17
104,Nice place,"The hotel staff's attentiveness and willingness to go the extra mile truly made a difference.

104,Rooms not up to standard but nice part of Hyde Park.,"The location was a little far to walk but on a sunny day not an issue to walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Harrods was just across from Hyde Park, and Hyde Park itself was very close. The Paddington Station is 5 mins away so that is good.

When we arrived we asked them to make the sofa bed, and also when we left for the day and it wasn‚Äôt made. The same the next day we asked twice and still no bed made. They did make it on the 3rd day. Appreciate they were busy but it shouldn‚Äôt be a case where this needs to be asked 5 times.

The rooms were not clean. The carpet was dirty and stained. The sofa bed was ripped in many parts and should be nearly thrown out. The bathrooms were ok. The heating system was strange where it was installed on the loft bedroom. So the bottom floor was freezing and the top room was too hot. Should be the other way round as heat rises. It was impossible to take the suitcases up the narrow staircase so we all had to dress downstairs. The balcony doors do not shut properly so there was always cold air that could be felt downstairs. 

The neighbourhood was safe. A very pretty street in Hyde Park which was what attracted me to it in the first place. There is a nice Italian Place around the corner, and some other cafes about 10 min walk.

Hyde Park is close by so is great to go running or walking.

Overall OK but wouldn‚Äôt stay again. ",2,2023,05,08
104,A terrible room Avoid,"Check in from 2pm room not ready at 4pm receptionist in experienced and extremely slow.
Deluxe family 4 star room booked
Got two single beds & sofa bed not even made up .we had our teenage  grandaughter with us room was tiny scruffy shabby old decor.fridge dirty.complained was offered up grade to two double beds .which was better. 
Not impressed more like two star standrad room not worth also ¬£300 a night.
Curtains hanging off rail odd curtains to valance.pillows hard old flat.towels worn thin old fridge dirty view was terrible all pipes & roof.windows wouldn't open window ledges rotten wood some lights didn't work furniture  scratch marked badly very very old.sheet were clean breakfast was OK.
This definitely ISNT 4 STARS.
Very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend  this avoid at all costs",2,2023,05,07
104,A real gentleman! ,"I am a regular guest in this hotel and I have to say that I am always very impressed with Marcel's service.
He is a very good porter who knows how to make you feel welcome and how to do his job properly, but most of all, he is a very approachable and a genuine nice person who always go the extra mile to deliver the best
He is also very funny and will make you laugh! 
",5,2023,05,07
104,My goods were removed from the room,"I booked a room on 4th May through DAYUSE arrived at the hotel at 10:00 first receptionist name Stella couldn‚Äôt find my booking and when she found it, she asked me to wait as the room wasn‚Äôt ready, room was booked for 09:30 to 16:30. Stella replied by saying that it should be ready by 10:30 as they had no reservation came through from DAYUSE.

I went to the room but the room key wasn‚Äôt working had to call the cleaner to let me in, me and my partner stayed in the room for about 1hr and 30mins, we then left for lunch and returned to the hotel around 14:55 upon arrival to the room I noticed my Bag was missing from the room and the cupboard was searched, I initially thought someone has stolen my bag, we immediately made our way to the front desk and we were informed that Stella had printed out the check out list and handed to the cleaner and the cleaner left it with the front desk. 
Stella apologised and took full responsibility of her mistake, I then requested to speak to a Manager or a supervisor on shift but unfortunately non available at the time, while Stella was chasing them up, the cleaner happed to be there, who said it‚Äôs a rubbish, I asked what is rubbish he said this bag, which got me very angry I asked him to clarify why did he call my bag rubbish, when he put my phone charger inside the bag and zipped it and then carried it all the way to the front desk. 

Stella shortly after came out and stated non of her manager available at the moment and took my email, I made it clear to her that I want ¬£85 back and I am not going to go back into the room because I don‚Äôt feel safe to stay there.
 Ever since I left the hotel with my partner I have been waiting for the email to come from Hotel manager name Jenna but I haven‚Äôt heard anything yet, this is extreme unprofessionalism and also putting customers goods at risk. 

I would want you to investigate this internally from your end and I would like my money back or else I will be writing a review everywhere and will take this further, as this is not acceptable that first someone goes into an occupied room and then look through my bag and then later calls my bag a rubbish bag on my face, and also we were checked in later than the time agreed on DAYUSE. 

Stella also informed us that they are short of staff, therefore she had to send in inexperienced cleaner into the room for final checks.

It has been 4 days, I haven‚Äôt heard anything from clueless and unprofessional people from the hotel.",1,2023,05,07
104,Not as photos at all!,"Small, unconfortable, not as their photos are seen on Triadvisor. The place is old and awful, very narrow aisles to get with the luggage. The inly good thing is that for one night, they are very close to the Paddington station and close to Heathrow airport. But I wouldnt go back ever.",1,2023,05,03
104,Come back Fawlty Towers - all is forgiven,"Where do I possibly start? Could it be the fact that I had no hot water coming out of my taps, despite reporting it four times? Or could it be my being woken up by the Duty Manager in the middle of the night and dragged down into reception (in my nightclothes)?  Here, I was accused of having already checked out of the hotel and would therefore have to leave, otherwise he would call the police. When I showed him my booking confirmation, he reluctantly admitted that it was a ""system error"" and finally let me go back to my room. No apology of course. 
I made a formal complaint to the Manager the following morning who offered me a complimentary breakfast for my troubles - I didn't stay around long enough to take advantage of this, funnily enough.
I stay in London hotels for business purposes 2-3 times a month and have never experienced anything quite like it. I certainly won't be risking  a return visit to this place.",1,2023,05,02
104,"Nice location, room and reception","The location is wonderful. Walking distance from Paddington station , I did not need a taxi to get to hotel. Nice people at reception desk, Larissa spoke portuguese and also there is a italian at the desk. Unfortunatelly 1 day the room was not clened..",4,2023,04,28
104,A good central Hotel,"The hotel was good and very central. 
All the staff were very polite, especially Stella and Jeana. They were always very friendly and had a smile on their face at all times.
We felt very welcome!
We will come back :).",5,2023,04,28
104,Avoid to all costs,"To be avoided at all costs, looks pretty, service is beyond minimal with miscommunications on payments. Staff not trained on how to answer questions.
I got debited twice, which I don‚Äôt mind as long as I‚Äôm notified. The lady at reception told me it‚Äôs due to (credit scores they need to keep tabs on!) which made me question the answer. When I asked why don‚Äôt they informed clients. They said we have too many clients to inform, obviously service is not something they are knowledgeable with. 
The room views are meek, the pillows are hard and it‚Äôs definitely worth a 2 star not 4. Too bad hoxton decided to invest in such a poorly managed hotel.",1,2023,04,27
104,Great experience at the Park Grand Hyde Park.,My son and I loved our stay at this hotel. Stella and Jeana at reception provided an outstanding and friendly service. They kindly gave us an upgrade to our room. The breakfast was of a high standard. The location is ideal. Would stay again and recommend. ,5,2023,04,27
104,Tatty hotel room,I stayed here on business in a single room. Very disappointing stay - the room was very tired looking with worn out fixtures & fittings. The mattress on the bed was so old it was lumpy & extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. I did not get a good nights sleep and it was noisy. Considering i paid ¬£182 for the 1night I expected more as I have stayed at much cheaper hotels with better mattresses.,2,2023,04,26
104,Great hotel and location.,"Nice hotel pretty near to everything and a lovely zone. Herrera was super friendly and kind, thanks for such a nice experience. Amazing breakfast service.
Super recommended place to stay and enjoy the surroundings area.",5,2023,04,26
104,Great location; average hotel,"We previously stayed at the Park Grand Lancaster Gate and had an excellent experience there, so we tried this sister hotel, the Park Grand London Hyde Park on a recent 5-day stay in London. The location is excellent; just two short blocks from Paddington Station (with multiple Tube lines and the Heathrow Express) and slightly more to Hyde Park. Our room was very small, like many London hotel rooms, but had a comfortable bed, good TV selection, and a coffee maker. However, while there was a small closet, there were no drawers or shelves for us to unpack our clothes (very odd!) and the shower was claustrophobic (although the water pressure was excellent). The breakfast buffet was included since we booked through the hotel's website; it was a nice English breakfast buffet (but not really worth the cost they would have charged if it had not been included and the repetitious offerings got boring after a few days).  The staff was fine, although housekeeping inexplicably skipped our room on two days of our five day stay. All in all, we've stayed in much better and much worse places. It's a decent place to stay if you don't spend much time in your room and you want a very convenient location to Paddington and Hyde Park.",3,2023,04,26
104,Hotel √Æs very good located,"Hotel √Æs nice and clean room is nice and big staff are very frendly and smiling Marcelll help me with bags ,everything Was perfect Rania and Xavier at reception Was very profesional restaurante and shops are very nearly",5,2023,04,25
104,Comfortable hotel with good customer service,Comfortable and clean hotel; very convenient to Paddington underground and overground stations. Spacious double room. Special thanks to Syed for his customer service and checking me in at a very late time. ,4,2023,04,24
104,Perfect hotel with favorable price.,Everything is just so nice. The hotel staff and waiters are absolutely kind and nice. And the room is clean. I tried to Book like a continuous 3-Day staying but unfortunately there is only one available for one night. ,5,2023,04,22
104,5 star for the service,"I would like to rate 5 star only for the service received and the location. The 2 receptionist fella and Rania who speaks Spanish as well were very kind, professional and funny. The hotel is close to the train station and only half an hour far from the Heathrow airport. Lovely stay. I would like to come back ",5,2023,04,21
104,Very good hotel value!,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days as part of a London vacation.  It‚Äôs in a relatively quiet section of the city, which is nice, while still being fairly close to Paddington Station, Hyde Park, and the Bizzarro Italian restaurant (terrific!).  Rooms are small but comfortable and our sixth floor room looked out over the rooftops to provide a very nice view.  The buffet breakfast is a great way to start the day.  The only negative was the lack of hot water in the morning - I don‚Äôt think the system could keep up with demand (had to shower in the evening) - and the shower that is slightly awkward to get in/out of.  There is AC but not sure how capable it will be in a warm summer - temps for our visit were cool and we just cracked the window.  Overall it was a very good stay and I would stay again!",4,2023,04,20
104,London Stay,"The hotel receptionists were very helpful.  Our daughter and her family of three stayed in another room 1/2 floor up and they noted that the water pressure for the upper floors need improvement. There was one night/morning where we didn't have cold water.  We called the receptionist and were told to wait 1/2 hour for the water to warm up.  Otherwise, the room we stayed in was fine. 
The hotel was close to the Paddington Station. That made it very convenient for taking public transportation.",5,2023,04,20
104,Quite Good for The Price,"It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs good enough for the price ‚Äî most staffs are helpful, but they did not give you fresh bottled water every day.. (this is trivial but quite important for me).
Location not bad! And breakfast is good also.",4,2023,04,19
104,Great location with family sized rooms,"Stayed here on our short stay in London after flying from Aus.  Chose this hotel after staying there in 2014 on a similar trip.  The location is fantastic.. with the new Elizabeth Line access to Paddington is dead easy and is super connected to London Transport and heathrow via the heathrow express.  The hotel itself is comfortable but after nine years it its looking like a refresh is needed. 
The breakfast was fantastic and the complimentary bottles of water in the room  were a winner.  In our previous stay we had a duplex family room, this time with the kids being a bit older we went for a quad.  
Overall hotel is great for families looking for a short stay and with easy connections. ",4,2023,04,18
104,Stay at Park Grand Hyde park,"The pillows were very fluffy, staff were all very accommodating I got an upgrade on arrival. The staff let me store my stuff for the day while I went out and let me sit in the bar area to charge my phone before I left. Marcel was awesome and super friendly. Loved my stay at Park Grand Hyde park and would definitely come back. ",5,2023,04,18

104,London Sightseeing Tripp,"Clean and quiet hotel in short walking distance to Paddington Station (train from Heathrow). In-suite but tiny bathroom, Breakfast ok, but to be ordered separate. Good beds.
To be highlighted is the warm and wellcoming staff even in extraordinary situations, (especially Larissa in case of losses!) and Tella as well as Xavier for his restrautant tips.

104,Amazing stay.,Jeana was absolutely amazing she is caring and ensured my stay at Park grand London Hyde park was top notch and hitch free. She rendered the best service ever! The hotel is close to Paddington station I had the absolute best stay here. I would say it was top notch. Ask for Jeana and thank me later. xoxoüòÅ,5,2023,04,14
104,Yikes,"As 60 somethings, you hope for ease of getting to your room and checking out, however, being a London hotel in an old building, that was not the case. The room was on the 7th floor but the elevator only goes to the 6th, then down a narrow hall and up an even narrower stairway, through another narrow doorway, hallway and finally to a room with limited storage an floor space and let‚Äôs not forget a few more stairs‚Ä¶The room was a bit worse for wear and the curtains looked like they should have been logged in as crime scene evidence. We asked for another room but was told there were none available. I would not choose this hotel again as the only positive was its proximity to the Piccadilly train station. I will say that the front desk staff was good with information about getting around.",2,2023,04,10
104,Perfect quiet location.,We stayed here for two nights. Arrived to a friendly greeting and checked in and in our room within 15 minutes. Staff members were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was ¬£15 each however if you pre booked it was ¬£12.95. Breakfast was plentiful with good quality food. The rooms have ample plug sockets. Our room on the 5th floor was small and a little tired with a few dents and dings however we‚Äôre not the kind of people to stop having a good stay. The beds were very comfortable. It‚Äôs a 5 minute walk to Paddington station.,4,2023,04,08
104,Beautiful experience ,Amazing stay at Park Grand London Hyde Park! The staff helped us to make our expierence even better! Always with a smile in reception! Thak you for been so kind! Our room was very comfortable.  Excellent British breakfast. Recommended ,5,2023,04,07
104,Absolutely NOTHING is grand about this horrendous hotel,"Do NOT stay here under any circumstances unless you want to be completely ripped off. We had a Deluxe room but their definition of ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô is obviously very different to ours. Tired, worn, musty and tatty hotel that needs complete refit. One lift for entire hotel so make sure you allow 15-20 mins to get up/ downstairs during peak times if you are on higher floors. Bar did not open, no fridge in room as stated when booked, room far too hot, shower room so small, couldn‚Äôt even stand in front of mirror as so narrow. Mattresses were absolutely atrocious. Worst nights sleep ever. Ripped lampshades, cracked mirror, curtains / pelmet hanging off, metal windows old and poor sound insulation. Quite how this hotel has got 4.5 stars on Trip Adviser is beyond me. Please do not wasted your money by staying here",1,2023,04,05

104,Great value hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is very conveniently located close to Paddington station which connects with the tube, the new Elizabeth line, Heathrow Express etc. We also walked everywhere: Notting Hill 20 min, Oxford St 25 min, Soho 60 min, and beautiful Hyde Park is literally at the end of the street. 
Our double room was small and the bathroom very compact, but it was all we needed. The room, facing Westbourne Terrace, was surprisingly quiet even with the window open all night. We did not get daily room cleaning but didn‚Äôt really need it. They came on the third day after we arrived. Breakfast is included. Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. A big shout out to the doorman Marcel, who helped us with our stored luggage and was very friendly. 
For this price, which was very reasonable, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a comparable hotel in London. We‚Äôve been to London almost 20 times and we know the city pretty well. This is our first time staying here but we‚Äôll be back. ",5,2023,04,01

104,Give this place a miss‚Ä¶..,"Never again!  Stayed 3 nights. Staff were great. Room was dirty, furnishings were old and worn out. My room did not get cleaned and I had to call for a cleaner to come even though they knocked at the door to clean and I told them I was leaving in a few minutes. They advertise ‚Äúlift‚Äù but my room was in a part of the hotel with only winding stairs. The breakfast room was pleasant and food was good. Staff at breakfast were exceptional. The room was small and very dingy. Because the room did not get cleaned toiletries were never replenished. When the room finally got cleaned on the 3rd day the teacup was never washed and no fresh toiletries. ( I had to call reception to get a 
cleaner to come). This is not a 4 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination. Closet was sbout 14 inches wide, not even a small dresser drawer to put clothing in, only what looked to be a very old worn desk with a center drawer and the smallest night stand I‚Äôve ever seen. No rack to 
put your suitcase on. Stains on the walls and curtains. Trash out in front of hotel overflowing. ",1,2023,03,28
104,Ok for one night,"Despite asking for a twin room when I booked then again when I confirmed and again on the day and I still ended up with a king bed for myself and my friend.  We got there very late and the man on the desk was lovely and found us another room but we didn't need that at 11pm.  Also the first room we was given had dirty spoons on the tray.

The second room we were given was very nice but had a threadbare pillow case on one of the pillows.  Not a 4*",3,2023,03,26

Staff were friendly and so helpful.  With special thanks to Xavier for the unprompted upgrade and Sacha & Jeana for the smiles.,5,2023,01,25
104,Overall Poor Experience,"Expected more for the price and based off the previous reviews. I arrived and they put me in a room the size of a closet in the basement level of the building. The hallways were extremely narrow and confusing to navigate, not knowing whether I was opening the door to the fire exit or a supply closet. Upon speaking with staff they moved me to a slightly larger room, albeit still in the basement level. Room was still small but had slightly more standing room. Around 10pm the same night while I was in the shower a random woman was let into my room and then abruptly ran out. A staff member then knocked on my door and asked me my name and when I had checked in, almost accusing me of being in the wrong room. I explained that my room had been changed and there was likely some sort of mix up in their system. They then called me from the front desk and confirmed they made a mistake but did not apologize for the confusion or for letting a stranger into my room. Overall not a great experience - location is ideal, very close to subway line, but definitely not a 4 star hotel in my books.",2,2023,01,24

If you don‚Äôt want to walk, Paddington station is a 1 minute walk away. Using the Elizabeth line, I was able to connect hassle free from Heathrow after 24 hours of flying straight to the hotel. Paddington is also a main station and had a connection to everywhere I needed. Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2023,01,17

Ridiculously small bathroom with a shower cubicle that required the door opening if the soap was dropped! 
Room changed for the remaining four nights. A slight improvement.
Front staff were very friendly and helpful.
Narrow stairs to the tiny restaurant in the basement.
Very poor selection for breakfast. 
Will I stay here again - no - have advised my company of this decision.",3,2022,11,27

104,Nice Hotel - Good Location - Friendly Service,"We stayed there for 6 nights. The front desk staffs are helpful as well as offer friendly service! As the mobility concerns, they immediately switch a larger room in one level instead two levels according to our reservation!~
The hotel location is convient, just few minutes walk from Paddington station. However, you may need to compromise a little bit of noise. The acoustic can be improved.  
Great thanks to Rania, Stella, Jeana and Priscilla!~",5,2022,11,26

104,Nice area ,"This hotel was well priced for the area. We found that our air conditioning unit was a little loud, but otherwise no complaints. The front desk was able to hold our baggage for the day and not only did we receive great service from Alice but witnessed her helping many others in line ahead of us.",5,2022,11,25
104,"Hotel could do with some serious updates, but staff are really wonderful","Marcel in particular was very helpful and very attentive. Thanks for looking after our bags with so much care and helping us with the luggage.

The hotel itself could really improve the features, for instance the towels are quite horrible and old, a good hotel experience often lies in some of the smallest of details. Wi-Fi could be better.

 But the staff really save the hotel and host people with their utmost effort.",5,2022,11,25

104,Well situated and staffed ,Well situated hotel; despite being in a busy part of London the hotel itself in an overall quiet area. Well staffed; Rania and Stella were particularly helpful in assisting with all my needs and with plentiful tips for the surrounds.

Great stay, room was good and comfy!

The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help me throughout the stay!
Alice was brilliant! Accommodated me in everything I needed! 

Will Definitely be coming back when in the city again!!!!!!",5,2022,11,18
104,Great staff but otherwise unremarkable,"The staff (Stella and Rania) at checkin were great! 
Otherwise the hotel was fairly average - a bit run down in places and parts of the room weren‚Äôt very clean.
However, not bad value for money overall.",3,2022,11,18
104,AVOID this hotel as much as possible if you don‚Äôt want your vacation ruined!!,"I would give it 0 star if there's such an option. We PRE-PAID for a 2-night stay in the Deluxe Double room WITH CITY VIEW but was assigned to an underground room (where we had to go through 3 fireplace doors to find it). The reason they gave us is that we arrived late and there was no city view room available. ONLY AFTER we showed the frontdesk our reservation confirmation where city view is explicitly listed did the frontdesk say he can offer us the correct room type the next day, as if their system doesn't have room type information on our booking. If we had forgotten we booked a room with view, I bet they would just let us stay in this unclean (see the pictures) underground room with smell for 2 nights.

We were so upset and frustrated so we called Chase Ultimate Rewards where we booked this reservation from. It turned out to be an even more stupid idea. The Chase agent talked to the vendor but the hotel does not agree to offer any compensation. We were told that ""The hotel was willing to accommodate you even you showed up late and they are willing to move you to the right room the next day"". It almost sounded like the hotel has done us a favor. Excuse me??? We pre-paid and never intended to cancel. Why was the room not available? They never contacted us before they gave our room to others. ""It‚Äôs not the hotel‚Äôs responsibility to contact guests before they mark guests as no show. It is the customer‚Äôs responsibility to contact the hotel to keep the room in case of late arrival"". They (the hotel and Chase) were trying to make us think it‚Äôs our fault! We had never contacted any hotels before for late arrival and there was never an issue like this. Late arrival is very common especially for international trips. Are guests supposed to call the hotel on the flight/train where there‚Äôs weak/no signal? 

What made us even more upset is that, after we hung up the call, we couldn‚Äôt find any ‚Äúlate-show or no-show policy‚Äù: not in the confirmation email Chase sent us, not on the hotel‚Äôs official website. We even tried the booking process again, but there‚Äôs no place proving such information!!! We printed the email and websites to pdf files as a proof just in case they add the policy later. We spent almost an hour fighting for our rights and got nothing but anger and frustration. 

I would never choose this hotel. AVOID this hotel as much as possible if you don‚Äôt want your vacation ruined!!",1,2022,11,17
104,Short getaway,"Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a couple nights stay in this hotel. We both said when we got up to leave this morning that it was the best hotel we have stayed in so far.

The staff were some of the friendliest people I have ever met and they all always had a smile on their face no matter what time of day it was.
We are both in our early twenties so when staying somewhere we don‚Äôt know we feel a little nervous, but we felt very safe in this hotel. 
The room was on the smaller side but fine for just the two of us as we were out all day everyday and was just what we wanted. 
The hotel was in the perfect location and enabled us to walk to most places we wanted to visit to save some money. 

The only downside was the bed wasn‚Äôt very wide so was a little uncomfortable, but this wouldn‚Äôt stop us from staying here again!

Thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay here very enjoyable, this is a lovely hotel and you should be proud of what you have created. üòäüòä",5,2022,11,17

They are both doing an amazing job.  They really helped me settle in for my stay. This was really amazing for me as I missed my flight. ",5,2022,11,02
104,Very overpriced for what we had,"When we arrived we asked what time the bar was open only to be told between 9pm -11 pm which is not stated when booking. The twin room was very small and had stairs in it as soon as you walked in so no good for someone with mobility issues. Stained bedding . The towels were the size of a postage stamp( see photo) so bring your own. Very tired and dark looking and looks like it was some sort of corridor in it‚Äôs day. The staff that were on in the afternoon really didn‚Äôt appear to know what they were doing.
The breakfast was spot on and the staff and dining area was very clean, this was the best part of the stay.
We paid ¬£170
Excluding breakfast which was very overpriced for what we had. Won‚Äôt be returning .",2,2022,11,02
104,Priscila,My family and I stayed at this hotel and we were very impressed. The location is great which is close to tube stations and lots of shops and restaurants.

104,3 Nights Stay in London,"The hotel is within walking distance from London underground (Elizabeth Line). There are multiple places to eat nearby the hotel. 

In terms of ironing facilities, I had to personally request at the reception as two calls from the phone in my room failed to work (i.e. no staff at the reception picked up my calls despite multiple rings). Further, the moment the iron was turned on, water was leaking from the  bottom of the unit. Changes to the temperature did not work. Eventually, I was unable to complete my ironing successfully. 

Air conditioner is available in the room. However, it appears to require service as it was making a lot of noise throughout the night. 

The private bathroom facility was well functioning (i.e no issues with shower and functioning of toilet flush). Staff who cleaned my room on 27 October 2022 did a great job. 

With regards to service excellence, there appears to be lack of orientation towards guest satisfaction. The staff response when answering to phone call(s) or servicing check-in/check out clients appear to indicate employee(s) on duty being a little tired and lack of motivation to perform their assigned task(s). Nonetheless, there was a new employee (Stella) who deserves a praise. She was helpful when being approached with questions. 

Overall, the hotel should pay more attention in training for its staff, well-being of its staff as well as ensuring existing assets in the hotel are maintained and checked on a regular basis to ensure it is well functioning. ",3,2022,10,31
104,Beware!!!,"I don't know where the other guests writing good reviews stayed at but I cannot believe we are rating the same hotel. My room was just horrible! The first thing I've noticed was the musty smell. The room was at the basement - NEVER ever accept a room on the ""floor"" starting with a ""0""!!! The window cannot be opened and it feels like in prison (see picture). The room was not clean at all, the sink in the bathroom not accecible when the door was open (and for a person bigger than me, not accecible at all). The walls are paper thin, I could here every single word of the guests next to me. The only good thing was the location and the water pressure in the shower.",2,2022,10,30
104,Just don‚Äôt stay here,"Stayed one night for business . Paid ¬£168 for a single room that was absolutely tiny ! It was just awful . The bathroom was smelly and stunk of backed up drains . The shower was so tiny , anyone on the larger size would not be able to fit in it . The walls were so thin , I could hear neighbouring room talking clearly .Lights not working . Aircon didn‚Äôt work .I left my dressing gown in the room . I e mailed the next day - no reply . So I rang the hotel - just not interested . E mailed again no response . Housekeeping must have found it but by now it‚Äôs long gone . I would never stay here again . It was cramped and just awful . Never again !! I could and would stay at a premier inn or Hilton for that price and have a double bed , decent room with some customer service , none of which this hotel provides for ¬£168 !!!",1,2022,10,30

104,Good overall well presented hotel and very friendly staff with a great barman,"I write this review especially for the super barman called Marcello.  On one of my evenings I came back to the hotel to an empty bar and decided to have a drink.  This young man was a super host and very intertaining.  An absolute asset to the hotel.  Very polite and smart.  He stayed open until very late before I retired.  
The hotel in general has a super location 10 minutes walk from the main tube and railway station.  The rooms are well maintained even though I would say the delux room I had was very small but well decorated.  The breakfast for a charge was well worth the money and certainly gives a good start to the day.  The staff were all very friendly and well presented giving the hotel an upper class feel.

Overall certainly worth a visit and with the location to the shops and restaurants and the station you will not bedissapointed here at Paddington.  Not forgetting Hyde park also within walking distance.",4,2022,10,27

104,Perfect Stay in Park Grand Hotel,"We arrived the hotel late night and was informed that there was a leaking issue in our family room, but they have immediately sorted it out and replaced as with one double room and one twin room, and as a compensation they offered us free complementary breakfast buffet. The staffs icluding Jeana, rania, sardor, felisom and faheem are all friendly and very responsive. We have a good stay.",5,2022,09,23
104,5 stars-very good hotel,"I liked it very much. the hotel is 4 minutes far from the station. Nice rooms, good breakfast and good staff. How not to mention stella, always smiling and available to all our needs (there were 7 of us).
the hotel also has taxis available which can be called for any need at your own expense of course.
I will definitely be back",5,2022,09,22
104,Not a 4 star hotel,"Arrived at this hotel for 2 night stay on 20/9/22. Initially on walking into the hotel the staff were friendly and warm and we were greeted to an offer of help with bags. Location was really good and from the outside the hotel looks nice. Another positive is despite not much options the breakfast was actually tasty and good quality, the rooms also had good quality TV facilities. However, onto the negatives when walking into the bedroom it immediately smelt of foist and had a thin entrance. We had an upstairs part of the room to the left which initially felt like a nice bit of extra room however the stairs were creaky and felt as though they were caving in to walk on. Unfortunately, the whole room had outdated decor throughout, marked walls and just didn‚Äôt feel properly cleaned. Upsetting to also not have access to robes or slippers when paying for what‚Äôs supposed to be a 4* hotel. The bathroom was also even small for me as a 4ft 11inch person and only 1 small towel each available. Also, the hotel states parking available on their site with no cost documented for this but when you arrive it‚Äôs ¬£25 per night which should have been prior advertised on booking as not nice to have unexpected costs on arrival. Overall, I think this hotel could do with a lot of redecorating and updating and definitely needs to lighten the rooms to make smaller space feel bigger and a good clean throughout and it could have the potential to be good but unfortunately doesn‚Äôt feel 4* to me as stayed in 3* that are better and cleaner and have more to offer for this price.",3,2022,09,22
104,Very helpful staff. Rania üëçüèª,"Great location, very clean hotel. Breakfast was delicious. Deluxe room on floor 3 was really comfortable and quiet, great night's sleep. The hotel area was renice and relaxing service was brilliant throughout.",5,2022,09,21
104,Excellent hotel with even better staff service by Christina Anthony,"First of all the location of the hotel was amazing, the rooms were very comfortable, neat and clean. The size of the room was very adequate, i stayed  there for a week and fir sure I will rebook if I am visiting London again. 

The staff of the hotel were amazing, the breakfast was very good. A lady named  Christina Anthony regularly served me and I rate her service as excellent, always with smile and going above and beyond for the guest. 

I loved my stay at Park Grand Hyde Park, the location, hotel room and service is all top notch and value for
Money.",5,2022,09,19
104,Absolutely terrible do not stay here,This hotel is honestly the worst I have ever stayed in. I had a room on ground floor and I could hear noise from rooms beside and from outside clearly. Never slept at all for 2 nights. On our second night an alarm started going off that went in for half an hour or more. The room is dark with no natural light and was very cold. The room smelt of smoke and was not clean. The staff were rude and very unhelpful. I asked them to call me a taxi and was told to walk outside and get one myself. Definitely will never be back here.,1,2022,09,18
104,Stella/Sacha,Amazing stay with very accommodating staff. The room was more than that we expected. A very nice ambience around the hotel. The staff were very helpful in terms of carrying our luggages. Overall it was a wonderful stay.,5,2022,09,18
104,courtesy and availability,"Irina and Stella were kind, available to our every request and fully satisfied them. They speak many languages ‚Äã‚Äãand put guests at ease. e

104,Wonderful services!,I stayed at the place for 2 nights in the middle of this September.Had nothing to complain about the stay. Especially the services from the staff were awesome . They were Friendly and well-trained. Special shout out to Stella.,4,2022,09,15
104,Nice but overpriced,"Stayed there late August. Rooms are tiny, as you would expect of central London, but they are so expensive. My stay was around 140 GBP per night. To get the idea - you cannot even do simple yoga in your room. My window was opening into some inner yard and looking directly into other windows. Breakfasts are really tasty. Staff is friendly. But I'm not sure if I'd want to stay there again? Tiny and also noisy - had to use eat plugs every night.",4,2022,09,14
104,Excellent services!,Hotel room was a bit small for us but the receptionist named Xavier helped us a lot with our stay and luggages. He was very informative and friendly. He also told us the shorter way to Paddington station from the hotel which made our journey a lot better. I‚Äôd say the stay was great because of him!,5,2022,09,14
104,Comfortable sleeping and yummy breakfast with wonderful reception staff,"Great service, comfy beds and delicious breakfast. Staff are so helpful and have gone above and beyond for my family the entire stay. Location is great for access to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Rooms are small but cosy and serviced daily.

104,Very nice stay!,"The title says it all! Hotel was very well placed with Paddington station just five minutes away. Staff were attentive too, especially Tamara who allowed me to store my luggage for the day at the hotel and the guy that works in the evenings who helped me carry the luggage to the car. Will definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2022,09,12

104,Nice hotel near Paddington,"Tamara and Gabriela were very helpful at check in. The room was clean and very well sized. The hotel is located in a neighborhood block,  but the location is such that it is a short walk to Paddington Hyde Park, and restaurants. I look forward to staying here again.",5,2022,09,12
104,Another great stay,"A great stay. The park grand are hidden gems - reasonably priced, superb service and great locations. Xavier checked me in and was welcoming and warm despite a small queue and no real wait he apologised and was really helpful.",5,2022,09,12

104,Park grand,Delusion was so nice and accommodating! Helped us find late night food and put us in a great room. He was wonderful. Highly recommended the park grand. Close to paddington station. We walked from the heathrow express,5,2022,09,10
104,Great visit,"Great service Tamara Irina. I highly recommend and I will be back soon. Cozy rooms,  quiet environment away from the busy streets of London and welcoming staff readily available to assist. I would 100% recommend.",5,2022,09,09
104,"Great location, warm service, good price","Had a very nice and warm 4 night stay at this property   which is very centrally located with nice restaurants, pubs and stores around. The rooms was tidy and clean a bit smaller than I expected but they do the job. The breakfast at the property was really nice and the staff was very accommodating to all our requests.
A quick call out to Tamara, Sacha and Irina for excellent hospitality:)",5,2022,09,09
104,Very disappointing,"I found this hotel to be disappointing on multiple levels.

First, the title of a boutique hotel implies that there is something special about it...knowledgeable staff, cute rooms, good location. 

The only thing that met the criteria was the location.  Close to Paddington Station, Hyde Park, Little Venice.

First the staff.  They were friendly enough, but there is no level of concierge service whatsoever.   Nice does not equate to knowledgeable about London nor does it mean that service is adequate.  I would expect at a minimum that a desk person would be able to call a cab.  No hope for that (download the Gett app if you go for calling  a cab).

Second, the rooms.  The photos are misleading.  We had a room that had a loft upstairs with a sofa bed.  Downstairs was a full sized bed.  The full sized bed was small.  You better have a significant other that is not an active sleeper, otherwise you will be bruised and battered by the morning.  Overall, the rooms were small and shabby.

A comment about the sofa bed.  The hotel knew that we had three of us, at a minimum the sofa bed should have been made up with clean bedsheets and pillows.  The bedsheets on the sofa bed were pretty nasty and we had to request clean ones.  Should have been made up already.

The shower continually got stopped up.  The front desk (not a plumber) tried to rig a fix by using a plunger, when it needed a thorough snaking.  Happened multiple times.

Breakfast was ok.

Overall, while the staff was friendy enough, they didn't appear knowledgeable (certainly there was no concierge level of service.  Basically, I'd describe this hotel as a hostel-like in terms of quality.,",1,2022,09,08
104,"Fun, exciting, great vibes.","The room location and staff were all excellent. 
The hotel staff was very helpful, understanding ( especially having to deal with my noisy group) and as very polite and  friendly.
Special thanks to Tamara , Gabriela, Faheem and Felison.
See you guys next year.

Ps Dr love",5,2022,09,07
104,Great hotel friendly staff,"Great hotel, 5 min walk from the station.  Faheem checked us in and was very happy made us feel welcome.

Highly recommended:)

Bathrooms are compact but you are in London and space is a premium!

Clean comfy beds and quiet.

Will book and stay again in the future",5,2022,09,07
104,A very nice time,"Freunde
Xavier and Sacha are Really nice and polite people, who checked us in. The room was beautiful and big. We
had a lovely time in the hotel and the
neighbourhood.
Es war wirklich sch√∂n. Der Service war sehr
nett und zuvorkommend. Es ist nicht weit zu
vielen tollen Gesch√§ften.",5,2022,09,05
104,London short stay at park grand Hyde park,The hospitality is good especially from Jeana and Tamara. They are helpful and assist us whenever we needed. Although the room is rather small but they are renovated and is rather clean for a short stay. Also the location is good as it‚Äôs walking distance to Paddington station that can go to airport direct.,5,2022,09,03
104,VERY REASONABLE- VERY FRIENDLY!,"I used this hotel as I was on a business trip. It was easily found and so close to Paddington station! The gentleman at the front desk greeted me with a smile, was very friendly and accommodating! It was quiet on Thursday so they upgraded me for free to a room with 2 stories and a large comfy bed! This is a place I would 100% go back to, it ticked all the boxes for a business trip and the staff were great. Thank you Xavier & Faheem !",4,2022,09,02
104,"Great stay, would recommend.  Staff very helpful and pleasant","This is a good little hotel for a short stay or overnighter.  Conveniently situated to Paddington St in a well kept terrace of beautiful townhouses.  
The staff really do go out of their way to be helpful. Xavier and Sardor greeted us at reception and although we only stayed one night, it was so nice to have a little chat with them every time we passed thro‚Äô reception.  They take pride in their role, as do the staff in the restaurant.  Breakfast is very nice, freshly cooked, beautifully presented.  The chef frequently appears from the kitchen to replenish.  Would recommend.",4,2022,09,02
104,My stay at the Park Grand Park Hotel hyde Park,"Yes I arrived here last Wednesday for 8 nights & was impressed how very friendly all the staff were ,nothing was to much trouble.
               The Room was excellent as is the location 
Just 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station.
            The staff in the restaurant were also extremely friendly & attentive.
Two members of at reception deserve a special mention Xavier & Sacha who were so very friendly & helpful.here is just one example, I had forgotten to pack a .umbrella they very kindly gave me one at the desk , thats what I call really good service.
           I will most definitely be returning here in the future, I would recommend this hotel to any one without hesitation, oh yes the other I noticed is how very comfortable the beds are .
          The price is also very reasonable it‚Äôs also the a bus stop beside Paddington Station , hyde park is about a 10 minute walk away .There are plenty of buses to take you where wish to go to , you also have the underground right handy .
                  So summing up a excellent hotel with lovely rooms & fantastic staff do come & stay here you will not be disappointed.",5,2022,09,01
104,Comfortable,Jeana was very helpful and welcoming. Excellent service. The room was really nice and the stay was comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London because it is also right next to the city center,5,2022,08,31
104,Very satisfactory,"This is my third visit to hotel (fourth to  the Park Grand  brand )  on all occasions the room and facilities are ample and clean, replenished daily. The staff at reception on arrival and departure are efficient and helpful , as is the young gentleman carrying cases and showing you to the room. I did have some names but unfortunately mislaid them on travels back home. The cleaning staff,  restaurant personnel and chef all do a good job and the breakfast are well cooked and presented. Thanks to all. I suppose the rooms are getting in need of some refurbishment, but this is reflected in the economical price. My room was particularly comfortable and being on the highest floor was quiet with some vies over roof tops of Paddington/Kensington.",5,2022,08,31
104,Absolutely TERRIBLE,"Here I have a list of things that went wrong:
- bathroom and bedroom were EXTREMELY small, no counter space at all to put our toiletries and did not have any storage space to put our clothes so we had to line them up on the floor
- the shower kept clogging up and the people at the reception desk would do nothing about it
- the reception desk people were VERY unknowledgeable‚Ä¶they couldn‚Äôt even call a taxi or get the refrigerator to work! It took 3 people to try and get it to work and they couldn‚Äôt even do that‚Ä¶
- breakfast food was okay, we were hoping for them to change it up a little each day (one day, the coffee was too bitter and it was disgusting though)
- the most horrendous thing: the bedroom upstairs had sheets that had splotches of yellow and black stains when we first arrived to the hotel

My family and I would never go back :(",1,2022,08,31
104,Amazing ,From the reception the hospitality is excellent. The staff were very friendly and professional in discharging their duty. The rooms were clean and have the necessary things to make your living worthwhile. The breakfast is awesome. With varieties of food to pick from. The location is conducive and with good access road. ,5,2022,08,30
104,Amazing experience,"Booked a room to enjoy the carnival for my birthday and was very impressed with the service as I walked into the hotel. Xavier was friendly and attended to our needs with a smile. We left for lunch and when we arrived back to collect our keys the lovely Tamara spoke to management to upgrade our room for my birthday. Really Kind gesture and the room was perfect for our stay.

I will be back again  for sure very soon

I wanted to say a big thank you to Xavier, Gabrielle and Tamara for going over and above to accommodate us. I had the best birthday.

Thank you",5,2022,08,30
104,BED BUGS!,"We visited this hotel a few weeks ago  and it was absolutely horrendous! The rooms were not like the pictures at all. The AC did not work and they said that they were going to fix it, but they never did. The sheets and towels where filthy and had stains and there was still things on the floor from the guests before. But the worst thing of all was that we found BED BUGS! We talked to the staff about it but they did not want to say anything until the manager was there, and they promised us that he would be there, but he never came. We did not get any compensation at all and they told us that it was our fault. I would not recommend it to anyone!",1,2022,08,30
104,Excellent,Excellent spot if you are staying in central London. The staff are friendly and very helpful. They helped to sort out a few situations over the Carnival weekend. Highly recommended by if you are in London for a long break or short stay. Thank you tamara and faheem for all your help.,5,2022,08,29
104,Big thanks to Ms Rania! Great service!üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª,As soon as I arrived Ms Rania who is very welcoming and friendly gave me the best room which me and my Mom liked very much! It was such a pleasure to receive such a service and treatment from Ms Rania! We enjoyed the stay in that room! Thanks a lot! I really appreciate it! It felt like coming back home when you are treated the way Ms Rania treated us! Great and excellent service!üëçüèª,5,2022,08,29
104,Rubbish!!,This hotel is definitely not a 4* more like 2* at a push. The rooms were tiny old filthy disgusting and really dated. The walls were covered in stains. Holes in the bedsheets smashed pictures the furniture looked too good for the tip. There were no hotel staff around and when I did question the filthy room I was told that somebody would pass my quirey on to housekeeping. I wouldn't stay here again if you paid me.,1,2022,08,28
104,Great customer service,"Booked a room very quickly after arriving to the UK. Arrived at the hotel quite late. Felison was very kind and straightforward, he quickly checked me in and explained where my room is. Will definitely come back!",5,2022,08,27
104,Great location for Paddington Station but  expensive and a bit dated,"We stayed 1 night in a dark basement room with a view of wall out of the window. Although comfortable the room was small for 2 people. The hotel itself feels like a 3star rather than an international 4 star. 
Positives - excellent location for Paddington station, good air conditioning in the room
Negatives - a bit tired and dated and we were charged the adult rate for a 10 year old to have breakfast. 
When you pay over ¬£200 a night for a basement room you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd let your child have breakfast for free.",3,2022,08,27
104,Thank you So much Tamara for all your help! I really appreciate it you are amazing!,Tamara is so kind and helpful and helped me so much!      Thank you for everything I highly recommend.

104,Xavier and Sardor are incredible.,"Both Xavier and Sardor made the stay absolutely wonderful. Incredibly kind, professional and made the stay very pleasant. I would highly recommend staying here if you are in the paddington area. Comfortable beds, good breakfast and outstanding staff.",5,2022,08,24
104,Great staff and service,"Hotel was easy to get to from Paddington station. On arrival the staff (Tamara, Pamela & Xavier) were all very welcoming and gave us a free upgrade to a larger room.

The room itself is clean and very spacious and modern with an extremely comfy large double bed and large shower. 

Would definitely return to stay again!!",5,2022,08,22
104,London trip,"Very nice and clean hotel with lovely rooms of a decent size. Great location being situated so close to Paddington station, as well as many near my amenities for food and drinks.

Staff were helpful and friendly on arrival and throughout the stay, with particular mention to Xavier and Sador.

Would definitely come back.",4,2022,08,22
104,Xavier was a credit to the hotel,Xavier was so welcoming and pleasant when we arrived slightly earlier than the normal check in time. He upgraded our room free of charge to such a lovely room with 2 floors! We were really impressed by his service,5,2022,08,22
104,London trip,"I recommend this hotel to other guests, the rooms were clean and cozy. The receptionist Rania took a good care of us, communication was extremely easy and clear with her, we would be happy to come back to the hotel again.",5,2022,08,21
104,Unique but certainly not boutique,"This hotel is not the boutique hotel it claims, it‚Äôs in desperate need of a renovation and certainly not a 4 star. On the first day of our stay the light bulb blew in the room which tripped all the lights, we informed staff at 3pm so they could fix it in time for our return after the Coldplay concert, we arrived back at 00.30am and nothing had been done, the untrained staff had no idea how to fix the issue and after 30mins of trying gave up and offered us a ‚Äúworse room‚Äù than we‚Äôd payed for! We packed our things in the pitch black (no assistance from staff, a torch would‚Äôve been nice) and moved. In the morning we waited for 20mins for the manager who never arrived and were offered no refund! On arriving back after our day out we were offered ‚Äúone of the best rooms in the hotel‚Äù (as you can see from the pics if that‚Äôs the best they‚Äôve got then it says it all) only when I flat out refused to pay full price for the first night did they offer us a 20% refund on one night which given the circumstances I found pathetic.
We won‚Äôt be returning, the place needs a full refurb and a re-training of all staff if it wants to get anywhere near the 4* it boasts",2,2022,08,21
104,lovely place,I was frustrated with the long day work and was greeted with a pleasing smile upon checking. Xavier understood I had a bad day and check in was quick and and easy. there was some problem with my payment however he let me in my roo. and we sorted the payment later.,5,2022,08,20
104,Room was upgraded,It was unplanned stay due to strike when we reached at the hotel Xavier was welcoming  and even provide us a complementary upgrade. Breakfast was nice and they even hold our bag for entire day. Very close to Paddington station.,5,2022,08,20
104,Great experience,I really enjoy the experience. Is a very nice hotel. Also the staff was very helpful and professional especially Pamela and Jeana. The hotel is located close to the tube station and restaurants. I will come back for sure!,5,2022,08,20
104,Great service,"We were greeted so nicely by Pamela and Rania. Pamela helped me giving me tips of where to go and it was very helpful. The hotel is very nice and comfortable. The rooms are nice and the beds very comfortable. The hotel is in a very good area, close to restaurants and public transport.",5,2022,08,19
104,"BED BUGS / BUG / WARNING, unhygienic, unpleasant and terrible‚Ä¶","The hands down worst hotel I‚Äôve ever visited. Visited London in the beginning of August as a part of a big group and stayed at this horrendous hotel. To start of, the air conditioning didn‚Äôt work in the double-room. Four people in a small room during a heatwave without AC? They told us they weren‚Äôt aware of this but considering there where two fans there when we arrived I‚Äôm guessing that was a lie, since there were no fans in the other rooms where the AC was functional. They told us they were getting someone who would fix this but that did not happen during our stay.

However, the AC was not the worst part. They had BED BUGS, in multiple rooms. Our group had 5 rooms in total and we found bugs in two of them. When we found them in the first room we immediately alarmed the reception and we got to change room. Unfortunately we discovered that the new room was dirty and unhygienic. The sheets were dirty and there was food on the floor. We went back down to the reception and told them about this. Thankfully they changed the sheets but still, we change room because the previous one had bed bugs but get a dirty room instead? The level of hygiene is under all criticism. 

The next day we also found bed bugs in another room. The one I personally was staying in. And due to all of this we wanted to speak to the manager. That did not happen. We were told he was going to be available for a meeting at nine the next morning but when we got down they told us he hadn‚Äôt arrived. Hours later we still got told the same answer. When we asked for compensation they told us they could only give us a complementary breakfast. However we were not pleased. Getting bed bugs means that you have to put everything in the freezer for at least a week. All your clothes, shoes, bags etc. And I also got 20+ itchy and annoying bug bites all over my body. They told us that we had brought the bed bug with us but this is completely ridiculous considering neither of us has ever had a problem with any sort of bug. It is only an excuse so that we can‚Äôt hold them accountable. 

I am very disappointed and want to warn people of this hotel! You will most likely get bed bugs, whether you‚Äôre you aware or not, and will end up without any sort of compensation. The receptionist where overall where nice but this one girl (Sasha I believed her name was) which we talked to on the day we left, had a very bad attitude and gave me mean looks while whispering to her colleague. 

This hotel is under all criticism. DO NOT GO HERE.

(Bed bug, bed bugs, bedbug, bedbugs)",1,2022,08,18
104,First & last time we would stay at this hotel.,"I booked this hotel for a stay in London with my 13yr old son.  I liked the location of it, just a block away from Paddington Station, and the photos of the hotel looked appealing. 

I am genuinely shocked that this hotel has a 4* rating, I really am. The reception area on entering was clean, modern and worthy of a 4*, and that was where it ended! 
The gentleman that checked us in wasn't particularly welcoming, didn't smile, not once even, and although offered us the opportunity to pre book breakfast at a discounted rate it was barely made to be an appealing offer, more of a going through the speel! No welcome to London etc etc. 

We took the lift up to our room on the sixth floor, and entered our ""deluxe twin room""! 
Honestly, there was nothing that I would have considered to be deluxe about the room or even the view. In fact, the first thing I did was to sit on the bed and open my email to confirm that was what I had actually booked. 

The room smelt like it had been smoked in.
There was a small sofa in the room, that I would not have let my dog sleep on, it really was fit for the dump! 
There was a throw across the bottom of the two beds, this had a burn hole on it. 
One of the duvets had a split in it.
The net curtains were absolutely filthy!
The bathroom mirror was stained and the bottom of the shower was dirty. 
The TV remote control had no battery cover.
And finally, the free WiFi was non existent, you could log in, but the signal was not there. 

We quickly came to the decision, that declining the breakfast offer was probably a damn good choice! 

The good points ~ the beds were very comfortable and the two ladies that checked us out were very nice indeed. 

As stated, this was our first stay at this hotel and for sure will be our last stay too!",2,2022,08,18
104,Nice hotel,"Before I say that the hotel is very beautiful, the reception staff are very nice and I would like to thank Felpson and Antouio for their good treatment with me and my friends and for welcoming us so when I visit London next time I will come to this hotel for their hospitality",5,2022,08,17

Despite arriving early we were immediately allocated a room; the room was a little tired and smelt of stale cigarette smoke, but we soon got used to it and only really used the room to sleep and shower!",4,2022,08,15
104,Excellent,"Everything is wonderful my kids enjoyed it, although the room is very small it is cozy and homey, the reception is very friendly and multi language, the breakfast buffet is great for a hefty meal, there‚Äôs also tea and coffe in your room for a good cup of joe in the morning, overall decent place for families.

104,Thank you :),"I stayed 4 days at here with my friend. Our room was next to the office, so we could here some voices. However, we could feel safe at that point. POV maybe. Thanks to Xavier, Cristina and Rania, we had wonderful time at there. Every staffs were so nice and helped us a lot. Best hotel during our 2weeks trip.",5,2022,08,08
104,Expected more,"I booked the hotel in the high season (July), so the price was relatively high. The hotel from the outside looks beautiful; however, the inside is not great. Our room was clearly built as an extra (cheap materials, uncomfortable to enter because of so many doors to open and steps to take) and was not cozy. The view from the window was to the back of the hotel (only a white wall). For the price, I was expecting a much nicer room or place. The breakfast is pretty basic (English breakfast, fruit). But the location of the hotel is good. Paddington station is pretty close, which makes it easy to move around London.",3,2022,08,07
104,Hotel,"Thanks everything perfect especiall thanks to  cristina  and xauer you are amazing , And Tamara

I would give them 10/10 for this amazing service and work. Nothing but the best and love for them‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2022,08,06
104,Cristina was excellent,"I had the best experience with the receptionist named Cristina, she was very outgoing and made me feel very welcoming!:) the breakfast was great and the location was perfect walking distance to paddington station.",5,2022,08,06

104,Great Location and Staff. Small Rooms,"The Hotel is in a great location - 2 minutes walking to Paddington station. The hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful - specially Xavier and Rania.

We weren't expecting to be able to park at the hotel due to us arriving around 5:30pm but we found spaces for both our cars and it was slightly cheaper than nearby carparks. 
They upgraded the room for the lady who was 50 and made great effort to add special touches. 
Xavier was friendly and very helpful! 
Beds very super comfy!",5,2022,07,31
104,Xavier is a star üåü,"A great value hotel with amazing staff. Xavier went above and beyond for our stay. He made our weekend away for my mom's 50th extra special. Can't thank him enough. Highly recommended. 

Parking out the front was ideal for our stay but can be limited. However, even though we arrived at around 5:30pm there was still enough spaces for our two cars. ",5,2022,07,31

104,Mixed,"Got a good price on a Wowcher deal. Confirmed the booking on the phone with hotel after redeeming wowcher and assured it was received. But on arrival no booking on system!!! Apparently the person I spoke to when confirming on phone was new and hadnt put it on the system. This had also happened to an earlier reviewer. Had to wait half an hour in reception but fortunately there was a room available. Reception staff helpful and courteous, arranged for some water while we waited. Hotel location good up a fairly quiet but attractive treelined road. Room was small, ants around and window area not clean. Long life milk clearly affected by heat and curdled in tea. Shower room the smallest I have ever encountered. Breakfast fairly good, but only scrambled egg. Late check out useful on wowcher deal as we walked to Portobello market, very interesting, and had a shower on our return before leaving at 1pm. We got a good price via the wowcher deal but would look elsewhere next time if there was somewhere for a similar price.",3,2022,07,28
104,Stayed over for a hospital appointment and combined with seeing friends,"I stayed at the Park Grand Lancaster Gate last week for a conference and when I needed to stay in London again was very happy to bookm with them again. I accidentally booked for the Hyde Park Grand Royal whereas previously I‚Äôd stayed at thei Lancaster Gate branch. This time the location was ideal for Paddington and St. Mary‚Äôs, v v convenient. 
Hyde Park staff were v friendly and helpful even moving my room to something more accessible as I use a crutch (but as it has been a last minute booking I hadn‚Äôt informed them of this) 
Great, friendly staff, happily replenishing tea, coffee, milk etc on request promptly and efficiently. 
Hyde Park is in places just a tiny bit tired compared to Lancaster Gate and Lancaster Gate breakfast had (for me) a better variety but of course this is v personal, there was a v good cooked breakfast selection which doesn‚Äôt appeal to me so much. 
Staff were really friendly, helpful and efficient and everywhere was spotlessly clean - something high on my importance list - so 10/10 for that and friendliness. 
Would definitely consider staying again but personally I‚Äôd probably choose Lancaster Gate unless location is important in which case, Hyde Park is fantastic. Overall though, I‚Äôd be very happy to stay at either again, thank you! üòä",4,2022,07,28

104,Less than optimal experience,"I had a reservation for my daughter and me. We arrived at 2pm to check in and were showed our room. We were told we would have to wait. We returned to be given a ground floor basement room. I refused the room. The staff ultimately (after I advised that the switch was unacceptable) sent us to a wonderful hotel down the street. I was promised a refund, never got it, and have disputed it. 

I am an easygoing person and am reluctant to write a bad review but beware. Go down the street to The Inhabit. It is brand new, less expensive and much nicer.",2,2022,07,16
104,Do not stay at this hotel!,Avoid this hotel at all costs.  I stayed here in July 22 and had aftershave stolen out of my room.  I reported it to the hotel management who showed very little interest in helping me but instead advised reporting it to the police.  Dreadful customer service and somewhere I will never return to.,1,2022,07,14
104,Five star only for staff efforts,"Stay was not that great. I came early morning I was allowed to keep my luggage at the hotel. Later I came back to hotel from my long tiring day got to know that I was allocated in a small room in basement.  With full disappointment I approach to reception, Xavier handed my situation professionally and allocated a room on higher floor.  

Advice do not stay in basement and please mention it in ur reservation details while booking. Hotel need TLC",5,2022,07,12
104,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed for 3 nights whilst visiting London. Superb hotel and location. Added bonus of free breakfast. Well kept and maintained hotel. Staff were very friendly especially Sacha. Will definitely be using again.,5,2022,07,11
104,Desperate need of a revamp,"Very poor. Room was an 'upgrade' but can only think normal rooms must be tiny. Furniture shabby and torn. Chair was broken so that you sunk in when sitting down. Bathroom ok - towels small and barely any life in them due to overuse. For ¬£200 a night, even by Londons standards, it was pretty dire.",2,2022,07,11
104,Amazing stay! Amazing staff and lovely hotel.!,"I have just stayed here with 15 friends for my sisters hen do. 
The manager xavier couldnt do enough to help make the stay special. 

They helped decorate the room with balloons, which looked fabulous  and blew us away and brought a tear to my sisters eyes. 

A room upgrade and complimentary Prosecco was such a lovely touch  and we felt so special and looked after our whole stay.

The hotel was a great location, reasonably priced and would definitely stay again. 

Thank you to all the staff for a memorable stay!",5,2022,07,11

104,"Impeccable service, rooms need TLC","5/5 for staff‚Äôs friendliness. Everyone goes above and beyond to help and are extremely nice. 
This is my second stay at this hotel, having stayed in 2018, and I was glad to see that the staff was just as nice this time around.
3/5 for the rooms. Though everything was very clean, the rooms we stayed in (we had two rooms) needed TLC (lots of scratches on the walls, furniture upholstery on its last mile, dresser looked shabby). The breakfast buffet could also benefit from fresh fruit (the pineapple served one morning had seen better days).",3,2022,07,02
104,Con is an understatement. ,"It‚Äôs safe to say the best thing about this hotel is leaving and coming home. Firstly, the bar was shut for the entire month- which was disappointing. We was not informed of this. We booked a DULUXE double room which if the definition of deluxe resembles a prison cell and 4ft 6 bed that barely fitted in the room they hit this on the nail. We also booked a family type room which was okay‚Äîish, just totally completely tired out and for the price we could have stayed somewhere much nicer! Felt totally robbed! Oh and there was also a situation where there wasn‚Äôt even a duvet on the bed! And when asked about this the hotel staff didn‚Äôt even know what a duvet was! Eventually after some deliberation as to what a duvet was they came to a conclusion and provided this which we were grateful.  The hotel staff did not appear to be bothered or particularly friendly throughout our stay. We will never return. My advice, don‚Äôt waste your money. ",1,2022,07,02
104,the best,ecellent service by the hotel staff. espicially Rania and Xavier they did the great job. very close from Paddington staion and st. marry hospital. good and clean room. ill definately will come back to the hotel,5,2022,06,29
104,Amazing stay,I got the opportunity to stay at the hotel and I had great experience during my stay . The atmosphere is lovely and the staff is very helpful and friendly . especially Valan and Antonio at the reception who were very professional and helpful and made my experience better . This hotel will be my first choice when I visit London again .,5,2022,06,28
104,Friendly,"Friendly service from Xavier & Gabriella who helped me with a fitting room for my six huge bags with equipment. It‚Äôs always a challenge to travel with camera equipment, but they helped me with a smile making it much easier. Thanks for your help.",5,2022,06,28
104,Thank you Rania,"I had a wonderful experience at this hotel I did my check in with Rania she was amazing very helpful.

104,Valan,"Nice staff and really kind one, fantastic experience in the hotel. He talked with us so friendly. The original was cancelled and he helped us to make a new booking and tell his about the ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶perfect guy mr. Valan",5,2022,06,27
104,Disappointing - Room Not Available,"The hotel overbooked & did not have a room available for us.. they failed to tell us this when we tried to check in & fobbed us off with a story about the system being down & took our bags.
When we arrived back from a concert in Hyde Park at roughly 11.30pm, they said they were doing maintenance and our room wasn't available despite having taken the money from our bank account on the day of arrival.
It took over an hour for them to arrange a room for us at another hotel & the communication during this time was minimal, the staff were unapologetic, incompetent and there were no senior members of staff available to talk to due to the time of night.
We were sent to a hotel around the corner & when we got there, no booking had been arranged for us & the staff there had to contact the reservations team instead. We finally got to bed about 1.30am, after 2 hours of sitting in hotel receptions & traipsing our bags round from one hotel to another.
I have been in a situation where the hotel has overbooked before but they have gone above & beyond to rectify the situation & that it fine.. what is not fine is displaying zero customer service like in this occasion.
Next time we will book Inhabit Queens Gardens instead where the front of house staff are able to perform simple tasks such as giving you a room.",1,2022,06,27
104,Fantastic break away,"What can i say, i‚Äôve stayed at the Hyde park Park grand at least 5 times in the last year and i‚Äôve always had a positive experience. The staff are polite and welcoming especially the wonderful Gabriela who has always been there to greet me on each visit. Rooms are clean and tidy, well stocked and its a stones throw away from paddington station! Though you wouldn‚Äôt think so with how quiet it is! Fabulous place to stay and i‚Äôll keep coming back.",5,2022,06,25
104,Very good,"Good hotel to stay if you go to London. Very well located, since it is near Hyde Park and Paddington underground. The room was clean and the staff were absolutely amazing, I was attended by Gabriela. I would recommend.",5,2022,06,23
104,Pleasent experience  - Free upgrade,Felision Valan & Antonio were very welcoming . We got an upgrade unexpectedly after arriving so late in the night after a flight .  Beds are very comfortable. Great location too !! Very central. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2022,06,23
104,FAB,"This was a one night wowcher deal including breakfast & late check out.

Staff were amazing in facilitating 2 double beds as opposed to a twin as we were 2 females guests.
The air con was a god send in the unprecedented weather & the beds were so comfy we both had the best nights sleep.
Breakfast was plentiful & nothing was too much trouble, it set us up for a days sightseeing.

Would definitely recommend this hotel it‚Äôs in walking distance of the west end, hyde park, Buckingham Palace.
The only thing that put a dampener on the trip was the rail strike which resulted in a 4hr mega bus journey home as opposed to a 90 min train journey",5,2022,06,21
104,Great hotel great staff thank you Rania,"My name is Zin. I got here and the hotel was great. Room was nice and location is amazing. The staff was kind and welcoming.

104,Disha Rajput,"Hi
I came as a tourist to London all the way  from India and am travelling alone. Being a single traveller I was very unsure of a lot of new things here but all my apprehensions disappeared when I checked into Park Grand and was met with the most helpful and friendly staff. Xavier and Valan made sure that my stay here was as comfortable as possible and went out of their way to help me in any way that they could. Starting from preparing an itinerary, to commuting, to local markets, to sightseeing etc, all aspects were very explained and guided. They became my support and I found friends in an unknown land. My heart felt appreciation to Park Grand for making their visitors feel a part of the family.
Will recommend this place for stay to all my friends and family.",5,2022,06,20

104,"Sizeable rooms and beds, helpful & friendly staff","Stayed 1 night, 2 rooms for the family. Rooms were sizeable, clean and the beds were bigger than expected. Bathroom & shower sizes varied by room - one shower was large and the other a tight squeeze. A/C was quiet and worked great (it was a heat wave when we stayed). Good 'English breakfast' buffet in the morning with fruit & yogurt choices too. Staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful - wonderful people. Easy walk to Paddington train/tube stop. Definitely would stay here again.

Only drawback was that our rooms were only accessible by a narrow curved stairway after taking the lift to the 4th floor - that made access with our heavy bags awkward. A strange quirk from being connected to the neighboring space, I suppose.",5,2022,06,18

104,"Wonderful, attentive and welcoming receptionist",Booked 2 nights in mid March and I was impressed how welcoming attentive and friendly the staff were. Any issues I had were solved incredibly quickly. Amazing staff honorable mention would be Pamela. 10/10 would recommend.,4,2022,05,10
104,Dissatisfied with hitel room due to cleanliness. ,"Our room was disgusting. I trued to put the photo's on here but trip advisor won't upload them? Dust, stained mattress, stained carpets, not hoovered,  bathroom floor dirty, cups in room dirty we had to wash our cups with the shampoo they supply. We used a whole 2 bottles of 100ml of sanitiser to wipe down surfaces so we could our belongings on the bed side tables, table, dresser top and hand stairs hand rail. We didn't have breakfast, as if our room was dirty and we can see it , I dread to think what the kitchen is like. We stayed 30/04/22  fir 1 night ¬£180.00.This is NOT A 4 STAR HOTEL by far. The staff were great ,but house keeping is woeful.  I sent the photo's via email to the hotel ,but no response.  I did this twice. We even slept on the bed as the mattress was stained as was the mattress topper. The carpet had visible dust clumps. I have always stayed in 4 or five stars hitela , but NEVER have I cone across this level of lack in cleanliness. Fir the hotel NOT to get back to me shows that there is no customer service as they say they follow up with enquired or any issues. 
Never again. I wouldn't recommend this particular hotel to any one. ",1,2022,05,09
104,"Clean and cheerful hotel , staff helpful and the access to the centre was only a cab drive away ‚Ä¶.. a good friendly hote",Super friendly staff especially Pamela and Gabriela who managed our check in ‚Ä¶ the hotel was quiet and we all slept well ‚Ä¶. Unfortunately the breakfast area wasn‚Äôt operating due to covid restrictions but we found nice breakfast spots within walking distance,4,2022,05,09
104,"Nice room, comfortable and great location","Great location. A few blocks from cetral station. Lovely room. Clean. Free water, tea, cofee etc.
The staff is super polite, friendly and attentive. Great place to stay in London. See you next time!!!",5,2022,05,09
104,Small room at a good price,"The hotel looks great from the outside but very different inside. There is no atmosphere, corridors are narrow and my room was not quite pod-size, but not far off. The duvet was very thin and the curtains did not close properly. The showroom would be a struggle to turn around in for someone of a larger stature. 
However, staff were pleasant, I got good value for money on the nightly rate and cannot complain as I was only in the room to sleep. If staying again for the same purpose, at the same rate, I would book again.",3,2022,05,08
104,Pamela was wonderful!,"Checked in May 7 and had a pretty hard time doing so because of Expedia cancelling our booking, but Pamela at the front desk was so helpful and professional at helping us navigate the situation to get us checked in. The room was upgraded for the wait which was extra kind of her! Definitely a great addition to their team at this hotel. Gabriela at check out was quick and helpful as well. Thank you ladies üòä",5,2022,05,08
104,Receptionist Xavier was excellent,"Lovely hotel.. the location was perfect and was happy with the helpfulness and kindness of the staff.Receptionist Xavier was excellent and done a upgrade for us..!
Most of the time parking available..!",5,2022,05,05
104,Horrible people,"We booked for my husband birthday about 6 weeks before ,the morning we were leaving they emailed to say they were sending us to another hotel we couldn‚Äôt cancel as booked through booking.com so our money would have been taken as it was less than 24 hours .. very sneaky I thought. although the hotel was nice it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted for my husband birthday it was a spa/vegan hotel no bar and I arranged to meet family at the hotel before we went for dinner I had to contact everyone‚Ä¶ I emailed them but they didn‚Äôt reply‚Ä¶ they could at least Replied‚Ä¶ BEWARE I HEARD THIS HOTEL HAS DONE THIS MANY TIMES",1,2022,05,04
104,Nice stay and very helpful service,"We arrived quite late at the Hotel and we were welcomed by Valan, who has been very friendly and caring to us. The room was a bit noisy in the morning so we asked if we could be given a quieter room and we were given one free of charge. The room were clean and the staff was very considerate. Big thanks to Valan!",4,2022,05,04
104,Wonderfull Stay-Thanks All,"I spent a night at The Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel , the location was perfect and was happy with the helpfulness and kindness of the staff (Rania, Xavier, & Jeana). I will most certainly stay again!",5,2022,05,01
104,Outstanding service - amazing beds. Excellent value.,"Is this the most glamorous hotel? No. Does it need a lick of paint and small cosmetic touches in places? Possibly. But for the very low rates the hotel offers you have to be realistic. Anybody who leaves a poor review for this great find are simply deluded.

Fantastic staff - the doorman on last night, the lady who checked us in (didn‚Äôt manage to get your name sorry!!) and Jeanna who checked us out on reception we‚Äôre so friendly and an absolute asset to the hotel. 

Nicely located on a quieter street outside of the central london hustle and bustle, close to tubes and Paddington station. 

The bed is perhaps the comfiest bed I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of sleeping in and the duvet was unbelievable. Water, biscuits, a great tea selection, ample toiletries. I‚Äôm not sure what people expect for ¬£90-¬£150 a night??

My advice is if you want super luxury, then pay for it. With some of the reviews on here you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking they‚Äôve spent thousands. You can‚Äôt use the lenses of a luxury hotel inspector when you‚Äôve paid ¬£120 a night. A super convenient, comfortable and homely hotel that is brilliant value for money. 

Pleasantly surprised and will be sure to use again when in London! Thanks all!",5,2022,04,30
104,"Nice, clean and affordable hotel in London","Good, clean, affordable.  Xavier was  very helpful and also kindly, at check in, he upgraded us for free!

Thanks

104,Hotel meets requirements but ...,"The hotel is very easy to find by car being on westbourne terrace which is just off the A40, unfortunately the sting in the tail is a ¬£25 charge per night for parking, and I bought a wowcher deal which did not mention this. I think they must give the wowcher deals the small rooms at the back or so it seems.
The hotel in itself is acceptable with quite nice breakfast which is in the basement, again this meant a little trip along basement corridor from the wowcher rooms. The ensuite is equally quite small but usable. ",3,2022,04,23
104,Staff are very helpfull,"the hostel is very nice and clean, near to all the services. There is an Arab restirant nearby and 10min away from Arab road. The personal were helpfull and kind. We enjoyed our stay and we recommend it.",5,2022,04,23

104,Nice clean and had everything needed,"Very clean room
Equipped with everything that‚Äôs needed.
The down side was that there were times the WiFi didn‚Äôt work and the room was small to fit a large luggage so there was a small space but it‚Äôs been taken by the luggage.
Other than that there were hot water. Kettle with coffee and tea (decaf included)",4,2022,04,18
104,Not a 4 star hotel,Dirty. Small. Not a 4 star hotel in anyway. Very disappointing. Nice breakfast and location. Other than that very poor experience. Would not return.

104,Nice,"I‚Äôm bad at writing reviews but honestly this hotel was a pretty nice experience. Bed was comfortable, cleanliness was a 10/10, staff were helpful and nice, especially Nicole, who was always ready to help us navigate this foreign environment. A specific example is her assisting us with finding a restaurant that we could go to with our normal timetable and not have to adapt to the UK‚Äôs timetable",5,2022,04,13
104,Ms,"I‚Äôve had a great experience with this hotel, especially because of Nicole, who was always eager to help at any moment. As a foreigner, she always made us feel right at home and she would not hesitate to give us relevant information about the area to help us out. (Specially regarding things like where to eat. Considering our eating times are quite different from the ones in the UK this was extremely helpful) 
Overall fantastic assistance.",5,2022,04,13

Will definitely visit again.",5,2022,04,08
104,Perfect for a London Business Trip,The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station. I selected the room upgrade option as I was staying for a week on business. I was given one of the rooms with a mezzanine floor which came complete with a kitchenette on the bottom floor and bed and office desk on the mezzanine. For a long stay it was an excellent space. Heating works perfect. House keeping daily. Overall a great experience and no problem recommending to anyone.,5,2022,04,07
104,Very helpful and welcoming team on reception,"I had a couple of very pleasant nights stay at the Park Grand. The reception team were so patient and helpful with sorting out some practical issues for me when I unexpectedly had to host an online seminar from my room. A big thankyou to Xavier, Rania and Pamela for all your help in making that possible.",5,2022,04,06
104,My Stay At Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel.,My stay at the Park Grand London Hyde Park was very good. The bed was very comfortable and the front desk staff PAMELA was quite helpful. Pamela was quite cordial and helped me settle in fast. I was surprised to see she is a Trainee (based on her name Tag) because she would pass for a very experienced front desk officer.,5,2022,04,05
104,Nice place,"Amazing place with a wonderful staff especially Pamela, was extremely helpful, communicative and lovely.
Very well located and quite close to a lot of restaurants, the Hyde park and the main streets of central London.
Rooms mostly nice, and very clean",5,2022,04,04
104,Got the quadruple room with the price of a double bedroom,"Thanks to Jeana, I only paid the price of a double bedroom to get the quadruple room. 

The only thing that l didn‚Äôt like is when the fire alarm went off for testing while I was a sleep, which was a bit annoying.

However, overall, I liked the stay.",4,2022,04,01
104,Miss Magali Jean-Joseph,"I stayed in this hotel on Sunday and I am back again today! Great hotel, the rooms are clean and cosy and the breakfast is fantastic!

104,Very nice accommodation & friendly staff,"We were in London for a few days and searched for a priceable accommodation with good connection to the Inner circle. We are more than happy that we found this hotel and we also were so lucky to meet the helpful and friendly staff, especially at the reception where the staff were also always in a good mood. Thanks to Sarah who was very cute, the check out was easy and fast done. I will definitley recommand this hotel to my friends.",5,2022,03,30
104,Fabulous location and rooms,"Just a short walk from Paddington Station. We got a room upgrade and had a room over 2 floors with an upstairs bedroom, lounge and kitchenette. Really spacious room and a small terrace. Breakfast was amazing. Thank you Xavier, we'll be back",5,2022,03,29
104,"Friendly staff, good location","Staff were friendly, served by Valan who had great customer service!! Convenient location but bedrooms were average and not very modern. Heating did not work. Clean room and bathroom and large double bed.",3,2022,03,29
104,Ok for 1 night but would not stay for longer,"The hotel is ok and offers good value if looking for a comfortable bed near Paddington station. If you are looking to travel into the city the public transport links are good as they are if you are looking to travel west. The check in staff were excellent and they alone deserve a higher than 3 star average rating. Our main challenge with the hotel was the room cleanliness which had stains on the bed runner and just a general unloved demeanour. The TV was not adjustable and the room layout was weird. The size was actually not bad for London hotel rooms and having an Iron was helpful. All in all though we will not be back, not because of anything to dramatic, just because there is either better quality rooms out there or you can stay in a premier inn for less money and the same experience.",3,2022,03,28
104,Recommended,"We arrived on Saturday 26th March to find that our reservation had been cancelled due to an error on our booking. Jeana was very helpful in reinstating our booking, and upgraded us to a large duplex room. The hotel is in the perfect location, around the corner from Paddington station. Staff could not do enough for us
Thank you Jeana for helping us resolve our query, we had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend and come back again  one day.",5,2022,03,28
104,Recommended,"The location is very good, in front of Paddington station, Nicole, a very nice Spanish girl, attended me at all times, she also resolved all my doubts with the subways and buses, I had some discomfort with the sound of the heater and  she solve it quickly. I highly recommend this place, next week I will have to go to London, and I will make my reservation at this hotel again.",5,2022,03,27
104,Cristina & Karolina,"I had a wonderful time in this hotel. I and my friend really enjoied there. So, l would like to Thanks all staff for their kindness espacially girls in the resturant Critina and Karolina for their excelent Service and being alaways smile when serve us.",5,2022,03,27

104,Great location and helpful staff,"Location is great, you have two tube stations located without 8 mins of walking and with good food restaurants close by. The staff was very helpful and went out of their way.
Valan, supported me in modifying my booking and called me personally to let me know that changes were done. He checked if I needed anything and also suggested on which room to book.
The single rooms are very tiny if you are travelling with a big bag, but if you are planning to stay out, then it works out well.",4,2022,03,26
104,Amazing staff!!,"We were at the hotel for a weekend, location is perfect and very close to the underground. Nicole from front desk allocated us at good room with nice views, she was very polite, friendly and following up our stay every day! Nothing bad to say. Good place to stay in London.",5,2022,03,25
104,Great location,"Brilliant stay the receptionist Sarah who was a trainee was great polite and is definitely a credit to the hotel.
Clean rooms perfect stay, rooms were a decent size and we needed for nothing. Walking distance to Paddington and tube stations.
Parking right outside the hotel which was also very reasonable",5,2022,03,25
104,Bad Night‚Äôs Sleep,"Firstly, the location is good. Close to Paddington Station. That‚Äôs about it.

Lady on the check out (arrived around 18:30) was extremely rude, demanded I provide my driving licence to back up who I said I was. Room was prepaid and had email to prove it, but still kept trying to charge me. Finally given a room key, this didn‚Äôt work so had to traipse back to reception to get another.

Once in the room - it was a single bed room - it was tiny. I know it‚Äôs London etc but this was extremely small. Window was single glazed and didn‚Äôt lock which isn‚Äôt ideal being on the first floor. Walls were marked all over and the curtains had rips in letting light through. The bathroom, whilst very small, was clean. Doors bang constantly during the night, and various mechanical ‚Äòbits‚Äô attached to the hotel whirl and crank all night long. The walls are paper thin. Chap in the room next to me constantly coughing. The walls are that thin, that if he had Covid I probably caught it from him through the wall. This is the worst night‚Äôs sleep I have had in a long time. 

To put it in context. I was due to stay at this hotel for two nights, but have left after one night and booked another hotel elsewhere.

I stay in Paddington a lot for work and was hoping to find a ‚Äògo to‚Äô hotel. This definitely is not it.

Many reviews speak about the need for an update and ‚Äòless rooms, better quality‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Some of the pictures on the website make the hotel/rooms look amazing. My experience is miles from this.",1,2022,03,24
104,Great location and great customer service,"We had a long business stay in London, location is very convenient, would like to commend Nicole and Pamela at the front office for their excellent customer service, they were always extremely helpful, well done!",5,2022,03,23
104,Lazo,The hotel is in a prime location and the staff are very helpful. They had worked hard to replace my room despite the demand especially i want to thank Nicole and Pamela . Mucho gracias for your assistance.,5,2022,03,23
104,Wonderful Rooms & Great Staff,"Really enjoyed my stay room was great, bed was super comfy and a big thankyou to Karolina, Antonio & Mironela for looking after me and the great breakfast 

I will be staying again nothing was too much trouble for them",5,2022,03,23
104,John,"The Park Grand is located on a beautiful tree-lined avenue called Westbourne Terrace, located within 10 minutes walk of Paddington Station. Hyde Park, Bayswater, Little Venice, Oxford St and Notting Hill are also within walking distance. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay, then look no further than the Park Grand. The staff are always cheerful and are extremely accommodating to one‚Äôs every need. Gabriela and Xavier do a wonderful job at the front desk and will make you feel at home. Highly recommended.",5,2022,03,21
104,Great hotel,Great hotel very near Paddington station but situated in a nice residential area. Few minutes walk to Hyde park. Stayed in a single room which was lovely .

104,Fabulous choice!,"We just spent our first night at the hotel and we are so glad we chose this hotel. After a very long transatlantic trip all the way from Honduras, we were greeted at the front desk by Pamela, who made checking in as easy as possible. We were assigned a beautiful room facing the street with very high ceilings and  a very confortable bed. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby and Paddington station is just a block and a half away.",5,2022,03,15
104,Great location,"It is a nice hotel with a lot of restaurants nearby great if you‚Äôre planing to stay a couple days, it also has a couple of metro stations close so moving around the city becomes easy for you, rooms are a little small and can hear people talking and walking.",3,2022,03,14
104,Location,"Nice location this hotel is just a stroll  from Paddington. Room was nice and if a little small, had a nice breakfast good choice. Found it a bit strange only one lift didn‚Äôt mine stairs from 5th Floor walking down but up had to wait for lift .our room was one that adjoining could hear people talking but slept fine",4,2022,03,13
104,Excellent,"Friendly and welcoming staff members. Responded quickly to any questions and queries, special shoutout to Xavier and Dania as they were friendly and easy going. Rooms were spacious and nice and had everything we expected.",5,2022,03,12
104,Review,"Great value. The staff are great especially Fayzi he was very helpful. The rooms are small and there is no sound insulators, so you can hear the other room. But in general it was good experience and as I said the staff very helpful.",5,2022,03,09

104,Mr S Alcock,"We were greeted by the very friendly and helpful Xavier and Sacha on reception.
Xavier gave us a free upgrade for our 1 night stay in a 2 tier room with a separate downstairs kitchen and bathroom area and an upstairs sleeping area.
The room was clean and modern looking but the flight of stairs is very steep and not the easiest to navigate during the night if you required the downstairs bathroom.
The room also has paper thin walls as we could hear absolutely everything from a the very noisy adjoining room with their TV blaring t 3am and constant use of the creeking staircase within their room hence we had a pretty awful nights sleep. 
This is not the fault of the hotel staff but this clearly needs to be monitored for future guests staying in one of these rooms as there is no soundproofing whatsoever !! 
We actually checked out earlier than planned as it was pointless trying to sleep.",2,2022,03,07
104,Great customer service by Mr. Felison,"I‚Äôm staying for a night for business here in London and Mr. Felison at the reception treated me like a king, upgrading my room to a bigger one and booked a cab for the morning.

104,Great Receptionist.,"Steer well clear of this hotel. We stayed via a deal from wowcher and on arrival were told it was our fault the computer system said 1 visitor rather than the two on our conformation email.  
The receptionist was fantastic sorting the situation and even swapping us from a room in the basement with no view to one on the 6th floor although after seeing the room perhaps the basement would have been better. 
The twin beds pushed together were old and tired and the rubbish falling apart sofa bed should have been thrown out years ago. 
No USB sockets and a bathroom with dirty grout just added to all the negatives at this place.  We stay at another hotel in London sometimes and it's the same price same sort of area and know which we will be using next time we are in London.",2,2022,02,27
104,Wonderful,"Only stayed here because of a wowcher deal, but I'm so glad we did! From check-in, Sacha was wonderful over a change in room due to mobility issues I have. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was clean, tea/coffee restocked daily, fresh towels etc. Breakfast. Amazing! Thank you Antonio, for looking after us so well. The food was so good. It said continental, but there was a full English buffet as well, the potatoes were divine. Thank you to Beatrice and Jeana for a trouble free check-out. Location is a 5 minute walk from Paddington. All in all, we are so happy with our stay. Thank you to the team there, we will be back!",5,2022,02,25
104,Chilled weekend,"Stayed here a few time , nice and quite area,  nice cafe up the the road you will pass them when you come out of the trian station , the train station about a 10 minit walk,  staff are lovely  from start to finish , they will keep your bags on Check out if u got time to go back in to London before heading home ",4,2022,02,23
104,Horrific,"Stayed @ the hotel for 2 nights . First room was a problem with the window. All their windows are not double glazed . 

Window was broken letting cold in freezing. Moved room into another one which had a tiny bathroom. Still problem with the window not broken but cold air coming in .

Tv was not working with many channels blamed the wind . So no TV for 2 nights. Staff also know of the problems of this hotel & just lying to covet up . Room not to any standard really dusty .

Don‚Äôt stay here like Fawlty Towers just horrific",1,2022,02,22
104,E.A,"The hotel is in a great location. The staff were very helpful and kind, especially Xavier and Nicole. They made me feel comfortable and their service was very professional.
It was a wonderful experience.",5,2022,02,22
104,Definitely won‚Äôt be back,"Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Everything felt dirty. 
It‚Äôs such a budget hotel. 
There were hairs in the bed and bath and even stuck to the bathroom walls. 
The tv remote was dirty. 
The shower head didn‚Äôt stay above the bath and kept turning so I had to hold it when I showered. 
The staff were friendly but if I had booked for more than one night I would have checked out after one.",1,2022,02,22
104,Staff go above and beyond,"Just returned from an overnight stay here and was blown away how nice all the staff were. Especially Fenilop and Gabriella.
The bathroom was very small but very clean and modern and the bedroom was abit dated but the bed was so so comfy!",5,2022,02,20
104,Great hotel ! Friendliest Staff!,"Really nice hotel in a great location. Special mention for the staff especially Jeana and her kindness and amazing smile as well as Sacha that‚Äôs really nice. The housekeeping team is amazing too. 
Highlight of my stay was definitely the lovely staff.",5,2022,02,19
104,Park Grand London Hyde Park,Had a fantastic stay at the park grand. Clean and comfortable rooms with heated bathroom flooring. This is my second time staying at the hotel and on this occasion i booked an additional night. Excellent customer service provided by hotel reception staff Gabriela and Beatrice. Would definitely stay again.,4,2022,02,19
104,A very good experience overall,"Good beds.
Very close to transport and a good walk to paddington station. 

Xavier and beatrice were very helpful.

The only minor side about the place is the wifi, couldn't get any internet on the park grand wifi  

Close to services and restaurants",4,2022,02,17
104,Short Trip,"Very welcoming and Xavier and Sacha couldn't have been more helpful. They were polite and welcoming all through our stay. Room spacious with a view.
The hotel was very well situated to Paddington station and good restaurants. Would come back.",4,2022,02,14
104,Such A Brilliant Time,"The hotel met so many of our requirements, the room was perfect, my partner was greatly pleased to meet valentines decorations in our room. Also, the service was fantastic, an employee named Xavier was particularly helpful and made our stay memorable.",4,2022,02,13
104,Park Grand London Hyde Park,This hotel was amazing comfy beds and enough towels well decorated and polite staff very professional run i would recommend anyone visiting Central London to stay at this Hotel. I would particularly like to thank staff members by the name of Gabriela and Beatrice very polite and nice staff members thank you so much and will see you soon for a stay sometime soon.,5,2022,02,13
104,Excellent Service,My stay at the Park Grand Hotel was one of me best experiences at a hotel as of yet. Xavier and Sacha were great and accommodating and were able to assist us with any of our needs. We highly recommended this hotel.,5,2022,02,13
104,Service brilliant hotel a let down,"Really sorry to write this but it has to help others find great hotels.
This particular hotel is very classic  looking from the outside however just located outside before entering were  huge dust bins which were filled and bursting with rubbish which looked very unsightly this was an alarm bell for me .
Entering the reception desk is small and not overly updated and it was busy we had to wait in the bar area before been gestured forward to be seen.
The staff were very friendly, professional and extremely helpful we had requested an upgrade at reservation   and was told that it was granted.
We decided to leave our luggage and did not see our room as we were very early and proceed on our day.
We arrived back very late and after a slight mixup with reservation we set about going to our room on the 6th floor which we were told was superior however on entering we immediately saw a thread bare large sofa chair covered over with a throwback, the wall paper looked dirty and was stained with brown marks, the room looked very tired, the bathroom was modern.
We were not happy so went back to reception and asked to be moved which we did to another room  which looked a lot cleaner however the windows in the hall right next to our room could not close and the night was very cold and draughty.
Antonio was very helpful by turning on the heating but it was a huge dry air machine facing the bed which became very uncomfortable.
I realised on inspection that the wall paper was old fashioned paper and also gave off the appearance of been dirty although this room was not.
We had to put towels by the door to stop the awful drought coming into the room.
We requested additional toilets which was granted however some of them had Dirty marks on them and they also was very worn and tired.
Breakfast is a full plus but not grand and I have to compliment Antonio who was very attentive and very professional to everyone‚Äôs requirements.
It‚Äôs such a shame as this hotel seems to have been left behind with refurbishment and it  so needs it not sure if it‚Äôs been done as it is a large hotel.
In comparison to the Park Grand London Kensington this classic hotel was disappointing.
The staff worked extremely hard to accommodate and do this company justice",3,2022,02,11
104,Paddington trip,"Received a very warm welcome from Xavier on check in and he selected a great spacious room for me. All facilities available, big screen tv, work desk, luggage space and large powerful shower and safe for valuables",5,2022,02,10
104,Excellent service by Xavier and Gabriela,"Outstanding level of professionalism shown by both Xavier and Gabriela. Would definitely recommend over other hotels nearby for the simple reason of welcoming and friendly staff, which can be a rarity.",5,2022,02,08
104,Great place,"Great and warm welcome from staff, room was very pleasant, the bed was super comfortable and the breakfast was 11 out of 10! Great quality produce and beautifully cooked and presented! Cannot fault!üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº",5,2022,02,07

104,‚ÄúExceptional Staff that go Above and Beyond‚Äù,"After a super stressful last minute change in temporary accomodation (between leases), the staff made my week. From helping carry in boxes and boxes of all my possessions to making sure I was settled and helping with anything I needed, the staff will really went above and beyond for you. Since I stayed for 10 nights, I got to know all the front facing staff, so this applies to absolutely everyone.

It‚Äôs rare that the staff alone are enough to make me wholeheartedly recommend a stay, but this staff was truly exceptional. Their management company is super lucky to have them and I think you should give them all a raise!",5,2022,02,06
104,Excellent stay,"Very great stay staff especially were very helpful and kind letting us leave our bags later that our check out !:) thank you for a lovely stay! Breakfast was also amazing
Thank you Beatria and Xavier especially for wonderful
Service",5,2022,02,06
104,Relaxing Weekend,"Very good service, the staff are young and ever so helpful, nothing was a problem. I recommend this hotel for a quiet stay, the room was nice and good Wi-Fi service. Nicole at reception was very helpful, courteous and informative.

Overall the complete hotel team complimented each other and worked to resolve and help with any issues.",5,2022,02,05
104,Lovely place,Amazing had such a great time! Xavier was such a lovely hostess. Very kind and helpful. He made us feel comfortable and was respectful.

104,Comfortable overnight stay,"Decent clean hotel with a good breakfast choice in a great location to get around London for a couple of days for two adults and two teenage kids. Booked 2x deluxe rooms and they suited our needs just fine. Yes the rooms are a tad ‚Äúcosy‚Äú and the bathroom‚Äôs a bit of a squeeze but for the price and for what you need for an overnight stay we‚Äôd be more than happy to stay here again.
Friendly reception staff who were always accommodating (particular praise to Nicole who went out of her way to move our rooms to be closer together on request having originally been put on ground floor and sixth floor).
Peaceful and safe area around and location  was great to get to nearby tubes (10 min easy walk to either Piccadilly or Lancaster Gate) and into the West end theatre area first night and then have a mooch around Kensington area and then easy walking distance to Hyde park the following day.
Breakfast area was very clean and staff always attentive and food choices were plenty and fresh.
All-in-all good for an overnighter or weekender for the price in a great location! Hopefully see you again soon?!",5,2022,02,02
104,Fabulous hotel!,"This hotel is very close to Paddington station and also Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations.
On the Bakerloo line, it is very easy to access all of central London.

Although the reception seems very small, the rooms are beautifully decorated with a very comfortable beds. It is clean, quiet, uncomfortable and as we asked for a twin bedroom, we were surprise to have two large double beds in the room. Although the bathroom is very small, and the towel rack is very high, it was spotlessly clean, and perfectly adequate.

There are tea and coffee making facilities in each room as well as biscuits. There are plenty of power points and a decent size TV.
The desk staff, Xavier and Sasha could not have been more helpful. We checked in early but the staff were quite happy to keep our cases for us whilst we went out for the day and to the theatre in the evening.
We would definitely stay at this venue again.

A great find near Paddington station.",5,2022,01,30
104,Stay,"What a lovely hotel! We came here for my partners birthday and I couldn't find a single fault. We were kindly greeted by Xavier who was very friendly and welcoming (as were all the staff)
Our room was beautiful! We had a deo",5,2022,01,28
104,Rescued Trip away,"Booked a different hotel for my 12 year old son and I but when we attended it was horrific so I left and looked on booking.com what was available and local to where we were. This popped up so I booked ( I was in tears at this point after a 5 hour drive and a worried looking 12 year old).
Walked into this hotel and was so so pleased. Greeted by welcoming receptionists. When I booked in she upgraded our room. Complimentary water, tea and biscuits.
My son said the beds were the comfiest he has ever slept in. The room was so quiet and spotlessly clean.
Thank you so so much for rescuing our London trip !! We will return..",5,2022,01,25
104,Great stay,"Very good hotel. Third time in this hotel. Very kind receptionist Beatrice and Xavier. Grazie a Beatrice per suo aiuto. I asked to to change my room and this was easily done.

104,Exceptional hotel,"A great hotel, very close to Paddington station which is just a few minuets walk away. On arrival Xavier, a very welcoming reception staff member, gave me a complimentary room upgrade in which I was highly impressed with. The price of the hotel  beat all others in the area. Thanks I will be sure to check this place out when I‚Äôm next in the city.",5,2022,01,22
104,Great service from Valan,Had a lovely stay at the hotel and really appreciated the great service offered by Valan. He went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was enjoyable! It made all the difference. I would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to london,5,2022,01,21

We had a problem with the heating in the room which was quickly resolved.

Overall a very nice stay.",4,2022,01,21

104,Park grand Hotel Hyde Park,Brilliant stay. Outstanding room and the breakfast was amazing. Would definitely come back again. The only down side to it was the heaters which weren't working. Other than that it was a Brilliant stay,4,2022,01,18

104,Fantastic staff make this hotel,"The staff really make this hotel, nothing was too much trouble. Room was spotless and comfy. We asked to check in early which was not a problem and they looked after our shopping bags after checkout. Location of this hotel is great just a short walk from the station and was nice and quiet at night. We will be returning!",5,2022,01,16
104,Holloway of a time,"Alexandru was great n lovely, he let us order a pizza at 4am.
Hotel clean; lovely size.
Great location 
Paddington is a good place for the tube and away from the city centre also not too much for an Uber.",5,2022,01,15
104,"Great location, helpful staff and good value for money","Excellent location to Paddington. Very helpful staff and a room upgrade on arrival. Particularly good breakfast and good value for money overall.

Heating in room did not work, only blew out cold air but as we were only staying for one night it was not a particular issue but would have raised it if we had stayed for longer.",4,2022,01,09
104,Hotel,"Everything was perfect l.Great value and very nice rooms. Jeana was very helpful as all the staff.
The rooms very clean and comfortable and perfect location just 5 min from the underground. Close to all the famous attractions.",5,2022,01,04
104,Emergency stay,"Found this place last minute due to needing emergency accommodation, as daughter in st. Mary‚Äôs hospital!! Shirley was very helpful from the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble and even gave us a upgrade!! A credit to the company!! Great spacious room with lots of coffee/tea/biscuits!! Bathroom great with walk in shower no bath!! Breakfast choice fantastic cereal/yogurts&fruit/ toast /croissants/pastries/full English!! Great value at just under ¬£100 for a deluxe double room breakfast and parking! Yes breakfast and parking us separately room price but great value in my opinion!!",5,2022,01,04
104,Excellent value; even better location.,We really enjoyed our stayed in the park grand. Excellent location - less than 5 mins walk to Paddington station. Staff were pleasant and friendly. Room was satisfactory and fit for purpose. Will return.!,4,2022,01,03
104,Disappointing,"Stayed in this small boutique hotel for two nights between Christmas and New Year2021.

Unfortunately not a good experience, which is sad considering its great location to the west end, Mayfair and Paddington station with easy access to Heathrow airport using the express train services  this would be a good place to stay. If only.

During the booking process I requested a quiet room as I am generally a light sleeper.

Needless to say I was placed in room 1 04 which is on the first floor near a swinging fire door.

Disastrous, throughout the night it was constantly banging as people passed through on their way back from a night out.

Not ideal when you‚Äôve got meetings the following day, The rooms are very small as you would expect with a double bed just about fitting in, not a problem when all you want to do is get some rest.

Having a shave in the morning reminded me of being given a practical assessment at sandhurst,Unless you‚Äôre a six-year-old, trying to wash your face at the sink was virtually impossible.

Sadly the standard of hygiene falls well below anyone‚Äôs expectations, and the cleanliness of bathroom towels ,and bedding well below par.

Rather than cram as many rooms as possibly  into a small building, this boutique hotel would be much better placed offering slightly larger and more spacious rooms ,a full refurbishment is most definitely needed here.

Sadly you get what you pay for lesson learnt, I most certainly would not recommend this to any of my friends as a place to stay in London",1,2021,12,30
104,Ms,Special thanks to receptionist JEANA for her hospitality. Staff was helpful and understanding.  They would take your requests seriously and perform their best to make you feel as comfortable as possible.,5,2021,12,29
104,"Location, rooms and impeccable service","Had the best time staying for almost 2 weeks at the hotel and special thanks to Jeana, Shirley and Felison for making the stay as memorable as they could. Location of the hotel is perfect and the staff goes above and beyond to help always. Waiting for the next visit already!",5,2021,12,29
104,Disappointing,"We originally were supposed to be staying at the Grand Royale London Hyde Park, but due to maintenance issues we were transferred to this hotel. Firstly we were not compensated for our inconvenience, and then we had to pay the room rate of the other hotel, for this hotel, which was advertised to be less ¬£¬£. Presumably due to covid, the hotel had no room service, which for us is a sign of a good hotel. The room itself was clean, but dated and probably a bit small for the three of us. None of us slept well as the constant movement of the people in the room above kept us awake, as well as the road outside being pretty noisy. 
All in all, would not stay again, and not deserving of the 4 star accreditation it apparently has.",2,2021,12,28
104,Fantastic Christmas stay,"Booked for Christmas day and having booked and stayed here before we were so glad it had reopened after being closed due to the pandemic.

We arrived Christmas day and were given a duplex suite, room 123, bedroom downstairs and sitting room and kitchen area upstairs. The room has a massive bed and massive window. We were glad to see coffee and tea facilities still available with a fridge and microwave too. Also amazed that the room was cleaned daily as during covid times this has been lacking in other hotels we have stayed in. 

The room was clean as was the bathroom with complimentary shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, did miss the bath robes though.

This hotel is located 10 mins from Paddington Station and 15 mins from Oxford Street and Hyde Park corner. We love the fact we can park outside.

The breakfast is still as good as before they were closed and the restaurant staff are very attentive.

The staff have changed since reopening, but the new staff were friendly and helpful and we hope to get to know them as well as we knew the staff pre pandemic.

Thanks Park Grand Hyde Park. See you again soon. ",5,2021,12,27
104,Stay at Park Grand Hyde Park,"There were a few things that made our stay not as nice as we‚Äôd liked. Firstly, in the room we were staying in (115)in  the room above us, there was constant movement in the first night of our stay, all we could hear was creaking and coughing all night. The guests in that room were moving a lot and we could hear this very clearly including their tv. This was throughout the whole night, and made our sleep very uncomfortable. This continued into the second night although wasn‚Äôt as loud. 

Secondly, in the second day of our stay, as we were going up to the room we were asked about our room number by one of the receptionists/ managers loudly in front of the entire lobby, as we then went to the room the card key did not work resulting in myself having to go down to the reception and get a new one. (I am unsure if this was related to the receptionist asking us about our room number when we had come back for a break during our stay).",3,2021,12,25
104,Good hotel,"Location: was amazing walking distance of the park
Room: was ok a bit dated and compact but clean had a fridge ironing board and iron, a safe, small closet and a rail, tea and coffee making, tv not sure about the channels as we didn‚Äôt use it, WiFi 
View: no existent
Breakfast: overpriced and not good save your money and go to a cafe 
Staff: in the main were friendly and helpful especially the housekeeper on the 6th floor who was a star always about and happy to service the room on request / stock up towels and tea coffee etc and the staff in the breakfast room who were doing their very best given it‚Äôs tiny and there was a lack of food",4,2021,12,24
104,Great customer service.,"I had issues with room cuz of being delayed with flights, covid, etc. and missed my first night. Jeana was so awesome and helped me get into another room last min when it looked like there may not be any avail. Simona, Sacha, and Veronica were all super accommodating as well, even at odd hours they were still polite, smiled, and made my stay that much nicer. Everyone i met at the bar, as well as the valet, and bellman were great as well, always willing to go out of their way to help. I met severa members of this staff, but Georgi, Valan, and Daniel were the guys i saw the most. All around the staff were great. Thank you.",5,2021,12,22
104,"Nice hotel, very small batroom","The hotel was clean and the staff were helpful. Having said that, I have given it a 3 star review because the bathroom in our room was tiny , to the point you had to open the shower door to be able to sit on the toilet comfortably. For the nightly cost I would have expected a little bit more. ",3,2021,12,21
104,Great stay,"Only stayed a short time but would highly recommend, only thing I would suggest is to reduce the price of the parking, which seem to be a crazy amount to me, other than that, every was fantastic and everyone was helpful and friendly.",5,2021,12,20
104,Nice hotel,Great location for the winter wonderland good reception staff. Was disappointed with the room as it was tiny for two people. Would have suited a single person but too small for two. Breakfast was great.,4,2021,12,19
104,"Nice, clean and friendly","Nice clean had all facilities, but disappointed the hotel took ¬£110 out of my account before getting there and then I had to pay full amount and I'm still waiting for the ¬£110 to go back into my account other than that the staff were lovely, especially daniel",3,2021,12,13
104,Great Weekend,Hotel is situated close to Paddington Train Station so very convenient.  Arrived early so room wasn't ready but was able to leave luggage and return later. Was upgraded to a bigger room after booking a deluxe triple room and eneded up with 2 double beds. Was OK as we were all family. Room was clean and had tea and coffee making facilities a 2 bottles of water.,4,2021,12,12
104,A Christmas Disappointment,"Hi all, 

I stayed at this hotel for my first holiday with my boyfriend, due to the pandemic. We had been waiting on this trip for MONTHS. We travelled from Ireland to the UK for a 4 day trip (stayed 2 nights in the hotel).
We stayed at this hotel during the Christmas period recently. We arrived at 5pm to check-in and were served by some lovely lovely people and staff however our room completely dissatisfied us‚Ä¶ the only window in the room was a blocked-up skyline (out of reach) with no natural lighting in the bedroom. 
I was curious as to the health and safety measures of this room. As in the Ireland, you are required to have another exit in each bedroom. Secondly the lighting was depressing as this was something not discovered until the next day‚Ä¶ 
Lastly the layout of the room was very small compared to the extra ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô charged upgrade we paid for. There was barely any room to walk around the bed without catching your shins on the corners. I‚Äôm coming home with bruises from it. As you can in the pictures there was barely any room on the opposite side to move freely. We were not able to push the bed over due to the fixtures on the wall, stopping it from being moved. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel on these grounds. I‚Äôm so disappointed after all that arranging, travelling and waiting for this trip that it was ruined due to room environment. 
I‚Äôm not one to complain but the whole experience was tarnished heavily‚Ä¶ it will be a long time before we return to London, due to this‚Ä¶

I do wish to say that the staff were incredible and so lovely. The area location was also very beautiful and so close to the underground.",1,2021,12,12
104,Fifth Stay - Never Again,"What a shame‚Ä¶ this has always been our ‚Äògo to‚Äô hotel in London, and we have stayed here five times over the years. I‚Äôm sorry to say that we won‚Äôt be returning to this hotel. It has hugely gone down hill, particularly within the last 2 years. The rooms are tired and in urgent need of a refurb. 

There‚Äôs been a change of staff team since our last visit and they are no longer friendly or welcoming. The lady who checked us in had no idea what she was doing.

The worst thing for me though was the blatant uncleanliness of the room. There was mould covering the thin curtains and marks ALL OVER the shower, sink, bathroom units, beside tables and desk (all of which could have been - and should have been - simply wiped away during a standard clean of the room!).

Overall a highly disappointing stay and complete waste of money. Could have found a Premier Inn for less with higher standards of cleanliness and a better service.",1,2021,12,11
104,Hidden gem,"Absolutely lovely stay! The room was slightly dated, this does not affect your stay at all! The staff are incredible and always willing to help, the breakfast was one of the better buffet style full English breakfasts that I have had, having stayed in some of the best and some of the worst hotels out there this falls very much into the better side of the scale! Very well priced for what you get, would highly recommend. Also very conveniently located for transport if needed.",5,2021,12,11
104,Awful experience,"Myself and partner booked to stay here for a few nights for our honeymoon. Not an experience I would want to repeat!
The hotel aren‚Äôt helpful at all, we booked on booking.com and they took a pre authorisation on the card which a week later I still haven‚Äôt had back!
We also had to leave early due to our little girl having Covid but despite numerous attempts to call the reservation team and email them, it seems nobody wants to respond to our request of a refund for the dates we weren‚Äôt there. Very unhappy with the lack of customer service, I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life!
Do not travel here!",1,2021,12,11
104,Quality of Hotel,"The service from all staff whatever time of day is always helpful and pleasantly given.
The room is always clean and facilities are generous. The rooms for solo are a little small, but this is reflected in the price. Larger rooms are always available
 The location to Paddington station is very close as is Kensington gardens and other places of interest. Jeana on reception has time for you as do all her colleagues all are friendly. This was my second visit and would have been more except for COVID. I look forward to visiting again next summer.",5,2021,12,10
104,Ms Diane Randall,"We had a very nice stay our room was very nice and comfy bed and spotlessy clean , all the staff where very polite and friendly, the only issue we had was with the heating was not very good but the staff where very helpful with getting it put right  ..

104,AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID Cancelled 12 hours before arrival without notice,"Booked the hotel for a weekend in late November. 

Was asked twice to put in card details using the booking.com app. When this was rejected for the second time, the property automatically cancelled the booking a mere 12 hours before we were due to arrive

They didn‚Äôt phone to confirm my card details, and I sat on hold for 2 hours to speak to the hotel and didn‚Äôt get through. I have still not received any correspondence from them.

3 days have passed and after several emails and calls I have not received a response or an explanation. I had to book a different hotel at great expense

It‚Äôs a 0/10 from me",1,2021,11,29

104,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location,"Fantastic location, staff really well trained in customer service, clean, comfortable room and great breakfast.  We initially booked for 2 nights, our room was very small with no view whatsoever, but well equipped, clean and comfortable. We decided to stay another night so I spoke to Veronica on reception and she organised a much bigger room for us.  I have to say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in for a long time and I would definitely recommend it to family and friends.  Hopefully we will be visiting again soon.",5,2021,11,24
104,Overnight Stay,"Amazing Place Great value amazing staff thank you Mark Rose ..

104,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend - final alternative arrangements.,"We were advised on check in we had been upgraded which was a lovely and unexpected gesture.
Many issues with the room however, shower didn‚Äôt have any hot water, suspect looking stains on the bathroom wall and the large balcony door didn‚Äôt close properly. 
As you can imagine during a November night it was freezing!!! 

Would not recommend this hotel.",1,2021,11,24

104,H,"Mr. Valan is an excellent in charge person, very accommodating manager, top service. 

However, the other staff named Giada unfortunately uses unprofessional way with dealing with customers and rough attitude, pushing customers away, lose hotel business in such a competitive service sector. 

Mironella is of an excellent service and top customer service style. 
thank you",5,2021,11,22
104,Nice hotel,"Visited with my son. Staff very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Room very clean, a little on the small side, but really what I expected from the pictures I‚Äôd seen. Nice area and out of the huddle and bustle, but still central enough with easy access to 2 tube stations. Would definitely stay again.",5,2021,11,22
104,Very nice stay,"Excellent position for Hyde Park and transport in London would recommend,  staff extremely helpful and effcient our friends also thought all facilities were good with excellent breakfast choice and quality, Well done Park Grand x",5,2021,11,22
104,Awful stay would not recommend ,"We stayed here to visit winter wonderland and the hotel was disgusting. Dirty room that looked like it had not been hoovered with no view. Sticky remote for the TV which should be sanitised let alone cleaned in the current climate. We saw every hour during the night for noise of the creaky lift and both neighbours having the TV on (in their own right). When we spoke to Valem who I assume was the manager but didn‚Äôt introduce himself as one at the reception the following morning to express our disappointment who said ‚ÄòI know it‚Äôs a problem I have to tell people to turn down their TV if you rang I could of told them to‚Äô which seemed to be his only solution. 
We stay in a lot of hotels, some for convenience, some for luxury and this is neither.  
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",1,2021,11,22
104,Great stay!,"Traveled to London and stayed solo at Park grand Hyde park hotel. This is a great place to stay! Good price, very friendly stuff (especially Valan and Anthony), clean room and great location. Overall, great experience!",5,2021,11,21

104,Amazing!,"We are definitely staying here again! Paddington station is 5 mins walk, loads of restaurants nearby and very friendly staff!

Highly recommend!",5,2021,11,19
104,Great boutique hotel,"Quaint hotel. Just the basics, and the internet is a bit shotty. But great staff and one in particular helped me out after a miscommunication with booking.com and there reservations team. I‚Äôd suggest to book directly through their site. And the manager Avalan was a big help in sorting me out and making sure my stay was perfect.",4,2021,11,19
104,One of the best stays ever!,"So where do I start! I was staying at park grand London Hyde park hotel due to being in London for a press event! The moment I arrived I was welcomed extremely well by the receptionist and was looked after by Giada very well.  

The room was stunning and so comfortable to stay in with everything that I needed. Even late at night I asked for a sewing kit and Giada and her amazing team sourced it for me which really saved my partners outfit so thankyou!! 

I would highly recommend staying here for business and pleasure as honestly it‚Äôs my new hotel for when I‚Äôm in London on business! 

Thankyou again Giada and your team for looking after me spectacularly!. 

I look forward to returning in the near future:)

104,Weekend stay,Fantastic hotel great friendly staff perfect location to go anywhere in London not far from the underground or trainstation. We stayed as a couple for a birthday weekend but will definitely return with our children. Breakfast is really nice too :) 5*,5,2021,11,14
104,The grand Park Hotel,"Really dissapointed with this stay. I booked the grand Park Hotel through booking.com. we were visiting London for my sons birthday. When we arrived at the hotel it was shut down for renovations. We were then sent to a sister hotel by one of the workers carryingout the renovations. When we arrived there they sent us to another hotel. We had to go through three hotels to finally get a room, which took up a lot of our time as we were only staying one night and with two young children it was exhausting. When we arrived at the third hotel I was very disappointed. The room was very basic for the money we paid there was no facilities no restaurant for dinner. Beds were uncomfortable and dated. Really ruined our trip as it was not what we booked or paid for. I don't know why they are advertising on booking.com when the hotel is shut down. We would have cancelled and booked another hotel with facilities if we knew this.",1,2021,11,14
104,I prefer other kind of hotels,"My stay was booked for two nights. Personally I don‚Äòt like these kind of very british hotels. Staff was friendly, no doubt, but it‚Äòs just the interior I‚Äòm judging about. After check-in it all starts with an elevator that is far too small to use with luggage. Arrived on the assigned floor you are in a far too narrow aisle to find your room. After you open the door of your room you have a musty stale smell in your nose. Honestly I expected a tiny little chamber, but I must confess, that room size was ok considering that I was in London. Unfortunately everywhere, except the bathroom, there was an old wooden floor, which creaked with every single step. This was quite annoying. Apparently the ceiling was wooden made as well and at the same time the floor for other guests. You especially could hear this in the morning, when there came down a consistently and long lasting noise for about an hour or so, what ever there happened in this room. It sounds like the bed was moving.  Generally some parts of the interior were renovated, some like the desk outdated and old. There was no minibar in the room, just an empty space for it. And I was missing a hairdryer in the bathroom. They gave me the room facing the backyard and not the street, which means no traffic noise at least.",2,2021,11,10
104,Jane & Lee,"Just back from stopping at Park Grand London Hyde Park,  room clean, staff extremely friendly & helpful, great location close to Paddington underground & restaurants, would definitely stop again, special thanks to Giada at reception who was so lovely & couldn't do enough to make sure we had a good stay.",5,2021,11,09
104,Great overnight stay in clean and comfortable hotel,"This is a great place to stay for an overnight in London. 
The room was clean, the bed was large and comfy, the en-suite shower was warm and quite powerful. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room, also bottled water. There was a good choice of different types of breakfast. The hotel is a short walk from Paddington station and Hyde Park.
All the staff are very helpful and friendly, but especially Jeana and Veronica  on reception. 
Next time we come to London overnight we will stay here again. 
Thank you",5,2021,11,07
104,Mr Mo,This hotel had very friendly and welcoming staff. Ask for Veronica at reception she will take care of you during your stay 100%. I recommend this place for those coming into London for a couple days to enjoy,5,2021,11,04
104,Great Service from Mr Valan,"Really happy with the visit. Met a guy at the reception Mr Valan, he was very generous and very kind. Gave me an upgrade of the room aswell from a double deluxe to a king deluxe room. Really happy overall.",5,2021,11,03
104,Great service levels,A well located hotel near to Paddington Station. Room size as you would expect in London. The service levels from the staff were first class with a friendly team ready to assist at any time of day or night!,5,2021,11,03
104,Short notice booking,"We were stranded and needed a place to stay - hotel grand to the rescue!
The service was faultless and the bed so comfy
- my partner has long Covid and was in a lot of pain, so having such a warm and caring welcome meant a lot.
The breakfast was worth every Penny too. Would recommend the Hotel. Special thanks to Simona
and the Porter (didn‚Äôt catch his name, sorry) as he sorted our remote batteries!
Thank you once again.
Helen",5,2021,11,01
104,Wonderful service,"From the minute we walked through the door after booking half an hour previously due to train issues, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service. 
Nothing was too much trouble for Simona the receptionist and we were upgraded into a very clean and comfortable room. 
Breakfast was well worth the money and again service was impeccable. 
I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this beautiful hotel and would welcome the opportunity to stay here again.",5,2021,11,01

104,Great reception area,"The reception space is the best thing about the hotel as its the only area that felt like a boutique hotel. We had problems with them cancelling our room on us when we were 5 mins away,putting us in a room for 4 when we had booked a deluxe double(more beds does not equate to being deluxe),the hit water didt work in this room so we had to be moved. The room we were moved to was very shabby,old wallpaper/paint with marks and scuffs all over,curtains that looked like they were from the 80's,and the heating did not work. They offered a 3rd room but it was 2 single beds and still shabby,so we stuck with the cold room. Managment just smiled alot and told us to wait 5 mins every time we asked about a refund ect.
We were offered a stay in the same hotel but refused after the experience we had had,we said we wld accept one at another property and we were just smiled at and told no i cant do that,asked about a refund,got the same response. 
We asked for a number we could call and complain,he gave us the number of the reception desk at the hotel we stayed at! 
Make sure you know what room you are getting if you stay here and pay in advance incase they decide to cancel your room when you're in the way there!",2,2021,10,25
104,2 night stay in London,Absolutely lovely hotel. We came to London for my 30th and had the best. We arrived in the morning and were given an amazing room with a city view. Jeana was absolutely wonderful and went the extra mile for us to make sure everything was perfect for us. The whole hotel staff were all welcoming and couldn‚Äôt do enough. The location was really close walk to Paddington and the breakfast had a wide range of options. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again.,5,2021,10,24
104,"Poor services from jeana, very rude 

Thank u Veronica for assisting us","I been in this hotel for several times, I came back after 2 years. Everything has change even the costumer services, since I arrive at the hotel a Indian lady was on the call and she were quite rude with an ironic smile, I asked her for a room ready but she said that she need to speak with her manager, my partner asked for a bottle of wine to be delivered into the room but she said that I have to go into the bar my self. 

After I left she turning laugh, and no explanations enough ! 

I will never come at this hotel again 

Room was ok, but the cleaning was horrible and another lady named Veronica she was ok when I explained her the situation with her colleague ! 

The manager needs to provide a good trainer for their staff. 

That‚Äôs a shame of this place hotel. 

Not recommend!",2,2021,10,22
104,Amazing service!,"Many thanks for Jeana and her team, who made the stay very memorable and comfortable.  Jeana was highly attentive for our needs and very friendly throughout our stay.  Thanks to her and her team, we would happily book again and recommend this hotel.",5,2021,10,20

Good location clean and tidy rooms close to lots of restaurant and pubs",5,2021,10,15
104,Very good and excellent service,A very good and excellent service at the Recepition by jeana. Really good hotel. 24 hours Recepition service. Their food is just mind blowing. Inshort a very nice and relaxing stay. Should definitely visit.,5,2021,10,15
104,Very good hotel,"Had a very good stay at the hotel. Hotel staff were very friendly specially Jeana, Steve, Antonio. Thank you all for the lovely stay  The rooms are very spacious   The area around is very easy to access. Paddington station is the closest. Thank you once again.",5,2021,10,07
104,Unapologetic,Received an email moving us to Hyde Park. We had booked Paddington as are out on an excursion 7.45am Sunday. As we are ladies of a certain age we now find ourselves away from public transport. Asked the hotel to fund a cab. Their answer was NO!!!!,1,2021,09,12
104,Horrendous trip. AVOID,"Never never never book this hotel. You will book and they move you to 3 different hotels. I arrived at 1am after 3 miles of walking.

No call to tell me they had randomly changed my hotel.

Avoid at all costs!!!!",1,2021,07,07
104,No refunds inpite of trip being cancelled due to Covid 19,"I have tried multiple times to get a refund due to our trip being cancelled due to Covid19 and while the hotel tells me that ""they have forwarded my email"" to higher management I have not heard back.  To me this was a great deal of money to lose in addition to the disappointment of our trip being cancelled.  I have been trying since June 2000 to get any kind of refund.",1,2021,06,10
104,"VOID THIS HOTEL LIKE THE PLAGUE - Disgraceful hotel, refuses to refund money due to pandemic","We contacted them since April 2020 üò°

We spent 1.5 hours on the phone waiting for them to take our call from Australia on the number they said to ring the hotel told us we had to prove why we couldn‚Äôt come so we sent them the Australian government ban on Australians leaving the country.
No response, no refund despite endlessly sending emails.

We look forward to facing them at their reception when this crisis is over. I will also ask my friends in the UK to tell us which consumers affairs department is best to contact.

We will not stop till we get a full refund no matter how long it takes ",1,2021,04,06
104,CAUTION - The Park Grand London Hyde Park is closed,"This is a heads up to other travellers - I booked this room through Tripadvisors price comparison tool which sent me to Agoda and the hotel was listed as open as it was everywhere else. I received a confirmation email and a booking number, on my way down to London I decided to phone ahead to check when the latest was that I could check in - no answer from reception after 7 attempts, I called three sister hotels - no answers there. 

When I arrived I found the hotel was shutand a letter on the front door stated it was closed for renovation and that I should go round the corner to the Chilworth Hotel as all bookings for Park Grand London Hyde Park had been moved there. This was not mentioned anywhere prior to booking nor in email confirmation. On arrival at the Chilworth I was told there was no booking, I showed them my booking confirmation and asked what was available but I was told there were no rooms free and I would need to look elsewhere leaving me without a hotel. I ended up paying a premium after an hour searching past midnight to stay at a different hotel. At 2:00am I received a cancellation email from Agoda for my booking at the Park Grand London Hyde Park stating the deluxe double room I had originally booked at the hotel that wasn't even open for business was non-refundable.

No help was given by the Chilworth staff to find alternative accommodation for me.

To summarise - the Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel is closed for the forseeable future, bookings will be accepted and they will take your money, but you will end up rebooking on arrival at your own expense. AVOID.",1,2020,09,11
104,WARNING,"I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel through last minute.com, due to work I had to change my booking dates. The reservation department at the hotel told me that everything had been amended and that they would be expecting us on the new dates. When we arrived they told us that they had to take ¬£50 deposit for any expenses/ damages (understandably). Monday morning my boyfriend has checked his bank account, the hotel have taken nearly ¬£500 from him to pay for the 2 nights without telling us. THIS IS THEFT! I am absolutely disgusted with their actions and to top it off they‚Äôre telling us that there are no managers in and so it can‚Äôt be dealt with until next week. My boyfriend and I are 19 and I find it funny that when a grown adult gets involved to sort this disgraceful action out they begin to sort it out and a manager magically apears. 

I wish there was an option to give a 0 star review. DO NOT GO HERE IT IS A SCAM.",1,2020,09,10
104,profiteering!!!!,"Hotel unwilling to make changes to booking until after 4 attempts when I sent them another Hotels Corvid 19 announcement offering amended dates to guests.
Then offered goodwill gesture of new date within 4 months but to make a decision within 24 hours. Also stated would higher tariff if we chose late July. who knows where we will be in July. 
Hotel is still offering rooms for March dates with no announcement on Corvid. Makes a mockery of their customer care policy. Purely trying to make money out of a pandemic situation.

104,Perfect weekend away,Had an amazing stay at Park Grand Hotel with my partner. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist who was attentive and efficient. The gentleman out the front parked our car and we checked into our room. The room was fairly small but beautiful and spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. We visited the downstairs bar several times to order some refreshing beverages before heading out to the theatre. We look forward to returning. Thank you for a fabulous stay!,5,2020,07,28
104,Would definitely visit again!,"A fantastic hotel, easy to find and not too far from a station making travel around London quite easy. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Staff are very friendly and breakfast was delicious and a great selection to choose from.",5,2020,04,23
104,Good location,"Very good location, close to Paddington station and Hyde Park. Friendly staff, Joseph and Sergi were very pleasant and efficient. Room was too small but ok for 2 nights. Although there were 2 beds, one of them has not been cleaned. Good shower.",3,2020,04,05
104,Fine for business in town,"Small rooms but affordable and smack in the middle of Paddington. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean. Breakfast was Spartan as is every breakfast in a London hotel. 
Claudia and Daniela were especially helpful.",3,2020,03,23
104,Excellent Staff!!,Nice hotel and ideal for a family. We stayed here for 2 days. Staff was really nice. I really wish to refer to two people here. First is the person at the bar MAX. He helped us alot in our two day stay. He is a very polite and helpful person. He went out of the way to help us and to make our stay comfortable. Full marks for his dedication to work. I also wish to refer Joseph at the reception and a lady from Argentina who also works at the reception. She helped us alot while selecting the destinations we should visit during our stay. Full marks to this hotel.,5,2020,03,16
104,Excellent Service :),"Although the hotel is just nice, I loved my stay here thanks to the amazing staff which made me feel extremely welcome. CLAUDIA in particular was very useful, and patient as I had some difficulties with my booking, nonetheless she was extremely friendly and a pleasure to talk to. 
Also I recently needed a copy of my receipt again and she was kind enough to stay over the phone with me until I have received it. 
Service makes this places look a million times better than when I walked in, I would certainly stay there again.",5,2020,03,09
104,Overnight stay for a visit to The Albert Hall,"Nice Hotel and ideal for us. To be fair room was a little tired and the towels were not the best. However, staff were lovely, breakfast was good and it was good value for money. Would happily stay again.",4,2020,03,08
104,Great experience.,Excellent attention from all the staff. The room was clean and comfortable. It was a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is convenient for transport and and all amenities. A great Base for sightseeing. Well worth it.,5,2020,03,08
104,Great stay,"The staff were so helpful, friendly and always had a smile, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel itself is in a good location, it‚Äôs about a 10/15 minute walk from Paddington station. Check in was simple and easy.
I had a single room, the room was small, BUT............ it was impeccably clean, it had an amazing shower cubicle and a comfy bed (single), it had everything I wanted so the size wasn‚Äôt a problem. The room has tea making facilities and a plate of fruit on my arrival which was a lovely touch, the room also has a safety deposit box.
If I had to write one slight issue was that I could hear every word the room next door was saying if they were talking or if their TV was on, but it didn‚Äôt spoil my stay.
I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat and would highly recommend it.",5,2020,03,08

104,Lovely hotel,I really feel I got a great deal at this hotel for a 3 night stay. Lovely hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable. Excellent location for Paddington station and Kensington gardens. Only downside was the air conditioning unit was outside our window. It was noisy but not enough to keep us awake. The staff were friendly welcoming you back whenever you returned. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2020,03,02
104,70 birthday stay,"We enjoyed excellent personal service from Jeana who kindly left a birthday card and my husband's favourite wine in our (upgraded) room for his 70 birthday. Claudia and Max in reception also made us feel very special with complimentary hot drinks in reception before we set out for a day in the nearby museums. They asked about our day when we returned and were extremely attentive. Our upgraded room was spotless, as was the rest of the hotel. We used Wowchers for this short break and were made to feel like royalty.",5,2020,03,01
104,Storm kiera,"I had booked 2 overnights at this hotel only to turn up at Glasgow central station to be told the trains would be running half speed for safety due to the storm , we all took this in good part but after waiting for many hours we were told it was too dangerous so all trains and coaches were cancelled. I phoned the hotel to let them know ASAP in case they could let out our room for stranded people in London. I phoned to rebook on the Monday to be told my booking was redeemed  which meant I had lost our 2 nights at the hotel ,even though we couldn‚Äôt travel until Monday evening ( no point at all) I find this dreadful in every conceivable way. When I spoke to one operator he said , that is why you have insurance Madam ! Then to be told I could book again , pay again and they would welcome me!!!! This beggars belief.  With all the hotels in the capital I would definitely not ever consider staying at this hotel chain.",1,2020,02,29

104,Amazing Hotel & Best Staff in the heart of London!,"To be honest, after I read the negative reviews I was expecting to have just troubles, be annoyed, etc. As is always happens in Hotels - you receive worse than in you would expect.
I was actually more than surprised to realize that just based on my feeling and intuition I did pick this Hotel and right now my opinion is that I couldn't have chose better.

To be so close to the center, having transport at disposal; and counting the price I would pay for this ""normally expensive zone in London"";I must say - I am impressed!

So, to begin;
I traveled in different kind of hotels (mostly 4-5 stars) in many many countries in our beautiful world but never met some staff like in this hotel. EVER. The thing with it is the fact that you can't possible find ONE SINGLE ISSUE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY OF THEM. I believe that this is the biggest strength of this hotel: the staff at the Reception, Bar, Cleaning.

So impressed to see that the every each person here is amazing and really care about the customer. You don't see this even in 5 stars in prestigious countries such as Singapore, US, South America or other EU countries.And if you do see - is just because you pay big bucks for it. BUT IS NOT A REAL THING.
Here,
I was actually surprised to find all this out  and guess what?! Its made me to finally find ""My Hotel in London! :
*Location - check!
*City Center - check!
*Good people around - check!
*Flexibility and things to do around - check!
***STAFF- ABSOLUTELY NUMBER ONE! (I don't know who train all these people here but they all are amazing)

However, I would like to offer special thanks to:
Claudia (reception)
Jeana (reception), 
Max (bar);
and to the 2 Romanian ladies (cleaning)that were very fast and responsive to my needs.
Also, the trainees working in the hotel at the moment are just great!

What can I say?!
I traveled over 25 countries, spend MANY MANY hours in Hotels and if I would pick a ""number one in London"" - this is my choice.

NOTE:
My special thanks to Claudia. In my opinion this young lady has a huge huge potential in Hotelier. Staying close to elevator I hear how she speaks to the customer, her behavior,  saw her presence and smile - just amazing! If all of us would have people like her in our businesses we would all be Billionaires.

I would also like to thank the sweet Jeana, the Indian lady which is such a wonder...! :-) A smile for you Jeana!

Thank you guys for everything and see you soon.
Really exceptional service!

Niky Achivei - Germany",5,2020,02,22

104,"Not 4 stars, but not bad","This was advertised as a 4-star hotel, but it was not nearly at that level. The best part was the staff, who worked hard to meet guest needs. The worst part is that the three rooms they offered me had maintenance issues. The first room (018) was hot like a sauna, a bit dirty, and had cuts all over the shower floor. I declined it and took the second room (609) offered. Unfortunately it had a bed with a huge sunken spot in the middle of the mattress, resulting in a horrible night's sleep. I asked the next day for a new mattress or another room, preferrably bigger. I was given a slightly bigger room (203). It was better but still not 4-star quality. The window wouldn't stay closed, had peeling wallpaper and was missing a face on the phone. All three rooms did have a coffee service and clean sheets. Breakfast was adequate. It's located on a quiet street a quick walk to Paddington. I recommend this place for budget-minded travelers who don't mind the rough edges.",3,2020,01,23
104,A deal or not? ,"Booked a girly weekend through wowcher. Which as part of the deal stated we were to be treated to a bottle of prosecco to share. After a lovely day/evening exploring we were eager to get back and share our ‚Äòbottle‚Äô of prosecco. I‚Äôm not sure who was more embarrassed us or the bar man when he produced a single serving bottle to share. The hotel otherwise was ok, the bar staff do their best but the manager on duty however wasn‚Äôt to helpful. ",3,2020,01,23
104,Lovely staff,"I had a great time in London and the Staff at Grand Park were exceptional, went beyond the call of duty to assist me when I got to the hotel earlier than check in time plus they allow to stay in your room longer before they clean the room.

104,NYE London 2019 with family,"Our family of 8 had other accommodation cancelled on us at the last minute (Airbnb), so we chose this hotel primarily due to location, availability given it was New Years Eve and the bed configurations available for our large group.
Subsequently we booked four rooms, all of which were extremely different. Some much larger than others and two very, very small rooms.
Whilst it is a boutique, old style hotel that feels like a rabbit warren; the facilities were average in my opinion.
The walls were paper thin, and the noise from the flooring above was very loud.
Noise was quiet echoey in your room from nearby rooms. Especially if your next door guests were active in the night!
Given the four rooms were so very different; it‚Äôs difficult to review the property overall.
However, if you‚Äôre looking for space in your room, you‚Äôre likely not to get it. The bathrooms are cramped for space and have no power points for hairdryers etc.
The lighting in the rooms was also average.
The only real space you have is on your bed. Even then you‚Äôll probably trip on your luggage to get up to go to the bathroom.
The staff member at check in was quiet rude and dismissive.
The doorman was delightful and very friendly.
We didn‚Äôt eat breakfast here, as an all day breakfast restaurant was just around the corner.
The location was ok. I cannot compare to anything else as it was my first stay in London.
Would I stay here again; probably not.",3,2020,01,12

104,Good staff but terrible manager,"I certainly had a very good stay at this hotel except the hefty price I had to pay . I agree the location is truly convenient for doing touristic things in London and also to travel to Heathrow via express train from paddington station . Rooms are very outdated and seriously need an urgent care and price is simply unjustified .  I was not happy to pay but had no choice. All staff are humble and sweet EXCEPT THEIR MANAGERESS( SARA ) . I can‚Äôt understand how she‚Äôs manager ???How a manager has such harsh attitude towards their customers?? It‚Äôs a hotel but more like a motel ??? And they are actually advertising as a 4**** on Trivago !!!!! 
Seriously???????
I was just  waiting to be served to those sweet people who was addressing a complaint to a hotel manager .... listening to that conversation actually made me sick üò∑. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs knows how deal with complaint or customers??? I don‚Äôt believe she understands the nature of hotel trademark??? In simple words it was actually SHOCKING.....
I would never put my foot again in this hotel knowing that how they dealt with customers complaint . It just not right .

104,Could have been cleaner.,"Liked  ¬∑ Very close to Hyde Park and Paddington Station so great location, comfy beds, fab cooked breakfast and lovely staff
.
Disliked  - After waiting 45mins after checkin time for our room to be ready, our first room was not what we‚Äôd booked and had to ask to be changed to the correct room. This took a further 30mins. This room needed a good dust and was really hot. The bathroom didn‚Äôt  have much room to manoeuvre either with the toilet being right next to the shower. A late check out was pre-arranged and confirmed but was not honoured by the hotel at the end of the stay. Definitely not a four star hotel.",4,2019,12,29
104,Good hotel but must complain,"Spent 2 nights here.  Reasonable rate with central location with a short walk from Paddington.  My room was small but comfortable so not an issue.  Unfortunately, impossible to get a good night‚Äôs rest getting woken twice in a row at 2:30 am by inconsiderate neighbours with shenanigans lasting well past 4am on the first night.  Complained to reception and asked to change rooms after the first night‚Äôs debacle but was assured the next room‚Äôs occupants had moved on.  Frustratingly pretty much the same thing the following night. Sorry but the hotel could have done more.  Two strikes in a row -not impressed!",2,2019,12,28
104,Rough round the edges but lovely staff,We stayed in a family room. Very tired hotel but the staff are lovely and go out of their way. Breakfast was hot - which is surprising for a breakfast buffet and made a lovely change. Room was hot and not easy to cool.,3,2019,12,27
104,üëå,Very good people working here.  Good room and fine bed. Paddington station is not far walking from the hotel. From the station you can take the tube 5 min to picadilly circus. London is a very beautyfull city.,5,2019,12,24
104,Citytrip,"For the second time here in Park Grand Londen Hyde Park , The Reception staff was very friendly and very nice dafin and dorina they rembered us instandly that was very nice , the rooms was clean and comfortable and near by the Paddington station, you will see us again .
Thanks

Great team",5,2019,12,24
104,A fabulous hotel,"The hotel and everything about it was marvellous.  The location was superb, the hotel has been recently renovated to a very high standard.  Our room on the first floor was perfect, it had everything we needed and the bed was so very comfortable.  Most importantly the staff were, professional, helpful, friendly and welcoming.  In no particular order, a massive thank you to the girls on reception Claudia and Dorina, the barman Dafin and last but not least the bell boy, Sergio all the way from sunny Majorca.  We will definitely be back.",5,2019,12,23
104,Old hotel,"We have just stayed there for two nights and would never stay again. A really grotty hotel, small rooms, old furniture and a bathroom you can just about turn around in. Peeling paint, dirty shower and the 15GBP breakfast is an absolute rip-off not at all a good look for a London hotel. The floor boards creek and you can hear everything from the rooms above and below. Only one lift which is very slow and small.",2,2019,12,21
104,"Grotty room, cramped and smelly","I used a wowcher deal so didn‚Äôt have high expectations but the stay was terrible. We were on the 7th floor (top) and the lift only went to the 6th so had to drag the cases up stairs. The room was tiny and very run down, the floor boards were ultra creaky, leather sofa had seen better days. Just after 10.00pm I heard vermin scratching about in the roof space. The bathroom was so small you couldn‚Äôt move in it, nowhere to put any toiletries and the shower was so small you couldn‚Äôt turn around. The towels were tiny and like sandpaper on your skin. 

We normally stay at the Hilton down the road but thought we would try somewhere different. Wish we hadn‚Äôt bothered, will never return.",1,2019,12,20
104,Very quiet for good sleeping,It's always a pleasure to stay at this hotel. The service is always very good. Everyone was very helpful. Clean and overall no major complaints. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet for good sleeping.,5,2019,12,16
104,Special Birthday Treat,With the date we wanted we knew we would struggle to find availability for last weekend but finally found the Park Grand Hyde Park. From booking on line to checking out on Sunday we were treated as though we were Royalty. The trip was for my wifes 60th birthday and the hotel staff made our weekend one to remember from the Rose petal Heart on the bed to the fresh fruit and drinks nothing was too much trouble.The breakfast was superb and the staff again were 1st class. We cant wait to visit again you will be our first choice. Every member of staff we met greated us with a smile and the warmest of welcomes.Thank you.,5,2019,12,16
104,Excellent stay,"The hotel was great value at ¬£114 for one night plus breakfast. What impressed me most were the staff - all very friendly and helpful, probably the best I've encountered anywhere. Room was good and facilities excellent.",5,2019,12,15
104,Thought it would be much better for the price,"We had 4 adults in our room.  Cost us $500 for the night.
This is not a 4 or 5 star hotel.  Its been knocked around and you can see by the room that things have been there for a long time.  Bathroom was clean but old.
We could hear people walking around on the floor above us early in the morning.
When we told them at the front desk they said they would try to fix it.  ?????  How?????
Breakfast room is old but clean.  You might be paying Hilton prices but you dont get the Hilton experience.  I",2,2019,12,13
104,Excellent customer service,"I stayed one night here and I had a great experience. Check in was easy, breakfast was good, room was nice. Above all, the staff (especially Julian) were incredibly helpful! Thanks to all of them and would definitely recommend.",5,2019,12,12
104,Wonderful Experience,"I recently stayed at the Park Grand on Westbourne Terrace. The room was good and clean but more importantly, the staff were fantastic. The manager-Sara Pilar was amazing and made my stay memorable. I recommend this hotel anytime, any day!",5,2019,12,10
104,Brilliant service ,"Thank you to Pilar, Jeana, Sydney, Sara and lastly but not least of all, Dafin.

104,Great staff and great location!,"We had a great stay while we checked out the Christmas lights around London. Jeana, Dafin, and the rest of the staff went above and beyond in everything! 

The room was perfect for us 3 weary travelers. Clean, well kept and close to the elevator for our many excursions around town.

 Location close to paddington station made airport transfer easy via the Heathrow express. 

Walking distance to Hyde park winterfest and the tube line.",5,2019,12,10
104,Excellent service but noisy,"The staff had excellent service attitude and the room was clean. Unfortunately the hotel is very noisy and we were not able to sleep well. You can hear basicly every little thing happening around your room. From the room upstairs you hear every step another guest takes there - and it‚Äôs a very loud noise. From the room next door you hear the conversations and if they have the TV on, the noise is the same as the TV would be on in your room. 

Be careful when navigating to this hotel - there are other park grand hotels nearby with similar names and the names don‚Äôt seem to have that much logic. We took a taxi to the hotel and the taxi driver left us at another grand park hotel in the area. ",3,2019,12,09
104,"great customer service, lovely breakfast, great room, good location and good value!","I booked 3 rooms at this hotel as we were visiting winter wonderland. When we arrived we were seen to very quickly and Dorina who was really lovely on the front desk upgraded us all to suites! She checked us all in even though we were earlier than the check in time of 2pm. She asked us if we would like breakfast the next day and we were all really glad we paid the ¬£10 extra per person for this because it was really good! We were also really surprised to hear we didn't have to check out until 12pm which meant we'd be able to have a nice lie in after a full on day at winter wonderland! When we got into the rooms we were all really happy, there was a lot of space as the beds were on a mezze floor and there was a living area below! All I would say about the layout is that if you get up in the middle of the night for the toilet it is a little daunting going down the stairs! The shower was great and there were plenty of complimentary toiletries and complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits in the room. The room was warm, maybe a little too warm for some but I think there was air con and you can open the double window doors quite some way onto the balcony to let the air in. The beds were soooo comfortable and everything was clean. The bar closes at 11/12 i think but you can order drinks to your room 24 hours and i ordered a Tia Maria to room when got back which came quickly and just how i like it over lots of ice. When we checked out Dorina was just as pleasant, making sure we enjoyed our stay and asking us how our visit to winter wonderland was, fabulous customer service! Would 100% stay here again!",5,2019,12,09
104,Review,"Stayed here on the weekend with a friend. Hotel staff Dorina and Dafin were really welcoming and friendly, they made sure we were happy and that we were happy with our room.

Will be returning :)

104,"Excellent customer service, poor bed quality","I was assigned to a single room on the ground floor, terrible bed I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all as my room was right next to the AC generators. Woke up the next morning with a really bad back pain. 
The front desk (Claudia) was really pleasant and accommodating and she offered me a room on the upper floors (upgrade with fees) but I decided to move to a different hotel instead. Both she and her manager (Aaron) assisted me with this and they couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful.
Management needs to replace that bed with a new one and install a double glaze windows for all the rooms located near the AC generators. 
5 stars for the excellent customer service provided by Claudia & Aaron. 1 Star for the room quality.",3,2019,12,07
104,Thankyou for a pleasant stay,In my books a lovely stay is when you don't immediately notice the service. This fitted the description perfectly. Nice relaxing breakfast and very helpful service. My preference would have been for a firmer bed.,5,2019,12,07
104,Friendly ,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms a bit on the tired side but made up for by friendly staff and decent breakfast.
Handy for Paddington station and a pleasant walk across Hyde Park to Harrods etc.

104,Great Staff,"We arrived at Heathrow from US about 8:00 a.m.. We got to the Park Grand at about 10:00 a.m. with the intention of storing our luggage, and heading out to Tower of London. We hadn't slept on the plane so we were beat. Not expecting an affirmative reply, we thought what the heck and asked about the possibility of checking in and getting our room early. Not only did we get our room, we were upgraded to a better room. We were able to then take a nap, being refreshed we then hit the sights. A big Thank you to Jeana, Pilar, Dafir and Chan.  Great breakfast.",4,2019,12,04
104,Dirty Rooms,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night and was grateful it wasn‚Äôt any longer. I booked an executive room and it was hardly that. Should  have been fruit and water in the room but there was none.  The room was dirty and old fashioned. There was stains on the bedding and the room was very dated and smelt of damp.  Some of the wallpaper coming off the walls. The bathroom very small.  The toilet was broke and kept dripping water in the system. 

Considering the room was executive it was tiny. Would have struggled for room if there had been two of us staying there. 

The staff were very friendly and the location was good. Other than that nothing else positive about the place.",1,2019,11,30
104,Wannabe 4star hotel,"Despite this one is a 4-star hotel, i wouldn't give it more than 2 stars. The walls are very thin, you can here every door closing, every toilet flushing. My room was very basic, with old furniture. The breakfast was a huge disapointment with having scrambled eggs from instant powder and mushrooms from can... never again.",1,2019,11,30
104,An enjoyable stay,"We booked a deluxe twin room for a 3 night stay.  The reception staff were very welcoming, polite and friendly and could not do enough to make you feel welcome.
Good breakfast and Maria, Anthony and Lilia were very cheerful and helpful and made every effort to ensure you had what you needed.  Great location, easy to walk to Paddington Station, Hyde Park, Marble Arch and Oxford Street.  would definitely stay there again.",4,2019,11,30
104,Gorgeous!,"Absolutely stunning hotel. Amazing deals. Stayed in the suite and was so impressed for the price. Also amazing location, so easy to get around. 5 minute walk to Paddington station, perfect if you have to get a train somewhere else the next day and don‚Äôt want to wake up too early. Also, amazing service from Claudia. Made our day having that really welcoming yet luxurious feel and she could not do enough for us. We will definitely be returning soon!",5,2019,11,29
104,Good position but not clean,"I was there for 1 one night.
Old fashion structure. I got a double room which was very small and quite dirty.
Red marks and the walls. 
The bathroom was quite dirty and the bath tap was broken.
The floors hadn't been cleaned well.
Payment on arrival and not when you check out
Negative experience even if well positioned.",2,2019,11,26
104,An enjoyable stay,"We booked a deluxe room and although the room was fine, there was a slight problem with the window.  On reporting we were immediately offered an alternative room.  However we decided to stay in our original room.  It was very comfortable with extras such as a bowl of fruit, bottled water & biscuits.  The staff were incredibly kind and welcoming making our stay most enjoyable.",4,2019,11,23
104,Thank you Dorina,"Me and my friends are coming in this hotel every week and we are so pleased and happy that Dorina is always here, she is the best and i want to thank her for the great job she is doing. Dafin as well is very friendly and Claudia. Thank you once again!!

104,An excellent stopover between Cornwall and flying into/out of Heathrow,"The Park Grand is a short walk from Paddington station - it is an excellent stopover for travelling between Cornwall and flying into/out of Heathrow and a convenient base for doing things in central London.  Jeana, Pilar and Anthony welcomed me off an overnight flight and ensured I had a room straightaway: the whole team were helpful and welcoming throughout my stay.  The price falls within international public service guidelines even on the premium day I was travelling.",4,2019,11,22

104,Weekend away,"Lovely looking building that must have been a magnificent home as one time.
Inside is bright and comfortable, reception small but all that was required.
Was bit shocked when entered room as expected it to be bigger and bathroom was extremly small. A large person would have had problems. I'm only 5ft so it was ok.
Room very clean and bed really comfortable.
Staff were brilliant. Very friendly and helpful. The night receptionist Alan was brilliant when my phone died and I had forgotten my charger. I needed to access my boarding pass and Alan was great in getting me a charger. I cant comment on breakfast as I didnt get it.
On a health note as lots more people are being troubled with allergies to scents it would be a good idea if there where no plugin in the corridors. I'm very allergic and found this difficult.",4,2019,11,18

The hotel is quite convenient for those who want to be close to Paddington or move around within central London.

The staff at this hotel were very friendly and couldn‚Äôt have been nicer people. They gave us a free upgrade on our room due to the fact we had such a terrible experience in the other hotel. I can‚Äôt thank Claudia, Dorina, Barbara, Jeana and Dagon enough. The rooms were amazing, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.

104,Tiny room,"My company made a mistake booking this hotel in London. I was wondering how a room with tiny bed for an adult could be advertised for sole travellers. 
Almost fell apart when sleeping . Unacceptable old dirty Soft mattress and box room with moulded tiniest bathroom would not able to move around.",1,2019,11,06
104,Superb friendly hotel with great facilities!,"I have stayed in many London hotels for both business and pleasure and this has by far been the best experience to date.

The staff are what make this hotel so great, nothing is too much for them, extremely friendly and helpful all with an element of fun.

104,Great friendly hotel with excellent rooms,"We picked this hotel as it was close to Paddington but didn‚Äôt know what to expect. 
To be frank this is one of the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed in for the price.
The service was first class, the room had a mezzanine floor for the bed and a sitting room with a modest kitchen - didn‚Äôt expect that!
I‚Äôve stayed in many hotel in London and this has a warm, family type feel.
I absolutely recommend this hotel!",5,2019,10,31

104,"Good location, unique hotel","We stayed here for 4 nights and actually booked our stay last minute. We needed a room for 3 which can be an award number. We had 2 twin beds and a pull out sofa chair/couch (but smaller). The two twin beds were pushed together to make (kind of) one bed. The room was very little for 3 adults but it worked since we weren‚Äôt there often. Small hotel rooms are pretty standard in Europe. There was a desk and a small closet, and a safe in the room. No outlet in the bathroom to style hair. I think there was an outlet for their own hair dryer but it was specific to the hair dryer, our curling irons and straighteners with adapters would not work in there (there‚Äôs not really space anyways). 

Heads up: you turn the lights on by entering your key card into a little box that activates the electricity! That was a new one for us and took a moment to figure out! 

The breakfast was good with plenty of variety. Eggs, fruit, toast, cheeses, bacon, juices. Keep in mind the breakfast is complimentary if you book thru the hotel. If you book thru a different site (Expedia, booking, etc) it is an additional charge. 

The room had a small water heater to make instant coffee and a couple packaged cookies were left every day. The first day we were left an apple and banana but we did not receive those any other days.

We were within walking distance to several restaurants and pubs, as well as the Paddington underground station. We used the underground daily. It was probably 4 or so blocks, just around the corner.  

The hotel used to be a house/houses so the elevator is tiny and some rooms are only accessible by some stairs (after the elevator). It‚Äôs not a standard layout like one would be used to in the US. But it‚Äôs a very cute unique hotel in a great location.",4,2019,10,27
104,Park Grand Hyde Park Hotel,"I would highly recommend this hotel. Very clean, spacious rooms, good sevices. The staff always nice and welcoming. The hotel is just a few minutes walk to paddington station. I stayed a few times in this hotel and they never let me down, they continue to maintain their standards. Will definately go back there whenever I need to stay in London.",5,2019,10,27
104,Fantastic staff,We stayed here whilst our baby was in hopsital close by. My wife was expressing milk and there wasnt a fridge in the room. We asked reception and they were only too happy to help and store it in their fridge. The next morning we were greeted by a lovely lady who was so happy today help us and show us such lovely compassion. I really hope the hotel hold on to these great staff members as they are a credit to your hotel. ,5,2019,10,26
104,Do not stay here!,"Just returned from a 3 night stay. The hotel was cute and clean, close to a underground station.  The rooms were awful. Cramped, awkwardly set up and very dim. The bathrooms are barely big enough to turn around in and have no storage. We were there with friends so saw 2 different room set ups. But the reason for my very first review ever, good or bad, was that our bed was upstairs and the bath was downstairs. Down very precarious stairs that my husband actually fell down. He is ok, but not a very pleasant place to stay. Who wants to climb up and downstairs all day and night. Our room was not appropriately cleaned either. Please read the reviews and carefully scan photos before staying in this hotel. If you are young and this doesn‚Äôt bother you then it will serve your needs.",1,2019,10,22
104,Nice hotel,"I had very good experience at this hotel last year and that‚Äôs why I got back . The room I was given this time was very luxurious two floor and huge bed . I slept very well . Close to Paddington station . 
I didn‚Äôt had time to use their bar or restaurant but will definitely try next time . 
Love this hotel and service. Highly praise manager Mr Sakar  for this kindness.",5,2019,10,12
104,Excellent service & architecture ,"Amazed by the old and modern touch of its building. Although there's not much service provided by the hotel with the price but staffs are helpful and friendly.
My family went there for second time after recommendation. ",5,2019,10,08
104,Very poor value and customer support,Stayed 4 nights for a business trip and upgraded to a deluxe room approx price 225 pounds per night. The first room supplied was far too small not even enough space to be able to use the toilet asit was so close to the sink (i am 6feet 2 inches). The gave me a new room on the Mezz level i flor up with no lift. The room was adequate. The main problem being i was unable to shower the pressure in the shower would after about 5 seconds go to a trickle or i would have pressure but only at the very hottest setting rendering this unusable. i complained every day about this with no improvement on my return twice i emailed the hotel to request a partial refund as for 225 pounds per night i would expect none of these glitches and i have not been given the courtesy of a reply. Very disapppointed,2,2019,10,08
104,The staff made it special!,"I spent 4 nights here solo at the end of a 3 week Croatia/Venice trip with a friend which had a frustrating end to it. Upon check-in they showed me to a basement room but when I said ""no"" to the basement location, they took me to a ground floor room which was a decent size for a single in London & had all ammenities for a comfortable stay. There were some things I needed help with so they sent Jorge immediately who got things sorted out. Jeana Rodriques at reception offered a friendly ear (& biggest smile) when I needed to vent about the frustration I had prior to arriving. She became like a friend every evening when I returned from my day exploring (even though I could be her grandmother). The English breakfast is lovely & Jorge was there as well advising anything I want cooked to order is also available. Maria @ breakfast also made me feel special by remembering me & my room # on 2nd morning. She also remembered I was warm the previous day (someone had asked for the heat to be turned on) so when she saw me she turned on the a/c. She also remembered my breakfast order each day with a full hotel. I've never had such personal inteactions with such a lovely, caring staff. The room also was incredibly spotless every day. I will definitely stay here next time. Kudos and many thanks to the warm staff who made me feel at home ‚ù§",5,2019,10,07
104,Lovely stay at park grand,"This hotel is in good locations and good competitive prices. I stayed here with my family, staff were very helpful. Rooms are little bit smaller than us but London hotel are tiny . 
English breakfast was fruitful, good and good choice for vegetarians like us . 
Would stay in future.",5,2019,10,04
104,Park Grand London Hyde Park ,"We arrived here around 10am on the 25th. The check in was painful ....40 minutes to say the least! I had pre booked and paid in full for this accommodation. Due to arriving at Heathrow 6.30am from Australia, a very long flight and very tired. I paid for the night prior so we could check in early (as check in was 3pm) and just go in to our room and shower etc. The front desk could not seem to understand that I paid for a extra night to check in early, finally we go to our room that has been booked and paid for has been provided to someone else, as room had beds used etc. So back down stairs...you can imagine by this time I was getting a bit annoyed. Front desk put us in another room on bottom level. The bed configuration was supposed to be Queen and single....no we got double and single. The double bed was too soft for my husband and I and you rolled into the middle. The bathroom was so small , the only way two people could fit would be one in the shower and the other sitting on the toilet. 
The room is very small and I would not recommend for those traveling with any children, we had our 13 y old son. 
The towels in bathroom, were seriously so thin and worn. 
The positives of this accommodation - the staff were trying to be as helpful as possible and friendly, walking distance to Paddington tube line, with a voda phone shop, sainbury, M&S all in the station, a fantastic Italian restaurant close by, Hyde and Kensington park close by and for those traveling with a car the accommodation has off street parking right outside hotel, this is very rare in London. 
Would I stay here again, Unlikely! If I had to I would not do more than one night. We were here 5 days. The cost was quite expensive ($400/night) for what you received, I realise this is London but I have stayed elsewhere and had better. ",3,2019,10,03
104,No thank you.,"Booked a single room for 2 nights. Room was very scuffed up, tatty, aged, sad-looking and microscopically small. The walls are paper thin and you could hear neighboring room conversations. Depressingly overpriced for the room size and room condition. Never again.",2,2019,10,03
104,I kept coming here for years,"Once again i came back to this very English stylist hotel because of their services. I always greeted by Mr Sakar who caters us like his family. I am pleased to know that he‚Äôs back to this hotel . The location is perfect, the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more polite . The area is as far as i am concerned the best in London. The breakfast is always fresh and delicious. I like their croissants . I would also like to thank Anthony restaurants manager for helpful services . 
I will keep on coming for many more years . 
Thank you Mr Sakar and Mr Anthony .",5,2019,10,03
104,Lovely Stay - Super Friendly Staff,"Three of us stayed at the hotel over the last weekend in September for a wedding. 
The hotel was clean, comfortable and easy to get to from Paddington station (5 minute walk). We had absolutely no issues and the staff were incredibly friendly, chatty and accommodating. We spent a fair amount of time talking to members of staff.
Special mention: Dorina, who was at the front desk during our stay. We really hit it off with Dorina whilst checking in and she continued to check on us from there on. It was like having a friend at front desk, which made our stay so much more comfortable. She was extremely professional and welcoming and remained so up until we all collected our bags a few hours after we had checked out. 
Would highly recommend staying at the Park Grand London Hyde Park and hope Dorina gets well-deserved recognition!",5,2019,10,02
104,Everything was perfect,"This is probably twenty times in this hotel . I am very familiar with the location and nearby attractions. Each and every staff remembers me by name which makes it Very homely. 
It‚Äôs always been a pleasure stopping by at the park grand Hyde park . My regards to 
manager Mr Sakar , Restaurent manager Mr Anthony, Ms Alrina, Mr Aaron and everyone who looks after after me . 
Highly recommended.",5,2019,10,02

104,Pleasant Staff But Average Hotel,I stayed in September because of its location and price. The staff were pleasant and the hotel was clean but the bedroom was very much on the small side and there was a sheet of glass acting as a wall between the bathroom and bedroom with only a bedroom blind blocking the view and a glass shelf over the sink was in an awkward position . The hotel has only one lift and there is nearly always a wait for it.On reflection I should have paid a little extra and stayed in a more comfortable hotel. I got what I paid for ‚Ç¨310 for 2 nights which wasn‚Äôt too bad and to be fair breakfast was quite nice.,3,2019,09,27
104,Great location,"A wonderful stay . The staff and services was first and services was first class . From the moment we arrived Mr Sakar welcomed us like a family. Swiftly checked in to a fantastic room and our bags was delivered . We were overwhelmed with the size of the room very clean and good size bathroom. The shower pressure is lovely just the way we like it.  
Good value for money but can be expensive sometimes . Gorgeous decor everywhere and finally very welcoming staff .",5,2019,09,27
104,Very impressive ,"We as a friend's been staying here every year and it's been past six years . First time we came we loved it and we kept coming . Room is spacious, bed is comfortable. For me personally I love shower so when ever they put me into room with bath . I ask them to change my room . Breakfast is excellent can't fault it . If we want something different they will do it for us without any hesitation. Staff are very friendly . Especially Sakar , Anthony and all the front desk . They always greet like good morning , How are you with warm smile. ",5,2019,09,27
104,Amazing,"Always a fantastic welcome here at the Park Grand group, particularly Hyde Park. The rooms are pretty big for London, quiet and decorated nicely, but honestly nothing beats the incredible level of service delivered by the team. My go to for London stays. Thanks to Sakar and Jeana for a speedy check-in this evening! ",5,2019,09,26
104," Well worth it for London hotel ","This hotel is well placed to catch train , bus , and taxi to city centre . The breakfast has a large variety to choose from . The bar was however very small but good whiskey selection.  The most outstanding thing was the excellent service from the hotel  manager Sakar to all members of the hotel . They were unfailingly professional polite friendly and made such difference . 
A special thank you Aaron and Alrina  duty manager who smoothed out our concerns during stay and went to a great deal of trouble to ensure a perfect stay . 

Front desk staff Claudia and jeana and other members whose name who we didn't get thank you .
",5,2019,09,25
104,Amazing Hotel wonderful breakfast ,"This is my second stay with the hotel. The hotel has amazing front desk which always welcomes you with a bright smile , since I stayed here previously I was given a complimentary upgrade to bigger room which was very nice. 
Booking on the hotel website will be advisable which comes with breakfast which is delicious.
Whenever I visit London park grand will always be my home away from home.",5,2019,09,25
104,"Great hotel, staff are amazing","Really enjoyed our stay with Park Grand Hotel, had an amazing experience staff were very friendly and accommodating.

Thanks again for making our stay so special",5,2019,09,25
104,Exceptional hotel and spacious rooms ,"I had an exceptional service from this hotel . The rooms are very clean and spacious. The hotel location was ideal to get to my office in sheldon square. Very busy area but not so busy street near Paddington . 
I particularly love the hotel bar very stylish, cosy and good selection of drinks. Very helpful staff . 

Just love it and I will inform my PA to book here again directly. ",5,2019,09,23
104,Our true home away from home,"This our only Home Away From Home when we both are in London- both for business and pleasure. The team here are amazing- they caters to our needs in efforts to make sure our stay as wonderful and comfortable as possible. The restaurant staff are fabulous and extremely patient and professional with every dietary requirements. 
Hotel is located in a green belt at Westbourne terrace , which is stone- throw from Paddington station and Hyde park . Walking distance to Marble Arch and oxford street and lovely neighbourhood. 
I highly praise this hotel and staff . Needless to say , I am thankful to all those lovely team who makes our stay memorable. Mr Sakar , Ms Alrina , Ms Claudia, Ms Jeana thank you . 
We will be back very soon !",5,2019,09,23

I had few issues during checking in but the manager Mr Sakar went out of his way to get things sorted. 

Very close to Paddington station and Hyde park . 

Highly recommended this hotel .",5,2019,09,21
104,"Overcharged, not refunded, terrible customer service","Made a booking and was advised by the hotel that it is fully booked and reservation won't go through (ended up looking for a hotel in the middle of the night in London!). Surprisingly, I was still CHARGED THE FULL AMOUNT!! Have been contacting customer service for several days and have been passed around from one team to another, without being able to give me a reasonable answer...clearly they were trying to avoid taking responsibility and refunding the money! Having looked around other forums/google, this seems to be a regular occurrence. AVOID at all costs...

P.S I still haven't received a refund..",1,2019,09,18
104,Best Hotel Ever,"This hotel is very good, lovely staff & a very hot receptionist called Claudia with a very charming personality, good room and bar service & would definetely comeback for a second visit. Best hotel in London IMO.",5,2019,09,18
104,Manage Your Expectations Regarding London Hotels,"Rooms are small and bathrooms tiny, but that is the norm for a London hotel (ie you get half the room for twice the price relative to hotels outside London). Staff were friendly. Did not purchase the breakfast option as did not think it good value relative to eating out. The location near Paddington is very convenient.",4,2019,09,15
104,Great Hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay here at the Park Grand London Hyde Park while visiting London. There was great customer service and upon my arrival, my packaged was ready for me.

The room was a bit small but that's ok. It's definitely a great price in terms of a hotel of that quality. Quick and easy access to London's Tube to get around the city, at Queensway Metro station.",5,2019,09,14
104,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is a very good hotel, on my arrival the cocerge Mr Lucian came out to received me friendly and ushed me to the hotel reception area. I was very happy and amazed by this wonderful reception. In all, the staff are very friendly,jovial and loyal to their hotel and guest at the same time. Is a wonderful hotel to me, I don't regret staying here. Miss Dorina also nice and friendly to me.
Thank you.",5,2019,09,06
104,Holiday,"We loved the attentive staff from check in , the cleaning staff, the restaurant staff and right through to check out. They were happy to do anything they could to make our stay comfortable. Very friendly and amiable. Lucien was excellent with advice as to where the sights were and best way to get there. The room was very clean and comfortable and perfect for what we were needed for our short term holiday stay . Was very close to public transport and in a very pretty part of London. We will stay again when we return to London.
Was so comfortable , convenient and close it helped make our London holiday enjoyable.üëåüòä",5,2019,09,05
104,A nice and cozy place to stay,"I found the location to be really convenient. It's a short walk to the nearest train and bus station. Everyone was helpful without being intrusive, thoughtful and attentive.

I would like to send a special remark for Claudia who checked me out. Very polite, professional and service minded.

Highly recommend and will definitely be back.",4,2019,09,02
104,Alrina,"Thanks again for yet another wonderful time. As always nice and friendly service.  Unfortunately Alrina, you and your staff would have to put up with us next year.. Thanks alot and see you next year. Nothinghill carnival 2020 here we come.",5,2019,08,30
104,First visit. ,"I come to London every year for Nottinghill carnival and this is my first time staying at the Park Grand London Hyde Park. 
I will definitely be back here. I arrived early and they let me have a room early. Lucian handled my bags and I do have to say every day I was there. He greeted everyone with a smile and was always willing to go extra, especially for some of my friends who were extra rowdy and drunk. Hopefully when you stay there, you have the pleasure of interacting with Lucian.",5,2019,08,26
104,"Good location, but the room was a problem","This hotel is well located near Paddington station and Hyde Park. There are several casual restaurants close by (Paramount Middle Eastern, Bizzarro Italian was really good and inexpensive) and there is a late nite convenience store just around the corner as well to pick up drinks, snacks etc. We had English breakfast included in our rate and it was a great way to start the day. The room had a little kitchenette and the hotel provided daily biscuits and cookies. The room however was a disappointment. We were in a split level ""suite"". It was very small even for London. The lower level had a pullout two seater couch which faced away from the TV and our kids said it was very uncomfortable. We had to request extra sheets as the bedding was too narrow to cover two teenage kids. The upstairs bed was up an extremely steep and narrow staircase. We nearly fell several times and it was very tough carrying even small carry-on luggage up the stairs. Definitely too steep for little kids or older adults. There was no space to put luggage and only a very tiny closet (which had a safe though). The bathroom was extremely small with zero room to move around (no way to get dressed in there) and no counter space to put toiletry bags or even a tissue box! Definitely a one person only space - no sharing a sink to do your teeth! And then you walk out of the bathroom into the living space to climb the stairs up to get dressed. The carpet was a bit musty too. We will not go back.",3,2019,08,23
104,Ok,"Price was very reasonable, it was clean however room was tired and exceptionally small, only good for 1 night only.  Breakfast was of very good quality limited egg options but good.  Reception staff are amazing girls on in the morning were fantastic on the 22nd Aug.  Lets down by room size and tiredness, reflected in the price.  Good value.",3,2019,08,22
104,Nice location- room needs some TLC,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights for the location was good for us. We arrived by train from Oxford so it was a pleasant walk to the hotel. Also it was close to Hyde park and the museums.
Staff were very pleasant and welcoming. 
We had booked the Club room for it had a king bed which was comfortable but unbeknownst to us was the room was a two storey affair. Steep narrow stair up to the bed chamber. We left our luggage downstairs but the only place you could hang any clothes was upstairs, good luck getting a suitcase up those stairs. The room had a bathroom which was very small, I could hardly turn around in it and the towels provided were very thin and quite rough. The sitting area had a two seater couch which was not the most comfortable but okay. There was a fridge, microwave and a sink - a mini kitchenette. 
The one bad thing about the room was there was a musty odour. It was not disgusting but what was the source. You eventually got used to it but it should not be in there in the first place. The room was clean so no problems with housekeeping. 
The breakfast staff were also friendly and greeted us well. There is a breakfast buffet plus you could order eggs cooked the way you like. 
The price of the room for the area was decent but I do not think we could do more than the two nights we had already done.
My wife also remarked the hair dryer cord was not long enough for her to dry her hair in front of a mirror, important for women. 
The TLC - the room just looked run down and for a 4 star rating it falls short.",3,2019,08,18
104,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WOMEN: Concierge with innappropriate behaviour towards my friend,"On the night of the 9th of August I went to meet my friend at the hotel and from the very first moment the concierge and porter kept giving abusive prying eyes to her and not even trying to diguise it. Extremely rude and disrespectful to both of us to say the very least. If you are a woman staying there on your own I would advise bringing your pepper spray or screaming police out loud if anything happens (in fact before it happens!!).

NOT RECOMMENDED there are plenty of better and less expensive options in the Paddington area.",1,2019,08,17
104,Good hotel ,Good hotel and I liked the stuff there they are helpful specially Lucian. Also the price is so good comparing to other hotels I came on the traveling season but still the price was good. But only the problem was the carpet needs more cleaning.,5,2019,08,15
104,Abusive porter / nonchalant manager ,"Contrary to our expectations, as we were well welcomed upon arrival.
I will just say, there is no CCV in some important parts of the hotel Lift/elevator included. Watch it for yourself if you are a woman, wife, daughters. You are in Danger for inappropriately approached.",1,2019,08,13
104,Easy booking and good hospitality,"Stayed for a day and was happy with the personalized service. All staff were helpful and pleasant to talk too. Assisted us with our late check in, hassle free. Special thanks to Mr. Valent for making us feel at home.",4,2019,08,09
104,Homophobic,"The night staff is blatantly homophobic. Don‚Äôt stay here if your part of the LGBTQ+ community. (Plus, the rooms are small and the walls are thin.) There are better, LGBTQ+ friendly hotels in London. Will never stay here again.",1,2019,08,08
104,Vacation,"I love Royal Lancaster hotel in London near high park.... great food , room are amazing, people working there the best ... and the most important when I need some information the concierge it was always helping me .. definitely is going to be my hotel in November 2019 ü•∞",5,2019,08,07
104,Average stay. ,"Stayed here for 2 nights whilst working in London. The room was clean and tidy but quite compact. Some nice touches, for instance the travel buddy (basically a mobile phone) that is supplied by the hotel. No matter what I tried o couldn‚Äôt receive incoming calls. My room was on the basement floor so away from the traffic noise however it was right next to the kitchen so Monday morning brought a rude awakening!

The staff were very friendly and polite but it‚Äôs the little things that sometimes make all the difference. The hotel boasts a fruit platter for the room. This turned out to be an apple and a banana & even they didn‚Äôt appear on day 2. 

Bath sheets instead of towels would have been much better too.
Overall it‚Äôs a comfortable enough hotel but a few tweaks could maybe make it a better hotel. ",3,2019,08,06
104,Denis,"Pleasant hotel booked single room for 3 nights. Small room at the rear of hotel, no view but as used for base to get around London not a problem. Secondary double glazing helps to keep room quiet at night. Clean and comfortable, towels and toiletries changed daily. All communal areas well presented. Good location Hyde park and Kensington gardens 10 min walk. Staff very friendly Claudia booked me in and out very helpful as was all the staff including night time personnel. For London thought hotel was value for money.",4,2019,08,05
104,Amazing experience,Why really enjoy my stay at the park grand hotel it was an amazing experiance the duplex/double bed room was amazing. customer service was excellent. room very clean. This is my second time and I will go again for sure. Thank you to all the staff especially Claudia who help my self and partner with every thing that we wanted. thank you once again Park Grand will be returning for sure.,5,2019,08,04
104,Just ok,The location is very good just near the station.But this is not the case.We could find better hotel with the same of price. The room was just ok but small for a couple. The room cleaning service could be better and some smells could be avoided.The room has coffeemaker fully equipped with biscuits. In general the hotel is ok but not for the price we paid and the so called four stars.,3,2019,07,21
104,Amazing Staff! Perfect Location.,"First review on trip advisor but i felt i needed to leave it. The location is great. I currently lived in Dubai but I came to London for a business trip. I was born and raised in London so i know the city well. Being around paddington area was perfect as i could go see family and have meetings in the city. Paddington station is a 5 minute walk. 

The staff were absolutely fantastic. Never was i left unattended. Room was always immaculate and the service in general was great. In particular Lucian and Adrian were great. I was always sitting in the cafe area and having a lot of my meetings there. They were always asking me if i needed anything. It was really a pleasure to be in the hotel. The staff as re genuinely nice people. No fake smiles. Just real, genuine people.",5,2019,07,18
104,My experience,"Very good hotel with regards to its location, cleanliness and service. There‚Äôs is a special guy there who can take care of everything that you need, named Lucian - friendly, support any request of yours and all being done with a great smile.",5,2019,07,17
104,Cheap but fabulous,"Great hotel and lovely staff. Close to underground and walking distance to most things.  Would definitely stay here again, rooms where clean and the breakfast was just the thing, my son loved the sausages.",5,2019,07,16
104,Great Place To Stay,"My mom and I stayed at this hotel for a week on our first trip to London.  We wanted to be near Paddington station to make it easy for a few day trips we took during the stay.  It was definitely conveniently located to the station.  The tree lined street was  beautiful, quiet and not directly in the touristy area.  It was also a short walk to Hyde Park for walking and connecting to other areas in town./ 

The staff was FANTASTIC!  They definitely would have done whatever we needed to make our stay better.  The desk employees along with Adrien and Lucien were so helpful, friendly and made the stay so enjoyable!!  When my mom was craving some chocolate and asked where she could go for something quick,  they found cookies in the office to give her.   

The rooms are smaller, but we didn't expect anything huge.  I will say the bathrooms were smaller than expected but the rooms were clean and we were comfortable.  

We would definitely stay again.",5,2019,07,15
104,Excellent Hotel,"We found this hotel luckily after walking out of a different hotel, this hotel is lovely. The bed was the comfiest I have slept in, in a long time. Staff friendly and helpful, location fantastic. Would definitely stay here again",5,2019,07,14
104,Hyde Park Concert ,"Stayed here for the Stevie Wonder gig at Hyde Park, it is a great little hotel, all the staff were very friendly and very helpful too.
We had a room on the top floor, it was very quirky as it is built into the roof, considering it‚Äôs in the middle of London it was very quiet, highly recommended and would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,07,11
104,Park Grand - Suitably located and well mannered staff,"I stayed in this hotel from 28th June to 1st July with my friends when on a leisure trip to London.

Pros-
1. Well located in central london, Paddington station
     is a 5 mins walk.
2. Reception staff is well mannered.
3. House keeping done regularly and toiletries
    replaced daily.
4. No hassle while returning to hotel at late night
    or wee hours in the morning.

Cons-
1. Overpriced, we took 2 rooms (double delux) for 3 
    days @ INR 85000. Way too costly.
2. Room sizes were way too small. A double bed 
    just fits in and there is no balcony.
3. Washroom was very small too, there is virtually
    no space left for a person to stand after the water 
    closet/seat.
4. No exhaust fan, auto venting doesn‚Äôt work
    properly and we had to bear with the unpleasant 
    odour.

Overall, a decent stay for a day or two, not apt for
families considering the cons above.

Thanks

104,Senior Advisor,"Staff brilliant. Very helpful and nothing too much trouble. Room a little dark but clean and well equipped.

The bar staff I.e Stevie...what a guy! Went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and sorted. Not often I praise staff individually but this guy deserves it! 

Keep this up guys!",5,2019,07,11
104,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night for our son‚Äôs graduation, the staff couldn‚Äôt be more friendly and very helpful. We used their parking spaces as we‚Äôd gone in the car, cost ¬£25 for 24 hrs which isn‚Äôt bad for London, the very helpful doorman was very polite and helpful also.
Really couldn‚Äôt fault the rooms and breakfast was good also. Will definitely be staying here when we visit London again.
Would recommend this hotel for being so close to the centre of London and being close to Paddington station and tube.",5,2019,07,10
104,Busy weekend ,"
We initially booked this hotel months ago via Booking.com with free cancellation up to 48 hours before. We got a good price with breakfast so was a bit peeved when 48 hours before we were due to stay ( for BST Hyde Park ) I received an email to say our room was cancelled as the card they held did not go through the pay machine . I immediately phoned to offer another card ( although the card they had was perfectly fine when I used it the next day ) I was told they had no rooms and to go onto Hotels .com. i begrudgingly had to book again, only a twin room available no breakfast for an additional ¬£60 .( paid upon booking )¬† Armed with both bookings i decided to at least request breakfast on arrival. However when i arrived there was no booking in place at all and no rooms. This was the day of the concert and we were keen to get going to Hyde Park. It took almost two hours of phone calls to finally get a room released to us on a new booking from hotels.com. 
However, i need to stress that we were treated wonderfully by Gurdeep Singh who went out of his way to sort us out. A drink while we waited, and eventually a room upgrade with kitchenette, bottle of wine and breakfast. Adrian in the bar was very sweet as was Claudia on reception. It was an extremely busy weekend and the hotels were obviously over booked. But Gurdeep especially coped with courtesy kindness and a smile

My only complaint is that breakfast was cold. There were no lids on the food trays which would have helped.

104,"Central Location, Friendly Staff","Walking distance to Paddington for Heathrow Express and also walking to metro tube for touring. Stayed 5 nights with 2 teens. Room basic and small which is normal for London, but adequate and it had air con which many in London in this price range do not have and it was heatwave during our visit so needed it! Hotel staff were very very friendly. Stored bags when we arrived early. Breakfast was included and very good (hot English and continental) and convenient to have each morning.",4,2019,07,10
104,Honest review,"Stayed here for a weekend visit to the BST concert in Hyde Park. Checked in around 1.45pm after a long train journey. Room was ready so off we went in anticipation of getting freshened up etc to go out and see some of London. I booked a double room. What a surprise we had when we got to our room no 505. It was the smallest room we‚Äôve ever had. It had a double bed in but it was shoved up against the wall so if you wanted to get out during the night you‚Äôd have had to clamber over the person sleeping next to you or slide to the bottom of the bed to get out. The bathroom was a cupboard. If you sat on the toilet your arms touched the wall and the shower side and there was limited space to get in/out of the shower. This is more like a single room but even then the bathroom isn‚Äôt acceptable. We did speak to reception who were very good and offered us a different room which was actually a double as booked. I saw the room before changing and it looked like it was ready for us although the assistant said housekeeping needed to sort it and would ring us in the original room when it was ready. We were made to wait a further 45 mins and then we went down to reception to enquire as to the readiness. The room was ready. We felt like we‚Äôd been made to wait purposely because we‚Äôd complained. 
Room 804 was our new one which was considerably better. Wardrobe space was limited. There is no hanging space for anything longer than a shirt to be honest. 
Breakfast was ok once we got it. We had to ask for cereal bowls/ side plates for toast/ glasses for orange on our first morning and then the same again on the second day except we had to wait for most of the hot food too. They appeared extremely disorganised. Several people were just stood around waiting to get things. There appeared to be a restaurant manager but he was as disorganised as everyone else. More concerned with ticking your name off his list. 
The hotel is nice but there are a lot of issues that need addressing. It‚Äôs frustrating to have to complain etc when you‚Äôve paid good money for your weekend away and just want to enjoy it. 
The hotel is within good walking distance to Hyde Park and Oxford St and for the most part is a nice hotel as long as you don‚Äôt encounter any problems it would be a good stay.",4,2019,07,09
104,Disappointing ,"Despite the name, this particular Park Grand hotel is nearer to Paddington and further from Hyde Park. The exterior looks lovely, in a nice area but the interior is dated. It‚Äôs like we were transported back to the 1980‚Äôs! We had a duplex room which was spacious, but is in need of renovation. The breakfast was disappointing. We arrived for breakfast at around 9.30am and we were sent back upstairs to wait in the bar, as the restaurant was full. It‚Äôs a relatively small breakfast room, which doesn‚Äôt cater for the number of people staying at the hotel. After 10 minutes wait, we decided to ask for a refund (we had prepaid for breakfast) as we didn‚Äôt want to wait any longer. The receptionist was just looking into our reservation, however we were called for breakfast before she finished. So we went for breakfast and it was average. Half of the cooked ingredients were cold e.g. the beans, eggs, tomatoes. Other items on offer were cereal, a toaster for sliced bread, croissants, muffins, tea, coffee and juice, fruit salad, yoghurts. The restaurant was even busier on the second morning and we were told that there was a 30 minute wait. We went down the refund route again, but a sign had appeared in the reception that said the terms and conditions stated that there are no refunds for breakfast under any circumstances...! I suspect because they must have had lots of guests asking the same thing. So we lost our money, as they wouldn‚Äôt refund us. We checked out and visited a lovely cafe down the road where the food was 100 times better. I recommend trying some of the independent cafes in the area, as these offer much better value for your money. Overall, we wouldn‚Äôt stay here again. We certainly didn‚Äôt get value for our money.",2,2019,07,08
104,Not my cup of tea,Great location however the room I was in was tiny and dated. It was like I had been transported back into the 1980‚Äôs. I had to open the shower door to sit on the toilet which wasn‚Äôt the best. And the TV was on the opposite wall to the bed awful. The breakfast was fine but for ¬£190 a night I did not think it was value for money one bit. Not for me I am afraid there are far better hotels which charge a lot less and you get a lot more space for your money.,2,2019,07,05
104,"OK hotel, could do better","The main attraction of this hotel was its location, about 10 minutes walk from Paddington Station (it's farther from Hyde Park, despite its name). My room was very small, about the size of one I had in a London hotel near Kings Cross for half the price. It looked out onto a wall with peeling paint. The breakfast is good, with a decent selection of hot and cold food. The staff on the front desk are friendly, but when I asked whether I could cancel the second night of my stay, they switched to a foreign language, presumably so I couldn't follow what they were saying, which I did not appreciate. I didn't use the bar. The neighborhood seems safe. There are plenty of hotels in the area, so check for deals before you book.",3,2019,07,04
104,Handy,"Needed a place to crash not too far from Paddington station. Room was a bit on the small side, public areas were well maintained. we didn't eat diner or breakfast here so I can't comment on the food. Staff were helpful",3,2019,07,03
104,Excellent location,After reading their reviews I was bit worried about room sizes but I know what to expect from European hotels .small room but has everything what do you expect in a hotel .lovely staff and nice breakfast to start your day .easy to get to Heathrow from Paddington station,5,2019,06,24
104,Perfect hotel in perfect location,Stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights.The reception and communal area are modern and airy .we were lucky enough to be upgraded to suite .we did not use restaurant and bar facility in the hotel .staff is very kind and lovely .will try again if back in area again,5,2019,06,23
104,Great Stay,"The location of this hotel is what is very appealing. Less than 5 minutes from a major Tube  station, restaurants and little corner stores if you feel like a light snack during the day. The room was very clean, interesting that our bed was in a loft. The only thing was our friend that had booked a normal double room. Take note that these room are really tight.  Bed is against the wall and the bathroom is very tiny.Staff was friendly and available to answer any of your questions. Breakfast is the normal fare, scrambled eggs, bacon etc...If I had a choice I would recommend this hotel if you are in this area",5,2019,06,23
104,Wonderful stay!,"From a friendly checkin , to a spacious and well appointed room. Very helpful staff who go beyond your expectations for a morablenstay. Breakfast was delicious and various choices of teas. I will definitely return back here with my family. Location is very convenient too.",5,2019,06,22
104,A place you can feel like home,"Me & my family came for a weekend away, the hotel itself is situated at the perfect spot more of greenery around you. Rooms were very clean. What should I say about the staff? Staff has been way helpful and very friendly. They will go miles & beyond to make your stay a memorable one. I have come twice and will return back for sure.",5,2019,06,21

104,A bit of a mess-up I am afraid......................,"Booked weeks ago through Booking.Com & warned them I would be checking in late, after an event. Arrived at 23h30 - receptionist was very welcoming BUT, and here's the rub; No Room! So that is a pretty big problem when he admitted he had my booking; he had a note it would be a late check-in and yet they had let my room go! So I can't review THIS hotel really, but you have to be double-sure they have your booking. However, they did redeem themselves. Receptionist promised he would get me into one of their ""sister hotels"" and within 15 minutes he had. So, yes, there was a mess-up BUT it was fixed reasonably efficiently.",3,2019,06,13
104,Great hotel and friendly staff,"Claudia, Marian and Elena were very helpful thought out my stay. Would highly recommend this hotel. Great location. Very close to the Lancaster and Paddington station. Nice restaurants nearby. Walking distance from Hyde park.",5,2019,06,11

104,Room too small,"It is supposed to be a 4 stars hotel, but I wonder how they could get 4 stars! It would be an acceptable 2 stars hotel. People working there are very kind, but the quality of the rooms is definitely very low. The breakfast was good and the position is also good to visit London.",3,2019,06,05
104,"Night out,","Really great find, all the staff were great, really friendly. 
Good location an easy walk from a few tube stations, restaurants, pubs & Hyde park not far away.

104,"Good location, fair prices","The hotel is located in a nice place, close to four tube stations and in a walking distance to the Hyde Park. Breakfast is simple but good, the attendants are very nice and gentle. The only problem that we had was that we wanted to make a reservation of taxi do take us to Heathrow airport and the hotel doesn't have this kind of service to the guests (but the day before we asked about this and the front door person told us that was possible to make the reservation through the hotel).

Amazing 
I was here for business , Paddington station near by . Easy location , good breakfast , room has wifi service which is very useful to business traveller 
A good place to stay",5,2019,05,28
104,Good base for exploring - a little out of the centre,"The Park Grand in Paddington is a very good hotel. Somewhat away from the hustle and bustle of the city but minutes away from Paddington tube and rail station means you can get anywhere!
We paid just under ¬£13 each for  a day ticket on the tube (using our railcard discount) and took the tube to Monument. Deciding to explore the city and spend the day walking back to the hotel. It‚Äôs a long way but very doable and enjoyable walking past all the landmarks etc.

The staff are very accommodating and friendly 
The facilities in the room are also great.
A fruit bowl, water and drinks on arrival made it easy for us to relax immediately after a long flight.
We were in a room on the 7th floor - lift to the 6th and stairs to the 7th but the staff brought our cases for us.
The room was very spacious and hot but the air con worked a treat.
We heard no noise from outside which meant we could rest up in the afternoon too.

At the time of our trip Breakfast was ¬£10 pre-booked or ¬£15 on the day. We however did not take up breakfast on this occasion.

All in all a great hotel.

104,Would Definitely Come Again,"The Grand Royale was everything we had hoped for. A lovely hotel with its own unique history. Just 2 minutes from the underground, getting anywhere was a snap. When we found ourselves worn out from the city, we simply walked into the park and found ourselves relaxing. The staff was wonderful, we spoke with Anifa in particular on multiple occasions, and found her very helpful.",5,2019,05,19
104,Very Good Location,"The hotel is within walking distance from Paddington station.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  We were given an upgrade to a duplex.  We had a bathroom, lounge/kitchen area with fridge, microwave and sink.  The bedroom was upstairs with a very large bed and wardrobe.  There was a TV in both areas, we had free use of a smart phone and plenty of drinks, biscuits and fresh fruit.  Breakfast was buffet style with an adequate choice of foods.  Unfortunately the dining room staff didn't pay attention to detail.  The tables were often half laid, with some cutlery missing, saucers with no cups and being served drinks was not automatic.  On our final day we were able to leave our luggage with reception until we went home in the evening.",4,2019,05,14
104,Roger n.,"The Park Grand calls itself a unique boutique hotel. An apt description.  It is located in the heart of London only a short walk from paddington tube station, bus routs are everywhere so transportation is easy.
  For 10 pounds a day your room can enjoy a lavish breakfast, a true bargain in an area where food is quite expensive.
  Where the Park Grand excels is in its friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff. From Lucian the porter, to the people at the desk, the girls in the breakfast room, every one is eager to make you visit remarkable. My wife and I stayed 3 weeks and our London experience was doubly enhanced by the assistance the staff gave us at every turn.
  I highly recommend this hotel. Just expect the room to be smaller than what we find in the U.S.
  Also, Hyde Park is a short walk, a beautiful place on a nice day.  Museums and art galleries abound, and a comfortable bed awaits your return.",5,2019,05,12
104,Great location great services,"I stayed at this Hotel for two nights. At check in there were Kelvina and Shawn who were very friendly who helped me with the things to go around to eat,drink & see. Rest of staff were always helpful in any matter.

Enjoyed my stay here and will definitely come back again when in London.",5,2019,05,09

104,Disappointed with this hotel,"The hotel was rated 4 stars but although staff were lovely and helpful we were more  than disappointed with our room. Which was basically ‚Äúgrubby‚Äù, definitely not the 4 stars  it had been awarded. We paid over ¬£800 for 5 people over 2 nights and it was not worthy of that. Room did not look like the pictures, the bathroom was as the size of a closet.. it was just all old and as I said ‚Äúgrubby‚Äù, ‚Äúsad‚Äù, ‚Äútired‚Äù probably had been better choosing a main chain of hotels instead.

104,Great Staff!!,"Stayed here a couple of times while in London for work and of all the hotels I‚Äôve visited (9 so far), the staff here makes all the difference. Kind and accommodating, Linda, Shawn, Adrian and Kelvina made my stay pleasant and comfortable, and I‚Äôd come back here in a heartbeat over other, similar hotels. How did I receive great staff interaction? I did nothing special, just said hello and chatted to them briefly; they responded kindly and with smiles and it goes from there. As well, the location is great for catching the tube or taking a walk to the nearby Hyde Park area.¬† Hope you enjoy your stay here as much as I have!",5,2019,04,17
104,Long business stay,"I stayed at the Park Grand Hyde Park hotel for over 2 months. My experience here was absolutely phenomenal, the staff was very courteous to accommodate my stay.

104,Good hotel in convenient location,"My wife and I recently spent three nights at this hotel. We were reasonably confident that we‚Äôd have a good experience because we‚Äôd had a good experience at a sister hotel near Earls Court. This hotel is conveniently situated up a quiet side street, a five minute walk from Lancaster Gate underground station. We arrived about an hour early but luckily a room was available and so we were able to put our feet up and have a cup of tea. Staff members at reception were pleasant and welcoming. Our room was not large but comfortable and well equipped e.g. large TV, microwave, largish safe for i-pads etc. The bathroom was really small but again, quite adequate for a short stay. Breakfast was served in a basement room, which had a couple of TVs, allowing one to follow the morning news. The choice of foodstuffs was fine ‚Äì  plenty of  options ‚Äì the bacon and sausages were nicely browned ‚Äì nothing worse than pallid bacon. The waitresses were helpful and efficient.The bed was comfortable and we slept well as there is very little traffic passing the hotel. We would be happy to return.",5,2019,04,15

Really enjoyed my stay, had a wonderful time.",5,2019,04,14
104,Friendly Hotel with Good Location,"Stayed here last Nov for 2 nights.  We booked a twin room and upon check-in was upgraded to a family room with a loft; there's a mini kitchenette and complimentary mini bar snacks!  
The staffs were friendly and helpful.  There's a nice & hot English breakfast in winter!
An easy short walk from Paddington Station; very convenient on a quiet street.  Hyde Park, Paddington Basin and Little Venice all within easy walk.",4,2019,04,03
104,This wasn't a 4-star hotel!,"The staff is nice and helpful, and the location is great - close to paddington station which is very convenient for Heathrow, and close to bus stops and London tube stations. It is about 5 minutes walk from Hyde park and approximately 15 minutes walk to Bond street or shopping mecca. :D
However, this hotel is nowhere near a 4-star hotel. Honestly, I have stayed in 3star hotels which were far better!
The rooms are way too small, and the wifi isn't strong enough in some rooms. I had to change my room twice because of wifi! The very first room I had was 114, which was too small, that the suitcase wouldn't fit in the room and they had to put it on the desk. The wifi signal was average and they were kind enough to change my room. The wifi in the second room was even worse and finally my third room was not only a bit bigger (807), but also it had a very strong and fast wifi which was great!! There is no fridge in the room, and the air conditioner is a bit complicated. Like they had to change some settings for me from outside to be able for me to put it on heater. Honestly, I have never seen any 4-star hotel with rooms this small, no fridge, and such little-to-none-amenities. 
This was my first stay in London, so I am not sure if all the hotels are like this, or it was this hotel. But honestly, I am not sure if I will pick them again - although the location was nice and the staff were helpful.",3,2019,03,31
104,Centrally located .convenient and relaxing room,"For overnight stay in London ,good central location .the single rooms are cosy but there is enough space and facilities available.

Friendly staff and clean room.",5,2019,03,22
104,Poor value for money,"There is absolutely no way this is a 4* hotel. Reception was tiny, furniture was sad, carpets are dated. We got the quad room for our family of 4 and knew we got a raw deal when we walked into a small, old and dated room whose ceiling creaked whenever the people on the floor above walked about and walls are so thin we could hear people coughing and talking. It is obviously a rip off when we compare this to our stay at another hotel the previous week- the only reason we wanted to move here was to be near Paddington so that we could catch the Heathrow express and our flight early in the morning and the other reviews had been so positive! Perhaps the double room is a better deal seeing the prices listed on TripAdvisor but for the price I paid for the quad room (>¬£200 a night), I‚Äôd urge families to stay away and research other hotels for better value. Kudos to the housekeeping staff though, the toilet was clean. ",2,2019,03,19

Upon checking in, the receptionist was a new trainee (fair enough) who blundered through checking me in, which i understand, however they sent me in the wrong location with my heavy suitcase, (was offered no help even though it was clear i was struggling) upon return to reception i was shown the right way. I was given no details about the hotel. Except that payment needed to be taken and there was Wifi.
Bed in room was very comfy, a saving grace. However ti found several hairs and some minor dust around the room. View was awful (but it's inner city london, whatcha gonna do?) 
Returned to the hotel late and went to the bathroom before bed, flushed the toilet, it wouldnt stop flushing. It just trickled loads of water, endlessly. I closed the bathroom door and tried to ignore it, however at 1-2am i got sick and tired of it as i couldnt sleep and contacted the nights team. Rang reception, but no answer, went to reception to find nights team chilling in the back office. One of the nights team who's english wasnt very good came to my room to inspect the toilet, he couldnt do anything and offered me a room move, however when we got back to reception his manager bluntly told him no that i wouldn't be moved, as they didn't have availability. Also, the nights team mentioned there was an issue with some plumbing as the mens urinals near reception wouldnt stop flushing water either. I was told i'd have to put up with the toilet running. He said for me to speak to a manager in the day on checking out.
I went to my room, and since the metal plate with the flush was a little bit off, i pulled it off, to find the pluming inside messed up and mouldy, i gave it a clean and put it back into place and low and behold the flushing stopped, i replaced the metal place and it clipped back into place. Problem solved, i went to bed, then checked online to see that i could still book a room online via booking.com.... Was i lied to? Or was there an issue that meant there was no availability? Unsure. But with the problem fixed, i went to sleep.
Checked out the next morning, a different receptionist who was alone and struggling to check people out, she saw me waiting, took my key, asked for my room number and told me goodbye, didnt ask me how my stay was or anything. I was going to ask to see the manager, but i was in a rush for a meeting. 
However, the concierge was very helpful, and nice and helped me with my luggage.
Overall, not a very good stay, although not the worst.",2,2019,03,13
104,Business trip,"I stayed here with my friend for a week on business trip and we were allocated a better room with free wifi service .
Breakfast is pure english served in lower floor .staff is very attentive and always smiling.
Highly recommend ed",5,2019,03,11
104,"Typical, London hotel","It's suffices. Reasonably located, 5mins from Paddington's Underground and Railway Stations, and right next to St. Mary's Hospital. 
The hotel and its' rooms have been constructed within the frame of the original splendid households that once filled fashionable Westbourne Terrace. That said the bedrooms and the bathrooms can be a little cosy - especially if you're over 6ft. 
If you opt for breakfast - it's pretty reasonable-to-good, with real British sausages, bacon, eggs and baked beans etc: etc: IF, and only IF the chef, or general manager is present in the dinning room. The majority of the wait staff are students, who prefer to spend their time on FaceBook during serve time. Needless to say, with no-one in charge, the dishes were never refilled, hot beverages were never brought to the table, and the scrambled egg never got made - in the full half hour we were there at our first b'fast, despite a determined server (who had her head 80% of the time with her head buried her cell-phone) who kept on insisting that was being made.
The rest of the staff, reception, house-keeping and the repair engineers were extremely pleasant, efficient and helpful. The hotel was clean, warm and friendly - with exception of the breakfast room. 
Note - there is only one lift/elevator that services all the floors. ",4,2019,03,10
104,Definately not a 4-star hotel,"The rooms were extremely small, they literally could not fit 2 people and 2 cabin bags. The staff was average, there were a few nice and polite people but most of them were absolutely indifferent. There were so many fire doors in order to reach our room in a tiny corridor which made us feel claustrophobic. There was also a weird and intense smell of some kind of middle eastern food throughout the entire hotel. Thankfully we asked for a room change which was granted. No value for money.
 The rooms were clean and the location was only a 4 min walk to paddington underground.
",2,2019,03,03
104,Good stay,"It's a good place to stay there. its quite and the staff nice. The porters are very nice and helpful. The problem I faced there that I couldn' find two room near each other, unfortunately I didn't booking there but the hotel I booked with it was in maintenance and they moved me to this hotel",3,2019,03,03
104,Aaron you are a STAR.,"Best hotel i have stayed. I checked in on 19 February. At first they was some problem in the booking which lead to cancelling of the booking. 
On reaching the reception around 1:40 late at night i was informed that my booking was cancelled and they were calls and emails regarding it but since I was in the flight didn‚Äôt get them on time. 
The night manager Aaron helped me alot. With a few extra pounds and complementary breakfast he managed to get me a room for my family 
I was in 201 which was very spacious and clean. Breakfast was excellent.
Stayed here for 2 nights and the staff is very friendly and always there to help. 
Special thanks to Aaron for helping me out,the doorman Lucian and Alrina for helping me out with the map to explore London and for the tickets.Rest of staff was also helpful but dint get their names.
Will definitely come again and also recommend the hotel to my friends.",5,2019,02,24
104,Amazing staff and Service !,"This place is like home, staff is excellent and the location is very convenient for our work place. We appreciate all the help the reception staff Aaron provided. He helped us with all our queries. We will recommend this to our friends and family",5,2019,02,23
104,"So average, can't believe it's 4*!","My first impression was how run down bits of the room are- broken lamp and aircon, marks on the bed, scratches on the furniture! And how tiny the single room is, can't move around in it and there's not even a bedside table! There's no basic mini bar in case you need an extra bottle of water in the night, or to use a fridge. No introductory guide in the room, tiny toiletries and bathroom in general. Only thing I can say is the bathroom and bed are reasonably clean.
The reception desk is starting to look worn with markings on it, and they were using a manky old cardboard box to store all the reservations!
Last but definitely not least, there's a huge gap under my door, so I can hear everything on the corridor! Why!
I've stayed in much better 3* hotels, the Ibis by Heathrow was so much nicer! Does 4* in a London mean something else? V dissapointing as it was meant to be a treat for myself.",3,2019,02,22

104,Highly recommended!,"I have to attend St Mary's Hospital in Paddington 2 to 3 times a year and for the past four years my wife and I have stayed at the Park Grand Hotel. Even though we only visit a few times a year, many of the staff remember us and we always receive a warm and friendly welcome. Our rooms have always been top notch and the breakfasts excellent.  It‚Äôs not much fun visiting the hospital but staying at the Park Grand somewhat compensates for that as it is such a pleasant experience.  Highly recommended!",5,2019,02,15

Excellent location for Hyde park and oxford street.hop on hop off recommended just near to hotel.Since i was there during the peak tourist season the hotel was crowded with many tourist so i guess must be a popular choice.
Would recommend it to people if they want to be close to public transport and have the option for some leisure activity.",5,2019,02,13
104,Owner needs to invest in new beds,"I frequently stay in different hotels for business and pleasure.  By far this was the most uncomfortable hotel I‚Äôve stayed in this far.  Two single beds were pushed together so kept separating, the mattress was way to soft and the room was not cleaned to a high standard was also quite noisey.",1,2019,02,13

I really loved this place and especially staff who is working here.",5,2019,02,13
104,Poor handling of enquiry,"I tried to book a room via the hotels website. Seeing the 15% off for booking more than 21 days in advance, I thought I would get that discount. It didn't show up when trying to book, so I called the hotel and was given no help at all, despite talking to three different people to explain that the website was not showing the offer. Needless to say, I did not book  a room.",2,2019,02,06
104,Hidden Gem,"Stayed here for one night (breakfast included).  Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station.  Check is in was a bit long winded.  Room was a bit smaller than expected (room 604), which was situated at the front of the hotel  on the 6th floor, so was a bit noisy; we did have the windows open (it was rather warm in the room due to radiator being on when we arrived).  Despite the room being small, it was adequate for a one night stay with tea and coffee/biscuits provided.  Clean towels a plenty.  It was clean and comfortable and the bed was nice and comfortable.  Breakfast was really nice and fresh (full English) and staff in the restaurant were friendly and attentive.  The staff throughout were really nice and friendly.  Complimentary magazines and newspapers in reception.  Overall, pleasant stay and highly recommended!",4,2019,02,05

104,Location is fine but the room need to be cleaned,"When we checked in, the staff was very good and upgraded me to the club room. However, when I went into the room, the room is very small with an upstairs sitting room and kitchen. However, the couch in the sitting room was broken. The ""bedroom"" is tiny"". Once you put your suit case, not much room left, so as the washroom. There is no free water. I have to call down to buy a 1-litre water. I think that it is a bit mean.",2,2019,01,31
104,Love it,Great experience and special service provided by the staff very kind and friendly. The location is very convenient walking distance to metro station and 15 minutes away from Heathrow. We will definitely return back here !,5,2019,01,24
104,Faultless,"We were so lucky to stay at the Park Grand out of the many hundred hotels in London. The room had a great sized  and it was perfect place to come back after a long day exploring London. The staff are polite ,friendly and accommodating. parking is available outside the hotel and cost is reasonable. Will be back on next holidays",5,2019,01,24
104,"Friendliest, best hotel in Paddington!","I currently live in Bristol but commute to London every week for work, and stay in hotels throughout the week. I started this job back in September last year and spent a couple of months trying different hotels around the area as I was keen to find my ""local"" hotel where I could stay every week. 
I've tried all the Park Grands in the area as well as many other hotel chains and independent BnBs, safe to say that this hotel is the best by far!
It's clean, warm, beds are comfy, showers are hot and the breakfast is good. But the best thing about this hotel is the staff. They started to recognize me as I became a frequent visitor and the service has been second to none. I feel so welcome every time I check in, always greeted with a smile and a Welcome Back! Particularly by the lovely receptionist Irina - who is always happy and chatty. She's now moved to the morning shift so I have a little chat with her when I check out. Shawn is also amazing, so accommodating and tells me I should visit India soon. He is always a nice face to see when I return. Finally, there is Florin. He was the first person that I got to know, he is my personal bar tender and chef. When the kitchen was closed, he made me an amazing salad so I didn't have to go out in the cold or wait for a take away. When I had a bad day at work, he made me a special hot chocolate and delivered to my room without asking. These are just a few examples of the kind things he does, which makes hotel living bearable. I cannot thank the team enough here, it has become my second home. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great, friendly and comfortable stay in London!",5,2019,01,23
104,Great value,I can say is the best hotel I stayed until now in London. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Exceptional breakfast for only ¬£10/pp.Rooms clean and tidy. Close to Paddington station and Hyde park. I highly recommend. Thanks a lot to the manager and his staff.,5,2019,01,22
104,Cool stay in festive month,"Very friendly welcome from staff.Room was a good surprise. Plenty of tea and coffee options.A good hair dryer provided in the room along with Handy phone service.

Great location and easy to find. Overall a nice and comfortable hotel in Paddington location.",5,2019,01,22
104,An excellent Hotel,"Stayed in the hotel on 7 January for our anniversary. Have stayed previously and had a great experience, hence our return visit. I had booked a deluxe double room but the hotel had our previous booking details so the hotel gave us a complementary upgrade to a duplex suite. Surprisingly the doorman knew that we had stayed before by just looking at us and welcomed us with a great smile.
The reception staff was very polite and helpful. Had some difficulty getting connected to the wifi and they helped me out with it.
Loved the room. It was amazing with a big bed on the top floor and a microwave with cooler on the ground floor.
Park grand is always our holiday destination as they never let us down. Everybody is warm hearted and with a cheerfully smile. Also it is very convenient in terms of transport.
Cant wait to visit you again.",4,2019,01,21
104,Decent,"This place was good location, but just one elevator that is very bad , than some stairs while they have an elevator so the elevator don't take you to your level you need to climb 4-5 stairs aswell . The staff was ok some of them spoke very bad English you could hardly understand.",3,2019,01,20
104,"Great location, helpful staff","We stayed here for only one night but would definitely use this hotel again.  The staff were excellent and helped us to get two adjacent rooms as we were travelling as a family and could not have been more helpful.  The location is great, right near Paddington station (great for the Heathrow Express), and near lots of restaurants but the street itself is still quiet and the rooms were not stuffy.  Very comfortable beds also!  ",4,2019,01,18
104,Family Weekend,"We had excellent time in this hotel. The service was very friendly and professional, we had tasty breakfasts and a nice room. The location near the Hyde Park was perfect for us and, what was important for us, the neighborhood had its unique and inspiring British atmosphere. You can find a big amount of different restaurants near the hotel.",4,2019,01,14
104,Hotel Stay,This hotel was a gem! A two minute walk from Paddington station which is very accessible to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express and also the Undergound Tube to go anywhere you want in London. Visited for three days with friends on theater business and saw three shows and dined at so many great pubs. The Park Grand London Hyde Park is definitely a place I will stay again. The staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and courteous and the breakfast each morning was over and above. A fabulous stay And very reasonable. The room was excellent!!,5,2019,01,13
104,Incredible Second stay ,"I picked this hotel  again for my spouse birthday.We again Loved it :-) .the service was delightful .actually it was nicer then any five star hotel .Breakfast was fantastic and so tasty .

104,The People Make This Place Fabulous!!,"My daughter booked my stay with a single bed and thankfully the manager was able to put me in a room with a double bed.  THANK YOU!!!

I have stayed here before and all of the staff have been VERY friendly and helpful.  For this particular stay I would like to highlight the really great service that I received from Lucian.  Lucian took my bags to my first room and then to my second room.  Like a magician, he is always available to help, is VERY personable and is genuinely interested in how your day was.  If you would like a beverage, Lucian is there to take care of it with a smile.  While I am not really used to having someone take carry my bags, Lucian does it in a manner that is natural and effortless.

I really like the hotel and staff overall.  Lucian is the icing on the cake!!",5,2019,01,05
104,Holidays and New Year,"Perfect location and wonderful team of staff. Paddington station is nearby and few minutes walking to winter wonderland .oxford street is best option to shop with many branded stores .
Would definite stay here again.",5,2019,01,05
104,"Not a great hotel, but I do have some suggestions!","We (my husband, my 11 year old daughter, and myself) stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park for a week.  We are checking out today (1/5/2019).  First off, the pictures that they post do not match where we stayed. It's strange, because the fixtures in the bathrooms are the same, but our bathroom is tiny tiny in comparison to what I see in the photos.  It is difficult in London to find rooms with two beds, to accommodate families, but the pictures that they showed of 2-bed rooms also do not match our room.  Our room was far far more cramped.  It's difficult for me to find floor space for the suitcase to pack this morning.  The two beds are also full-size, not queen.  That's okay for my family, but may not be for yours.  So just know that.  Also, the bathroom is super tiny.  There is no counter near the sink, just a sink (with literally no counter), which is rather frustrating when you're traveling.

On some level, they cannot control the size of these rooms, but they can control what they report out in the form of these pictures, and I feel as though there is some amount of dishonesty, in that we thought we were arriving at larger, nicer accommodations.

One rather terrible thing about the rooms, and an easy problem to fix, is that the towels that they have are super thin and super tiny.  My daughter is 5 foot 2 and 84 pounds (38 kilos), and the towels barely fit around her body.  But the towels get worse.  When you wrap yourself up after a shower, you inhale chlorine fumes that match what it's like to hang out at an indoor pool.  The fumes are incredibly strong, and I just don't get it.  It's so bad, that I don't allow the towel to touch my face or hair.  A friend who is also in the hotel said that towel-drying her face made her face incredibly irritated.  This seems like such an easy problem to fix.  Throw away all of the thin horrible towels, or turn them into cleaning rags, and purchase nicer towels, and stop using so much bleach in your laundry.

The breakfast that is at the hotel is fairly nice and fairly well-priced, though the website made it seem like the breakfast is included.  To be clear, it's not.  The breakfast includes scrambled eggs, some breakfast meat (sausage or bacon or both.  I don't eat either, so I didn't take notice), nice breakfast pastries including plain croissants, and the all-important nutella, some nice fresh fruit, some yogurt, and some breakfast cereals.  It's small, but adequate, in my view.  The one problem was that I wish they would just have a tea and coffee station. Instead, you need to wait for a waitress to bring you tea or coffee, and this service was super hit or miss.  Typically, I like hotel breakfasts, b/c they speed up our mornings and let us get to our daily activities rather quickly.",2,2019,01,05
104,Family trip,"We booked familh rooms to celebrate new year.We are family of 6people travelling from indonesia.
Hotel is nicely decorated and few minutes walk from winterwonderland.Hyde park is very lovely park to go and serpentine is lovely.staff is very lovely and breakfast is amazing",5,2019,01,01
104,Never disappoints us,"There aren't many places now a days that reward you for being loyal but this hotel certainly does and welcomes you back with a warm welcome each time.

Another fantastic stay in this lovely hotel situated 5 minutes from Paddington station, also has on site parking.

Again room was spotless and all the staff amazing. Make sure you have the breakfast when you stay as Anthony and his restaurant team are fantastic and the breakfast is the perfect start to your day.

Thank you again to all at the Park Grand Hyde Park for a wonderful stay and Happy New year",5,2018,12,31
104,A Little Extra Information - Hopefully Helpful,"My wife and I stayed for two nights between Christmas and the New Year and this is our take on things:

The hotel is situated on a service road parallel to the main road which offers limited parking. We managed to find a slot near the front door and left our car in favour of taxis during our short stay. You need to pay at reception ¬£25 per night and they give you a ticket to display on your windscreen.

The reception staff were polite, efficient and more than helpful so full marks there. Our room was unusual in that it was not only split level, but had a staircase to a lounge kitchenette with a mezzanine balcony over downstairs. The all important bed was very comfortable and the shower room relatively new. Overall, not bad at all, but a bit tired here and there as this an ‚ÄúOld Duchess‚Äù hotel. 

Watch out for room service times - there is a mis-print in the room info folder and the opening ours were considerably less than we were led to believe.

We only had breakfast in the hotel (which is where I deducted a mark). The buffet is small, scrambled eggs instead of fried (no facilities for this) but when it came to the bacon..... enter my pet hate, it was smoked! Nobody spoke English for me to ask beforehand - they simply didn‚Äôt understand what I was saying so I found out the hard way. 

I admit that it is becoming a bit of a thing with me and I am probably over reacting, but all of these top hotels seem to offer smoked bacon instead of ordinary un-smoked. To top that off, this hotel is not alone in having staff that neither know the difference, care, or understand. Sorry, rant over.

So, a good hotel to stay and pretty local to all Central London facilities about 10 minutes and ¬£10 away by taxi.

Back to the bacon.......",4,2018,12,28
104,Very Nice and inexpensive,"I stayed here one night as I was passing through London.  I choose it because it is close to Paddington rail station and it is inexpensive...  around 90 GPD for a single room.  The room is small but...   the location is great and quiet, the staff are very pleasant and welcoming... And, for a basic and inexpensive place, I was surprised to have a banana, apple, cookies, coffee/tea making and a couple small bottles of complimentary water in the room and a selection of daily newspapers in the lobby.",4,2018,12,24
104,Perfect stay,"I spend such a good time in london, hotel was close to the center and also well communicated with subway line.room is well equipped with many things and hotel WiFi service is nice .Nice helpful people at reception  Recommended!",5,2018,12,21
104,Not to bad,"We stopped two nights at this hotel. Early impressions were good. Nice clean friendly reception staff who were really helpful. The room was nice fairly big very good size shower. We were on the forth floor which had no lift and the stairs were not exactly easy to climb. The only few down points to the hotel were, the menu in the room stated prices that were wrong, when challenged the reception acknowledged this and it also stated they did snacks till 11 which they don‚Äôt as there is no chef after 9. The bar man on evening was a bit harsh with this (if his shift got any tighter his buttons would pop off :) ) final point off all was the bed may have seen better days I kept rolling into the middle of it but it was bloody comfortable! all in all a good hotel to stop at good location.",4,2018,12,20
104,Nice stay,"We were travelling for a month and decided to book a hotel at last moment for our personal leisure.On trip advisor we saw this hotel and did not gave second thought to try it.
Rooms are very confortable and staff Irina,florin is a plus addition to this hotel.
Highly recomended place",5,2018,12,11
104,4th Stay!,"Back again for visit number 4! We love it here. Service from reception staff is always world-class and exceptionally friendly! Irina who checked us in (I hope I got her name right!) was lovely.
The location of this hotel really is perfect for us, particularly as our onward journey was from Paddington Overground Station! Easy links via Paddington underground and overground to all major stations across London, and within walking distance of Hyde Park, too!
Breakfast staff seemed a little unfriendly and aloof this year, and lacked their usual charm and warm personas, which was disappointing,
We were also a bit disappointed with our room this time, but this was not the hotel's fault. We have been spoiled in past visits with a room high up overlooking the pretty views at the back, including the far-off church steeple, and the planes flying low. This year, we were placed on the first floor, and unfortunately didn't have much of a view at all, however this was down to personal preference and had nothing to do with the standard or cleanliness of our room in general.
(Also... Sad to hear that the fish from reception has passed away :( )

Staff is very friendly and helpful.Paddington is nearby and primark is best for shopping.a very happy tourist",5,2018,12,08
104,Outstanding,"Well well. A hidden gem. Stayed for a week and will come back and certainly recommend. Firstly the location. Three tube stations on different lines within 600 metres.  Paddington Lancaster gate and queensway.  Proximate to hyde Park and forty minutes walk to Buckingham Palace.  The room was comfortable and certainly to our expectations.  Food was terrific for breakfast. You certainly can‚Äôt complain.  The hospitality and disposition of all staff was wonderful. The following were truly wonderful and made our stay far more enjoyable.  Lucian, Shawn and Kalvina at reception along with Ana and Anthony at breakfast.  Housekeepers were always helpful and should be acknowledged as they undertake a thankless task. Everything was spotless every day.  Thanks.",5,2018,12,02
104,Friendly staff,"We were only here for 12 hours, so only used the hotel as somewhere to sleep, which I was glad of as our room was small.

We managed to get a deal so perhaps they put us in a smaller room, but we were in a basement room and it was very compact for two people.

Bathroom was nice but needed a bit of upkeep.

Staff were very friendly and location was perfect.",3,2018,12,02
104,Brilliant stay!,"Had a great stay here, our room was lovely and a lot bigger than expected! The parking at the hotel was ideal and allowed us to keep the car there as long as we needed! All staff we came across were friendly and attentive to our needs.

104,Beautiful rooms and extremely good location,"Stayed here for my birthday we ended up getting a upgrade to the club room as the first one we stayed in was quite small and when you have a big muscly boyfriend it‚Äôs just not a good combination

104,"Nice rooms, helpful staff and great location","Stayed with a group of 12 friends for one night, after our previous hotel let us down on the last night. I wish we stayed here for the whole trip. 

The hotel is located in a quiet area, but only 5 minutes from the nearest tube station. The rooms were modern and clean and the staff were always smiling and happy to help. Thoroughly recommended.

From the time we pulled up outside until we left, the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. So polite and accommodating- nothing was too much trouble. The room was lovely and comfortable, very clean and modern. Not that we intended spending much time in it! 
Hotel location was perfect, and at a brilliant price. Had such a good weekend and staying here was icing on the cake. Will stay here again. And extra thanks to Lucian who could not do enough to help from the moment we pulled up to the door. Thank you so much.",5,2018,11,13
104,Friendly stay,"I stayed here for the first time and honestly the staff and customer service are amazing! I would definitely come back again and stay for longer.

104,Quirky,"We needed a good value, well located hotel for an evening function in town and came across this place close to Paddington. Staff gave a warm welcome and check in was a painless process. The room was a surprise! A set of stairs was an unexpected sight as the door opened. The stairs revealed the bedroom which was located on a mezzanine level, albeit the wardrobe was sited - impractically - downstairs in the lounge area which lacked any degree of home comforts and remained unused. The microwave and TV were confusing and unnecessary additions. The tiny (and I mean minute) downstairs bathroom was a tight squeeze but everything worked. Storing toiletries needed careful planning with such little space. Housekeeping could be better - carpets needed an improved vacuum and paintwork a fresh coat of gloss. The bed was a little lumpy and a zippered together variety. There is a small bar area and the breakfast room in the basement serves a predictable selection of the usual favourites. The hotel is functional and reasonable value but it's quirky rooms frustrate as much as surprise.",3,2018,11,09
104,"Very nice Hotel, with one small flaw !","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Park Grand, and the rooms were very nice.

I particularly liked the racy cartoons I found inside one of the drawers, and I laughed and cried along with strange story within, which told of a boy's quest to discover the true nature of aluminium plating.

The one gripe I had was I was surprised discover that there was no park inside the confines of the hotel, and I had to instead use Hyde Park, a public park for my meanderings.

I usually prefer to observe the local fauna in private, but I had to make do and do it in public instead.

Very good apart from that, especially the boiled eggs. I was able to order 15 hard boilers up to my room, and the staff were very helpful, especially after I explained my tip would be in Worther's Originals.",4,2018,11,09
104,Ignore the bad reviews.,We loved our stay at the Park Grand and its not the best location for shopping but after doing our math it was our best option because we wanted somewhere nice but not over priced and with an easy commute and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this grand hotel.,5,2018,11,08
104,Most plesant stay,"I stayed in this plesant hotel with my fiance for 4 nights for honeymoon trip.personal in the hotel were extraordinary friendly and helpful.food was really good especially chicken dish which I loved the most. Kind regards to reception team alrina, irina Aaron and kind manager Gurdeep",5,2018,11,08
104,business travel,"I visited to this hotel for my business travel , that location was vonderful, it's near to the train station and to the airport as well , that rooms so small but clean on it, breakfast is normally according to the europen standarts.if you going to Uk for turistic travel that you exactly selected to this location, so every turistic area is near to this location.",3,2018,11,07
104,Weekend in London,"Staff.. pleasant 
Free newspaper in reception
Breakfast.. pretty good but standard 
Room.. We were on 6th floor.. view not that brilliant I couldn't see any of the famous landmarks 
There was no fridge the first day
The room 614 was terribly small
Furniture marked
Bed was small must have been a double
Windows were a bit grubby
Lack of coathangers in the very slim wardrobe, small cups and saucers I'd take your own mug. 
Nowhere to put your toiletries in the tiny bathroom 
The toiletries supplied smelled nice
Towels were small.. no bathsheets
No tap covers so you had to just guess which way was hot or cold, bath or shower. However once you'd sussed it out it was good and fast. 
About 15 min walk to Hyde park which was great. Maybe 10 mins or so to the underground.
There was some argument with a drunk outside the hotel entrance & blood spillage ..police were there.. that was probably a one off but it surprised me. Not nice.

Wouldn't stay there again.. I think we'd get a nicer room at a premier Inn.
We had a nice weekend anyway ..it's what you make it.",3,2018,11,06
104,Great Location,We had a lovely stay at the Park Grand Hotel. It was very close to the underground and Hyde Park set in a lovely area. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff friendly. The breakfast was georgous plenty of variety. The only one criticism I had was the towels could do with an update they are a bit worn so not very absorbent.,4,2018,11,05
104,Birthday trip,"3 very important things about this place, location, service and cleanliness, all these were beyond our expectation, the location is very accessible, the staff are very helpful and accommodating, special mention to Gurdeep and Shawn, who made our stay very much comfortable, and lastly cleanliness is of good standard.

Staff is nice and manager Gurdeep is very helpful.
Rooms are big and very nicely maintained .housekeeing doing their best job and restaurant area is small",5,2018,10,24
104,Great Location but reasonable hotel,"If you are staying in Central London you need to spend a lot to get a decent accommodation. Was staying at Park Grand in single bed room and room is only for sleeping and not to spend any other time. So if you are only looking for night sleep then single bed room at Park Grand is perfect.

Staff was excellent, breakfast was good and location is perfect as most of the tourist places are nearby.

Overall for single bed room this hotel is apt for business traveler or for night sleep only",3,2018,10,23
104,Narrow rooms ,"Bedrooms are very little for familly. 
Bathroom as well is very little and not convenient for a familly. 
Looks expensive for room sizes 
Th√© view from the room was not pretty 
Parking is 25¬£ a day for outside location 
",3,2018,10,22
104,Birthday weekend,"We have now been going to this hotel go a few years. Staff are wonderful especially Gurdeep, Sagar, and Anthony who always make us feel so welcome. Breakfast is great with good variety. Hotel is very convenient for Paddington Station and Hyde Park. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We prefer the duplex room which suits our needs. We will definately be back for our yearly visit next September.",5,2018,10,20
104,Business stay,"I have stayed in Park Grand hotel during my first business trip to London, I decided to stay here again because the location is a stone throw away from Paddington station which makes it easy to get to Heathrow airport in 15 min! The neighborhood is nicr with chic restaurants around. The hotel is cosy, clean and quite luxurious.  And the hotel manager,  Gurdeep was very helpful and kind when helping me to get around. Highly recommended",5,2018,10,19
104,Recommend for the price,"Positives: close to Paddington Station, didn't worry about getting back to Heathrow to make my return flight. Clean and affordable. Even though I stayed by myself, I upgraded to the larger, two-floor room. One should expect little space in a city hotel. You want more room, expect to pay for it. Also, I booked direct and had breakfast every day for free. I came in early and I they let me take a nap in a single b/c my room wasn't ready. That was really nice of them, but glad I didn't book a single! Negatives: not a happening location, but I knew this. If you want to be in a hipper location, it'll cost more. It was close to the underground and bus stops. The breakfast was bland, but it was included, so that's OK. I would recommend this hotel for the price (as you can guess from how I reviewed it!)",4,2018,10,14
104,Grea stay,"Initially we Were booked at Grand royale London hyde park but they moved us to park grand London hyde park.
Rooms are nice but reception is not grand as our previously booked hotel.

Staff is very nice and manager Gurdeep is very helpful.

I will choose this hotel again",5,2018,10,09
104,Business stay,"Staff is friendly and location is great .rooms are smaller but well equipped with all the amenities.
Paddington is closest to the hotel and 15 minutes to Heathrow airport by express train .
WiFi service is amazing and business computer available in the hotel 

Highly recommended place",5,2018,10,06
104,Our regular hotel ,"We have been staying here through Kuwait airways and must say , it‚Äôs properly managed hotel with good vibes . 
Location 
Room 
Cleanliness 
And food which matters the most is outstanding. 
Their big asset is staff, I would like to thank Manager Sakar and Monica for great service while I was there ",5,2018,10,06
104,What could have been...,"I chose the hotel after looking at the combination of location, cost and reviews here. I must say that I was a Bit underwhelmed. The location was good and it was just a short walk from Paddington station. The room was small (as most hotel rooms in London are) and I got a room in the basement. There was no view at all, but the room had both a TV and safe. The bathroom was small but had an ok layout. The bed was excellent and I slept like a log the whole night. Breakfast was very basic but nice. The staff were very kind as well. The major gripe about both the room and the hotel itself was that it was dusty. Not dirty, but dusty. Really dusty. The bathroom was very dusty and the breakfast-room was dusty as well. If they could sort this out then this hotel would become a really interesting alternative in London. ",3,2018,10,05
104,By car trip from kuwait to Park Grand,"This is our second trip to London by car.all staff at the hotel remember us .Gurdeep manager helped us again with car parking and sorting nice room for us.Florin porter is so helpful.

104,very clean hotel,"Very clean hotel with beautiful surrounding ,  the bed is very comfortable. The hotel is a walking distance to Hayde park .We booked through booking .com and unfortunately our room was block by a high wall ,when we arrived we asked to change the room they said no other rooms were available and that make our stay unpleasant  . We may come another time but we will be sure what kind of room we will get.",4,2018,10,05
104,Great family,"Staying currently with my wife and business stay.rooms are neat and clean .rates are very expensive for my choose dates but nothing can be done .
As rates were very expensive ,hotel added one day complimentary breakfast for me .Gurdeep manager assisted me with my disappointment .
Breakfast is yummy and Anthony is a great person",5,2018,10,05
104,Four wonderful days in London,"I stayed in London 4days,the hotel is fantastic very clean and very comfortable. We had a fantastic experience and a very pleasant time. The staff are very kind and professional...

104,London excel trip,"Service is wonderful at the hotel and I have never observed this in London Hotels‚Äôs.hotel is surrounded by nice tree but sometime street can be a little noisy .
Rooms are nice and mine had 2 stories with kitchenette .lucian ,Shawn and manager Gurdeep is very helpful at reception .breakfast is very nice but little bit less option for Middle East traveller .

Overall a nice and beautiful hotel",5,2018,10,04
104,Wonderful stay and nice manager,"I was quite reluctant to stay in central London hotel but I had no option to book central as my boss booked me for a business interview in London .
I was booked in to Park Grand hotel and it was a good surprise for me .hotel rooms are nice and clean
Manager gurdee helped me with upgraded room with little extra cost .
Thank you very much Mr Gurdeepn
All in alll a good stay",5,2018,10,04
104,Business stay,"Amazing service, but the room was a little bit small. But the personal was really great 
Hotel is near to Paddington Station and 5 minutes Walking to Hyde park.
Breakfast is very good and cost ¬£10

We Will visit again for business trip",5,2018,10,03
104,Meh.  Not much for the money,"You would hope that $200 per night in London would at least give you a little bit of charm?  Not here.  There was nothing wrong per se (except for extremely irritating bed lights that would not turn off; had to remove the key card from the slot to get the room dark).  The hotel is clean and the staff friendly.  The rooms are quite small, but that is often true in London.  But everything is just a bit tired and uninspired. 

Breakfast is extra but fairly priced (10 pounds for full English, with cheaper options available).  The hotel is also quite a close walk to Paddington Underground--so the location is ok.

Would I stay here again.  Only if the price was under $135 dollars (for an upgraded room; I shudder to think how small the cheapest ones are).  It was just not a good value for the money",3,2018,10,03
104,family trip to Britain,"stayed her after taking recomendation British friend .we were not disappointed at all with his choice.we were allocated quad room on sixth floor with view.
bathrooms are small but nicely decorated .Gurdeep manager at hotel is very helpful with all the request made to him.
thank you buddies",5,2018,10,02
104,Thanks Sakar,"A fantastic boutique hotel central location in a very quiet and beautiful area of Westbourne terrace. I walked most of the London attractions easily.
I was upgraded to a very spacious club room which was amazing. The services was absolutely fantastic. We booked a hotel nearby which was absolutely disappointing and when arrived park grand with my wife , Mr Sakar who was on duty was very very kind , respectful, understanding and he did almost everything to make our stay superb service. 
I would had love to stay longer but sadly we had to get back home . 
Higly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,09,30
104,Thank you for great services Mr Sakar ,"I have enjoyed my trip at this hotel . My bank booked this hotel out of blue and didnt know what to expect. when checking in , i was greeted by Mr Sakar who is that manager with warm welcome . 
Swiftly checked into a duplex room . The room was very cosy , splitted into two different level for privacy . 
Very clean and neat room with nice decor . 
Being paddington station nearby is bonus and what makes this hotel outstanding amongst others is their genuine hospitality . 
Breakfast was fresh and nice with lots of choices . 
I loved my stay , and thank you for all staff especially Mr Sakar for everything he did to make my stay memorable . ",5,2018,09,30
104,Leisure and business,Olga and Cosmina were very friendly with special services asked for. I wish all hotel visits were that easy what comes to making additional arrangements due to changes. Location is good and it is easy to travel there by bus or tube.,5,2018,09,30
104,Great service ,"The reason why i booked it is due the services. I was recommended by my best friend who is regular to this hotel . 
They offered me very good price when booked directly. 
The rooms i was given was spacious and clean and the best part is their friendly and welcoming staff , especially manager Mr Sakar who helped me to book my hotel reservation and offered me a good room . 
Anthony at the bar was very helpful too . 
I highly recommend and will be back soon .

104,Great stay and great hospitality,"While searching on internet ,i came across park grand group. After further search and  reading few reviews online i decided to book.i was little concern over rooms sizes but nothing much can be done in typical london hotels rooms.
I was checked in by Mr Gurdeep on arrival and was escorted to room by Lucian conceirge .team is willing to assist you extra and easy to deal with .
Room was shockingly big and very clean .breakfast is purely english but restaurant guys can assist yoh with more variety of breakfast.
I will definately choose this hotel again to stay .",5,2018,09,29
104,London Holidays,"I cannot say anything more then to say that this hotel is located in superb location and most importantly staff is so helpful .Mr. Gurdeep at hotel is so helpful and kind to fulfill our needs.
Rooms are small but nice decorated .breakast is yummy and served in lower level in the restaurant.

Definitely I am a very happy customer of Park Grand",5,2018,09,28

104,Pretty comfy hotel near Paddington,"I just stayed overnight, which meant I really didn't bother where I stayed. But this hotel caught my eye after some research, and overall I can't say that I was disappointed. Quite small single rooms but comfy beds and nice bedrooms. Although covered with some flies that I had to chase down and kill.

Free (and good!) wifi and good breakfast. It got the job done!",3,2018,09,25
104,Lovely hotel with excellent staff service ,"Enjoyed our 5night stay at your hotel. Very helpful & kind hearted staff. Breakfast was amazing and most enjoyable.

104,Nice but...,"This hotel has a great location, a walking distance from Hayd park. Also, The receptionist was very kind and friendly. They gave us a room that was underground; you can‚Äôt even see the sky from the window. I hated the room so much that I couldn‚Äôt wait till the next morning to checked out.
However, the room and the toilet were clean.",4,2018,09,23
104,Excellant stay wonderful hotel,I absolutely loved my stay at the Hotel Park Grand Hyde Park. It was a beautiful hotel in the very heart of London walking diatance to Oxford street.  Really lovely communal area with a fabulous bar and a sonderful reception area with sitting sofa. Also benefits from having the use of restaurents in the basemdsnt of the hotel where i requested to uae for my meetings during the day. The suite rooms ar the hotel are lovely if a little small but for this part of london and your not in london to sitbin your room.The staff was very welcoming at thw reception specially mention to the Manager Sakar and Shawn at the reception who were exceotionally helpful friendly warm and keen to help.

104,Quick trip to London ,"Great location. Small room but comfy bed. 
The best part of our stay was Lucian. He was so accommodating and helpful. A very kind man. 
The only negative was when we arrived. We were greeted at the desk ( don‚Äôt know his name) and he asked where we were from. We said NY. His comment was, New Yorkers are the most unfriendly people he‚Äôd ever met. Thank you sir for the warm welcome. Luckily we didn‚Äôt see him again. Everyone else was lovely, and again made even better because of Lucian. ",4,2018,09,22
104,Always delighted to stay here,"I have stayed at this Park Grand several times and it is always a delight.  The hotel property is well located, short walk from Paddington station, yet tucked away in a quiet neighborhood.  The rooms are nice. I stayed in their club room, which I normally do - it is very comfortable. The room is spacious with all the amenities for a comfortable stay. 

What differentiates this property is the hotel staff.  Gurdeep the manager is a pleasure to deal with.  He is always available to take care of any odd situation that may arise.  Anthony in the breakfast room keeps the place running like a well oiled machine.  The front desk staff is always helpful.  When I checked in, I saw the duty manager Sakar training a trainee very patiently.  

This hotel is a hidden gem in London.",5,2018,09,22

Rooms are very small but has everything to meet businessman requirements.staff is very helpful .
Breakfast was not included so cannot day much about it.",5,2018,09,21
104,Such a wonderful hotel ,"What a wonderful hotel ! 
We were arriving over night flight from texas , got to the hotel and our gorgeous room was ready early at 7.30am . 
Travelling with our teenagers son and daughter was perfect for all for of us on family room. They dont do dinner as such , except sandwiches and panini , however plenty of restaurants within 5 mins walk to Paddington station.  Front desk helped us bookings us to various sites and were fantastic service.  
Its was indeed a perfect one week at park grand in London.  
Thank you all for having us ",5,2018,09,21
104,Fantastic hotel and great services ,"This is indeed a great hotel and staff are were welcoming enough for us . The hotel is in an excellent location with easy access to Heathrow airport. 
There are loads of restaurants nearby to Paddington Station London. 
Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice and freshly cooked English breakfast. 
The rooms are crispy clean , very spacious and comfortable. The great assets of this hotel is their staff . All staff are very welcoming, friendly and they outmost with your requests. 
I would like to thank Mr Sakar who treats us like his own family and always makes sure we have pleasant stay . ",5,2018,09,21
104,Business stay,"Great hotel. Very impressed with the staff and the service. Daily breakfast served makes it very convenient.

Special thanks to the Hotel Manager Mr. Gurdeep Singh, who goes out of the way to make your stay comfortable.",5,2018,09,21
104,It would take a long time to detail how bad this hotel is.,"I'll mention the positives first which won't take long. The hotel location is in a good location and the head waiter tried his best to cope with some of the hotel's failings. That was quick.

Whoever awarded this place a 4* needs to seriously think again. I would guess 2* at best.

We booked a Deluxe Double room which was absolutely tiny with barely enough space to walk past the end of the bed. We asked for a larger room but were told that although others have different layouts they are all the same size. I hate to think what a standard room is like.

The shower cubicle was dirty with lots of black mould, the base unit was worn to bare wood in places and the fridge compartment was just a hole presumably where the fridge had been ripped out, the toilet role holder was hanging off the wall, the window was dirty with a frame bodged up with mastic and a rotten sill and the bathroom grout was dirty and missing in places.

A minor point was the cheap toiletries but a major point was a restaurant that just can't cope when the hotel is busy. At breakfast, we were asked to go back upstairs to the reception area and wait to be called as there were 18 people ahead of us in the queue and the restaurant doesn't have much capacity. As we didn't have a lot of time we decided to eat elsewhere so asked for a refund of the cost of the breakfast but were stone walled by ""the breakfast is free to guests booking direct so there's nothing to refund"". Interestingly, there was a large framed notice on the desk detailing the cost of breakfasts - ""but that doesn't apply to you Sir - yours is free"" What a load of black pudding.

However, is suspect we may have jumped the queue after complaining and the head waiter was very pleasant and did his very best to look after us and quickly supplying plates etc that had run out etc. Although the guests next to us complained about the wait for their food, we didn't have that problem.

In summary, I suggest you steer well clear of this hotel; we certainly won't be back.",1,2018,09,21
104,Only reason to stay is location.,"Hotel rated a 4 star. It's a 2+ at best. I used points with my high end credit card which came through as an Expedia booking. We were relegated to the smallest room which was marginally clean. Although i did not pay a discount rate the hotel treated it as the cheapest of bookings. When I complained they said well, you booked on Expedia so this is the room you get. Specifically, beds were hard, pillows were awful, carpet seemed dirty, bathroom so small you could barely turn around.",2,2018,09,14
104,Very disappointed,"The front desk night attendee was missing when I wanted to check out at 4:00AM despite being assured the night before that I could check out anytime.

After 10 minutes of searching, I eventually found the person asleep at his desk in the private area. I then tried to wake him up. He was extremely rude to be waken up and said that I should not be in the private area. 

I then waited another 10 minutes for him to come out of the backroom. I asked him to be checked out. He fell asleep again in front of his computer and it took another 10 minutes for him to be awake enough to type my room number on the keyboard. I had a flight to catch and was running dangerously late.

This is in addition to the fact that I found out that my sheets had not been changed and were dirty.",1,2018,09,13

104,"Small rooms, needs refurbishment, poor bar and lobby area.","Very disappointed wit this hotel - I travel to London on a regular basis and stayed here on this occasion as other hotels were booked. As a female travelling alone I did not feel safe, Rooms very very small and basic - in need of refurb, public areas such as bar and lobby were practically non existent and had to leave hotel to get food as no food available in evenings.",2,2018,09,04
104,Great hotel,"The staff were very polite and helped us make sure we had a Taxi whenever we needed one and they helped us with directions all the time. The rooms were very small but very clean and new. The beds were also very comfortable. The hotel was in a great Location, it was a five minute walk to some great restaurants and cafes. It was also located about a 10 minute walk to Paddington Station which was very convenient for when we had to catch a train and did not need a taxi. We would definitely recommend staying here.",4,2018,09,03
104,Simply perfect ,"Very nice surprise from my best mate on my birthday! Small hotel with traditional British touch . Very pleasant with nice Victorian building in a very quiet atmosphere.

I must say i love the hotel , always warm smiles and MR Sakar always goes above and beyond to fulfill our request . 
Super location and spacious rooms .
Already booked for next year . ",5,2018,08,26
104,Not my cup of tea...,"I know it‚Äôs London and so on, most of the hotels have small rooms and prices are not fair compared to what you get. But i must say that this is a bit to claustrophobic for me. The room is very tiny, the bathroom as well, i could manage a small room if the space was used wiser, but it‚Äôs not, it is just a huge irritation. No space to open your luggage without taking half of the hallway area, not even possible near the bed. The bathroom is like a closet, no storage for your toiletries and so on, just a zink, a toilet and a shower. The lack of storage places really annoys me, cause all your stuff just adds up and make the experience even more tensed. 

Besides the size, the room also need an overall update, i would not rate this as a 4star hotel, more likely a 3star. 

The staff though, really polite and helpful, but for me, it doesn‚Äôt level out, i feel like i‚Äôve wasted 330pounds, living three days in a closet...",2,2018,08,25
104,Central location to explore London,"Stayed at Park Grand London for a week.  Located very close to Hyde Park and easy access to the London Underground.  Several cafes and stores within walking distance from the hotel.  The pleasant surprise was the quality of dinner and lunch we had at the hotel restaurant!   While we were not looking specifically for Indian food it was a delight to eat at the hotel.  They have an authentic Indian chef (Altaf) cooking the meal.  Tried Fish Curry, Prawn pepper Masala and some starters.   Top notch quality.
Front desk staff (Felicia and Xavier) are very polite and responsive.  All in all  we enjoyed staying and dining here.  Thank you.",4,2018,08,22
104,Over night stay ,"Lovely location and pleasant staff. Very poor noise insulation between floors. I booked the room for a good nights sleep before a long flight and heavy footsteps above kept me awake throughout the night. So if you are light sleeper, definitely not the place for you. ",2,2018,08,21
104,Vacation in London ,"My brother booked me here for two nights from travel agent . 
When i arrive , they checked me in to a single room swiftly into a basement room . 
The room was small but very clean and bed was good enough for one person , the bathroom was good , comfortable and shower was very good . 
I had a breakfast here which was delicious but if had more varieties or even an arabic breakfast would have been nice too . 
Staff are very respectful and welcoming. 
Mr Sakar was very nice , he came across as my good friend . Very well managed hotel . 
Location is very very good and i will come back . ",5,2018,08,20
104,small room in paddington,"stayed here march 20-24 2018. 

Pros:
1. walking distance from Paddington station

3. staff were very courteous

5. Walking distance to the office 

Cons
1.Single bedroom, a bit small to be honest. but its company paid, free, so not really complaining.",4,2018,08,19
104,"Nice, peaceful and relaxed...","Great hotel of this class. Hotel was very clean as well as the room.  Will definitely stay here again when visiting the area, and would highly recommend it to others.  I'm glad I had the distinct pleasure of staying at this superb hotel for my holiday. My stay was absolutely perfect. From the kind, courteous, and professional staff, to the meticulous, comfortable room and common areas, restaurant and the breakfast buffet my experience was nothing less than exceptional. Thanks Sakar..",5,2018,08,19
104,Business trip,"We had a one night stay whilst on a business trip. The hotel standard is poor in comparison to how the images showcase the hotels and rooms online. The hotel rooms are noisey, outdated and appear more like a 3* hotel than a 4. We will not be staying here again.",2,2018,08,17
104,Below average room for high price,"I normally don't go out of my way to make reviews but this was a below average stay.
We paid 175 gbp for a small room, in the basement. It all seems so rundown, the light fixtures were cracked and broken. The shower didn't drain. Rooms are tiny. Overall I'm quite disappointed for what was supposed to be a nice stay. Definitely not coming back",3,2018,08,15
104,Professional and great services. Thanks !!,"We again had a great service provided by the hotel. 
The service we received exceeded with our highest expectations. Special thanks to Mr Sakar , Dimitry and the team who made our stay super perfect. I highly recommend this hotel to my friends, families and everyone who is looking for memorable stay . ",5,2018,08,14
104,Another REALLY HAPPY STAY,"I have visited this wonderful hotel a few times over the years and truly without fail, they are the just fabulous every time I visit. I know you hear things on review sites and think is that even true, but in this case it  really is the case..!! Right from walking in, to seeing the familiar and new faces of staff, everyone is warm, kind and attentive..

I went for a long weekend and my train journey to London wasn't too great, as my train got cancelled, but seeing Sakar and meeting Dimitri  was a really nice welcome to being back in London.

I can tell you about the great access to shops around the areas, eateries, Paddington Station only being 5/6 minutes away. Kensington Gardens is also just a few minutes away, so you are really at the heart of things. However the hotel, the atmosphere the staff create, just makes it feel like home. You feel safe, looked after and valued. 

I genuinely haven't seen customer service like this, as it feels like you are amongst family and that includes all the little things that are done for you! Just to point out also. I got late for my return train back to Yorkshire too. Although my own fault as I got caught up with things, the staff were really helpful and sympathetic. 

Thank you to Sakar and the whole team, you made this weekend another memorable one and I look forward to seeing you soon!

Highly recommended to everyone!!",5,2018,08,14
104,"Good Location, Avoid Rooms In the Basement","Centrally located and near the metro, which allows one to explore London easily. It is also near Hyde Park, which is worth a visit. Staff were friendly but not overtly familiar.

On our first night, we were given a room in the basement. Upon the opening of the lift doors, one‚Äôs senses were assaulted with the stale musky air emanating from the kitchen. Smelt of old curry and socks. Unfortunately we could not change the room till the second night. Room also smelled bad despite the A/C and were left with clothes and hair that smelt like curry. Was thoroughly disappointed with the poor ventilation. Thankfully the flight to London was enough to render us unconscious for the night.

They were able to give us a room on the top floor. However, accessibility is rather precarious as one would have to take the lift to the highest (fifth storey if I‚Äôm not mistaken) and then climb a flight of stairs up to the next level. Was rather difficult to bring the luggage down the narrow stairs.",3,2018,08,13
104,very good  hotel ,"I stayed here for three nights in single room for travel agent . The room was nice , very clean . The bed was ok to sleep for one person . iI love the location because it is very easy to get to anywhere in london . 
All staff are very helpful like Florin and the manager  Mr Sakar of couseos the best one . i already booked cor next friday and looking forward to stay .

104,"Perfect location,beautiful rooms and special thanks to SAKAR,ALRINA AND ANDREAA ","Perfect in every way I could say!! The moment we walked through the door the doormen welcomed us cheerful and helped us with the bag. Mr sakar the manager was kind enough to upgrade my double room to a club double. Ohh what a lovely front facing room. It was 125. Alrina and Andreaa helped me alot in terms of booking tours and and making other arrangements. Rest of the staff were very friendly but I had a lot of conversations with the above mentioned staff. Paddington station and lancaster gate is like 5 to 10 mins walk which is very convenient.
In all the next time I visit London i will make sure to stay in Park Grand London Hyde Park.
Thanks Sakar and your Team ",5,2018,08,12
104,fantastic staff and excellent customer services ,"Its always a bargain when staying at park grand . Prices are very reasonable . i have been visiting for few times and so far no complaints. 
rooms are always comfortable and the bathroom spotless. 
we both love their chicken panini and curry which serves during evening .

i would like to thank Aaron , dimitri, florin , Anthony and Andreea.

104,What a great little hotel,"We‚Äôve just got back from our first stay at this hotel, it won‚Äôt be the last time we stay here, it will now be our first choice of hotel to stay at in London, it‚Äôs the best hotel we‚Äôve used in London by a comfortable margin and we‚Äôve used quite a few 
We received a lovely welcome in the immaculate reception area, hot towels to clean our hands and face with and freshly squeezed orange juice from Bogdan were a pleasant surprise 
He then took our bags and guided us to the lift to go to our club room on the fourth floor, he showed us how to use everything from the air conditioning through to the heated bathroom floor.
What a lovely clean room, comfortable bed, great shower, Ellemis toiletries and every accessory you could need including a smart phone that you could take out with you with no charge for calls made!!
Lancaster Gate tube station is only a 5 minute walk away, or if you fancy a walk you can reach Marble Arch in easy 15 minute walk, all on the flat.
The hotel is situated in a very quiet mainly residential area, we had a room at the rear and didn‚Äôt hear a thing over night other than a couple of guests arriving back after their night out. The sound insulation on the rooms appears to be very good, or the other guests are very quiet!!
The breakfast room is very modern and if the same high standard as is the rest of the hotel and again just as the reception staff what very polite and efficient waitresses
We had the continental breakfast on both mornings, lots of choice, salmon, boiled eggs, cheeses, cold meats, yoghurts, breads, croissants, cereals, compotes and cereals, great coffee and an endless supply of toast!!
If anyone from The Park Grand is reading this can I just say well done, whoever recruits and trains your staff is doing a superb job.

104,"Poor service, BEWARE‚Ä¶","I booked my hotel about two months out before my trip. Two days before my arrival they did a pre authorize to my card. My card co declined it as it looked suspicious. The hotel never sent me an email explaining what they did and why. I just thought they made a mistake. When I got to the ft desk after a long flight, and about ten min of searching they discovered my booking was cancelled. No notice, no email, nothing. 

The girls at the front were kind of stiff and did not speak English very clearly they told me I could have a booking at there sister hotel for 400. She 100% made it seem like my booking site dropped my reservation. Upon calling them they said it was the hotel who did. I about panicked because I only paid 100 per night. I told her no way am I paying 400 a night for this place. Then she corrected herself and informed me it was the same rate I was getting. This all took about an hr to figure out. 

I have stayed at this property twice before and was happy with it. I will never stay here again. The staff was not very friendly upon check in(the door guy was really nice though). It started my VERY much needed holiday off on a very wrong foot. And what's worse is the property they sent me to was not nice at all! I gave them two stars because I did get a reservation and the door guy who was sweet.",2,2018,08,11

    On first sight hotel looked very nice on a road of like wise properties, some quite bleak and unwelcoming. Reception staff were very welcoming and helpful.
    The room was quite small and would probably suit one person rather than two!
      The bed all though clean, could probably do with another mattress as we kept rolling into the middle!

104,Very Disappointing,"I am currently staying here 21st July 2018 in allegedly a Club Double room. This is meant to be a 4 star hotel but the room is so small for 2 people to be in. The King-sized bed is actually 2 singles pushed together and feels more like the quality you‚Äôd expect in a Travelodge. The bath towels are very small, threadbare, thin and pretty useless. The hairdryer smells of burning and glows orange inside. There isn‚Äôt a microwave as advertised on their website. The complimentary ‚Äòhalf bottle of wine‚Äô is only 18.7 cl and so not half a bottle. Oh and they only offer red wine -nothing else. The bathroom floods after taking a shower, lampshades are damaged, light bulbs are different colours and the complimentary fresh fruit was only 3 items. Considering this was our anniversary and we paid for the most expensive room available this is all very upsetting and disappointing. It‚Äôs certainly not 4 star.",2,2018,07,21

104,What a gem!,"My partner and I stayed here due to the hotel‚Äôs proximity to Hyde Park (we were attending a concert). We arrived far too early but the staff were so friendly and did everything they could to make life easy, storing our luggage and letting us into our room as early as possible. On top of this we were given a free upgrade to a duplex room, which was amazing! A spacious room spread over two floors with an enormous bed! After staying in a boutique hotel in Paris I was concerned about size but here I was at the lap of luxury. It would definitely be my first choice if returning for another event! ",5,2018,07,14
104,Excellent ,"Me and my partner stayed here for one night. One night was not enough. Everything about this hotel was exceptional,  the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Upon on arrival we was told we‚Äôd been upgraded to the duplex suite free of charge. I would highly recommend this hotel, and will most certainly revisit,
Thank you for a pleasant stay",4,2018,07,14
104,Avoid if possible and ask lots of questions before booking.,We spent three nights at the Park Grand in July- booked for us by our travel agent. The location is desirable and the staff friendly but the room we received was miserable. The room was so small there was not room to open our luggage. We had a full size bed - tiny at best. The view looked out on a dirty building and plenty of dirty garbage. You could hear every neighbors toilet flush and shower and the bathroom so miniature. It might be OK for a single traveler for business but was not an appropriate room for two people.,2,2018,07,13
104,FABULOUS!,"As with many other travelers, i pop onto have a read of the recent reviews  so i can gauge the average level of expectancy. I really wanted to enjoy my accommodation and i can assure you i will most definitely be returning to this gem of a hotel in central London!
I had requested on my booking that i  didn't want a lower level room and the staff made sure that the room given met with my satisfaction. Due to the high temps outside during our stay the air conditioning was much needed and the room was of a decent size so the air circulated sufficiently. The breakfast room was located in the basement, however it still had a bright airy feel to it, with a great selection of items and the staff were on hand to serve teas, coffees and offer help if needed.
The location and staff are fantastic and i can''t wait to return. ",5,2018,07,12
104,Very mediocorre,"My husband and I stayed one night at this property when we found out at the last minute we needed a room in London.  The room was not as described on line.  We were in an executive 3 person room on the first floor.  It seemed this room was added as an afterthought.  A twin bed was added in a little alcove, which was not a great design.  Also, a tiny window was installed that faced a concrete wall about two feet in front of it.  I wonder if it would have proper egress if necessary due to the size and where that would lead you.  So no natural light, which in mind should come with a room withe executive designation.  The general restroom for the hotel was next to our room down a small hall off reception along with maintenance supplies.  This caused noise at odd times.  The bathroom did not come with basic amenities.  There was a soap dispenser attached to the wall and no real soap for the shower.  The room was clean, though the carpet not as much.  The description of the lounge as spectacular is quite an over statement.  The front desk staff did their job ... check in was efficient.  I was disappointed when I asked for the name of a near by pub that they could not provide a list of recommendations or any verbal suggestions just told us to make a few turns and we would find a suitable street.  Not horrible, but not worth the cost and much more could be done.  Not a good a reasonable value for the rates.",3,2018,07,06
104,Thanks Mr Sakar ,"I got back to London from vacation from my home country in Saudi Arabia. When I got to London Heathrow I found this hotel on booking.com abc happily booked for two nights. 
Later on due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to modify my booking into one night , I spoke to booking.com and send them an e-mail . They informed me to speak to the hotel directly. I spoke to Mr Sakar who‚Äôs a hotel manager. He was very kind and helpful person. I explained him my circumstances and he happily changed my dates . 
I will definitely come back to stay in this hotel in future as I often travel from Heathrow and staying somewhere close is a bonus and more especially with helpful manager like Mr Sakar I would not think to stay somewhere else . 
It‚Äôs a nice hotel , room is good , very clean and bathroom was spotless and location is fantastic. 
See you guys in few months time and I will book directly with you . ",5,2018,07,01
104,Good ol' common sense,"I can't speak highly enough of the duty manager Sakar. Not only a genuinely nice guy... but someone who understands the importance of being helpful and flexible in a non-standard situation.
Instead of repeating the famous phrases 'I'm afraid that's not possible' & 'we can't do it like that' he takes control and puts the customer first. 
This is what makes a hotel great... not the decor or amount of marble on the walls!
Great work!",5,2018,06,29
104,thank you so much Mr Sakar ,"I often stay here for work and leisure and must say I love visiting here . 
the staff are always friendly and accommodating ,  the atmosphere in the lobby is very welcoming.  
I must mention Mr Sakar and Alrina which helps me with everything I asked and looks after me all the time .
thanks you ",5,2018,06,27
104,Nice Boutique Hotel,"I traveled to London recently for a quick girls get away! We arrived in London from America at 8am and to our delight our room was ready about 45 minutes after our arrival. This hotel is centrally located in London and very close to the Unground Train station. Although the rooms are small, they are clean and comfortable. The bathroom floors are heated and the water pressure is delightful. 

I must give a special shout-out to Demitri. From the moment that we arrived, Demitri was VERY friendly and professional. No request was too small or too big for him‚Ä¶his only concern was providing great customer service. He provided great insight on ‚Äòthings to do‚Äô, traveling around London and providing great recommendations for food.  Demitri is an ABSOLUTE asset to this hotel! 

The only hiccup I encountered during my stay is, they did not get a food/beverage delivery. As such, the hotel did not have several items such as cranberry juice or certain sodas for a few days. 

I would not hesitate to stay here again on my next trip to London!
",4,2018,06,26
104,Not exactly the best,"We had booked the Queen size room at the sister hotel at The Park Grand London Paddington.  On arrival (approx 11pm) with a 4 year old child, we were tired and just wanted to have a shower and get to bed.  Unfortunately they had a flood in the basement which they had just finished drying/fixing.  We were told that our room was a little damp and was in the basement.  We refused the offer as we didnt want a room without a window/fresh air (it was 28c that evening).  They offered to put us up in the sister hotel Park Grand Hyde Park.  On arrival they had a room ready, however it was not what i was expecting.  We got a double bed instead of a queen, and the bathroom was so tiny!  Management were good",3,2018,06,25
104,Thanks to the Manager Mr Sakar ,"Mr.Sakar was amazing he‚Äôs hospitality is incredible, he tried to help in so many ways in my reservation. He gave me an awesome room . And a free breakfast was included the location of the place is perfect and is near the paddington train only 6min away by walking. When I‚Äôll be in London again I‚Äôll definitely be back here . ",5,2018,06,22
104,"Great location, quite expensive for a very average hotel","We stayed here last Saturday night to enjoy a rare child free weekend. We found a secure car park a 10 minute walk from the hotel and the location in terms of Hyde Park is fantastic. It is set on a lovely road where pretty much every other building is a different hotel.
Inside it is kitted out well with pretty modern decor and has everything you typically expect in this type of hotel. The service was very friendly so no complaints there. The only issue we encountered was the breakfast, the space is quite limited and as we didn't prepay the night before we were told there would be a 45 minute wait, as a result we checked out and went elsewhere.
Overall a nice hotel in a very good location.",4,2018,06,20
104,Excellent Experience Good Location and welcoming Staff,This hotel is centrally located in London and very near to Unground Train station. Here Staff are very friendly and welcoming. I would like to thank Mr. Sakar who pleasently helped me to change my room on my request. Cheers,5,2018,06,16
104,Good location Great staff,"Stayed here this week for one night with some work colleagues.  The positives are: 10-15 min walk from Paddington, hotel staff are friendly and efficient, breakfast was really good and they let you leave your luggage after check out to collect later.  The negatives: my single room was really small, only had one pillow which was rock hard, shower doors didn‚Äôt close properly and you can clearly hear guests in neighbouring rooms. ",4,2018,06,16
104,"Great location, average value","Location: Conveniently situated close to restaurants, coffee shops, metro and Hyde park. The area has nice buildings and streets throughout.

Rooms: We were slightly shocked when our room was located in the basement of the basement without any daylight. It's not what we'd expect from a ""grand"" hotel's ""superior"" room that, at about USD 200 per night wasn't exactly cheap either. (The manager seems to occasionally respond to such criticism in reviews by suggesting one should call the hotel in advance so that they can ""suggest a room category"", but room pictures and descriptions on the hotel's website (via which we made our booking) do not indicate that some (about 20) rooms don't have natural light. I find this omission at least misleading.)
Bed and bathroom were nice and appeared relatively new.
We got a room with daylight on the 2nd floor for the second night, which had equally good interior, and overall made for a much better experience.

Breakfast: Nice breakfast room, very friendly staff, good selection of food. Overall very good!

Overall: Good hotel in convenient location, would have been great, except for the episode with the daylightless basement room.",3,2018,06,15
104,Amazing experience ,"I must admit I was skeptical about this hotel at first , reasons because I always feel pictures are deceptive but boy was I wrong. Stayed in a double room which was well apportioned for a Central London location. The shower was amazing! I got the room and breakfast deal and the breakfast was decent. I was satisfied with the facilities really- good and safe location too with proximity to.2 stations: Paddington and Lancaster Gate. 

But the selling point- The staff. Oh my! I felt at home. All staff were warm and friendly. From the reception to the dining to room service - very receptive and attentive to your needs. Diana, Alrina, the trainee Andrea (can‚Äôt really remember), Floretin and the Manager ! So so wonderful. 

Thanks Park Grand Hyde Park for an awesome experience. I will definitely come back here when next I‚Äôm in town. Keep up the good work, Tobi. ",4,2018,06,13
104,Continues to impress,"I stayed at Park Grand again earlier this week after 2 months away. Mr. Sakar remembered my name, dealt with me in a wonderfully courteous manner (with Alina) - and made me feel very welcome at the Hotel again. It's very nice to have such service, and I remain a huge fan of the hotel.",5,2018,06,13
104,Awful Experience,"The Hotel was obviously intentionally overbooked. Arriving around midnight, I had to wait for around 30 minutes before a driver brought me to another hotel. It appeared like this all was a standard procedure for the hotel, using their very good location in order to lure guests, distributing them to hotels that are nowhere as close to Paddington station. The hotel room I was brought to was awful, loud, dirty, in an unattractive location and extremely small (there wasn‚Äòt even space to put down a small suitcase). I will avoid this hotel at all cost.",1,2018,06,09
104,Big fat Thanks to Mr Sakar ,"Best place to stay for all purposes be it business or leisure. Good connectivity, well appointed rooms, courteous staff especially Mr Sakar and nice breakfast. I have stayed on 5 occassions. Got a complimentary upgrade also once.",5,2018,06,08
104,I love Park Grand London Hyde Park,"It was very nice to stay in this hotel not far from Underground station and circle. People like Florim, Dimitri and Arina are very nice. Before I came I told them that I am in ramadan and I am fasting. So they gave me th English breakfast every 9pm. Love this guys and their hospitality. I recommend everybody to stay here for their trip to London.",5,2018,06,05
104,Recommend,Our family of 3 stayed last week for 2 nights in the triple sharing room. Slightly small for 3 with bags but other than that we had a very nice stay in all respects. Special mention of DIANA at the Reception who was always very helpful. Thank you.,4,2018,06,02
104,One night stay on our honeymoon,"My husband and I had a one night stay at this hotel on our way to our honeymoon. The hotel was clean and the room bigger than those found in many London hotels. The location was excellent with a short walk to Hyde park or to the underground and with many good restaurants nearby. The staff were friendly and attentive and when they learned it was our honeymoon could not have been nicer- which is not something a gay couple can say of all places to be honest. The manager even bought us a drink to celebrate! We will definitely stay here again, thank you!",5,2018,06,01
104,Great find in London and especial   thanks to Mr Sakar ,"Sorry for this is a very late review posting, But we had a fantastic time at this hotel . What made it so special for us was the hotel Manager Mr Sakar who always came up with the best things to and visit in london . We wanted to take our parents to the best Japanese restaurant in London for their 50th anniversary . He made lots of efforts making reservations at ZUMA Mayfair . It was just an amazing experience . Thank you Sakar . 
I strongly recommend this hotel as a base to be in London, only a short stroll to Oxford street and there is many restaurant and groceries close by . 
Thank you Mr Sakar

104,Lovely!,"Perfectly located a couple of minutes walk from Paddington and Hyde Park this hotel ticks the boxes.
It is:
1. Clean and comfortable 
2. Well appointed - rooms are small - standard
3. Breakfast buffet is delicious 
4. Family friendly - our room was a loft and downstairs area. Whilst the stairs are a little steep, the set up of this room suited our family of two adults and two children (9 and 10) well. The children shared the sofa bed downstairs. I struggled to find family friendly accommodation in London and this was perfect.
Last and certainly not least, the staff at Park Grand London Hyde Park were wonderful! I had requested early check in as our 24 hour flight from Australia arrived at 7am. To our absolute delight our room was ready about 1/2 hour after our arrival. The reception staff and in particular one of the door men were so very helpful and friendly it made our stay even happier.
Thank you Park Grand for making our stay in London so enjoyable.",4,2018,05,27
104,Not all Park Grand are same,"I stayed several times in another Park Grand and must say that they all of the same name. Yes interior looks also same. But that‚Äôs it. 
I didn‚Äôt know that a room can be so tiny. Somebody in jail has more space. And it was not really clean plus the room was ‚Äûused‚Äú. 
Next back to my old Park Grand. ",3,2018,05,27
104,5-stars service,"Spent three nights in this hotel and was very pleased with the accommodations and location. At check in I asked for a larger room (from reading online, single rooms are too small for comfort) and the person at the desk was able to accommodate my request with no issues. There was a problem with the door of my room though so I was upgraded to an even larger room at no cost, making my stay even more comfortable. I was very pleased with how this was handled and am very grateful for having spent three nights in comfort and peace. Every staff member was eager to please and so nice. I loved the location of the hotel as well; close to Paddington station, Lancaster station and most importantly to Hyde Park. The area of the hotel felt very safe and was very clean. Would not hesitate to stay here again on my next trip to London!",5,2018,05,27
104,Thank you Sakar ,"I have been staying here for past four years and I always feels like home away from home. 
Each and every member of staff greets me like a family and especially Manager Mr Sakar outmost with his hospitality. 
Very descent place to stay in London and fantastic service. 
Cheers ",5,2018,05,25
104,Love this hotel and Diana,"All the employees that work in this hotel are friendly, which is very important to a foreigner I guess. It feels like home. 

Spot of the hotel is really good. It is very close to Paddington station, which is quite convenient for a traveler.

I indeed had a very delightful experience in this hotel, especially meeting Diana from the front desk. She was very kind and gave us lots of assistance during our stay, really appreciated! And more importantly, she was also the most gorgeous woman that I've seen during those days. I do not know how to not be a friend with such nice and beautiful lady, I'm hoping she would be able to see this comment and contact or reply me if possible =)",4,2018,05,21

So nice! Best hotel in london.
I was given 

Staff was so welcoming!! And decalf coffee was delicious. 

Hope to stay here again soon!!!

Loved it very much.  Bed sooo comfy. I recommend staying here. 

Sakar thanks for the amazing service!!!",5,2018,05,17
104,Excellent Hotel,"This was an absolutely wonderful hotel to stay in. It's location was perfect for a traveler on the go, such as myself, with easy access to a tube station and bus stop and lots to do in the area around it. The Room itself was extremely clean and well furnished with a comfy bed. Most importantly though their staff is excellent. I had a slight issue with my reservation being slightly messed up by the agent I booked through, but the the manager himself, Mr. Sakar, persobally helped sort out my issue and get me checked in quickly and without a fuss. He gave me a bunch of recommendations for local bars and places to go see while I was staying in the area as well and I had a fantastic evening at the pub he had suggested because of his recommendation. Overall a fabulous hotel with wonderful staff. 10/10 would stay again.",5,2018,05,13
104,"Amazing stay, hotel and thank you Sakar, you were amazing","I emailed before my stay with some special requests for myself and my wife, as a newly married couple, when we arrived we found we had been upgraded to a gorgeous suite and they had gone above and beyond what we expected.

Everything was stunning and the staff were so helpful and friendly, especially the manager Sakar. First class service the whole way through our stay!!! The room was modern, spotless and spacious with some really special touches put into our room. I think it worth repeating just how amazing the staff and manager were, nothing was too much trouble. They made the stay a delight, from beginning to end. I feel like we should have paid double for what we got, the rooms, the service and location. 

The location is also perfect for tourists, Everything was so close.WIll definitely stay again. Can't recommend highly enough. Stop looking and just book this. You wont regret it, it is a steal!",5,2018,05,07
104,Thank you Sakar!!,"We had the most amazing stay at Park Grand last night. we have been married for 3 weeks and my husband called up the hotel in advance to tell them that we were coming - they upgraded us to a beautiful deluxe suite, decorated the bed and put out extra chocolates and really went out their way to make our stay special. they didn't have enough space for us to park onsite, but the next day allowed us to leave our car there all afternoon complimentary. this was all thanks to Sakar, the incredibly kind and helpful manager who sorted it all out for us and really went above and beyond - when we couldn't find our charger, he personally investigated the matter and gave us free drinks whilst we were waiting for him to get back to us. 
the room was beautiful, the service impeccable and we highly highly highly recommend staying here. the only comment i have to say is that the shower is a little small, but that is not a reason to avoid staying here. it's also extremely well located and looks beautiful inside and out.

Many thanks again, Sakar!
Libby (and David)",5,2018,05,07
104,A hidden gem,"I was met at the door by a helpful bellman, quickly checked in, and then escorted to my room. The bellman showed me the coolest thing I've ever seen in a hotel room- a smart phone for my disposal during my stay. I used it when I went out and about. I didn't have to worry about draining my phone battery and had that GPS in my hand all the time!

I will say the wifi was horrible in my room, but everything else was so wonderful I won't hold it against them.

The room was the biggest I have ever had in Europe. There was a sofa in addition to the bed. The bathroom was spacious.

The hotel is located on  peaceful, tree lined street. It's just lovely. I'm a fast walker and was at Paddington station in less then 10 minutes. It's also a quick walk to the park. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2018,05,07
104,Fantastic hotel,"Great location! Ten mins to Paddington tube station/train station. Lovely room, upgraded to a suite. Just loved staying here for the convenience - parking is extra but great to park outside the door. Breakfast was very nice, usual choice of cereals pastries cooked breakfast etc. Tea coffee and good selection of biscuits in the room. Just a bit of advice - first night we booked through booking.com and then had to pay over ¬£20 for breakfast. We decided to book direct with reception when we decided to stay a second night - cheaper and included free breakfast!",5,2018,05,07
104,Thank you Sakar and Anthony ,"Thank you Sakar and Anthony for the great service.  Great location and great service.  I loved the breakfast.  Good WiFi.

The services they provide is very welcoming and attention to detail which makes a very big difference when staying at the hotel . And I can see how like that with other customers too .  
Highly recommended- we stay here every visit we make to London. ",5,2018,04,29

Thank you ",5,2018,04,28
104,"fantastic stay, excellent staff, wonderful position","There are many factors you must keep in mind when you book a hotel, in particular if you are staying in London. Grand Hotel Royale Hyde Park has satisfied everything we were looking for. The position is fantastic: cross the road and you are in Hyde Park or Kensington Gardens; turn the corner and you have two underground stations; buses day and night. Thus 5 stars to the position.
The hotel is a Victorian house, still charming with that particular atmosphere of another century. The room was very small, this is true but not uncommon in London, the problem having been that we booked on line and we couldn't really choose or know the sort of room we booked. But after all when you are in London the time you spend in the room is not that much. The bathroom was fine, with complimentary products. 
Staff was brilliant: quick, kind, always ready to solve any problem. Breakfast (not included, but absolutely worth its price) was great, and the staff in the breakfast hall were absolutely the kindest you could hope to meet.
I am sure I will stay there again and I am already missing it.
Thank you to all the staff, especially as I was ill on the day of my departure and they were extremely helpful and understanding.",5,2018,04,28
104,Great place to stay with excellent manager,I have stayed in this hotel several times on business.  It is always a pleasure.  They take care of everything for a traveler like me.  I again just finished my trip to London and stayed again at this hotel.  Once again the stay was great.  The manager Mr. Gurdeep is outstanding.  He makes sure he takes care of all the needs of the guests.  He pays great attention to detail.  The breakfast at the hotel is great.  The hotel is an absolute gem.  ,5,2018,04,28

We had great service at the hotel but room was a bit smaller than we expected .  However, the service exceeded our expectations , special thanks to Mr Sakar who always looked after us with our needs and made our stay perfect . He is an absolute credit to this hotel . My wife loved the layout of our room which was very modern.  Restaurant manager Anthony overwhelmed us with PARATHA( which is an Indian bread ) . We are vegetarian so that was very nice of him .

So Mr Sakar will see you soon . ",5,2018,04,28
104,Special thanks to the staff - Alrina & Dimitri!!!,"I am writing to thank you and your staff for a wonderful stay of mine for a period of 2 months at this hotel. I was on a business trip here and stayed for almost 8 weeks...

I really enjoyed my stay at this wonderful hotel or I must say my second home... The staff have all been warm and friendly and have provided exceptional service. ¬†Well done to the entire team for making my stay so enjoyable...

From the moment I arrived, everyone was so efficient and friendly and made me feel so welcome. ¬†The hotel in itself is style and elegant creating an environment that is so comfortable and the standard of customer service is second to none...

From the initial e-mail conversation with my bookings over my accommodation request, my arrival, check in, escort to my room, all was so lovely and comfortable...

Special thanks to the front desk staff - Alrina & Dimitri who were so courteous, and helpful and ensured that I get the maximum comfort...

Sakar - the manager, front desk staff - Diana and Arina have been very cordial with my special requests for room services.

The experience was pure professionalism and personal. The staff were both personally engaging and helpful at the same time. The facilities were impeccable...

Your hotel is wonderful, the staff is great and attentive. The spirit of the hotel and charm of the building (room, bar, restaurant, lobby etc) makes it a unique place...¬†

On the day of checkout, each staff member had the courtesy to check on my family back home... Right from booking a cab and ensuring I reach to the airport safely, will always remain memorable...

Once again, thanks for making my stay so wonderful and comfortable...

104,Thank you Mr Sakar for everything ,I booked in to this hotel by my company for a month and i must admit that i love this hotel. The service is second to none. Staff are very friendly and hospitable especially Mr Sakar the manager and Ms Alrina from front desk. I was given room 808 which is small but good for one person. I will book double room next time hopefully in December because its my wife who wish to come London for birthday. ,5,2018,04,26
104,Not very happy,"Stayed one night only as I flew in for a birthday party. The reception staff did not come across as very pleasant. Quite dry and reluctant to meet customers with a smile or with a routine phrase such as ‚Äúhow was your journey‚Äù. 

To corroborate my first impression, I had the unique privilege of waiting for 10 minutes before being able to ask for a wake up call as the only reception staff member was explaining to a group of customers, not having the same credit card with which they had made the reservation, that the hotel policy did not enable him to check them in. Not only did he have an attitude, but this staff member had also the audacity to say to the customers ‚Äúyou are wasting my time‚Äù. Lived for 5 years in the UK and 3 in the USA and I have never heard something similar. This staff member really needs training or, even better, looks for another job.

Was given a puny room in the basement, which was very smelly.  To go around the bed, one needed to be a highly skilled cortortionist. The water in the shower had only one temperature, no way one could change it. The hairdryer was ok.

The towels were put on the bed where normally people place their dirty suitcases. Debatable choice from a hygiene point of view.

The glass of the tiny window was broken.

On the positive side, the bed was comfy and the room was quiet. Wifi works fine. The porter was nice and polite! 

Location: Paddington tube is not far but you can get lost if you are not familiar with the area.

Left the following morning quite early. So I did not try breakfast.

I am not recommending this hotel, just to be clear.

104,Great vibrant exquisite hotel in Paddington ,"We chose this hotel for my girlfriends birthday and it certainly lived up to its expectations. 
It's a very beautiful exquisite hotel located in Westbourne terrace converted from probably English town house . The neighbourhood of Paddington or Bayswater is also a very trendy area with lots of great restaurants, souvenirs shops and high fashion boutiques also close to Marble Arch or oxford street . The staff are very attentive and helpful and especially Sakar , Gurdeep , Draja , Diana , Alrina and Anthony from restaurant who really went out of their way to to help us celebrate my girlfriend birthday. They all are definitely a credit to the hotel . The breakfast in the morning was delicious , fresh and lots of choices and we had a great spacious room . 
We definitely visit this hotel again . ",5,2018,04,26
104,Marathon weekend stay,"Stayed for night before 2018 London marathon. Shared a quad room with wife and two daughters. Room was a duplex style, pretty dated with only a double sofa bed downstairs for the girls. Large king size bed on upper level, which was okay, but pretty soft matress and pillows. Small shower room with poor quality towels, bath towels provided were only just a bit bigger than hand towels. The double doors with opening restrictors opening onto a shared balcony didn't close properly or lock and were a security concern. Wifi appeared to be okay as were the tea/coffee supplies in the room. Breakfast was good and enjoyed by all. Hotel staff were attentitive and able to respond to our requests. Quite a lot of noise transmission from adjacent room late on Saturday night particularly when occupants were running up and downstairs, not too great night before the marathon. There also appeared to be numerous fire doors within the communal areas that were not closing properly and creating a potential fire risk, these need immediate attention and a separate email has been sent to the hotel.",3,2018,04,24
104,VERY NICE STAFF!,I give this hotel 5 stars cause of the accessibility of the place to the tube and bus stations. Room is normal and nothing special but the staffs are very friendly and very helpful! I would like to commend this hotel for their extraordinary staffs especially Florin who was very accomodating during my stay at the hotel,5,2018,04,23
104,Very disappointing and over priced,"We booked this hotel over 3 months ago, and although it said payment on arrival our card was charged straight away. 

On arriving at the hotel we were asked to produce the card we made the booking with. Unfortunately we have since changed banks so didn‚Äôt have that card anymore. Understandable that hotel would ask for this, but after we explained the situation we were spoken to very abruptly by the hotel check in staff and after producing every bit of I.D possible to prove it was us who made the booking we had to pay for the rooms again, and told to take it up with our bank, (the one we don‚Äôt hold an account with anymore). Later that night, around 1.am in the morning the check in guy rang our room to say he made a mistake and would refund the card in the morning, the I.d we had produced was satisfactory 

Our rooms we so small you had to shuffle round the bed to get from one side to the other. I have never seen such as small shower and bathroom.   Our room was next to the lift shaft so we had to put up with that all night. There was also noise from guests most of the night, but you can‚Äôt blame the hotel for that. 

¬£197.00 per room, well over priced, Breakfast was decent and not over priced, but the rest of the stay was a shocking. 

",2,2018,04,22
104,Smallest room in the world,"I did book a single room and it is London but I was quite shocked at the size of my room/cupboard. Tiny. Single bed, desk and small wardrobe. No room to move around and I struggled to find a home for my suitcase (cabin bag size). Bathroom was equally as small. 
On the plus side the location is superb for westminister and oxford street/Hyde park. Was only ¬£120 for the room also. Check in was pleasant. 
The fire alarm went off about a dozen times in the morning which was really irritating. No apology when I checked out either. ",3,2018,04,20
104,Avoid!,"I booked this hotel last minute due to a conference I was attending in London later on that week. I chose this hotel because of its ‚Äú4 star‚Äù rating and the photos on their website, which presented large, modern, corporate rooms. On arrival, I was greeted by the friendly receptionist who give me my room number (402) and had ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù me to a king size room. The room was very unimpressive; shabby, unclean and scruffy. The ‚Äúking size‚Äù bed turned out to be a large bed made up of two lumpy mattresses that had been pushed together. The air con was faulty, it was a very hot day so some cold air would have been welcome. I had a very poor nights sleep. The walls and ceiling are paper thin, meaning you can hear EVERYTHING from screaming children, to people stomping around above you. The toiletries are basic. No mini fridge. No room service menu. I ordered Deliveroo which came with the a glass bottle of coke. When I called reception to ask for a bottle opener, I was delivered a bottle of wine with 4 glasses...I was by myself! When I called and asked for complimentary toiletries I was told that I could get these from most convenience stores. I also noticed some not very pleasant dirty marks on the curtain as I went to open the window for some cold air. (Photo‚Äôs attached)

I‚Äôm really disappointed with the experience I‚Äôve had at this hotel and will not be returning. However, location is great as it‚Äôs a short walk from Paddington station.",1,2018,04,18
104,Thanks to Sakaar for amazing hospitality,I visited UK for a period of 2 months and was staying at Park Grand Hyde Park and I must admit the staff is very friendly and supportive. Sakaar specially made my stay more comfortable and ensured I am fine always. He provided the max assistance he could... Very friendly and nice staff.. Must stay...,5,2018,04,16
104,Good value,"I was expecting to stay at the Shaftesbury Metropolis, but due to a maintenance issue they had to move me to the Park Grand. The service at both ends was good and they provided a taxi to take me to the alternative property despite it being just around the corner.

The room I was given was good although it was a tight squeeze between the wall where the TV was and the bed to get to the other side of the bed or part of the room where there was a desk.

Everything seemed clean and the facilities in the room were good. The room featured a mini fridge, microwave, safe, air-con and tea/coffee making facilities. There were complementary biscuits and bottled water, although these weren't replaced after they were used on the first night of a two night stay.

The bathroom was clean and included all the usual shower gels.

Breakfast was very average. It was a buffet affair but by no means a Full English. There didn't appear to be any options for fried eggs and there was no black pudding. The sausages were of basic but acceptable quality and the bacon was fine but had a lot of white residue caused by it being quite high in water content. I was happy with breakfast but wouldn't have wanted to pay full price.

Overall, I would be very happy to stay in this hotel again. It was comfortable and served my purposes perfectly.",4,2018,04,14
104,Simply wonderful,"It was my first time in this boutique hotel with my fiancee and it turned out to be the perfect hidden gem near Paddington station based in Westbourne terrace. 
We both appreciate the service, the friendliness of the staff and delicious chicken tikka Masala during evening. Our room was on the roof of the building and therefore the view was beautiful overlooking the city . it's been a delightful stay and we both are already looking forward to stay next year . 
",5,2018,04,13
104,Show and stop over,"Close to underground, Hyde Park and Marble Arch, ideal location for us and the hotel was very good. We booked two double rooms and we were both given suites! 
Very clean and modern, good beds and excellent breakfast! 
Would certainly return, really good quality hotel in a great location.
We ate at Gusto, an Italian restaurant, very near to the hotel, excellent service and food.",5,2018,04,09
104,Suited or needs perfectly - recommended !!!,"Its been a while since I've been pleasantly surprised by a London Hotel, but this one delivered.
We only paid ¬£96 for a double room with breakfast for a Friday night out in London.
The hotel is about five minutes walk from Paddington Station, and from there of course, the underground will take you somewhere livelier. 
Our hotel room was spacious and immaculate. A huge bed, nice complimentary fruit, tea, biscuits etc, wardrobe space and a tv. Also had a lovely modern bathroom.
Staff were friendly and approachable, and had gone out of the way to accommodate
us due to an issue at our end.   
Breakfast was the usual full English or continental styles, but I was very happy with the quality of the bacon and sausages (not the cheap nasties often on offer in hotels).
Our needs were basic, but met with some style by this hotel. We will definitely stay here again.
If I really had to find fault, I would say that there is little in the way of pubs or restaurants in the vicinity, however, a brisk walk to the underground and you will find yourself only a few minutes from major attractions.",5,2018,04,08
104,Good with some comments**,"Booked this last minute and got a good price including breakfast. Room not ready at 2pm but staff provided free tea whilst we waited and upgraded the room to a duplex suite.

The bed was big and very comfortable, bath and shower in bathroom which was very small but modern and plenty of products left for guests. Fresh fruit and bottles of water also left in a little kitchen area. Staff helpful and pleasant.

BUT. The hotel is in a very old building with wooden windows and floors. The floors creaked every time the guests above me got up during the night which was approx every hour and as they paced  about from 6 in the morning. I could also hear their toilet and shower. So not a good night sleep. The hotel needs refurbishing to sound proof it and the duplex was very tired decoratively. Also the windows did not prevent traffic noise and as London Traffic is constant that disturbed me too. Having said that the price at ¬£78 for b&b near a mainline station in central London was good. I would have been very unhappy to pay full price.

The breakfast was excellent too as it was included but again would not want to pay ¬£15 for it. Hope this is helpful. If you are a heavy sleeper and an early riser it is a great place.",4,2018,04,07
104,Average London hotel,Visited this hotel for business. The hotel was average nothing really bad and also nothing really good. I was in a family room with 2 double beds. The toilet and shower room was quite small and I would imaging it would be a struggle for space for 2 adults with children and luggage. That aside my trip was pleasant and the location was very convenient. Breakfast on the morning was also good. ,3,2018,04,03
104,Good hotel ,"I was browsing hotel in London for three nights and this hotel was very apparent to me in hotelme website. It was a package trip and I was not sure what to expect. 
When I arrived, the location was very good. They help me with my bags , was given a room key with in minutes. That was a very swift checking-in . 
When I entered the room , it was very spacious and clean . 
All the staff has welcoming smile and most importantly Sakar and Gurdeep is the best one out of all . They really go out of the way to assist their guest . 
Thank guys . ",5,2018,03,31
104,Excellent location,Booked the hotel on the day of stay due to change in plans. Was surprised to get a double bed with breakfast for less than 100 quid!  Was upgraded to a deluxe room which was good size but slightly dated. The shower was excellent though.  The hotel is a decent 3 star but with just a 5 min was to Paddington - the location is brilliant. ,4,2018,03,30
104,Good location,"My nephew found this hotel from MakeMyTrip.com .
There was a good reviews.
When I arrived a lady checked in , stored my bags and when got back was given a nice room . The thing I liked in this hotel and the ambient . Staff are very friendly especially Gurdeep ,Sakar and Aaron are very friendly.

Food wise , I wholeheartedly enjoyed their breakfast. It's very fresh and tasty. 
In future, if I ever come back to London I will be staying here ",5,2018,03,28
104,Very good stay and Special thanks to Sakar,"Had a great time, the room itself was lovely.
The bed was really comfortable, the staff were really friendly and helpful especially The management Mr Sakar .
I had to go Heathrow airport and the paddington stations offers Heathrow express which is only 20 mins and affordable price too . Spotless, clean and homey feeling hotel . 
Would certainly stay again :).

104,Great quiet hotel in Hyde Park,"Me and my partner stayed here for the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
Our room was a decent size and perfectly clean. 
Staff were really helpful and friendly. Location is good, Mayfair and Soho are walkable or a short Uber journey.
Would stay again, good value for money.",4,2018,03,20
104,Clean Central Hotel. ,"This hotel was a great find. It was great value for what we got. 
The room was clean, the bathroom was massive and very clean. 
The staff were friendly and helpful. 
The location was great, it's very close to Paddington station - so easy to go anywhere. 
And I think the best bit is check out is a 12pm without having to pay extra - such a bonus. ",4,2018,03,19

104,Great staff and good hotel ,"I was recommended to book this hotel by my friend who stayed here before . I did checked few websites as well as TripAdvisor . So we booked in for eight nights ( twin room with my cousin ) . Heen we arrived we were greeted by helpful front desk staff and offered us room in ground Floor 806 . Room is spacious and clean . I came to London to attend appointsments at weymouth hospital . I was most of the time at the reception and we meet Mr Manager Sakar who was very friendly and Made us feel like home . His service and his hospitality we never experienced even in five star hotel . All front desk staff are helpful too. Arina especially was very kind to offered me water when i requested .

This time when i arrived Sakar remembered me and welcome like his family . We were given room 201 which was amazing and we loved everything . 
This hotel is probably 4 star but service is 7 star ....
  
",5,2018,03,15
104,Excellent service ,"I stayed here for 14 night and I felt overwhelmed with the service I received. Especially from Manager Mr Sakar , Aaron , Brain ( Night Team ) Anthony from restaurant are super friendly and hospitable . 
Room I was give was second floor which was comfortable for one person however bathroom was small than I expected. 
Location is the hotel is the reason why I choose to stay . Paddington station makes everything reachable . 
Breakfast at the hotel is very good but I only had chance to stay for two times but in future I will have it every morning. 
There are plenty of hotel in London but this one ticks every boxes because of WORLD CALLS SERVICE. ",5,2018,03,15
104,Thanks Sakar ,"First time in paddinton area after 25 trips made to london in 10 years , great location and 500 mts from paddington stn .special mention to Mr Sakar at front desk who was generous enough to upgrade our room to next available category.Breakfast was complimentary and seved hot.",5,2018,03,15

Anyway I arrived  first was shown to room and it was lovely we had been upgraded and we had 2 queen beds the room was 401 spotlessly clean lhad some fruit and biscuits  left too!

The room was so quiet and I had the windows open all night!

Staff first class esp Daria lovely young lady polite kind professional

Hotel walking distance to tube and bus stops plus walk to Kensington and Hyde Park gardens

Would recommend anyone to stay here",4,2018,03,14
104,"Thanks you Guys, it‚Äôs a great place . ","I stayed here one night . My room was originally booked on February and we turned up to check- in on March as we made a mistake. When we arrived we were greeted by Darja , who confirmed us that our reservation was made on February which we didn‚Äôt realized. But she helped us making reservation for us and checked in to a nice upgraded room . Room was spacious, huge bed and overall brilliant. 
Next day in the morning when I requested for late checkouts. The manager Sakar was very kind enough to let us stay until 15:00 with an upgrade charges and moreover he helped us booking taxi to Gatwick Airport too . 
It‚Äôs a nice hotel with very helpful staff . The staff we came across Darja and Sakar were excellent. I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,14
104,Nice Stay,Very nice stay here. Rooms are smaller but compact with everything you need. The bar is nice too. The AC works splendidly!! A bit farther out by Hyde Park but still easy to get to and from. Would stay here again. ,4,2018,03,13
104,"Great hotel, excellent location","Stay here a lot when in London for business. Staff are always really friendly, esp. Sakar and Ariana on the front desk. Handy for Paddington station. Rooms are very clean. Would recommend this hotel for price, location, comfort and cleanliness.",5,2018,03,13
104,A Great Base,"This was a great hotel to act as a base for our trip to London. It was very clean and comfortable. The staff were first class and the room was cosy with a great view. It also was kept well stocked with tea, coffee and fresh fruit on our arrival. The shower was brilliant but the towels were quite small. Overall though a great place to stay.",5,2018,03,11
104,Miserable hotel,"this hotel boasts 4 star level and calls itself ""IT'S BOUTIQUE, IT'S UNIQUE"" in reality, it does NOT deserve even ONE star.
We booked a deluxe room (we had the room 806) for 7 days and paid 841.10¬£.
The room had very thin walls, we heard everything in the corridor and the neighbouring rooms. The heating system was out of service for 3 days it was during the very cold period in London (from Feb. 23 to March 2) and the hotel did not even change the room for us (it was not fully occupied). 
The housekeeping service did not do their job properly and the room was not clean.

For a 4 star hotel, this was so shabby and miserable.

DO NOT STAY THERE, people. Honestly, DO NOT.",1,2018,03,09
104,Awesome place,"Wow great price great location for overseas travellers staff friendly room perfect everything you need for your an exciting london trip well done guys 
Would definitely recommend this hotel.to everyone wanting a stay in london book it now!!!! You wont be disappointed ",4,2018,03,08
104,Nice hotel and warm welcome ,"I stayed here with my mum auntie and myself in two rooms.  
Rooms was upgraded with good size bed and very comfy bathroom.  
Very good location in Paddington and there was two staff who checked us in and sort out room for me and my family was Mr Sakar who happened to be the manager of the hotel and Lovely Arina 
Great breakfast and super friendly staff .
Will come back soon. 
Give five star .",5,2018,03,07
104,"Excellent staff, good location but small room","It's my practice to review the bad comments before i decide whether to book the hotel.  This time, I had to book the hotel in last minute without the time to review the comments.  After the 4-night stay, I read the negative comments and realised that I'm lucky not to go through the review before I booked this hotel or I would not consider this hotel!

The front door staff in particular Doria, restaurant staff, cleaning staff and the men carrying our luggages to the room are all excellent and friendly. 

The room is clean with refreshments, fruit and amenities for your stay. Although the room and the bathroom are small, I think it's fine with me while it would be too small for some guests.

The buffet breakfast is included in my room rate which is very cheap as compared with other hotel in London.  There are many choices and included bacon, beans, sausages, eggs, grilled mushroom, salad, yogurt, juice etc.  You can order coffee and cappuccino as well.  

The location is also great.  I took Heathrow Express at the Paddington station and it's only 10 minutes walk from the hotel.  

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel but again the room/bathroom would be too small for some guests.",4,2018,03,07
104,Small dark and dingy room in need of a revamp,"Firstly, its in a great location. Very close to paddington station and tube. We arrived for business and i must say, the reception staff were excellent! Very friendly and kind. 

We were given a basement room and immediately the alarm bells were ringing. The bedroom was extremely tight. How they got so much into a bathroom was impressive. The left handside of the bed where a small window was- absolutely filthy! looked like it had not been cleaned in months. The floor also had a strong smell of food 24/7. i think it is close to the breakfast areas. 

If i am offered this hotel again for business i would kindly say no. If you are staying here, do ensure that you are not given a basement room!",2,2018,02,27
104,Thank you Sakar ,"Would 100% recommend this hotel, outstanding staff and we got our room upgraded to a deluxe double room as soon as we entered, had everything we needed, gorgeous hotel close to everything, bed was so comfy and staff so welcoming, would just like to thank the manager Sakar for our wonderful stay will 100% be coming back soon. Thank you for our stay ",5,2018,02,27
104,Very warm welcome ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The room was spotless and absolutely incredible. The staff were so polite especially Manager Mr Sakar and the staff will cater for all your needs! 

Definitely a 5 star hotel! Would definitely recommend!",5,2018,02,27
104,Kind staffs,"We had amazing time during the Valentine‚Äôs Day at very nice warm and smart hotel in south 
The best part of our staying it was surprising from the staffs I but some flowers üåπ for my partner and every 10 minutes the staff called Stephen bring a flower for my partner.
Thanks to all staffs.",4,2018,02,18
104,"Convenient location, helpful staff, excellent breakfast","We stayed at Park Grand Hyde Park for three nights during a recent trip as my default hotel was not available.  Overall, I thought it was good value for a London hotel.  Convenient to Paddington for trains/tube.  It's the converted townhouse style, which makes for some awkwardness in the layout, but somehow feels more in character for London (to me).

We had a ""club room"", which is their better rooms.  Our room was on the old (high ceiling) main floor of the townhouses, and had the sleeping area essentially built as a loft over the bath and lower (sitting) part of the room.  Good bed, but steep narrow stairs to get up there (or to get down to bathroom in the night).  Sitting area furnishings were very hard and plain, but there was decent space and a small kitchenette.

We found the breakfast quite good; well managed and kept fresh.  Staff were always pleasant and helpful.  I don't know that I will automatically choose this hotel in the future, but it will definitely be on my list of good options in the future.",4,2018,02,17
104,"Very small room, damaged, with no room to work.","I arrived to this hotel the 14th of February 2018 to stay one night for business reason. I was arranged in room Nr 001. So my experience is about this room and the general welcoming i got.
The room is very small, with a double bed taking out all the space. There is a chair in the room, presumably to be used with the little desk available, but the chair cannot be situated near the desk because there isn't enough space between the bed and the desk (see pictures attached). The lamps at the sides of the bed were both damaged. working, but damaged. The tiny window got only 1 of the 2 locks necessary to close it, so the room remain very cold if you don't use the heating, otherwise it will be very hot because you need to keep the heating on the entire night.
The courtesy bottle of water (pre-paid with the room) was missing. I had to ask it twice at the reception to get it.
When asking for the water I heard a couple of customers (it was S.Valentine day) complaining about their room and the concierge told them ""you are nothing""... it was very disturbing to me. I mean, they were customers, the staff should demonstate some respect... or not?
The TV in the room had not remote control when I arrived, I had to go to the reception again to ask one. The first time I was provided with a not working remote control... I got a good one at the second attempt.
In conclusion I am very disappointed both of the room and of the staff... so suggested my company to avoid the hotel in the future.

My suggestion for travelers is to avoid room 001, if you cannot choose, then avoid the hotel.",1,2018,02,16
104,Good convenient place in Paddington,"It was a business visit and this was a very suitable hotel for the trip. This was primarily because of the location and its proximity to my work place. Other than that, don't have much to talk about here. Rooms are small though very clean. Breakfast was the standard spread. Nothing to complain.",3,2018,02,16
104,Happy happy happy,We arrived and the friendly reception staff offered us an upgrade to our room! we loved it! the bed is so comfortable and the duplex room was spacious and nice! absolutely enjoyed the stay! thank you to the hotel! The little extras in the room made us feel special and the staff all round were happy helpful and friendly,5,2018,02,15
104,Fancy Getaway,"I spent three days in London with my boyfriend and I was struggling to find a solution big enough for both of us (given that he is 6.6'/2m tall). I found this Hotel on-line and it was a great deal. Best quality-price ratio I found so far in London. Clean and spacious room&bathroom, good service and excellent location. A special thanks goes to Arina. She warmly welcomed us at the beginning of or say with a prompt and smooth check in. She showed us around the main hotel facilities and she was also kind enough to help us with the travel plan and with few touristic tips. Always smiling she set us off to a great start.
Final advice, if you have any special request, do let the team know as they are very accomodating. Definitely worth another visit.",4,2018,02,12
104,Home from home,"Excellent location, just moments from Heathrow Express. Have stayed a few times over the years, always feeling welcome when I go back. Cannot help but mention Gurdeep, Sakar, Adriana and Lucian for their professionalism and commitment to service. A highly reccommended hotel",5,2018,02,10
104,Average ,Room was facing street so busy and noisy also when I arrived smell of air. refresher was so strong I couldn‚Äôt stand it . Not sure what smell was this trying to mask . Location is good but they need to upgrade that hotel ,3,2018,02,08
104,Good but requires weather-proofing!,"Upon arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a larger room on the top floor, however this did not feel like an upgrade for several reasons!  Stayed in early January on a cold stormy night - the windows had been left open so the room was freezing and there was rainwater over the windowsills. Then realised one of these windows did not close properly so there was a noisy, cold draft all night due to the storm. As a result the room was cold and uncomfortable. 

Pros - clean, good breakfast, good location for paddington station and connections to Heathrow airport.",3,2018,02,07
104,Excellent service and accommodation,"The room was very comforting.
The service was excellent and all the staff were very helpful and friendly to meet my needs of anything.

The room service was so good as well.
The hotel is close to two tube stations and the area is quiet and peaceful.

Thw hotel is also near the royal parks so it is always convenient to go to those parks in the morning.
",5,2018,02,07
104,Always excellent service on my short business stays,"I have stayed here fairly frequently over the last year when working at a company office in Paddington.  I usually stay for one or two nights.
I originally chose this hotel for location, however I continue to stay there as I feel safe and comfortable in this hotel while travelling on my own, and I have found the service to be excellent and all staff very welcoming.

On my last stay in December, I requested a room with a bath and was therefore upgraded to one of the top floor rooms which was a lovely room with views over the street and across Hyde Park in the distance.  The service from the Manager in sorting this out for me was exceptional.

On other stays, some of the rooms are a little small, and I did ask for a window latch to be fixed once, which was done immediately. The beds are always comfortable and I love the underfloor heating in the bathrooms. 

I will continue to stay at this hotel while I have to travel to London on business.  I would also recommend booking directly with the hotel on their website as I always get a better deal by doing so. 

The breakfast is lovely with lots of choice and good service.",4,2018,02,05
104,Mr Andrew Evans,"I stay at Park Grand pretty regularly, as it‚Äôs close to my work....and when it‚Äôs busy at work, it‚Äôs a place I really like staying at. Staff are friendly, particularly Sakar who always goes out of his way to be pleasant and accommodating to me.

104,Thanks Sakar for great hospitality ,"I have been a regular to this hotel for good four years and I loved this nice little boutique hotel in Paddington . This like my home from home. Rooms are always fantastic, bed are sometimes two stacked together but its comfortable. 
I wake up too late therefore never had chance to try breakfast. 
The reason why I always come back is the service of the staff and Mr Manager Sakar who makes sure everything is placed according to my needs to have a great time while I am staying here . ",5,2018,01,14
104,Great Location,"With so many hotel choices in London, I was happy to have chosen this one.

The rooms are tasteful and comfortable, the location extremely convenient, and the staff is exceptional--charming, helpful and accommodating.

I will come back with my family soon . ",5,2018,01,05
104,The usual excellent service from Sakar,"As usual excellent service, been quite a while since I have visited but Sakar greeted me as I entered. Even after a few months of me not visiting Sakar treated me as if I was his brother who was there the day before. Was a great experience and will be back at the next opportunity.",5,2018,01,03
104,Small rooms,"Rooms are quite small.
Reaching there is easy via Tube.
Breakfast is average , wifi is okay.
Located nearby to Paddington station.
I'll not recommend this for family. 
Amenities are average , room service is also average",3,2018,01,03

I didnt had an opportunity to have breakfast or dinner so cant comment on that but overall five stars stay . 
Highly recommend. 
Thank you Sakar for all your help . ",5,2017,12,31

All staff are very welcoming and especially Mr manager Sakar did outmost to make our stay pleasurable .  
Fantastic location and good price , surely will book again.   ",5,2017,12,30
104,"Excellent hotel, Central location","We stayed here as we were spending time at Winter Wonderland and wanted to combine other tourist sites.  We booked through Booking.com and had two rooms which were perfect, triple with cot, located near top of hotel, final staircase was tricky to use with two under fives, buggy as well. And a twin which was on fourth floor.. Room 407 and 403. Reception were confused with our names as initial next to surname on paperwork read a totally different name. But rooms very clean, warm and perfect. The bar is very basic, no comfy chairs to relax in though. Breakfast was fabulous, huge selection and lots of staff very attentive to our needs. Only a couple of negatives, the hotel was far to hot everywhere and the bar was not attended constantly which as a ex hotelier I get.... However, when you go to reception to request service and no one there either...eventually someone appeared but guests may not wait. - Sorry but this form is not allowing me to rate sleep quality which I rate as five stars, and rooms four",4,2017,12,28
104,Wonderful Christmas stay,Our stays here have now tripped into double figures and as soon as we walked through the door on Christmas day we knew why we keep coming back. This time we were given an upgrade but given the choice of what room we wanted. The welcome from the staff was amazing. The room was a duplex suite and as always clean and tidy with those lovely added extras. We were given the same treatment at breakfast in the morning. Anthony in the restaurant was as accommodating as always. We love this hotel. The location and the option to park outside is one of the many reasons we keep returning,5,2017,12,27
104,Honeymoon trip,"Stayed here 4 night on honeymoon trip .our room was spotless clean and good as a London room standard .
Hotel is Five minutes walking distance from the station .breakfast was nice and very fresh. Special thanks to luggage porter  pavel and gurdeep at reception 
Mr. Pathmanaban",5,2017,12,27
104,Comfortable ,"Stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of December. We arrived to a warm welcome by reception and a porter brought our bags up for us which was nice. 

The room itself had 2 beds pushed together and the sheets and towels were clean. The bathroom was a little on the small side but perfectly functional. 

Tea & coffee facilities plus free wi-fi. Hotel was nice and quiet. 

Would recommend & would return.",5,2017,12,25
104,Our first visit to London,"A good hotel with superb breakfast. Location is an advantage with only a short 5 mins walk to Paddington station where we can easily grab some food (KFC, Burger Kings & Mc D are all there). We stayed in Family room that fits 4 of us in 2 double beds. Room cleanliness is OK. Bathroom is small though it just is acceptable considering the room size. But we've never been in such a small shower booth before! If we want to travel again to London, I would choose this hotel again mostly because of its delicious breakfast!!",4,2017,12,24
104,Business Stay (long),"Stayed here for almost 50 nights just before Christmas.
Wonderful hotel, great location! I loved the room I was in... spacious and warm with all the necessary amenities. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows...large washroom with heated flooring and mirror.
The best part was the hotel staff. Friendly and helpful.
I'd certainly recommend this Hotel to anyone! ",5,2017,12,23
104,Great hotel,I booked this hotel as a stay for me and my friend. My friend has a medical condition and is not good on his feet. The staff and manager that I met where fantastic constantly checking we was ok. The hotel and room we was in was excellent clean tidy and had everything you needed. We even had a try off the food which was of good standard and tasty. I would recommend this hotel to anyone whether it be for a night or longer it was a shame we had to leave. Keep up the great work guys and thank you.,5,2017,12,19
104,Nope: bad experience,"I booked this place despite I normally book another hotel chain with the same price range that never disappointed me, because I thought this looked even nicer. I was very wrong.
I booked, directly with the hotel, a deluxe double room including English breakfast and I paid 448 pounds for 3 nights. We were given room 127.
This is meant to be a 4 star hotel but our room was definitely not a 4 star. 
First of all, the size. We hardly had any space to walk to the window and the other side of the bed. The bathroom was so small that only one person could fit in, unless one was in the shower. The bathroom door collided with the wardrobe door when both were open.
Then, there was a draft coming from the window which is not exactly what you want in December. This reminded me of the time I was a student in London living with other students in an old house, except it's a 4 star hotel.
Additionally, the bed size was too small for a couple and definitely too soft to sleep on (but I guess this is personal taste).
Finally, the room appeared in strong need of some renovation. Yes the bathroom sink looked new, but the walls, the fan, and the general look of the room was pretty dated and crying for TLC, I attach pictures.
Breakfast was ok, although if you are not after English breakfast there is not a big choice - again, this would be ok if this was not rated a 4 star hotel.
Location is good, a few minutes to Paddington.
All in all, I will never book it again and I publicly apologize to my boyfriend for my bad :)",1,2017,12,19
104,Fantastic location,"I was booked into another hotel in the group and on arrival, found they had already booked out my room. The desk staff were very quick to offer me a free drink and order me a taxi to the Park Grand. My room was quite spacious, and the bathroom looked brand new. The only downside is that there is no restaurant in the hotel and you have to go to one of their other properties just down the road for breakfast.  Very good value room rate too, and located perfectly for tube links and Hyde Park.",4,2017,12,15
104,Absolutely awful,"I originally booked the hotel across the road, but with the work they were having done they relocated me to this one. The room was absolutely tiny. If I wanted to get to the bathroom had to make sure the chair was fully tucked under the desk as it would be in the way. Hardly any space to go around the bed, and they your luggage would be in the way too as there's no space to put it. Bathroom looks relatively recently decorated but I could have tiled it better myself. The shower door came of the hinge so it wouldn't shut properly and the bathroom floor was flooding (very laid back response when reported, and no - did not sent somebody to fix it). Filthy shower cabin.The window was ancient and drafty, opened to a revolting view of a courtyard absolutely plastered with bird poo. Travelodge kind of breakfast. The only good thing is close location to Paddington and Oxford Street.",1,2017,12,15
104,Business,"Do not book, bad location and worst room ever for this rate

If you book, tell them you do not want to be  in the basement or at ground floor where the room are max 7 m2 with basically no space to even to do one step...

Really bad experience ",1,2017,12,11
104,3rd Visit In A Year - Perfect Again!,"This was my third visit to this hotel in a year, and I have to say, it never lets me down! In my opinion, the best hotel in London, attributable to many, many reasons, from the location, to the staff.
There is such a warm and friendly atmosphere in the hotel, and the minute you walk in,m you feel special and valued - the staff can't honestly do enough to help you.
Just outside of the exciting hub of central London, this Paddington hotel provides great transport links to all major London attractions via the close-by underground and overground services - which are ideally located a 10 minute walk from the property.
Set on a beautiful row of terraced buildings, the hotel looks charming from the outside, and this is only mirrored from the inside with the world-class service you get from all of the staff. From offering advice on the local area, to promptly appearing toc lear breakfast plates, the staff work tirelessly, and always with smiles on their faces. They are all the definition of professional, and make our stays at the Park Grand special time and time again.
Breakfast is a delight of continental feasting, with hot cooked delicacies, pastries with an array of jams, cereals, cheeses, meats, fresh fruit, and yogurts.
The rooms are spacious and clean, with some offering majestic views out across the city, where you can watch the planes flying overhead. There are water, fruit and biscuits in the rooms upon arrival, and also luxury mini toiletries in the bathroom in-case you might have forgotten your own.
LOVE this hotel and its vibe, and can't wait for our next stay in the very near future!",5,2017,12,09
104,A 5 star find!,Stayed here for one night..was upgraded to a family room which was a delightful surprise. The doorman and reception staff were so friendly..it is perfectly located to the station. But would definately recommend the walk through the parks all the way down to Buckingham Palace. ,5,2017,12,06
104,It is an excellent Hotel,"This Hotel is exceptional. Its location, service and hospitality is difficult to match. Therefore, on all future trips to London, I and my family shall try to stay here depending on room availability. Our experience was extremely good and were fully satisfied with the  Hotel and its management and staff. It is merely five minutes walk from the Paddington station and is very accessible. There are whole range of nice restaurants nearby and an Italian one, a few minutes walk is rather good and reasonable.",5,2017,12,02
104,"""Great location..Good customer service ""","My girlfriend and I were attending a concert @the Hyde park an needed a place to stay close by. This hotel has a great location less then 5mins walk to Paddington station and 10mins to the Hyde park. Room was clean and had all the amenities needed. check in was smooth and on check out we were asked how was the stay, if everything was fine with our stay, by a smiling face which was a nice touch. Would recommend  this hotel if you are looking for something close to the station or Hyde park Also Oxford circus is not that far. :) will visit soon. 
",5,2017,11,29
104,One word EXCELLENT!!!! ,"I stayed with my girlfriend here on 25th of November and I highly recommend this place. Winter wonderland was the main reason to be in London since I am from Cardiff. After all the drinks and and fun we had at winter wonderland we were very tired. 
A short distance away from hyde park was this hotel. I booked a double room on their own website. On reaching the hotel we were welcomed by the hotel reception gracefully they gave us a complimentary upgrade to room 702 which was a club double room which was wonderful and complimentary breakfast for booking on the own website. It only had few steps  but it had an amazing view. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. 
The English breakfast scrambled egg, mushroom, sausages were amazing. The restaurant staff were very friendly and polite. 
Overall the room was fantastic and the staff are very helpful. And definitely next time when I am in London this is my place.
",5,2017,11,29
104,Best time spend,"I had my best time here in London and it was best choice .hotel is walking distance from Lancaster gate and not too much trouble to order food in midnight as well.
Rooms was very big and facing lovely west Bourne terrace .i did not had breakfast in hotel because I got up late every morning .however staff was willing to offer something to eat after breakfast . Well done team at park grand ",5,2017,11,28
104,Centrally located and second home ,"Superb location anf excellent reception staff which all needed while you are away from home.this was my second stay and i was   greeted with smile.
Rooms are on small side but what can you expect from london hotels.
All in all highly recommended place with friendly staff",5,2017,11,28
104,Great and pleasure expirience!,"This hotel offered to me and my family a great and pleasure experience. We love the hot breakfast every morning and the good service as well. The room hade a confortable size and with a new bathroom, you are able to take a hot shower after walking several hours av doing sightseeing! Staying so close to the Paddington station is very convenient.  We liked everything in this hotel. We will be back and recommend it to friends.",5,2017,11,25
104,Lovely Hotel with Freindly and helpful staff,"I have stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park on Businesses many times and have Always found it to be a welcoming with a warm reception. 

I have stayed in various rooms and have always found everything to be kept to a good standard and all in keeping with each other in regards style. Some of the rooms on the higher floors give you a great view of the area. The rooms road facing give you get a great feeling like you‚Äôre in an old Victorian home (In a good way) where you look out onto the street but not a noisy one due to the hotel being away from the road and the sound is blocked by the high hedges and trees which act as a sound barrier.

Regarding location, it is a 5-6-minute walk from Paddington train station or Paddington tube station (depending on which exit you leave from). Location wise Paddington has good tube links which make it easy to get into central London but Paddington its self has a lot of place to eat and drink.

The staff have always been fantastic on my stays. I am always greeted when I arrive and whenever I am in the lobby, walking the halls or at breakfast. The staff greet me by name and are always very quick to meet which ever needs I require. Especially Sakar from the management team and the Reception staff Alrina, Diana and Arina who have helped me with finding and booking places to eat, things to do and arranging travel, while always making me feel welcome. Their knowledge of the local area and things to do in London is spot on.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Park Grand London - Hyde Park if just for an evening, a week, or a month.",5,2017,11,21
104,Good value for money,"I'm very glad I found this hotel on booking.com and got a good deal. An upgraded room right on the top with lovely view over the city, staff very pleasant and polite, they helped me with bags, receptionist called to check if I have all I need in the room and provided me with all amenities I requested straight away. Handy phone is a really good idea, free calls and internet wow! Really could not be better. Special mention to front desk team: Daria, Arina, Sacar and Aaron
See you soon!",5,2017,11,13
104,A great place to stay in london ,"I stayed here at the park grand london hyde park two times with my friends on two weekends and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay . 
The room was nicely appointed and bed were very comfortable too . The A/C in our room worked perfecfly fine . We had the booking that included breakfast which was delicious. The staff here are delightful, efficient and friendly . A special thanks to front desk staff, housekeeping and restaurant team . 
They went above and beyond to make sure we had it all we needed . 
We will stay here again . ",5,2017,11,12
104,Very Disappointing,"Totally baffled by the good ratings and 4 stars of this hotel. First, we thought we were booking a 2 level room as shown on Expedia but instead got a regular room. When questioned about this we were told this was Expedia's fault. It's hard to know exactly what kind of room you are getting based on the confusing room descriptions on the hotel web site.  A refrigerator was listed as a standard amenity. There was a cabinet for one but it was empty. When asked about this the manager seemed surprised and said ""You want a refrigerator?"" He promised to bring one the next day but when it didn't come we asked again. We finally got one but the on/off knob was broken. The walls are very thin. We could hear clear conversations from next door and upstairs there was loud banging and moving of things at various times of day and several times at 2 or 3 in the morning. I've never dreaded returning to a hotel after a day of sightseeing before. On the good side, the location is great, the front desk staff pleasant, the breakfast was decent. Not impressed at all with the manager we dealt with. At one point when he realized we booked a twin room, he offered to show us a double room, saying ""that's not good, you should have a double bed"". Excuse me? Loved London but really regretted this hotel.",2,2017,11,11
104,Lovely,"Truely lovely hotel after staying for two weeks , an absolute hidden gem six minutes approx  away from paddington station and around eleven minutes crom lancaster gate ststion  . Staff was very accomodating and friendly when we arrived several hours before bookong.com official time check in , they put us directly into a room which was a pleasant surprise as we were expecting to have to leave our luggage and wander around until later day .
Room were very clean and well decorated . we stayed in a Deluxe double and although size of a room was a bit smaller than expected, it was nicely appointed with a robe , slippers , nice touch of fruits , coffee, biscuits , cookies and A VERY CLEAN KETTLE for a cuppa .
My wife is very fussy with kettle and lime scale issues . But there she didnt expressed any issues . 
varities of restaurants, groceries and souvenir shops  near by . 
Each and every member of staff we came across , very friendly and have good knowledge of everyrhing we asked .

Park grand team is amazing, thanks to everybody who made my stay so wonderful : Darja, Pavel, Alrina.  One suggestion though I would like to make: you need to add sport channel. I will come back in December and already look forward to it! ",5,2017,11,06
104,Tiny room with lousy bed,What a terrible hotel ... don't let the name and the 4-star rating fool you ... not only the room was small .. bad design made it that much worse .. no light on the desk .. no place to put any stuff in the bathroom .. lousy soft bed .. the only saving grace .. no frig to take up any room .. and semi-decent breakfast despite of limited choices,1,2017,11,05
104,Really good hotel.,"Stayed at this hotel with my 8 year old daughter  during half term.  It is a hidden gem and we will definitely stay here again.  The hotel is in a brilliant location, 5 minute walk to Paddington tube station, some nice restaurant's nearby and very close to Kensington and hyde park.  The hotel itself was clean, the staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really good.  My only fault is that we were on the top floor and could constantly hear the lift but apart from that we really enjoyed our stay and will be returning.  ",5,2017,11,04

From the wonderful manager Sakar, to the cheerful and helpful doormen Lucian and Pavel it is a pleasure to be here from the moment you arrive and you know you will be looked after.  

The breakfasts are delicious and set you up for the day.  The waitresses and cleaners are delightful and always have smiles and well wishes for your day.

On arrival we were given room with a double bed and apparently our travel desk made an error . It was supposed to be twin beds , however we were given one double bed as our bookings was for a double room . 
We went down and requested to speak to the manager , then this is a good part . 
Mr Sakar dealt with our request he kindly showed us few room and we were happier to be moved at room 803 two single bed , very comfortable and spacious . 
Hotel itself is very clean and charming neighborhood near paddington station . 
Staff are big assets as they went out of their way to assist their guest . Very friendly and warm smiles . 
Breakfast is very fresh , good quality and lots of variety. 
I really like their scrambled eggs . 
Without any hesitation I will surely request our travel team to book this hotel . 
Thank you Park Grand and thank you Sakar , you have been a very good host . ",5,2017,10,25
104,"Good location , great service ","I stayed here for three night . 
Very much liked it in respect with location , price and room . 
Room was small but well comfortable considering the location and price we Paid . 
Staff are very friendly and accommodating, especially Sakar at the reception. 
Wonderful and hospitable . 
Good and fresh breakfast. 
Without a doubt will book again. ",5,2017,10,22
104,Convenient & Efficient,"London is a beautiful old city that is alive and evolving daily.  Ancient buildings next to modern, even avant garde soaring towers is eye candy to any fan of architecture.  However, getting around town by car is a challenge.  This is where the London Underground aka, ""The Tube,"" becomes a must.

On my latest trip, I not only had meetings around town, I also had several engagements in villages north of London.  The most efficient t way if getting there is by Train.  For me, staying near a train station was imperative. 

I chose Paddington Station for two reasons:it is easily accessible from Heathrow airport via the Heathrow Express (15 minute dedicated train), from Paddington you can get all of the Tube routes and trains going north.

The Park Grand London, 8 minute walk from Paddington made the most sense.  It was affordable, clean very efficient, somewhat at the cost of comfort, with an extremely friendly and accommodating staff, set in the middle of a neighbo9full of classic Georgian architecture. 

The Park Grand rooms are smallish but they offer everything a traveler needs--bed, desk, sofa, TV, and coffee/tea (I disdain rooms without caffeine).  The bathrooms are wet bathrooms, meaning completely tiled with the shower open to the commode and sink.  It's not bad and you don't have to clean it, they have daily maid service.  The hotel also offers a decent restaurant and a friendly bar/lounge.

I highly recommend the Park Grand London to business and leisure travelers that are looking for location, convenience. And efficiency at a reasonable price.",3,2017,10,21
104,"Ideal in every way, ticked all of our boxes","A great place to stay in the heart of London, close to Paddington station and underground. Excellent and clean accommodation. On site parking. Good breakfast. Friendly and polite staff. Will definitely be returning.",5,2017,10,20
104,Perfectly Hosted,"We stayed at the Park Grand for 2 nights on the weekend of my partner's 40th Birthday.  We chose the hotel based on it's location and proximity to Hyde Park as she was running Royal Parks Half Marathon on the Sunday.  A room upgrade on arrival was most welcome and the welcome basket of drinks and fruit was a nice touch along with the mountain of chocolates that were left on the bed spelling out ""Happy B'day"".  The staff were welcoming and friendly, Sakar (the duty manager) ensured that we wanted for nothing.

The hotel was a short walk from a range of great independent eateries and shops with a Waitrose approx 5 minutes away.  8 minute walk from Paddington Station too which was great. Breakfast was varied and well cooked.  Superb coffee too which is a rarity these days.

I wouldn't hesitate to book again for our next trip.",5,2017,10,20
104,Great Hospitality and Location,"Have been staying regular at this hotel for my business trips. Great location 10 minutes walking from Paddington, specially if you taking Heathrow Express from the airport. 

Hotel has a very warm and nice staff ready to help and accommodate customers requests. in my last visit their Manager on front desk Mr. Sakar was very helpful in accommodating me to their best rooms and like usual everything was very pleasant service, breakfast, their concierge also always ready to help and catch a cab if required.

So guys a big thumbs up for this small yet very nicely staffed hotel.

104,Small but all you really need...,"Great for a hot and sticky weekend in July: small, single room but fantastic air conditioning!  Great location, just a stroll down from Paddington.  Nice bar, great place for a night cap.  I did not try any of the food.  And I must agree with other comments, very friendly and knowledgeable staff",4,2017,10,16
104,Great hotel in the city centre of London,"The hotel was very nice and very central. The room was great, very clean and exactly what I was expecting after seeing the pictures online. Breakfast was of good quality too.
The stuff was friendly and useful, specially a lady in the reception called Arina, that answered all my questions regarding London and the hotel, being extremely useful and facilitating my trip very much.",5,2017,10,16

104,Four star hotel - Five star services ,"Excellent facilities in Park Grand and very welcoming services. 
Hotel is situated in very heart of london in paddington area . 
A little bit of quality boutique hotel in classy English victorian building. 
Easy to reach oxford street and Edgware road proximity of 15 mins walk . 
All staff were uniformly pleasant, responsive and very attentive. 
In particular Sakar has been very helpful in ensuring my stay was pleasant, as a result i push my company to accommodate in this hotel till I finished my work. ",5,2017,10,16
104,Comfortable Stay,"This was the first time I had stayed at the Park Grand Hyde Park. It is very conveniently located near Paddington station on Westbourne Terrace and is quite close to a number of restaurants.

I booked the the day before through a last minute website and got a good deal but I would also suggest you call the hotel direct.

The Park Grand is in a lovely building but has at some time been converted. The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful and the registration was painless. The room I was given was functional but very small. Having said that it had all I required albeit a single bed which I haven‚Äôt slept in for a while. The room was modern and clean and the bathroom was modern and fresh and there was plenty of hot water. There was also a TV and free WiFi. This was a business stay so I was perfectly satisfied with the accommodation having arrived in the evening, gone out for a meal and left by 9am the following morning.

The Park Grand is within easy walking distance of restaurants around Paddington.

I had paid for breakfast in the rate and there was plenty on offer by way of cereals and cooked breakfast.

I would definitely stay at the Park Grand again for convenience",3,2017,10,15
104,Best relaxation time ..... ,"Stayed here for 2 nightss... was welcomed with a smiley receptionist. Each and everytime i pass by the reception i am greeted with a smile. The room is nice and clean. The staff was very friendly especially i would thank Alrina from reception amazing girl. With a smile on her face always. And Pavel a friendly person.
I would definitely return here for my next visit. ",5,2017,10,14
104,My fourth business trip in park grand,Located just 5 minutes walk from the the Paddington Station. Great welcome from the staff who knows the true value of customer service special mention for reception (Sakar) and the restaurant for first class service. Overall the stay was pleasant and enjoyable.,5,2017,10,13
104,A little disappointing,"Having stayed at 2 other Park Grand hotels near Paddington, this was a little disappointing. We had upgraded to a club room but when we arrived were told we had been upgraded to a duplex room. This was a large room/rooms but smelt of damp which had been masked with plug in air fresheners, not nice. The bedroom was accessed via narrow rickety stairs and the room downstairs was obviously meant as a second bedroom as it was kitted out with just a sofa bed. Ideal for a family of 4 but wasted on us. We were woken in the middle of the night by guests arriving in the room above, it is an old building and guess sound proofing not brilliant. Staff were on the whole lovely. The cooked breakfast was very good but a tad cold, not a great choice of meats and cheeses should that be your preference. We got in at 11.15pm hoping for a night cap but the bar had closed at 11.00pm. We wouldn‚Äôt mind returning but not in a duplex room",3,2017,10,13
104,"Great location, Friendly stuff and very helpful Free Wi fi device","We stayed in this hotel for seven nights.
The hotel is located in a beautiful street, just a few minutes from Paddington station.
The stuff was very friendly and helpful.
The Room was nice and clean although the bath room was small with shower only. 
A nice surprise was a free device with cellular data and local calls, it helped us a lot planning our stay and navigating in the city.",4,2017,10,12
104,Avoid,I had a terrible experience here. My room was prepaid and the surly staff insisted on charging my credit card when I arrived assuring me they would refund it. Instead they refunded the card to which had been used to prepay it. My room was small and awkward with a second floor sleeping space and dingy bathroom.,2,2017,10,11
104,London,"3 noches ...buena ubicaci√≥n.
Good confortable rooms . 
Price was extensiva. 
Breakfast was tasty and fresh.
Lovely staff and very helpful especial menci√≥n Mr Sakar 
Internet must come back next year.
Thank you ",5,2017,10,07
104,Disappointing stay,"I stayed here for two nights. The Single room (room 818) I was allocated on arrival was tiny, with no bath. Apparently this is standard. It was so small that I couldn't even wheel my bag into the main part of the room, it would only make it past the door, and then I had to lift it to get it onto the bed where I could open it. Decor was poor (see photo of cracked lampshade... The same in both rooms). Cleanliness was generally very good. As for the bed, the mattress was so soft and old, and sloped that I literally felt I was climbing up towards the wall all night! On the second night, I was moved to a double room (room 810, complimentary upgrade) which had a bath, but the top window pane rattled so badly that I was woken at 2am by the noise and ended up stuffing tissues around the sides of the pane to keep it in place. The staff were really lovely and helpful though, so I feel sad that I can't give the hotel a better review. The breakfast was good. I've previously stayed at the Melia White House, and I'll be returning there next time. ",3,2017,10,06
104,"Great location, lovely hotel, fantastic staff! ","3rd stay at this hotel , keep coming back whenever visit London for many reasons , perfect location , and the good service , Sakar always looks after us and him and his staff go out there way to make the stay that extra bit special. Sakar always treats us like family and always makes up feel welcome and always gives us great tips on where to eat out and things to do in London! Will be back to this hotel without a doubt!

104,Sixth times in Park Grand and it is definitely a GRAND ,"Having staying in park Grand for several times over the years . I love ever bit of it . 
From front desk to housekeeping and restaurant team to porters . 
Each and every staff I come across is very helpful . 
I don‚Äôt feel like staying at Hotel it‚Äôs more like my OWN HOME . 
I am always thankful to the manger Sakar who goes out of his way to makes sure we have a pleasant stay . 
Also I would like to thank DARJA for stopping taxi for us . 
Thank you Park Grand ",5,2017,10,05
104,It has been a fabulous stay and helpful staff,"I am on a business trip from Abuja for six nights.
I was not sure what to expect staying on so called Boutique hotel . 
Never stayed at anything like this ...
When arrived was greeted by very warm and helpful reception staff . 
Room is very comfortable at very competitive prices in London. 
Very good location near paddington station . 
Away from hustle and bustle road traffic . 
Special thanks to Mr Sakar who accommodate us in a nice room and Mrs Darja with her recommendations.

104,Pleased with my choice,"I'm in London for 10 nights to indulge myself in art and historical architecture Tonight is the seventh night.  I booked the hotel almost a year ago.  I have been a bit skeptical, because of the mixed reviews but that doubt soon disappeared.  The minute I stepped into the hotel I was greeted by many friendly cheerful faces.  Grateful that Mr. Sarka upgraded me to a deluxe double.  The room is small but that's expected since the sizes were clearly stated on the website.  Although small there's adequate space for a fairly good size desk, a small wardrobe (with a safe), a double bed and a space between the end of the bed and the wardrobe where I placed flat my suitcase, a flat screen TV.  The washroom though small is modern and very clean, the shower is good size (rectangular) and the shower head is very strong and comfy.  I really enjoyed a hot shower and the comfortable bed after a long day.  On top of all that they provide me a handy phone with unlimited data, local and international calls...although my own phone has a roaming plan their handy phone saved me from overusing my data plan because I can use their phone for all day GPS needs.  I don't eat at he hotel because there are so many eateries around and there are two supermarkets including the Marks & Spencer's inside the Paddington Station.  As for getting around this location is 5 stars.  It's only 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station (rail and tube) if you come and go from Heathrow this is a perfect location.  The Lancaster tube is also 5 minutes away.  There are, beside the rail and tubes, buses just around the corner to take you to all the key attractions- in fact I prefer the bus because the tube is overheated and you can't see anything like you can on buses.  I'm very satisfied with my stay so far - the only reason for one star short of five is the towels - I don't mind there's no face towel because I always bring my own but the bath towels really need to be replaced.  I was told that there's a total renovation plan in place and that's why they are not getting new towels for now.  This will be my choice hotel when I visit London in future.",4,2017,10,04
104,Just horrible,"I made the mistake of giving this hotel the benefit of the doubt by booking a second stay. I never will again. My first stay, the room was pleasant (An executive double) although the air-conditioning unit was leaking as if the tap had been left on! Repairs were carried out daily to no avail and when I gave them the opportunity to fix it whilst I was out, they lied saying it had been fixed and then blamed me for being in the room when the engineer came? I actually called through to reception to tell them when I would be leaving for that day. The duty manager, Mr Sadak was pleasant and professional and changed our room but this left a sour taste. Upon our second booking, again an executive double we were greeted by Mr Sadak upon arrival to be told that the room we booked was not as big and they had no other rooms available? We gave them the benefit of the doubt by entering our room to find it was a double bed in a box room! Just enough space to walk around the bed and the same with the shower (No bath tub). How is this in anyway an executive double? It was a single room with a double bed!! We left that very night, no more than an hour after checking in! A different duty manager asked if there was anything she could do but I gracefully did not give her the opportunity, having known what I did from what Mr Sadak told me (Unfortunately I gave them story to my immediate departure). Never will I ever stay at this hotel again.",1,2017,10,04
104,Anytime again!!,"Everyone there in the hotel was very friendly. A warm welcome by Pavel, when arriving, was the first contact :-))) - great. The desk staff help me at once, because I need an adapter for the socket-outlet to charge my smartphone - no problem. The room was nice and cosy - the bathroom is just a little bit to small, but everything was clean there - and this is essential!!!! The breakfast is fine (the staff there absolut friendly) and my cousin (glunten-allergic) can eat her own bread in the breakfastroom.",5,2017,10,03
104,Nice Frontage,"The only good thing about this hotel was the frontage.  Its looks stylish and has character but as soon as you enter the lift its ALL down hill.

We always book hotels that are 4 stars or above, there is no way this hotel is 4 stars, its 2 stars at best.  The room we had was for a single person - tiny. The bathroom was so small you could just about use the toilet, the control which operates the shower/bath was faulty and the wash basin was shoved in a corner which every time you used saturated the floor.  The view from the window was the top of buildings with electric wires lying in pools of water left by the rain.  

IT WAS AWFUL.

We have been on a world trip and have booked ALL our accommodation through booking.com. I am beginning to wonder whether the hotels give you the CRAPIEST rooms knowing that you have booked at a cheaper price.  We have had not one decent hotel and every hotel booked was 4 stars or higher?  I will not be using them again.",1,2017,09,30
104,Outstanding! ,"Booked this hotel last minute in hopes of easy travel the next morning to Heathrow Airport. We were greeted by friendly front desk staff, he informed me that I was being upgraded to a top floor suite at no additional cost. The room was clean and large, containing a couch , desk and king size bed. The room had a bowl of fresh fruit, cookies and bottled water.  The suite contained a portable device to use for free that had data. We took it out with us and used it for google maps and locating nearby pubs/ bars. Morning commute to Heathrow was very easy. Paddington station is a 5 min walk from hotel where we grabbed the Heathrow express and was at the airport within 30 mins. Excellent and easy commute to all tourist areas from this train station. Will definitely book again for the easy commute to airport and overall comfort of this hotel. ",5,2017,09,28
104,Superb Hotel Superb location,Stayed at the Park Grand twice now for business and pleasure and an amazing hotel in perfect location. Right on the door step of Hyde Park.

104,Just right,"Coming off a less than stellar AirBnB experience, we checked into the Park Grand Hyde Park for the last two nights of a London vacation. We were so glad we did.
The room was plenty big enough for the two of us and our luggage, it was clean, quiet and comfortable, and the Park Grand added enough extra touches that we felt like we were in the lap of luxury or not far from it. 
Full English breakfast was included in rate, as was a mobile phone for us to use for calling family and surfing internet while touring London and the countryside. 
It was short walk to Paddington Station, making it convenient for us to catch the Heathrow Express train back to the airport when our stay was over.",5,2017,09,25
104,"Fine room, beautiful area, convenient to transportation, lovely staff","Everything at this hotel was great, staff very congenial. At breakfast, they provided cappuccino as well as oatmeal made with soya milk when I asked for it. Amazing! I loved my room on the seventh floor, great view over rooftops towards Hyde Park, lots of natural light, very quiet, good bathroom with shower. I stayed six nights and was delighted with the ambiance, the room service, and the beautiful tree-lined streets where the hotel is located. It's also terribly convenient to Paddington Station, where trains whizz back and forth to Heathrow and go to points west like Bristol and Cardiff. And Hyde Park is a few steps away, as are some good restaurants. Bizzarro offers superb Italian cuisine and is just around the corner. Just a delightful hotel. Highly recommended. I was there for a family wedding and to see theatre. Access to ground transportation--bus and underground--was incredibly easy. I live in New York City and do not have a car so am used to relying on public transportation. London is a gem of a place for public transportation.",5,2017,09,25
104,My favourite hotel in London in recent times,"I visit London about once a year  for business purpose. I have been to staying at Park Grand London Hyde Park hotel in recent times because of the good services I receive. The hotel is located near Paddington train station serviced by Heathrow Express directly from the Airport. Two of the notee friendly staff include Sakar and Arina.

104,Superb hotel in Paddington ,"I booked this hotel for five nights a deluxe double room as our yearly holiday trip in London with my wife . 
I was not sure what to expect but had good reviews and got good price on Expedia . 
When we arrived checking-in was very swift and we were given room on sixth floor 611 . 
We were not happy with our rooms because all decor were tired , small bathrooms and over all my wife was very disappointed. 
I went downstairs and requested to speak to the . I was greeted by Mr Sakar , I raised my concerns and he immediately showed us various double room and we choose room 611 . 
We really really loved and like the way our issues was handed and provided a very comfortable and spacious room which exceeded our expectations. 
Yes this hotel is in very lovely neighbour hood in Westbourne terrace . Short walk takes to either Paddington station or Lancaster gate or Hyde park . 
Over all I loved the hospitality and locations . 
Especially mention Sakar and Arina for all efforts. 
Be Back in two weeks . ",5,2017,09,24
104,4 out of 5,"Having stayed here before, thanks to TripAdvisor reviews, I had no hesitation in booking again.  

Overall it was good,  pleasant staff on reception and in and around the hotel. Room was small, but was a single and reasonably priced for London.  Fresh fruit in room each day was a nice touch.  The only thing stopping a 5, was my breakfast experience. 2 days out of 3, the buffet food was barely warm and 2 days out of 3 I had to remind the lady I'd ordered coffee five minutes previously.

104,Handy for Paddington Area but I Wouldn't Return,"I stayed here recently for a number of nights on business having chosen the hotel in a bit of a rush from a coprorate travel booking system.

The hotel is very near to Paddington and the buildings are externally appealing and are on what looks like a decent street. Once inside, check-in was fine and the receptionist was friendly although I did make a note that payment was asked for on check-in which isn't perhaps the norm but it didn't bother me too much.

Writing this review after staying, my advice would be that you ask to see your room before you make that payment up-front in case you want to change your mind as I'm not sure I'd stay here again.

My room was on the top floor of the hotel and the lift doesn't go beyond the 6th floor so I had to walk the last part up to the 7th floor. The stairs themselves were suprisingly steep with very narrow treads and the corridors, doors, carpets etc. gave an impression of a hotel which is looking pretty tired and where the maintenance feels very much from the ""DIY"" school.

The same was true of my room which had steps almost immediately behind its door which I more or less fell down on stepping in.

It was pretty small and the carpets and fixtures felt tired and/or not so well put together in the first place. For example, the carpet could have been cleaner, the wallpaper and skirting boards were marked as was the furniture. The TV was missing its remote control and the bathroom was very small with some of the grout missing, gaps around the fitting of the ceiling fan, etc.

That night, I rang down to reception to ask whether they had a larger room but they were reporting full on the night but suggested that I might be able to switch to another room the next evening.

The next morning, I found that there was no hot water so I had to start the day with a cold shower which I mentioned at reception and I was advised that there was a problem with the boiler that had 'never happened before' and that I'd be moved to a different room later in the day.

That evening, I'd been moved and the hot water was back. The room and its bathroom were bigger but, otherwise, were in similar condition to the first room. Again, the decoration and furniture was tired, the wallpaper was starting to peel in places. 

This room also had steps just inside its doorway and it adjoined another room through a white door spattered in what looked like grey paint with a keyhole that someone had crammed something like putty or sealant into. Between the bathroom and the bedroom was a large glass window which had then been covered with a material which was then water stained and shabby around the edges.

Additionally, the wall between the rooms seemed thin and noise travelled quite a lot from that adjoining room where someone was pretty noisy until 4am and I found it pretty hard to get any sleep that night.

The next night was much better. My noisy neighbour seemed to have been gone and I got a decent sleep until around 7am the following day when the fire alarm went off. It rang for a short period of time and then stopped. Around 5 minutes later it rang again and then went off again.

In the evening at around 11.30pm the fire alarm went off again and, as before, stopped after a short time.

3 fire alarms in just 2 days starts to make you wonder what's going on.

Later that evening I awoke at 3am to find that my neighbour had returned and wanted to watch TV and bang in and out of doors in the corridor. I could hear that they were watching ""First Dates Hotel"" and lost an hour or two of sleep before they finally turned it off and went quiet.

Naturally, my neighbour's behaviour isn't the hotel's fault. What was disappointing was how much noise travelled through the walls, floors and doors. I noticed that the gap under my bedroom door was around 2 inches high :-(

The rest of my stay was largely uneventful and I mostly stayed out of the hotel as much as possible. I didn't eat/drink there so I can't make any comment as to what the food or service might be like here.

To summarise a long review, I don't feel that the Park Grand offers value and I'd say it's worth around 50% of the rate that I paid for it. The rooms and public spaces are tired and can be noisy. One day there was no hot water. Other days, there were fire alarms.

Based on my experience, I'd struggle to recommend the hotel and wouldn't be looking to return and I'm surprised that it's got a 4.0 rating on Trip Advisor.

There are better places to stay in London that cost less money.",2,2017,09,17

104,A gem,"With the extensive number of hotels in London this is a gem, lovely welcome and really friendly staff. Mr Sakar made our visit to london extra special by being courteous and especially helpful all in a very professional way and with a good sense of humour. The room was probably smaller than we were expecting but it was perfectly fine after all we were visiting London not a hotel room. Breakfast was buffet style and very adequate, all the staff were helpful and very pleasant and made us feel like guests where so many city hotels treat you like a number. Will definitely revisit, good base from which to explore London.",5,2017,09,13

Each stay has been consistently good. Rooms very clean, staff helpful, excellent breakfast with very professional and hard working staff in what is obviously a very busy time.  Beds comfortable which contributed to a good night's sleep. All facilities in rooms more than adequate. 
Check-ins have been easy and efficient with the staff being very understanding of tired guests!
Special thanks to Sakar who was obviously very pleased when I told him how many times I've stayed here. 
Looking forward to next visit! ",5,2017,09,11

Above all, we found the staff amazing, helpful and friendly. Gurdeep, Aaron and Anthony - full marks for your cheerful and kind manner. Pavel, your assistance with the luggage and opening and shutting the doors were all done with a friendly smile.

The staff at the front desk were friendly.  We would stay here again because of the great location.",5,2017,09,07
104,A very good stay ,"Hotels and hospitality are best judged by how they act when things dont go as planned . After a mishap with my  reservations . the lovely staff did everything the could to help , and it was more than enough . 
special thanks are well deserved for Sakar , Darja , Aaron and Pavel for all their efforts . 
I will be after three months . 
",5,2017,09,06
104,Wouldn't recommend,"We booked through Trivago to stay at Paddington but due to the rubbish rooms there we were sent here. 

First family holiday, husband, I and our 10 month baby. Felt like we won the lottery when Trivago showed us this hotel for the price. 

Just goes to show 'if it's too good to be true it probably is'

I have given this hotel 2 stars due to the fact that the staff seemed a little friendlier than their sister branch. 

However the bed was an absolute joke. It was lopsided and the lamps were frayed and the carpet filthy. 

As we were so tired as we got given this room at 2.30am I had no desire to go back to the reception to complain. 

The only saving grace was he breakfast which was nice. Although a few more vegetarian options would have been nice. 

To give his due 'Brian' did say he would move us to another room but we decided against it due to the sheer amount of things we would need to move but I did make my decision that I would not be staying at this brand of hotels again.",2,2017,09,06
104,Great experience as always By MR SAKAR,"Great hotel, pleasant staff. Always welcomed when I arrive.

104,Mr Sakar and Mrs Darja,"I am very regular to this hotel and what's makes me keep on coming back is the warm hospitality I receive from the front desk Mr Sakar and Mrs Darja.
I always have problems sometimes booking this hotel because price always varies . 
Yes I am a regular guest to this hotel , I have given them so much business but why they can't look after their regular guest like myself??????????
In business there always should be give and take but in this company I don't see this .
I didn't stay at this hotel during this visit, I have been staying in the strand palace hotel because I had no choice price was sky high and their reservations team refused to offer me better price .
Even though, I was not staying in your hotel my heart could not let me leave London before I meet and see these amazing guys Sakar and Darja . I would like to wish Mrs Darja for happy married life as she got married recently and got married with a descent man .
Mr Sakar I am not sure when you are settling down .
But hey guys it was such a pleasure to see you in person and catch up with you . I will be back on November and I do hope your reservations team will offer me good rate for one week .

Reached there to know that for some unknown reason our booking was cancelled. 11pm in the night and neither the hotel staff could help us nor suggest an alternative.We were stranded.
As we had previously amazing experience of staying in Park Grand Hyde Park where Mr Sakar and Ms Arina had helped us have a smooth and comfortable stay, we decided to meet him and seek help.
This time was no different. As soon as we met him he assured that he would sort things out for us. Mr Sakar and Ms Arina were rockstars who sorted things out for us and helped us to have a place to stay.
Customer service and customer experience is taken to a different level by these people.
Thanks both for a wonderful experience.
Requesting the management to make note of such extraordinary display of customer experience.

104,DECENT AND AFFORDABLE CHOICE NEAR PADDINGTON STATION,"This hotel is in a residential area, within easy walking distance of Paddington Station and well within the normal price range of four-star hotels in London. Everything in this hotel is small but adequate, except for the bathrooms which are absurdly small and crammed, even for slim guests. The furniture is modern and comfortable and overall cleanliness is very good. Although there is a lift, many rooms require climbing stairs to get to them. Some rooms have stairs within the room itself; this may be a problem for physically challenged guests. Breakfast is served in an attractive and well illuminated dining room in the basement and offers a wide choice of tasty dishes. The hotel's best feature is the service provided by its staff. It is friendly, efficient and competent.",4,2017,08,29
104,A Top quality place to stay in London ,"EXCELLENT SPOT TO STAY IN LONDON NO MATTER WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING FOR TO DO. 
Hyde Park is just across the road,  marble arch,  Edgware Road,  Oxford Street nearby walking distance.  Heathrow express is the most convenient way to get to airport from Paddington which five minutes walk.  
I had chicken tikka masala one evening that was very tasty super than restaurants I tried.  
The staff are outstanding throughout especially mention Mr Sakar who is a truly LEGEND. 
Excellent stay.

104,A smart hotel 5 minutes walk from Paddington station,"A very pleasant stay, my second time at one of the Park Grand suite of hotels, offering a warm friendly welcome upon check in, attentive service, smiles and greetings from all staff throughout my short visit. 
The two rooms I stayed in had some minor niggley maintenance issues which could have easily been avoided if attentive inspections were carried out on a more frequent basis, however, these were resolved quickly.  Both double rooms I occupied were on the small side, particularly one of them which should really be sold as a single room. They could benefit from a make over and a lick of paint as they are looking a bit worn and shabby now. 
The beds are comfortable with nice crisp sheets and four pillows but the duvet was a little too warm for my own liking.

Everything is kept clean and tidy, complimentary gels in the bathroom, tea and coffee making facilities with biscuits, two small bottles of water and a plate with an apple and orange.
Breakfast is served in the basement, though it is well presented, bright and airy with a good choice of hot and cold breakfast items to choose from which are kept regularly topped up and fresh. A very good start to the day.
Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at either of the Park Grand hotels, the Paddington Court or the Hyde Park when in in London.",4,2017,08,26
104,Thank you very much Mr Sakar,"We were planning holiday to london from long time. Wanted to stay in central and we found this hotel on Booking.com .

104,"Amazing hotel, thank you Sakar!","Me and my partner stayed here for a little getaway for my birthday. The hotel itself is within walking distance from most parts of London so a very good location no matter what you're wanting to do. From the moment we walked through the doors we were made to feel welcome, when we got to our room we had champagne, chocolates and a lovely cake waiting for us (the cake was delicious!) the room itself (club double room) was very clean, plenty of refreshments, the bed was very comfortable and sprinkled with rose petals which was a lovely surprise! The staff are always so friendly, always smiling and will always go out of their way to say hello and ask how your day has been. The manager Sakar and Lucian are both brilliant, made us feel very welcome throughout our stay, both polite, attentive and couldn't do enough for us, they definitely made our stay more enjoyable! We will 100% return to this hotel and would definitely recommend others to stay here too!

104,At first one of the managers was not too friendly but Aaron made it all work out beautifully,My son and I stay there for four nights before backpacking across the western Europe. One of the managers was not very friendly at all but the rest of the staff was more than hospitable and helpful. One even consoled me after I found out that I lost my Eurorail pass for the trains through Europe. He took some time to talk to me suggested a place where I could go walk in Hyde Park and clear my mind. And the next day the not so kind manager was very sharp and rude not very kind at all. But everyone else on the staff was very aware of his behavior. We were able to leave a bag with The hotel for the 2 1/2 weeks while we backpack through Western Europe and spend our last night before coming back to the United States in the same hotel. Aaron again save the day by giving us an upgraded room with all the amenities of fruit basket some things to drink and a very warm smile. He one back this customer. For life!,4,2017,08,22

In particular, I would to mention the hospitality of Mr. Sakar, the hotel manager, and the efficient service of Mr. Anthony, the resturant manager. The rooms were comfortable and very clean.

104,DO NOT STAY HERE MANAGER THREATENED ME WITH LEGAL ACTION,"We stayed here on the 18th to 20th of July on second night my girl had cut her foot and had to go to hospital in space of one hour of being out of room while ambulance to come a member of staff had entered room and took most of our valuables when I had gone back to room I found items missing I asked the night staff if they could check the Cctv with there reply it was only managers that could check and was told to come back at 9am. At 9am I returned to the main desk where I was greeted by the manager he then lead me to the hotel bar area and before I had a chance to explain he started telling me how his business was small family business and that my accusations of a member of staff stealing from my room would result in him taking legal action aganced  me I was shocked and disgusted and told him that I didn't accuse anyone and that his whole place was full of Cctv and just wanted to make sure no one had gone in or if the stuff had been left somewhere when my girlfriend left to go to hospital without another word I stopped him and told him that he better call police because I was going to stand for this and that I would be leaving once police got here and I had explained after 10 minutes we had a knock at door I was greeted by 5 police officers and told that I better calm down I was very calm and was trying to explain when one of the police officers stopped me and said we don't care pack your stuff and get out I was shocked by what he said as I looked at the manager I could see the nasty smirk on his face (horrible little man) after a few moments me and my girl friend was separated and both me and her had our belongings checked to make sure we didn't have them we know we didn't have them because someone had stolen them I then asked the police to check the Cctv because of missing stuff and was told they wasn't interested in this matter they was only interested in getting us out the hotel the a few moments later the manager got a phone call he then went away and come back with a machine he went passed my self he then  plugged it into the door while the police stood there  and wiped any information the door had! trying to hide the face that someone had been in room I know from passed stays at hotel
U can check at desk who has been in and out of rooms so why would he have a machine to so say check information on door I said to police are u going to let them do that before u have checked anything and there reply was we will do our checks after we have spoken to your girlfriend I was disgusted and in the end we had no option but to leave but when I was leaving the manager  told me to write all my details down and that his legal
Team would be in contact I refused and left after some time arguing with police about my car and them doing a number of checks on my self and my car the manager walked out and said that he had found our stuff in the basement level the level that only staff had access to so how was this possible what a joke I took my stuff and left my advice to anyone staying here is do not leave anything no matter of the value as people like to take and staff and managers are not willing to help or check Cctv but rather threaten u with court action but all I say to you mr manager I look forward to your day in court I hope u have big pockets for all your mouth stay away from this hotel",1,2017,08,20

That is it, the best of the hotel.
Nowhere near a 4 starts hotel... first, the stairs to arrive to the room, tiny and ridiculous! Hard to carry a luggage upstairs. 
Bedroom was awkward, tiny, old windows, dirty carpet, tiny bathroom, soft bed, a ""fruit platter"" with a sad apple and a mandarin rapped in plastic paper...
Tiny toilet with no space even to leave the toiletry.
A huge disappointment compared to the photos!
Definitely more a 3 star hotel... down part is that I went there with a better deal thanks to my work... not sure how the normal deal would be...

Getting in contact with the concierge via email was a breeze. They were so understanding of my situation that they even organised express postage of my lost jacket.

We wasted 2hours of our Saturday morning waiting to speak to manager. Whilst he did give us another room, he insulted us by referring to our size. I also enquirer about a vegetarian breakfast as I was told on first morning that I had to book this when booking room. He told me a shouldn't be a vegetarian. He also promised his business card to give us a good deal next time but of course we never saw him again.  Hotel is clean and in good location but not impressed at all with reception and management.",3,2017,08,08
104,Horrible,"This hotel is horrible. The room being small it was included in the description. The fact that the windows do not close properly and they consider it ok, wasnt't. The hair dryer and complimentary mobile phone were broken. The kettle was musty. The towels were  pretty dated.",2,2017,08,08
104,It was nice.... but,"It was a nice hotel, our room was on 0-floor. Room was ok, but littlebit weird because there was a door to the tiny room or somekind of closet? And inside there was lot of paperboxes somekind accounting papers etc? And bathroom have a large window to the otherside. There was only black curtain what covers window at otherside so you cant control it. If you go with your friends and you dont want them see you naked then dont take this room :D because curtain is only otherside and everyone can open it :D. Ventilation at bathroom was weird and dont have any guide for it. And A/C machine at restaurant was too high and cold. If u sit under it with your warm breakfast its not anymore warm. But the location and the staff was perfect.",3,2017,08,07
104,Thanks Sakar ,"Awesome place 

Great staff 

Very helpful team 

Central location 

10 out of 10
We loved our stay at the park grand and staff were very very very helpful in all day in and out 
Mr Sakar thank you for everything ",5,2017,08,07
104,Really terrible,"My mother and I went to London at the beginning of July. We chose this hotel because it was near Hyde Park where I was going to the Tom Petty concert on Sunday the 9th. The hotel was expensive and when we arrived, first there were a lot of people trying to do the check-in. We waited around 40 minutes or so. Apparently the place was undergoing some construction or (much needed)  renovations or something so they moved us to a different building and it was terrible. We asked for double room with two beds,and they gave what is supposed to be that but it was tiny, we barely could fit with our bags, let alone move around the room. When we asked to be changed the people on the other property, which I'm guessing it's cheaper than the other one, told us they had to charge for the upgrade so, because we really didn't fit in the other room, we accepted. But this other room was bad too. We found a few ants on one of the beds, then one morning the shower didn't work and they couldn't fix. The water was too hot and the solution they gave me was to leave the water from the faucet open while taking a shower so it could be more cold....so as you can read, it was a mess. The only thing good was that it is indeed really close to Hyde Park and two different Tube stations: Paddington and Lancaster Gate. Around Paddington you can find options to eat. There was one guy, but I can't remember his name, that was extremely helpful. So I really want to thank him because the really did tried to assist me and my mother. Anyway, as usual, hotel rooms does not look like in the pretty pictures on their websites. For me, this was an expensive hotel that was definitely not worth it and I do not recommend it.",1,2017,08,06
104,Not worth the price tag ,"I stayed in the Park Grad Hyde Park with high hopes.  On checking in, the lady at the reception desk didn't have the friendliest attitude, was very matter of fact and somewhat brash. 
I was given the key to my room and made my way over. 
On arrival to my room, I noticed that the trash was not emptied from the previous guest (it contained some personal papers - probably a good idea not to throw these out in a hotel bin as you don't know if they're emptying the trash). As well as this, the bed sheets had small red stains on them which you would not expect for ¬£130 a night. 
If given the choice, I would not stay in this hotel again as the rooms were very small and for the price, the cleanliness was not up to the standard that it should have been. Continental breakfast for ¬£10 was as expected - scrambelled eggs, mushrooms, bacon, cereals etc.  
A positive, however, was the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were nice and firm. 
",3,2017,08,06
104,Thank you Sakar ,"I stayed there for 7 nights and it was really awesome . 
Hotel is in good location good stuff this why i choose to stay . 
I booked a deluxe single room and it was smaller than I expected. I will book double next time . 
All staff are very friendly , special mention to Mr sakar who is very nice . 
I would recommend this hotel to everybody. ",5,2017,08,05
104,Nice area and great location for Paddington and other transport links,"I arrived to a very warm welcome and smooth check in.  I have been upgraded to a duplex suite, with the sleeping area upstairs( with very creaky stairs!).  The bathroom is downstairs and very small & no room to put anything!  The room smells faintly of the cheap tree air freshener that you get in cars, but it is very clean with a fridge and microwave.  Cookies and fruit too! The wifi is very fast and stable.  There is quite a lot of traffic noise, but the air con is masking it.  Plenty of nearby restaurants and shops to choose from.",4,2017,07,31
104,Hidden gem in London ,"I visit London about once every 2-3 months and frequently stay at the park grand chain .
On every visit I am warmly greeted by Darja and Sakar at reception who's always working on lave evening shift .
They remember I enjoy my lamb curry and pint of cobra after check-in and when I fancy something else always suggest booking a table for me .
on business travels arriving from airport I appreciate quick and smooth service and someone knows I will need to be feed as well . 
Thanks guys for great services.

104,Clean hotel in great area of paddington ,"This hotel is very clean and all the staff are very friendly. 
Good value for money . Its convenient to bus line and underground from paddington and lancaster gate station. 
I would highly recommend this hotel for travelers either for leisure or business. 
The hotel staff was also fantastic with everything we requested. Special mention to Mr Sakar and Ms Darja on front desk . 
I had a very bad headache felt like a migraine attack . Sakar and Darja went out their way to get me to saint marys hospital , they were so caring and helpful. 
We will definitely be staying here again inshallah next year vacation. ",5,2017,07,30
104,Great location & staff. Tiny room,"We booked a family room for 4. There was not enough room for us to even walk with us in the room 
The bathroom was smaller than my closet. Noplace to move or put any of our toiletries. 

There were 2 full sized beds. Not even queen. One of the kids had to sleep on the floor. There was not room for a roll away bed in the room and not room for 2 big teen boys in that tiny bed. 

The staff was fantastic - could not have been nicer or more helpful.  They had to work with what they had

They charged me 8 pounds ($12) for coffee. The moderate buffet was 15 pounds ($23). Not worth it. 

It's well located near Paddinggon station so easy to get from place to place. 

Don't think I will book there again.",3,2017,07,30
104,Uncomfortable stay,"Pro:
Nice location, polite staff.

Cons:
Lack of furnitures (no dinning table and chairs), and destructed uncomfortable bed.

tl;dr
I'm aware that hotel rooms in London are small.  we stay at a 2 story suite with a living room and kitchen.

There are _NO_ furniture for dinning, no table to place your food.

This might not be critical, since London is a city with lots of restaurants.

Here's the worst part, the bed is totally gone. no support and extremely uncomfortable. My personal opinion, hotel is where you rest. There is no way you can get any sleep on this bed!

I'm not a picky sleeper, and not talking about some plush bed.  This is even worse than sleeping on the floor.

I don't think a decent bed to rest is too much to ask for a ""4 star bouquet hotel in London""...",1,2017,07,28
104,Thank you sakar and draja for great hospitality ,"I arrived from indoor with my wife to celebrate our honeymoon in london for 4 nights . 
When we arrived we were not happy with our room . We requested manager to provide us a good room so that we have comfortable space . 
We were given room m4 which was spacious and clean and comfortable too . 
Very clean hotel and must admit its a fantastic base to roam around london to do anything you wish for . 
We have breakfast in the morning, its very tasty and fresh . Staff are very polite. 
All in all i would like to thank Mr Sakar and Ms Darja for helping us to make our stay stress free . 
We will for sure recommend this hotel to all our family and relatives in India . 
Thank you ",5,2017,07,27
104,"Friendly staff, only basic amenities","The staff was really friendly and location is conveniently located near Paddington station. The actual accommodations were just okay. The room was tiny (even for London) and dated. The breakfast is served in the basement, and food was just okay.",3,2017,07,27
104,fantastic stay ,"My wife wanted to spend three nights in London  before we leave for our holiday in Thailand and wanted to cram in as much sightseeing as possible and romantic roof top restaurants and bars. 
We started with Jersey boys musical which was mind blowing. 
I am very much so thankful to my wife that she choose this hotel. which is located very near to Paddington, Hyde park., Edgware road and bays water. 

Our room was on 6th floor great views, which was lovely, very clean, crisps linen and overall very spacious. 
ALL staff members we came across were very friendly and attentive. 
lastly their restaurant is in basement, which was again nice very helpful staff. 
However, my only concern was they are not open for dining. 
The hotel is in great location and we will definitely be staying there again. 
",5,2017,07,27
104,Very good location and excellent breakfast,"The room was indeed rather small as was the bathroom but it really had all you needed. Bedding was great as was the shower . Airco and heating were perfect as I was staying in January. Reception staff was very efficient and extremely friendly. Breakfast was excellent even outstanding to English standards. I never had to wait one second to have anything done or taken care off. Checking in and out in the blink of an eye. Very handy is the free mobile you are granted during your stay. The hotel is on walking distance from Paddington station which gives you a direct link to St Pancras. Hyde Park and Kensington Palace are just around the block. There is an abundant choice of restaurants in the immediate neighbourhood. Apart from the room s space, but it was well furnished and spotlessly clean, this is certainly a very good high standard 4 star London hotel that I would certainly recommend. I had a room on the 5th Floor, road side and it was most quiet to sleep as it is not situated on a very traffic dense boulevard!!! Still very close to city center by bus or tube!!",4,2017,07,24
104,Never again,"We arrived late in the evening at the hotel and there was already a queue at the reception. Staff simply was not able to find any reservation in their system and asked for confirmation codes. I did not hear this questions for years. After providing these they did not find any reservation for my friend and some other folks in the queue. Asking what to di now the seriously responded: ""Go on the internet and search"". WHAT?
They found my reservation while my friend was trying to find something else. If I only would have done that as well. This was the smallest room ever and it was even in the underground level with a small windows to a backyard. The room was about 2x3m and the bathroom another 1x1. Paying 200GBP/night for this is ridiculous. Early checkout was not possible. Breakfast was OK if you can find a staff member that is able to understand the complex request: ""Tea please"".
Bath room was not clean.
Never ever again!!",1,2017,07,22
104,"Good location, mediocre hotel","The hotel is located on a nice street, 5 minute walk to Paddington station. We stayed in the family room which we found clean but extremely small. Double beds were also small in size. The bathroom was about 2 square meters! The plus in the room was the presence of air conditioning. Breakfast was OK. The reception was also attentive and helpful. The price was aligned to what you get in return. ",3,2017,07,20
104,Appalling Hotel Customer Service.,"I booked this hotel on 27.1.17 way in advance as we had tickets for the BST concert in Hyde Park. I guaranteed my booking with my debit card details. I emailed the hotel the week before departure to ensure all was ok and the hotel replied saying looking forward to welcoming you. On the day of the concert I rang the hotel from the train on the way into London to confirm we had arrived but to say as the concert started at 1pm(before check-in time) we were going straight there so wouldn't be checking in until later, they said that was fine. At 17.42pm I received a text from the central reservations team saying room was 'Not guaranteed and therefore cancelled' . We were in Hyde Park with 65000 people on the same day as London Gay Pride day with no room available for miles. We are females in our 50s and 60s. This spoiled our whole experience. As it was impractical for us to make calls from our mobiles due to the excessive noise/surroundings etc we had no option other than to text our families to try and sort out the mess. They eventually did find us a room at the opposite side of London for twice the price we had secured at this hotel plus found out that the booking was cancelled due to boiler issues. No apology was then or has since been given, and on top of that the full fee for room was taken from my bank account. I have made numerous calls to the hotel since arriving home trying to get the payment reversed. At one point I was told 'it should be reversed but if it isn't get back to us and we will look at it!'.
Shocking. I never expected such treatment from a reputable brand hotel!! Please be aware when booking with this company!! Did anybody else experience this on the 8th July ??",1,2017,07,19
104,A memorable night,"The Park Grand was a completely random choice, booking.com threw up a variety of hotels in the area, PG offered onsite parking.

I travel a lot and know how competitive this market is, for a single night stay it is hard to impress. Having driven down in the evening from the Midlands after a daytime work event, simple hospitality was required rather than over servicing.

A greeting from an accented doorman set the tone, stripped back polite and professional. He read my body language well, engaged in conversation without intruding and handled the foyer needs perfectly.

Arini (apologies for spelling) checked me in smoothly and guided me on dinner and breakfast options. A couple were checking in next to me and the nature of their transaction was equally smooth and welcoming.

A long morning flight to Sydney meant no nightlife, no desire to seek out an intimate meal for one, a straight forward quality meal with a beer was needed and the front bar delivered.  

Arini turned out to be the shift supervisor and an exceptional hostess, she offered engaging conversation with all the bar guests without hesitation. Simple normal everyday conversation is rare at 10pm on a Saturday evening in a hotel bar, but its gold dust for the solo business traveller.

Breakfast was exceptional, a wide variety of high quality food and drink served by a merry band of restaurant staff.

Check out was as smooth as check in and Heathrow was my next destination.

I describe this review as a memorable night simply because it was perfect. Everyone made my stay just happen, everything simply worked. It's very hard to make that happen so naturally.

Thank you particularly to Arini but also to all the staff of PG.",5,2017,07,19
104,Okay stay,"Stayed here just one night for business reasons. The room was really small, as more rooms are in London, and so was the bathroom. Everything seemed clean and the bed was comfy enough for one night. Unfortunately the room wasn't soundproof as I could hear my neighbors television (turned on mine to let them know how noisy they were) and woke up several times at night due to passing guests. Wouldn't stay here again.",3,2017,07,14
104,Great value home from home in London,"London is an expensive place to stay even for just a night or two. The Park Grand hotels offer a wonderfully warm feeling and welcome that larger chains can't deliver.
This was my first stay but will not be my last.",4,2017,07,13
104,Good Economy Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights on vacation after some business travel to the UK.  It is approximately 2 blocks from Paddington Station (1 down and one over) so transportation by bus, train, and subway are incredibly easy.  It is on Westbourne Terrace which seems like it is a main street but there isn‚Äôt much noise from the street heard in the hotel.

There is an elevator that serves all floors (as far as I can tell), a restaurant in the basement, and small lobby with a separate lounge/bar on the main floor.  The staff was incredibly friend and ready to help with any requests I had.

The hotel is part of an old terraced house block and the walls are a little bit thin.  Talking can be heard thru the walls if it is above normal conversation level, but this didn‚Äôt seem to be a problem during the evening.

I booked a Deluxe Double Room.  The bed and furniture (desk, chair, and two small night tables) were adequate and comfortable.  It wasn‚Äôt a particular big room but it wasn‚Äôt particular small either.  In fact, it was bigger than the room at the Hilton London Metropole I stayed in on business travel.  Space around one side and the foot of the double bed was a bit tight but fine.  There was reasonable space between the other side of the bed and the desk.

The bathroom was a bit on the small side; the toilet was sandwiched between the wall and the shower and my shoulders often would touch both of those surfaces while sitting.

There were many electrical outlets (at least 6 easily accessible ones that I noticed) all UK standard plug type.  The room had also had a wall mounted ductless a/c unit.  There was also a standard laptop sized room safe in the closet, however, it wasn‚Äôt bolted to anything so if you wanted to pick it up and carry it away you could do that.  There was free wifi in the hotel and it had excellent signal strength and speed.",4,2017,07,12
104,"Great Hotel, Great Staff and Perfect Stay","I have traveled all over the world for work and always stay in 5 star hotel but wanted to do something different this time and have not been sorry. From the moment I got to the hotel I was treated as if I had walk into my fully staff home. This is a real review of this hotel and the people that work there. There is no words so say how helpful the staff was, how peaceful the area is but still close to transportion. The room that I stayed in was not a big room but I was alone and it was fine for me and CLEAN CLEAN and A/C that kept you cool in the heat wave that London is having now. Please keep in mind that all the rooms in Europe are not huge as space is limited. The hotel does have bigger room so if you want more space for two or more people my suggestion will be to get a bigger room. My time in London will not have been so enjoyable if it was not for the hotel staff Aaron, Pavel, Lucian and Sakar these people were warm, friendly and most of all helpful and happy to be so always with a smile on their face. I spoke to the staff about some of the negative reviews I have read and it was explain to me that sometime their sister hotels have to send over guests because somethings may not be working at the former hotel and they have to give the guests the rooms that they have at the Park Grand London Hype Park and it may not be the best however they move the guests to better rooms as soon as it becomes available. When my time was up to leave I was sorry I had booked to go to Brussels because I was so comfortable at the Park Grand London Hype Park. I plan to visit London again next year with my brother and his family and I have already spoken to the staff about the best rooms to get for a family.",5,2017,07,11
104,Great hotel and location,"Attended BST Hyde Park event. This Hotel was lovely. Very clean and well maintained. Staff were helpful and welcoming. Location was perfect for Central London Hyde Park and Oxford Street.  Based on an 'avenue' type street, nice and quiet.      ",5,2017,07,11
104,Great Hotel!,"I stayed 6 days at this hotel and it was a good experience. It is a walking distance to Paddington Station. Lucian, Ali, Pavel and others are so friendly and helpful during my stay here. Breakfast was good. In fact the food I ate at the bar was good too. The room is small to place my luggage or movement, but it is a typical thing for such hotels in London.
I will sure to come back again here!",4,2017,07,11
104,Wonderful Experience,"When we first walked into the Park Grand, we weren't that impressed. It looked very small and old. Once we got to the room though, we were very pleasantly surprised. The room was very large and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location only about two blocks to the nearest tube stop and many restaurants, souvenir shops, and stores. The ONLY negative was the location of our room in the hotel. We were in room 801 which was directly across from the ""bar"" area. Every time the door to the bar area opened, we heard the door and the people. Front desk staff is extremely helpful and ordered us a taxi the day we checked out that arrived early and only cost about 20 pounds from the hotel to St. Pancras. We would absolutely return to the Park Grand, we very much enjoyed our stay here!!
Each room comes with a small smartphone sort of thing that you can use to make international call, etc and can even take out of the hotel to use for navigation purposes. Despite two visits to the front desk for help, we were never able to get ours to work. It would have been nice to try it out but it's a very nice and unexpected amenity that the hotel provides!",5,2017,07,08
104,Lovely hotel very friendly and helpful staff. ,"Here celebrating our wedding anniversary.   Great hotel. Staff very helpful.

104,"Tiny bedroom, dirty and hot","We had a late arrival and found ourselves in the most minute bedroom with a very small double bed against the wall. The bathroom was tiny. The tv was hanging so that you could not see it from the bed. Not enough towels for two people, pillow cases missing. We asked to be moved which could only happen the next day. The new bedroom was slightly larger but still small. This fridge did not work either and the net curtains were missing. This room also felt dirty. The hotel does not live up to its website at all. We will definitely not be coming back. There was one helpful and sympathetic member of staff at reception- Adriana.",1,2017,07,03

104,Thank you Sakar ,Sadly we were booked into the wrong room and Unfortunately no alternative was available.

104,Great Hotel Would Stay Again,"We found this hotel after we arrived in London because our other hotel was terrible. Not only did they have AC, it was clean and spacious, the food was great and the staff went out of their way to help you. The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  If I had one complaint the water drained a little slow in the shower.  It is a short walk to Paddington tube station and the Heathrow Express.  Lots of places to eat close to the hotel and a quiet street.  I would definitely pick this place again!",5,2017,06,30

104,Stay at Park Grand London Hyde Park,"The room was very small. Design was not very good - for example, position of the air-conditioner was not conducive to sending cool air around the room.

104,Good relief from camden council evacuation ,"We got evicted from our home in camden last minute and was told to stay at this hotel . 
We were not sure what to expect and the location. 
When we got there we found ourselves in paddington in a beautiful area in westbourne terrace . Its very near from oxford street and to visit the main sights of London. 
Especially i have to say staff are so friendly and accommodating. 
The manager Sakar was listening to our heartfelt stories and when we told him didnt had anyfood since breakfast. He was heartbroken and offered us cheese sandwiches and hot cup of tea . He even requested his staff to put extra milk , tea, sugar and coffee in our room . 
Ms Darja made us a very tasty coffee and recommended us Bizzarro ( italian just down the road to paddinton ) . 
I never thought staying hotel could made me feel like a home ?????
Reception staff to the manager could out of their way to please us and cheer us in this depression time . 
So Sakar thank you so much for your kind advice and Miss darja thank you too for listening to us . 
Some days in future we will be back to enjoy ur hospitality. 
We will only recommend this to our friends and families.",5,2017,06,26

The rooms were very clean, quiet and  comfortable and the hotel is in a wonderful location.  The breakfast was fantastic. And we really appreciated the help printing boarding passes and calling for airport transport.  We would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2017,06,21
104,"A good location & hotel, but sound travels between rooms.","Very close to Paddington rail & tube, which makes it easy to get to/from the airport via the heathrow express, and to get around everywhere on the tube. Good shower water pressure, and the bed was comfortable but was 2 beds pushed together. Quiet, tree-lined street. Friendly staff. Good breakfast. We had a club room, so there's a lounge/TV/sink upstairs on a mezzanine level of the room. The bed and bathroom are downstairs. It was nice to have the extra space for the 5 days we stayed. On the downside...the stairs are very creaky, and you can hear the people in other rooms moving around and using their stairs too, so the sound proofing is not great. Our first night there was a large group of teenagers staying in the next room and they were extremely noisy and drunk, waking us up at 3am, shouting, and stomping up and down in their room, and then because they were all talking outside near the lift it was as loud as if they were in our room. We were concerned we'd checked into some sort of party hotel, but thankfully they checked out the next day. But... I see on another review that this hotel will happily rent a room to large groups, so you perhaps take your chances with this one because of the way sound travels. Or take earplugs. That aside, we enjoyed our stay here and would stay again.",5,2017,06,21
104,Extremely helpful staff,"My mother and I had a fantastic stay at the Park Grand. We came with her guide dog and the staff were extremely accommodating and helpful. They were so polite and we cannot thank them enough for their assistance! 
The hotel is very close to Hyde Park and to a tube station.
A fantastic feature in the hotel is the mobile phones that they offer free use of in the rooms. This allowed us to explore London and use maps without using up the 3G on my phone. It was also useful in terms of learning more about the attractions in London and facilities in the hotel.
I would like to thank all the staff very much for a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning in the future.",5,2017,06,21
104,Another Perfect Stay!,"My favourite hotel in London - I wouldn't stay anywhere else now!
We returned for my boyfriend's birthday, and had our stay made even more special upon check-in when we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Duplex Suite! It really did just make our day from the offset!
The suite was amazing! It was over 2 floors, and had wonderful views out across the beautiful, grand terraced street outside. The window was floor to ceiling. It was during a very hot spell that we visited London, and after a day trawling the tubes and getting rather uncomfortably warm, we had an amazing night's sleep in our air-conditioned room. The bed was really comfortable, too.
Location wise, the hotel is just perfect. A 10 minute walk from Hyde Park, a 5 minute walk from Paddington underground & overground... A beautiful part of the city without being right in the crazy hubbub of the center.
The thing that stands out the most about this hotel is the staff. They honestly can't do enough for you! They are all so friendly and helpful and professional - such genuine service is hard to come by!
Can't wait for our next stay in December!",5,2017,06,21
104,My favourite hotel,"Great location and great staff
Sakar has proved a great asset to the company and always looks after the guests
Great for parking especially when working around the corner
I've stayed here for several weeks and I've had different rooms each time - some of the rooms are spacious and some are a bit small and the spaces within the bathrooms are a bit small - other than that great place to stay
Could do with a firmer bed as well",5,2017,06,21
104,Thank you Sakar ,"Me and my friends decided to book this hotel for our weekend (10 of us).
we were greeted by a lovely staff team as well as the manager Sakar, him and his team took really good care of us all and made sure that we were all happy. The rooms were very nice and spacious. Thank you for a lovely weekend. ",5,2017,06,19

104,A Great place to stay in London ,"We have stayed at this hotel three times and we throughly enjoyed our stay . 
The rooms are nicely appointed and the beds are very comfortable. 
The A/C in our room worked perfectly. We had the room rate that included breakfast which was tasty and delicious. 
The staff here are always delightful, efficient and very friendly. 
A special thanks to Mr Sakar who managed this hotel perfectly. I have no criticism what so ever . He always went above and beyond to make sure we have the most pleasant stay .
Paddington station stone throw away .

104,Three nights at Park Grand in westbourne terrace ,"Having had to stay in London for three night on my business trip, I was eagerly looking for place to stay with comfortable room and reasonably good prices. 
I managed to find this hotel on  booking. Com. 
When I arrived I was greet with with welcoming smiles by Mr SAKAR AND was checked into a very clean and comfortable room. 
Initially I made booking with makemytrip they couldn't find it and I had to make new bookings  but later my balance was refunded. 
Must admit all staff are friendly and accommodating. Ms Arina recommended me Masala zone which was very tasty and price wise good too. 
All in all I loved the place and I will be back with my family soon. 
Thank you SAKAR and ARINA for your hospitality. ",5,2017,06,13
104,Our first family trip in London and at Park grand ,"Excellent hospitality. Wish to stay here again on next trip. Had an amazing experience with my family. The staff, rooms,food and ambience were all fabulous.
One member of staff Mr Sakar the manager of the hotel who went out of his way, taking me to the noor pharmacy to help purchase a plaster and lotion for blister on my foot .
I would also like to thank Me Arina for all her recommendation for my family .
Thanks guys ",5,2017,06,12
104,Interesting,"We arrived at the other Hotel Shaftesbury Premier which was just awful and the manager managed to move us here as part of their chain.. 

yes they gave us a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience.. but 
 
At the Park Grand London Hyde Park... we were dumped in a room next to reception and the bar. The beds were pull down beds from the wall so there were no head boards, the mattress on the double bed hung over the base, no lamps, no bed side cabinets, 3 spot lights above the bed and the dimmer did not work. I asked how to get the AC working and the controls are on the wall at the high of the AC unit near the ceiling.. I couldn't reach and was told to stand on a chair, which I was using for as a bed side cabinet...And the best feature was a large internal window separating the bathroom from the bed area, which they have attempted to cover with an old dirty blind. Who wants to see someone else on the loo from the bed?!

Eventually moved and went to another hotel which was beautiful which I should have done from the start.. lesson learnt never stay here again

Only positive was the staff were helpful. 

Really spoilt a weekend away with my children, as a special treat for us all which we had saved up for..",2,2017,06,12
104,Short Visit to London,"Last month I travelled to London for a short visit. Searching through all the portals i finally zeroed on this property. It was a perfect stay. Rooms are tidy and outside look through window is amazing. Staffs are really nice. Special mention to Sakar, who provided me perfect room for my requirement. I will advise to go for this property for sure.",5,2017,06,11
104,"Charming Hotel, Fantastic Location.","We stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park for 9 nights and were very pleased with our experience. The location cannot be beat, surrounded by gorgeous houses in a shaded residential street, a four or five minute walk to Paddington Station, and a 10 or 15 minute walk to Hyde Park. The staff was very helpful, especially Pavel and Lucian, who pointed out nearby restaurants and told us about the neighborhood. They also returned our cameras, which we had accidentally left in the lobby. The room was small, but not so small that you didn't have any room. The bathroom was nice, but I do have to say that the shower was quite small. They also provided a cell phone to use, but we didn't figure out how to use it exactly. Another nice feature of this hotel was the Free Wifi. One thing to know when you walk in your room is that when you first open the door, there will be no power. There is a little slot next to the door, and you have to stick your card in there to get power in your room. We didn't realize this and thought our hotel room had no power, and got somebody from the lobby to explain it to us! This hotel was a great find, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2017,06,10
104,Perfectly Peaceful Paddington Pitstop...,"Apologies for the alliteration but we were pretty happy with this lodging choice after so many recent sub-par London experiences. Yes, its 6-8 minutes away from Paddington station but its worth the walk into nice quiet surroundings of Westbourne Terrace. Great staff eager to please. Delicious and generous breakfast buffet in the morning. Very comfortable room. Not big and not small... although the bathroom is a bit snug. But hey, 170 pounds all in a pretty good value these days. Complimentary wi-fi. Would definitely stay here again when we need to get to Heathrow the next morning. Don't miss the opportunity to visit the Paddington Basin and Merchant Square nearby. Well worth the ten minute hike.",5,2017,06,10
104,1 night stay,"The staff was very friendly and helpful, even allowed us to print documents needed for travel. (Lucian was great,he helped with our bags and gave us a map and pointed out nearby sights). The room we had had a downstairs sitting area with a sofa and an upstairs bedroom. The bathroom was very small, but it did the job. The location of the hotel was great, short walk to restaurants and train station.",4,2017,06,07
104,Close to Paddington station,"Close to Paddington station, a medium hotel class with small rooms and tiny bathrooms. The best is Lucien, very very helpful, polite and friendly. He is The best of the hotel's staff. Breakfast is correct but very expensive (17). Very honest staff: they found my camera and gave it back to me",3,2017,06,05
104,1 week stay,"Recently stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park for 6 nights. Excellent location, only a short walk from Paddington (trains and underground) Station. The hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly. Arianna was very helpful in arranging transportation to catch the 1st Eurostar train over to Paris. The hotel room was clean, mattress comfortable, mini fridge, cell phone in room for your use, free wifi. For the price, it is excellent. Would definitely stay here again! ",4,2017,06,04
104,Beautiful location.,"Just a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park and Portebello Road and around the corner from Paddington Station. I like walking so found myself walking to Buckingham Palace, Oxford Street and even Harrods.
Single room is very small and could do with a renovation and make use of the space with less furniture. Although small it did feel cosy. Staff were lovely especially Arina, very helpful and kind. 
Great having a kettle with tea and coffee, I looked forward to my little packet of biscuits when returning to my room each day.  A mini fridge would have been great but no big deal (I booked knowing that there was none). Air con works wonderfully and shower water pressure great.  Lots of little toiletries, soap, shampoo, conditioner etc.The hotel provides you with a free mobile mobile phone that can be used in and outside of the hotel for making free calls (international also) and came in handy when I needed to use google maps outside of hotel. This is a huge bonus. I felt at home here. Thank you!",4,2017,06,02
104,Good value sometimes ,"Stay here regularly and if you can get the club or deluxe double room at a decent price its not bad, they are a good size.
Bathrooms are still small and the rooms could do with a refurb but they are ok.
Gets expensive as soon as its busy, like most hotels in London.",4,2017,05,31
104,Honeymoon trip in London ,"It's really a nice hotel and the staff is really helpful as well as Mr. Sakar the manager is very helpful and is good in his work. Excellent service by him, clean and a good hotel. Pleasent hotel.

104,Good hotel,"Location= perfect 

Hotel= Stunning 

Location-
First and foremost, the area that hotel located is fantastic . Good buzz and Great energy in the city . 10-20 mins hyde park, marble arch , edgware road . Lots of botique shopping in the city and so many great restaurants . 

We had a wonderful stay at this hotel . The room is bit on cozy side , but to be expected for london hotels . 
Staff were great , very friendly and helpful.
Special mention Sakar Who helped with so many things and fulfil my needs to Made my stay pleasureable . 
Thank park grand and memorable stay and great holiday .",5,2017,05,31
104,Fantastic Hotel and perfect location,"On Arrival we was greeted by the doorman who assisted us with our luggage. He was so pleasent and was nice to see after a long journey. The reception staff and manager could not of been more helpful. They checked us in. Gave us maps and told us all the tourist attractions and how to get to them easily. There service was first class. Our room was beautiful, well decorated with all the modern amenities you would expect. The entire hotel was spotless and well maintained. The continued service throughout our stay was just amazing. The location is perfect for tourist like we was, Everything was so close.",5,2017,05,30
104,My favourite hotel in London ,"I have been staying here for many  years and must say it's always been a good experience.
First of all it is based centrally in Paddington which is a pretty good base to move around London there are many shops and restaurants nearby.
Rooms are good and clean not big as I expected. 
All staff are very helpful and Sakar the manager is the best.
",5,2017,05,30
104,Good location but probably not for Long stay,"Pros:
- very convenient. 10 mins walk to paddington station which is connected to many attractions
- some nice touch like biscuits and microwave in the room 

Cons:
- cleanliness is a big concern. Pillow stinks which is a big no-no for me.
- I have not stayed in other London hotels so I am not very sure what would have been the benchmark but the room is very small. Toilet is very compact
",3,2017,05,27
104,One night in park grand,"Every thing was perfect in this hotel . 
I loved the location which is good part of it . Nearest train station Paddington and we like Arabic food . Edgware rood is 15 mins walk . Room was very small for I expected but ok for one night . 
All staff in frond desk very friendly and every one smiles and "" say hello ""
When we passed . They also helped us with all our requests. 
We booked our MADAME TUSSAUDS TOUR in the morning in hotel . That was a very good too . 
I come back may be in two months",5,2017,05,25
104,Convenient to Paddington Station,We stayed here for 2 nights recently.  It was convenient that we were able to take the train from the airport and then walk a few blocks to the hotel without having to try the Tube with our suitcases on a weekend.  After we dropped off our suitcases we were able to go back to Paddington and take the tube.  We even walked back from Harrod's on Sunday afternoon because the weather was perfect.  The breakfast was wonderful with lots of choices in the morning.  We would stay there again.,4,2017,05,24
104,Excellent hotel,"Enjoyed 6 very good nights in this well placed city hotel . 
A great area as very close to padington station and good connect to heathrow. 
The staff are at the hotel are exceptional and always greet their guest with a welcome and big smile.¬† 
Special mention to Ms Adriana who was on a front desk had such a warm smiles that made us so relaxed , Ms Arina too been very helpful with advice and was such a pleasure to talk to .
Overall the Manager Sakar was extremely cool and very helpful helping us with finding a good room for us . 
We had a breakfast at the hotel which was included and all staff were very hospitable .
Mr Anthony was a star in restaurant with assisting our needs . 
The rooms are good & i request firm pillow and almost immediately received them in our room .
I would definitely stay here in this fine hotel every time i return to london and thanks to Adriana,¬† Arina , Sakar , Anthony and all staff for fantastic stay . ",5,2017,05,22
104,Love this place!!,"Found this place by accident, and so glad we did!! Wonderful place! As beautiful as the pictures online, and very friendly, helpful, and close to Paddinton Station. Entire neighborhood is walkable with great restaurants and site seeing attractions. I would Highly recommend this place and if I ever went back to London, would definitely stay here again and again!!",5,2017,05,21
104,Amazing staff and accommodations ,"Booked 2 rooms for a cheap price compared to others. Great breakfast buffet. Location right next to Heathrow Express station. Beds are comfortable. Best help was especially Sakar. Had to change room once and he did it with no questions. 
Defo park grand be back next year . ",5,2017,05,20
104,My stay in Park Grand Hyde Park,"In my many visits to UK, the Park Grand Hyde Park gore tops up the list when it comes to friendliness and coziness of the service, in my opinion, bricks and mortar doesn't make a hotel an elite in its market, it's the quality and friendliness of service that makes the hotel a real hospitable property.  The staff at the front office are so friendly and specially Sakar, the hotel manager, he is so well trained and he is so friendly to the point that you feel you knew him since a very long time like a best friend , this is how a hotel service should be, I'd certainly recommend this hotel for any purpose of your visit, approach Sakar for any reservations or any issues during your stay, he's the man for it. ",5,2017,05,19
104,Fair but definitely not a 4 stars hotel,"The hotel we first booked was park grand paddington but upon our arrival, they told us that they would transfer us to the hyde park one. And after a 5 hours flight, we had to go to the new hotel on feet. That was not a serious inconvenience. The staff are friendly. The rooms are fair but they are not noise proof. You can hear whatever your neighbors are saying. Plus, unfortunately our room on the first floor had no view (although we had asked for one with a view) and every morning we used to smell the food being cooked and that was reallyy annoying!
As for the location it is fair, 7minutes walk to the hydepark from the Kensington side and 3 minutes walk to nearby shops. It is not so close to the oxford and piccadilly circus streets, as it will take you 15-20 minutes by car. I wouldn't rate it as a 4 stars hotel. A mere 3 is enough. And by the way, you do not get complimentary water except on the first day, where you get 2 small bottles.",3,2017,05,17
104,Our home in London ,"I came here with my boyfriend for three nights. 
We booked from last minute secret deals and wasn't sure what to expect. Was a complete gamble and was my birthday too . 
When we arrived we were give room 130 . Wasn't happy about it having two beds and spoke to the receptionist Adriana . She showed us room showed us duplex room . It was very spacious, good size and very comfortable bed and nice size bathroom . 
Manager Sakar went out of his way to make our stay stress free and got to say birthday stay was very good . 
Very close to Paddington, lots of shops , helpful staff , what more can I ask for !!!'
Yes I recommend this place . ",5,2017,05,14
104,Very good two day stay at Park Grand,"Very nice hotel at a very reasonable price, friendly staff who couldn't have been more polite and helpful, the room we had was very large, clean, stylishly decorated and on two levels with the bathroom and small living space with kitchenette downstairs and very large bedroom upstairs.

Quite close to transport links with some shops, supermarket, cinema and restaurants close by.

I would definitely stay here again without hesitation",4,2017,05,14
104,Very small room in basement,"Hotel was OK, location quite close to Paddington Train Station, however the room was absolutely tiny, so much so that there was barely room to iron a shirt. Breakfast good. hot and cold options available",3,2017,05,14
104,Familiy stay,"Park Grand London Hyde Park made us heartly welcome, Mr Sakar and his staff is very service minded. Convenient situated near Paddington station and Hyde Park, a beautiful London area. We had a familiy 
room which was a little to small but filled our need to a good price. The room was clean and pleasurable, and the english breakfast was delicate and very good. The stay was a nice experience and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others. ",4,2017,05,14
104,Great stay at park grand ,"Amazing stay. Very clean room. Staff couldn't be more helpful! Sakar made us feel very welcome and made the stay as pleasurable as possible.
We had breakfast, the selection and was very fresh and selection. 
Hotel is near Paddington which is handy .

104,Our Motown the musical trip in london ,"This hotel is a little gem. Clean warm the staff are friendly and the hospitality is second to none. 
The room is spacious, actually to find a hotel of this standard at this price in london is unbeatable.... 

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London either for business or pleasure. 

The manager Mr Sakar will go out of his way to make sure your stay a memorable one. ",5,2017,05,06
104,My home in London ,"We two brothers roaming around Europe for two weeks and when we reached London , we booked this hotel last minute makemytrip.com ....
We read few reviews which wasn't too great but when we reached this hotel , we were greeted by manager Sakar . 
He went extra to accommodate us ,helped us with our needs and recommended us various attractions in London . 
Each and every member of staff we came across were very helpful and hospitable . 
For sure bed and very comfy and we slept ok . 
We will surely be back to this hotel on future and highly recommend to everyone. ",5,2017,05,06
104,Feed back on our stay in Park Grand London Hyde Park,We were glad to stay here. As we get an extra ordinary hospitality from the staff specially from Mr. Sakar. Who is been always very helpful / polite & professional to guide us in terms of our visit to the city. I would recommend to all of you to visit this hotel at least  once and encourage them to continue provide such hospitality.,5,2017,05,02
104,"Good location, helpful staff. A little expensive and loud for what it is.","Stayed at the property for a week over April/May 2017. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance from transport and local attractions, not far from Hyde park.

My room was on the 3rd floor. It was OK - small but decent. However, it was incredibly loud. I could hear the guests in the room above and next door and virtually participate in their conversation. Unable to sleep, asked the staff for a change. Was moved to the 'basement' level to a larger room. Much better, but still noisy in the morning.

The staff were very friendly and very accommodating - definitely the highlight of the property.

Due to the dates of my stay - covering a bank holiday - prices were a little inflated. Would only recommend if no other alternatives.",3,2017,05,02
104,"Small but Comfortable Room, Easy Tube Access","I had a ground floor room, which was a bit on the small side but perfectly adequate for just me. The bed was comfortable, and I liked the fact that I could open the window for some fresh air. The only downside for me was that bathroom was tiny, and I'm a large person, so showering and using the toilet was a bit of a squeeze.

The room included a smart phone that you could use and take with you, which is a nice touch, but I can't comment on its performance as I used my own phone on my trip. Wifi in my room was great with a strong signal and decent speed.

The biggest draw for me for this hotel was its proximity to Paddington station. It was a quick, 5-minute walk to the station where there is an express train to Heathrow airport as well as access to the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines of the Underground, which made it very easy to get around London.

I would stay here again the next time I'm in London.",4,2017,05,01
104,my business visit in london,"I am visiting london from Oman for my business trip and also having my 
my family studying in University of cardiff . 
I found this beautiful hotel from booking.com and i really liked 
the pictures of rooms , location and price . 
i stayed here for 10 nights . when i arrived i was checked in very swiftly. 
room was spacious and good size for one person . and again as mention 
above location is the hotspot being near paddington station . 
all staff are very hospitable and friendly . 
marble arch and oxford street is 20-30 mins walk or 10 by tube and 20 mins by bus 
from paddington station . 
Breakfast i had was very fresh and tasty . 
with no doubt i will stdy here again and highly recommend this place .",5,2017,04,30
104,Don't go above 5th floor,"First and foremost,  don't accept any room above the fifth floor.  The lift doesn't go any higher than 5 and you have to walk up extremely narrow steps to do so. Very difficult with luggage.  When I got to my original 7th floor room, there was no chair at the desk because there was barely room to fit a leg between the desk and the bed.

All that said, Ylenia and Lucian were great and it really is convenient to Paddington. ",3,2017,04,29
104,Small but comfortable ,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel in the second week of April. The room was pretty small, but there were two beds - which is better than one big bed in my opinion. The bathroom was tiny, but it wasn't a problem for us either. There wi-fi is great (probably the best ""hotel wi-fi"" I ever used) and they offer you a free mobile phone with internet that you can take with you during your days to use maps and things like that.  The location is pretty great, five minutes from paddington station and there are a few Italian restaurants and coffee shops in the way. I had a little problem with the staff because of a mail that arrived for me, and because of their lack of communication they couldn't find my envelope and I had to explain again and again to all the staff there, because apparently they don't talk to each other. But in the end it was solved because I found out who signed my mail (that I've said to the people in the reception that it would be arriving on that day). 
Overall it was a good stay, and I would come back. 
  ",3,2017,04,26
104,Very Small room and uncomfortable stay,"I stayed at this hotel on a business trip, which was paid by my office (mentioning as this is why I had no option to change during my 15 days stay).

The pros and cons are mentioned below:-

Pros:-
1. Hotel provides you a cell with unlimited calls to India/UK/US - however this facility is available with most of the hotels these days.
2. Nice breakfast - less items, but fresh and healthy
3. Close to Hyde park, so you can have a nice time for evening walks after office.

Cons:-

1. SMALLEST single room of Universe - can't find so small room anywhere to live in.
2. No balcony, fresh air or natural light in the room. Is a headache once you live more than 2 days and I spent 15 days with my office work included.
3. Front office staff are with non-caring behavior, where as the supporting staff, room service staff, restaurant staff are very polite and welcoming - seems the receptionists are just for a fake smile rather than with any help.
4. money minded rather than providing information - will insist to book a cab rather than suggesting routes by bus/trains.
5. The rooms are just very inside approachable - this means one need to go in cave to find his/her's room - very unpleasant for guests.
6. I stayed in single room, which just don't have any space to have a 2nd chair to sit for, also the double rooms are very small - never suggest anyone to opt this hotel.",1,2017,04,26
104,Birthday celebrations in London. ,Stayed 2 nights. Very obliging excellent staff. We were redirected to this hotel as the sister hotel had problems. Our first room was a little small. We asked to be moved and we were given a choice of rooms with free upgrade. The Manager sakar was excellent. Good food for breakfast. Pity they didn't do evening meals. Clean rooms. Recommended as location is near to Paddington station. ,5,2017,04,26
104,Cozy,"Nice hotel in the Paddington section of London.  Very close to Hyde Park and some major shopping outlets.  Rooms were small, but well kept and clean.  Great place for couples.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on a return to London.",4,2017,04,19
104,Good hotel ,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and I enjoyed this hotel .

Breakfast is small , same breakfast but i wish if there is changes in variety. 
Reception staff is very helpful and smiling at all times especially the manger Sakar and Arina. 
Hotel is located in central and easy access to anywhere you wish to travel in london . 
I recommend this place and will surely be back someday ",5,2017,04,19
104,amazing service and location,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night, due to the cancelation of my flight. I managed to find this hotel through google. It was near to the paddington station, very convenient to the heathrow airport by heathrow express train.
It was a great stay and very convenient travelling to the city . All the staff here are very supportive and comfortable to communicate . The room was vey nice and comfortable, the bathroom was modern and chic . The manager of this hotel , Mr Sakar was very friendly and helpful for booking my flight ticket with qatar airways . it was a great relief and he managed to upgraded my flight too.
I wold love to visit here ones again with my whole family when m back in london again .",5,2017,04,17
104,Vacation in London ,"My daughter and I were visiting London and staying with a friend outside of London.  Our friend had a family emergency so we had to relocate quickly.  We moved to the Park Grand London Hyde Park and could not have been happier.  This is a beautiful boutique hotel in a fabulous location a few blocks from Hyde Park.  Our room was lovely and very clean with a great view of the pretty tree lined street.  The staff starting with the manager Sakar, the receptionist Adriana and bellmen Lucian and Pavel were so helpful and friendly.  They went above and beyond to make our stay great.  I plan to stay here anytime I'm in London and highly recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful place to stay.",5,2017,04,17
104,Not what I expected.,"First of all I made my reservation for The Shaftesbury Premier and when we arrived they moved us to the Park Grand because they were full.  OK no big deal we moved across the street. Check in went smoothly staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  I booked 2 triple rooms and they were decent size.  Mini fridge and coffee/tea maker along with cookies are provided.  Location is great walking distance to Paddington station, big bus tour stop, shops and a variety of restaurants.  The only issue I had was the thin walls and ants in our room.  I could hear every room conversation from the hallway as well your neighbors in the room.  We also encountered an ant problem...came back from our tours and ants were coming in from the window.  When I called the front desk to let them know their response was there wasn't anything they could do until the next day.  That was unacceptable and after many conversations they changed the bed sheets and vacuumed our room.  In my opinion it could have been handled better.
Breakfast had a good variety from scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, potatoes,  bacon, sausage, croissants, rolls, cereal, yogurt, and a variety of cheeses and fruits.  I must say it was a delicious spread.  Also the breakfast area was comfortable accommodating about 50 people. 
 Wifi connection was great!",3,2017,04,17
104,Very welcome Manager,"I stayed in room 405.
Very pleasant room , comfortable bed . Brilliant food in breakfast. 
All staff are courteous and services is topped in every aspect. 
Hotel is very convenient being near to Hyde park and PADDINGTON station . 
I would like to mention manager Sakar , Darja , Adriana , Arina ,Lucian and ANTHONY at restaurants for their wonderful service which made my stay pleasant . 
Surely be back to stay in room 405 on my next trip to London . ",5,2017,04,16
104,Unbelievable ,"One of the best service I have ever received from manager sakar & lucian.  Wonderful hotel and staff are going over and beyond especially the 2 names mentioned above.

Rooms are lovely and breakfast is great.  

Hotel location is ideal and centra to everything.

",5,2017,04,16
104,"Miss Adriana , Mr Lucian and manager Mr Sakar rules Park Grand ","I have a clinic in Harley street london , and my staff and I regularly stay here and it's only 10mins by black cab or if we take Bakerloo  line from Paddington few stops away .
There were few mix up etc in my past reservations ADVANCE PURCHASE.....
However , Adriana , Lucian and Sakar is the hotel saving grace . Nothing too much trouble , they have a can do attitude........ and it's largely because of them , that we stay so regularly. 
This may sound harsh , but many London hotels falls largely with respect to the quality and attentiveness of all the staff . 
At park grand , staff in particular are the big assets and they make sure things work smoothly during stay .
As a result, I push my company to accommodate us all there , when we stay in London .
Thanks guys ",5,2017,04,12
104,I should have stayed rough at the nearby train station,"Small room, noisy, cold, single glazed. Did I remember to say small rooms?  Well, when I say small, as a peripatetic IT Consultant, this it the smallest room I have ever had the misfortunate to stay in, and yes, that includes the Munich Ibis...

Captive audience got me here, as it was the nearest available hotel to where I have a client.  Now I know why.",1,2017,04,11
104,Awful place,The window in the room did not shut there was no catch or anything.  Part of the wall was damp and there was a strange curry like smell.  It was dirty.  We were next to the service elevator and the general elevator and had to listen to the clanking of the machinery till the early morning.  The bathroom door had sealent hanging off the tiles on the floor where chipped.  When we complained we were told it was a nice room and there was nothing they could do.  We had been overbooked in the hotel we had chosesn so they moved us to this hotel.  The staff on the reception were not happy about this and complained between themselves about sending the other hotel the bill.  Credit where credit is due the breakfast was really good and there was fruit waiting for us in the room.,1,2017,04,11
104,Family holiday,"I was with my family on holiday I stayed for 6 nights 
Great people awesome staff specially the manger Sakar
So I really recommend staying at this hotel if your going to London 
Great prices and great services",5,2017,04,07
104,What a lovely hotel!,"We needed a London hotel over a Sunday and Monday night and came across this one for a very reasonable price.  We have paid more per night for other hotels in the Paddington area that aren't nearly as nice.

Just a short walk from Paddington station, the Park Grand is very well located.  We were greeted very warmly and every staff member we encountered, even if we met them by chance in the lift, was cheerful and friendly.

There was some welcome fruit and water on arrival, and a well stocked tea tray which included biscuits.  There's a small bar where we enjoyed a nightcap one evening.  Toiletries and towels were plentiful in the bathroom, the water pressure and temperature in the shower was great, there were plenty of pillows on the bed and plenty of space in the room.  A request for a shower cap from reception was met very promptly.

Breakfast was included in our Deluxe Double (Advance Purchase) room rate and this was plentiful and regularly replenished.  As well as fruits, yoghurts, breads, pastries, cereals, fruit, cheeses and cold meats there was a selection of hot foods which was different on both mornings we were there.  Tables were cleared quickly, and hygiene standards are high.

All in all we enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.",5,2017,04,05
104,Superb Location,"We were received by Sakar. He was extremely helpful! We arrived at the property after some hiccups over at the Paddington Court property and transferred over. We were tired and needed to rest desperately. As it was before check in time, Sakar went an extra mile to find an available room for us to freshen up. 

We will stay here again! Thanks to Sakar and Lucian for making our trip memorable.

",5,2017,04,04
104,business trip in London,"This is the third time I stay in this hotel. The staff is very courteous and welcoming. The managers, front desk and all the staff is welcoming. Manager Sakar , Lucian,
 Anthony , Adriana are all very hospitable. 
Will come again whenever I get a chance.",5,2017,04,02
104,Nice Paddington Hotel,"Nice hotel located 5 mins from Paddington station.

Rooms were small but beds comfy. Bathrooms were tiny which was very disappointing.

Breakfast was average, nothing special.  It was included in our room rate, I wouldn't have paid extra for it.

Staff are very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,04,01
104,"Great hotel, great staff","I have stayed here a fair few times now, always pick this hotel if I am in the area. Staff always friendly, always have a need CEO chat with Sakar, Lucian and the ladies on reception.

Rooms always clean and good quality. Good location close to Praed street where there are plenty of good restaurants. 5 more nite walk from Paddington train and underground stations.",5,2017,03,29
104,"Great location, fantastic staff","I visit London every couple of weeks and normally stay overnight. I have tried a few hotels, but now only really use this one because its such a great location; next to Paddington (I live in Somerset) and close to Hyde Par for a morning run. Its hard to find any faults.
All staff are very friendly, particularly Sakar. On my last trip, a couple of weeks ago my wife (only her second time up) actually mentioned how welcoming Sakar and the staff are. 
The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the breakfast unlimited. The price is also very reasonable. Highly recommended.",5,2017,03,28
104,Klaus,"An amazingly expert, courteous and friendly welcome by very friendly staff and team members. Wonderful themed bar, very comfortable rooms, perfect bedding. All technical appliances working perfectly fine. Room service as well as if made in hospitality heaven. Rarely do I give 10 out of 10 - at Grande Royale I happily do.",5,2017,03,28
104,London Business Visit,"Every time I visit London for my business work, choose this hotel as by default option. The staff are very friendly and helpful at all time. Rooms are neat and clean. It is very close the the Paddington station (Underground and rail) and have plenty of eating options around.",5,2017,03,27

104,Amazing stay! Highly recommended ,"This review is on behalf of my parents that stayed here in early March. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful (big shout out to Ylenia and Lucian), location was perfect and easy to access transportation, breakfast yummy and the amenities such as free international calling to landlines were very appreciated. Can't say enough about how pleased my parents were with this place! Don't hesitate to book as it's a lovely hotel run by people who really go out of their way to look after you!",5,2017,03,25
104,Good hotel close to Paddington Station,"Had booked two nights in the Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park.  Hotel phoned me on the morning of my departure to London that there was a problem and that I would need to check into the hotel and then I would be taken by taxi to a sister hotel.  On arrival, all seemed fine at the Shaftesbury Metropolis, so no idea what had gone wrong - was told it was something to do with the boiler, but there were people staying there.  Had read on Trip Advisor that other people had had the same thing happen to them.  Had they overbooked?  As I had booked well in advance, then I would not expect to be moved last minute.  Anyway, the Park Grand was fine - and I was told that breakfast would be complimentary due to the inconvenience.  All hotel staff were pleasant and helpful.  The room was a single and small, but it was clean and warm. Bathroom was fine with good shower, towels and toiletries.  As I don't spend time in any hotel bedroom during a stay, it was ideal.  Breakfast was very good, with choice of continental and English, so one could help oneself to whatever you fancied.  The proximity to Paddington Station was really good taking several minutes.  I would consider this hotel if and when I visit London again, but probably try and book direct with them.",3,2017,03,23
104,Lovely room!,"I booked a last minute Club room and it was beautiful and clean. Downstairs we had a bathroom which was compact but still had everything you needed and a living area which contained a TV, sofa and a small kitchen. Upstairs we had a bedroom which contained another TV a very big king Size bed, a desk, wardrobe and chairs. Although there was a road outside the hotel it was quiet. The turndown service left chocolates and a card which was a nice touch. The breakfast was just ok with the quality of the  food letting it down. The room in which breakfast was served was also very small with staff often standing in the way. Regardless I would definitely return to this hotel. The hotel is also in a great location. ",4,2017,03,22
104,"Great hotel, great location, excellent staff","Excellent service from the moment we arrived for a 1 night stay.  Good sized double room with en suite, a mezzanine with small kitchen tea/coffee making facilities, microwave, settee and a second TV!  Location short walk from Hyde Park, Paddington Station and surrounding restaurants and facilities.  Best of all were the staff - all were extremely friendly and could not do enough to make our stay comfortable.  We will be returning to see Sakar and all of his excellent team.",5,2017,03,21
104,Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from our second visit to this hotel. All the staff are really friendly , helpful and always have a smile. Nothing is too much trouble for any of them. They made our stay very special. The restaurant is lovely and light and very clean with a delightful choice at breakfast time. We can highly recommend this hotel . And will be returning again mid summer.

104,Very Helpful Manager and very nice hotel in Paddington ,"This is my fourth time visit in Park Grand Hyde park . 
Everytime we have been greeted by Sakar . 
Very helpful staff and wonderful location. 
Everytime quickly checked in spacious room . 
Good breakfast in the morning , very hospitable staff again in restaurant. 
The more especially is all those staff who are always there to help with anything and warm smiles in their faces . 
I am already planning to come back with all my family in few months times . 
Thanks park grand ",5,2017,03,19
104,Loved this hotel and the WONDERFUL STAFF!,"This is a late review: I went to London spontaneously last January and stayed at the Park Grand-Hyde Park (very close to Paddington Station). Loved the convenient location, the hotel, and the staff! Lucian, the bellman truly impressed me. He greeted me with a smile the moment I rolled my luggage towards the entrance and immediately insisted that I hand over my luggage even though I kept telling him he didn't have to. Every time I saw him, he was always in a good mood and so were the rest of the staff at the front desk. 

The rooms were clean and anytime I wanted anything like ice or anything else, the staff were happy to help and very prompt. I also love the street that this hotel is in. ",5,2017,03,17
104,Not that impressed,"The staff were very polite, very convenient to Paddington Station 5 minute walk, breakfast was good but the room was in need of attention it was cramped so was bathroom and  the stopper did not work on the bath, when the shower was used it soaked the bathroom floor because the screen was too small. We stayed in a sister hotel just around the corner was much better.",3,2017,03,16
104,Great hotel for a night,"This is a perfect business hotel for 1-2 nights. The location is good. For a long walk and your near the city. Caps can easy come in front of the door.  The staff is nice and there is not really a place for breakfast but near by there ar tons of shops were you can eat something. The rooms are clean and there is no noice. The shower is a bit small but for London it's perfect. 

So i've your looking for a nice hotel this is the one.",3,2017,03,13
104,Please be more organised,"Nice little hotel in a quiet location. I really don't like being asked to pay on arrival when I have already pre paid and then the same thing for breakfast the next morning. You really need to sort this out as I and most probably others find this insulting. Apart from the bed being very small then the hotel was fine. Very good breakfast, clean, warm, nice showers. Would probably consider returning in the future!",4,2017,03,13
104,Thank so much Mr Sakar,"Stayed for one night , the manager Mr Sakar , he knew so much about where I'm from (Ghana ) . He went had previously visited Kumasi , spoke about the local dishes and had a good laugh . Also guided me to a lavish double bedroom with all the available amenities . 
Hotel is centrally located in paddington good to explore in London . 
In many years to come I will be visiting this hotel and big fat thanks to Sakar for his welcoming hospitality.",5,2017,03,11
104,Convenient to Paddington Station and a pleasant stroll to Picadilly,"It's always hard to find a decent hotel in London at the miserable allowances made by my company.  This one is, however, just lovely and within the budget!  A very friendly and helpful staff, a good English Breakfast and a newly decorated and well-maintained room.  Will definitely stay again- it is 5 minutes walk from Paddington at the end of the Heathrow Express.  Plenty of restaurants arond on Craven Road.",4,2017,03,10
104,Great value. Friendly staff,"This place is around 5-minute easy walk from the Paddington station. Quite a few nice restaurants nearby.

The door men here are very welcoming and friendly. More welcoming than most of the hotels I experienced in US.

The continental breakfast is also great. ",4,2017,03,10
104,What a gem!,A great hotel in a great location not more tgan 5 minutes from Paddington Station. Had a Duplex room which was great value. A lovely comfortable large bed and excellent facilities. Staff were very friendly and the breakfast was perfect and plentiful. Will be staying here again. ,5,2017,03,03
104,Very nice room in a great location!,"Ylania, who checked me in was very nice. I got a club room which is really spacious. It's like a mini flat with a good size fridge, sink and microwave, with a little living room. Upstairs was the bed, which was really comfortable. The only thing that wasn't as good was the small bathroom. I had asked for a room with a bathtub but I guess they didn't have one. I personally think they could had made the bathroom bigger and used some of the living room space to do so. Also it was a bit cold, which I can the temp set to 30, so that might just me. Overall a very nice hotel!",4,2017,03,02
104,Big fat thanks to wonderful manager Sakar,"Was on a business travel. Nice place n nice room I got.Sakar was very helpful and sorted every requirement with ease. Always had a smile on his face. Great stay.
Very handy to roam around london and Heathrow . 
I will be back soon with my family .",5,2017,03,01
104,Thanks to Mr.Sakar and one of the most helpful staffs,"This is my 4th stay at Park Grand and everytime the staff make the stay so homely and comfortable. 
Special mention and thanks goes to Sakar who with always smiling face and informal attitude makes it an awesome stay. Everytime.
Thanks guys. And see you soon üòä
Keep delighting. ",5,2017,02,28
104,Excellent choice,"Must admit that the good reviews for this boutique hotel are spot on. 2 min walk from Paddington tube station. Lots of nice diverse eats in area. Good location for central London generally. The hotel itself is very nice, the rooms are clean and tidy with good size bathroom and lots of extras that you might expect from a far more expensive hotel. Breakfast is excellent with a good choice of cooked food. However the best thing about this little hotel is the staff who are just brilliant and cannot do enough to help, even to making complimentary coffee whilst waiting for a friend to arrive in the foyer. This is an easy recommendation to make and one that is guaranteed not to disappoint.",5,2017,02,27
104,Best Gem in Central London ,"I frequently visit this hotel for business trip and is the only place in London which makes me feel at home . 
Outstanding service , good size rooms , excellent facilities , wonderful curry in the evening . Every aspect of this hotel is classy and the attention to detail combined with cozy feelings it offers makes it my favourite place in London to stay . 
Mr Sakar and all of his co-workers at the front desk start the journey and the personal service never leaves until you walk out the door . 
Paddington station is stone-throw away which is good base to catch various underground lines and Heathrow express makes so much better to get to the Airport . 
I would highly recommend this exceptional hotel to all visitors . ",5,2017,02,26
104,Brillant,"Wonderful stay with extremely friendly staff a special mention to alrich and lucian who were so helpful. 
Excellent location however breakfast is a bit hit and miss!!
We will be back again for our next adventure.!",5,2017,02,26
104,Mr Sakar Thank you very much ,"I called this hotel my private residence in London . So far probably we been here around 30 times. Staff do so much for us that I will not be able explain.
This hotel is as the pictures show on their website,  modern , clean and chic .
The manager of the hotel Mr Sakar couldn't do enough to make sure we always have a pleasant stay as well as the whole team .
Great location close to paddington station. 
Rooms are very spacious but some bathrooms are small though. 
Overall however an excellent experience and we will always be back .
",5,2017,02,25
104,Pleasure to be @ Park Grand,"Talking about the hotel, the hotel facilitates with a high standard accommodation, includes good breakfast and speedy services. Also the location is in a perfect area where two Underground stations are nearby and many local shops and restaurant around. It's quiet and clean. I would recommend this hotel to all, Beside I would like to thank all of the helpful staffs of the Park Grand who made my stay 'A Wonderful Stay' . Particularly, Arina for helping us out by navigating the local areas, booking taxies and recommending the restaurant around. I will definitely be back to stay here once again.",5,2017,02,20
104,"Staff lovely, room disapointing",The staff in the hotel were lovely. Very friendly. The room was disappointing.  The white sheets on the bed had unpleasant looking stains on them which was really off putting getting into bed! I would throw them away if they were mine.The room is dated and tired looking and looked grubby.The tea making facilities tray needs a jolly good wash.  The location of the hotel is great.,2,2017,02,20
104,A Big thanks to the best Manager I ever came across ,"Amazing hotel , 2nd visit to hotel , great location, when I mentioned i came last year Sakar and darja at reception helped massively accommodate us for parking and room as we booked last minute and no over local hotel could accommodate parking ! Sakar helped me book a taxi and amazing restaurant to go to ( Gaucho tower bridge ) This has made a hotel experience wanting to come back and will defiantly be using this hotel ever time I come to visit London , even more so now I know what sort of service they gave ! Lovely room and a beautiful breakfast to finish of our stay ! 
Lastly hotel porter Pavel was very helpful to carry my girlfriend's bags to our room . 
Thanks all of you for wonderful stay .",5,2017,02,19
104,New home in london,"I was very angry and disappointed I had to be transferred from the Shaftesbury hotel I had a bad day and to hear this news was very disappointing. I came to the park grand hotel and the service was amazing I met the manager Sakar and he was very polite very professional and very welcoming. Sakar calmed me down he was very calm and offered me some water . Sakar showed me a beautiful romantic suite which absolutely took the words out of my mouth it was beautiful. My idea home for many years to come, I felt like am living a million pound lifestyle. The faculties are brilliant warm comfortable double bed for me and my partner she's in love with it.  The shower facilities are clean and very modern never been to a hotel like this. From now on I'll be coming here where I am treated like a king and I love it.",5,2017,02,17
104,Mr Sakar thank you for your hospitality,"I have been a regular and valuable client of this hotel for over the years .
As far as I remember I have been assisted by the whole team in a very friendly  and polite behavior . I have been very  satisfied with their service. 
I always book directly for periods between one to two weeks    Including  breakfast .
Rooms are quite narrow, but ok  as long as personnel is fine , I feel like being at home within a family, all the personnel at reception, Lucian the bar tender, breakfast waiters 
Hotel is blessed with great team members and also location as well .
However , I did had few issues on my last reservations but Mr Sakar helped me out and solved all the problems .
I would definitely come back to this hotel in future purely based on the guest satisfaction from all the staff Mr Sakar ,Mr Gurdeep , Ms Arina , and all other girls at reception, without forgetting house keepers and Mr Pavel and Mr Anthony for great hospitality . 

Kind regards

104,One night in park grand ,"I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel amazing staff , they really go out of their way to make sure we had a great time especially mention manager Mr Sakar & Lucian & Darja they were amazing. Location is great very close to Marble Arch and Hyde park . The bedroom was spacious and beds were very comfortable. As soon as I entered I felt very welcomed . This was an amazing Valentine's Day present from my partner I defo a recommend and I will be returning 

Thank you Mr Sakar ",5,2017,02,14
104,Valentines getaway,"We booked a room at this hotel that was very closed to many shops. Paddington station is very close wich is good as we could get to the destination very quick and easily. The staff are amazing and have excellent customer service. The manager is a blessing to the hotel Mr sakar, Lucian the Porter  and darja at the reception is so helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great stay and I will definetly be back in the coming weeks for an enjoyable stay. ",5,2017,02,14
104,"Very nice, convenient too","I was very happy with the Park Grand Hotel Hyde Park. With on site parking available and a 5 min walk to paddington station, it's very conveniently placed. But it is also a comfy, smart and friendly hotel. The room was big enough and a comfy bed with a good tv. The bathroom had heated flooring and the shower was nice and big. The room had plenty of tea bags with biscuits available to us. 
When we entered the room it was freezing as the window was open and radiator wasn't functioning. However, a short call to reception and a very helpful gentleman fixed everything in a jiffy with a smile. 
For the price paid and the convenience, I would highly recommend this hotel if you're visiting london. I will certainly be returning.",4,2017,02,12
104,Perfect for a business trip. Maybe not only !,"It is a small hotel not faraway from Paddington Station but out from the ""Jam"".

My room was large and clean, as well the bathroom. Free Wifi.

The breakfast was even good.

Considering you are in central London, and with my company fare i paid only a bit more of 80¬£ breakfast included, i can only say ....

Very Good !",5,2017,02,08
104,Great value and location,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Lovely breakfast, though dining room a little small and cramped if hotel full. Some rooms a little small and a little hit and miss if you get a room with a working fridge. However, great value and location.",4,2017,02,04
104,Poor,We got moved to hyde park where one of the two rooms was smaller cramped and dated. We received free breakfast and complimentary wine and i still wasnt happy.  No seats for breakfast was unacceptable. This is the first bad review i have left for anywhere. The staff were very helpful though,3,2017,02,04
104,Somewhat disappointing,"The hotel is located very conveniently, around the corner of Paddington underground and train station. Lots of restaurants in walking distance as well. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms however are small and have seen better days. There were stains on the walls, furniture was chipped and the handy little smartphone did not work. The bathroom was tiny, and I'm not exactly a big person. I had a double room, but the bed, albeit comfortable, was rather small as well. All in all, I was disappointed as I had expected much more for the price I paid.",3,2017,02,02
104,Very pleased after a bumpy start,We booked a 2 night stay here and on arrival staff were pleasant and very helpful. When we got to the room we were a little disappointed as we had paid to upgrade and the room wasn't that nice and the bathroom was very small. So small I fact that I could not use the toilet ( im a big bloke ). Reception rang us in the room and asked if everything was ok. I mentioned the bathroom problem and they sent someone up straight away to show us another room that if we liked we could swap to. We swapped and had an excellent stay. All staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Would stay here again. ,4,2017,01,28
104,Nice stay,"Convenient location around the corner from Paddington Station.  We had a very small room, but we weren't in it much and it was still comfortable.  Staff were all pleasant. Lots of restaurants within walking distance.",5,2017,01,26
104,DISSAPOINTING,"The rooms of the hotel though well appointed are extremely small. Much of the gadgetry provided are wasted because of the cramped space available. A pity because all other aspects would get a four star rating,.",3,2017,01,24
104,Birthday weekend in london,"Arrived at the hotel, porter came straight out to offer to take our bags. We were given a free upgrade in our room. We had a two storey room, lovely and spacious. The bed was huge and comfortable. Breakfast was lovely, I opted for a healthy blueberry pancakes. Delicious. Would recommend this hotel, great base for seeing Hyde park side of London. Thank you for making my weekend lovely. ",5,2017,01,22
104,Great Service & Accommodation...,"I stayed at the Park Grand over the Winter Holiday, and while I have traveled quite a bit, I had likely one of the best experiences, in my travels. 

The hotel is comprised of (maybe) 4-5 converted Townhomes, so the layout is a bit quirky; but this just adds to the charm of the place. From the modern Lobby to clean and updated rooms the accommodation is excellent. 

Located a very short walk to Paddington train and tube, there are also touristy and not-so-touristy places to eat along the way. A little-bit further down, you may also find Hyde Park (through-which I strolled everyday). This hotel was also an easy drive to Heathrow. The Heathrow Express also leaves from Paddington.

If you have a car, parking is approx. $25.00/day (depending on exchange). 

Saved the best for last... The Staff was Amazing... From the Doorman, to Reception, to House Service, the people were nothing but friendly and professional. At one point, I felt as if I were coming home, as they would ask where I had gone each day... 

All around, a definite recommend, and will be my go-to for London.",5,2017,01,22
104,Birthday Treat,"I booked this hotel primarily on location as it is very close to Paddington rail and tube station, and also outside of the congestion zone as we were driving down for my partners 40th Birthday. It was only ever going to be a crash pad for us but we were greeted by very friendly staff on arrival, who secured us a parking place and, offered to take our bags. My partner and I are both Vegan and the receptionist (Arina I think) recommended us a fantastic Vegan buffet restaurant for lunch. In the morning we went for breakfast not expecting to be able to eat much at all on offer. We were pleasantly surprised, Anthony could not do enough for us to ensure we had a wholesome filling Vegan breakfast to start the day. The chef cooked fresh food for us, dairy free, and he even enquired as to the length of our stay so he could provide more choice for us.
The room itself was very clean and big enough (we had a duplex room with a mezzanine level) and was airy with an extremely comfy bed.
The only downside to the room was the dividing wall between us and the next room was quite thin and the room next door was a little noisy til the early hours with chatter and a creaky stair.
To be honest, we were both zonked after a day travelling and sightseeing so didn't keep us awake but the potential was there!
Overall I'd highly recommend the hotel for location, friendliness of staff and cleanliness which made for a pleasant stay and a memorable 40th birthday for my partner!",5,2017,01,19
104,Incredible hotel ,"This hotel was so great! Perfect location! Quiet, easy to find and easily accessible to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express.   The room we had was great. Large, very clean, Grand windows.  The bathroom was very nice too. We even had too add a day and the staff were very accommodating and gladly helped us book at the same rate.  Basically this is a great hotel and I'd recommend it to anyone! ",5,2017,01,19
104,A very welcoming and satisfsctory return to the hotel,"We were very satisfied and happy to return to the hotel. The service provided was consistent and satisfactory. We would like to graciously thank in particular Sanya and the team for the efforts and consistent hospitality provided to us during our stay.

We appreciate that being a gold member of the chain, we were upgraded to a club room upon availability and the fruit platter and amenities prepared in the room to welcome us back were fresh and delicious. 

We are also grateful of the warmth and friendly housekeeping staff that came daily for our evening turndown service to replenish our amenities. To me, it was exceptional to have the turndown services provided by Park Grand Hyde Park. Very well done and a great additional personal touch provided. 

Thank you once again to the team in Park Grand Hyde Park and please continue to keep up the good efforts, services and hospitality!! :)",4,2017,01,16
104,Best experience ever!!!,"Great hotel!! Great rooms!Two minutes walking from Paddington Station and Hyde Park! Breakfast is great! They gave us a mobile phone with free calls and internet. Free wifi in all of the hotel. The staff is amazing: There is Pavel that always greeting you on your way in and out, and if you'll get lucky there will be the angel Sanya from the reception. She helped us a lot and was so nice. She made our trip amazing.",5,2017,01,14
104,"Uncomfortable single rooms, but close to Paddington Station and friendly staff.","My favorite thing about this hotel was most of the staff.  When I checked in, I was coming from their other location, a few blocks away, which was fabulous.  This location was disappointing compared to the other, but the price was very good and the staff was nice, except for one man.  As I was checking in, I was having trouble with my credit card because my bank account had been hacked.  I kept having to call my bank to try to clear the card.  The guy at the front desk seemed annoyed.  It was devastating to have this happen, so compassion would have been appreciated.  I was given a single room upstairs that was freezing and smelled bad.  They let me look at another room, but told me that I probably would not like it because it was smaller.  I took the smaller room because it did not smell bad.  It was super tiny though, he was right.  It was also depressing.  The mattress was old and uncomfortable, but the rest of the staff was so nice, the location was an easy walk to Paddington station, so I did not complain.  I had booked through booking.com and it was a bit complicated to move to another hotel because I had paid in cash for 5 nights, plus I was jet lagged and didn't want to deal with moving.  Sometimes the options for single travels is kind of limited.  Also I found a bug in the bed the morning that I left.  Had I found it earlier I would have moved.  Again the staff was really friendly and nice, the cleaning people were nice, the room was clean, the tv was modern, and it was a good price.  So there you have it, my real review.",2,2017,01,12
104,Weekend away,"Great hotel with parking, location just off the m4, easy access to London central by foot or public transport, staff were very helpful with local knowledge and directions to the sites.
Great room  upgraded to the club double room,clean and tidy and breakfast was great.
Will stay here again booking direct is the best option.",5,2017,01,06
104,New Years Eve.  Great venue,"Stayed here on New Years Eve 2016. Convenient to Paddington Station and tube. Close to Hyde Park. We visited  Winter Wonderland in the afternoon which was   lovely but very expensive.

This hotel  was  ideal for us to explore before waiting for the fireworks. It's about 2.5 mile from Trafalgar Square (about  a one hour slow walk).  But the  tube is only Five minutes from the hotel  (Lancaster Gate Tube station).

The staff are very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were more spacious than some reviews led us to expect. They were well appointed and spotlessly clean.  We even got to park outside the hotel which was a real  bonus.

Overall, a very  good  hotel which I wouldn't  hesitate to recommend. Many thanks Park Grand, we really enjoyed  your hospitality.

",4,2017,01,01
104,Nice value for money place in central London,"This place is close to Paddington Station and one can just take the Heathrow Express from the airport and be there is less than 30 minutes. A very well maintained 4-start property with good hospitality and a decent breakfast -- in a very secluded street which is rather quiet and canopied by trees....I would call it an ideal business or family hotel if one is traveling on a moderate budget. You can do the bookings through the Shaftesbury group of hotels website easily -- and this group really has some nice 4-star properties (avoid the 3-star ones as the rooms are miserably small). The Park Grand has larger rooms and breathing space, something which is rare in London. ",4,2016,12,28
104,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","Found this hotel online by chance and it had good reviews generally. The location is great being only a few minutes walk from Paddington station and underground. A pretty area with tree lined avenues and smart houses and only a short walk to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens/Palace. The Hotel can pride itself on its friendly staff who were all willing to help. The breakfast had a fantastic choice of hot and cold food. There is also a small bar just off reception. The double rooms looked ok online, however as a solo traveller, my single room was in the basement (this is not unusual as solo travellers seem to be given the worst rooms in hotels normally the last rooms down a rabbit warren of corridors) As I only needed the room for showers and sleeping I was not bothered by its location too much, It was very small indeed but the facilities were good i.e. very good shower, flat screen tv, tea/coffee facilities, hairdryer, mini fridge, and smart phone for guest use. The bed was very comfortable and there is air con for the summer months which is just as well as the windows overlook a small courtyard with ventilation systems exiting on to it so I would imagine it gets pretty hot in the summer. There are a selection of toiletries and the towels were changed every day. There are a few areas around the rooms and hotel that could do with a bit of maintenance, but on the whole I was very pleased with the hotel and would stay there again.",5,2016,12,26
104,Sakar (manager) made our stay a lot more special,"I have stayed at this hotel two years running, and just checked out from a lovely two night stay. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Good location. Will definitely be returning here next year. Very good for the money. ",5,2016,12,23
104,Fantastic Stay - thanks to manager Sakar,"We have just checked out of this hotel, we stayed two nights and it's our second stay at this hotel. Staff very friendly and welcoming, good location. Sakar (the manager) very nice and likes to make sure you have the best stay possible. We will definitely be returning next year. ",5,2016,12,23
104,perfect location,"Great service from the people at the reception, very helpfull all the time.
Good complete breakfast for a good price, with a lot of healthy choices. 
Close by Paddington station  and a lot of good restaurants.",4,2016,12,23
104,Box Room of Death,I was transferred to this hotel from the Grand Royale which had problems with a boiler.  I paid ¬£168 for room 501 which I think was a converted box room.  There are stairs immediately behind the door which I fell down as I entered the room to switch the lights on.  The lights would not turn off at the switch - I had to take the card out of the wall.  There was a picture window between the ensuite bathroom and the bedroom which was covered by a blind in the bedroom side - so no privacy. Bed was so small my feet stuck out of the end and I am only 5'6.   Walls were paper thin so room was very noisy.  I may have just been very unlucky but my room was the worst room I have stayed in in London.  Receptionist in the morning was very snotty and perfunctory.  Implied I was stupid for falling down hidden stairs in the dark.,1,2016,12,18
104,Great location for Paddington Station,"The welcome we received from the staff was outstanding. Check in was easy, despite arriving a little early. The fact you are only a 5 minute walk from the station means that dropping bags and storing bags is no problem if you are travelling from the west by train. The rooms were bigger than the normal London hotel at this price point and the breakfast as well worth the money served in a bright breakfast room with healthy options on the menu. All in all it was a fantastic package. Would most certainly use this as a base for exploring London if I was arriving by train into Paddington. A cut above other hotels at this price point in the area.",4,2016,12,15
104,Fantastic value for money,"will defiantly be coming back to this hotel,the room itself was probably one of the best hotel rooms I've stayed at in London although slightly dated but the cleanliness was second to none and the facilities were brilliant,friendly staff and a great breakfast also in the price means i would highly recommend this to anyone looking to stay near hyde park,parking available right outside the hotel was also another plus point",5,2016,12,14
104,Faultless Hotel & Exceptional Staff!,"Stayed at this hotel last week and was completely bowled over by it! There is absolutely nothing negative I could say about any aspect of it at all!
Can I just say straight away that the staff at this hotel are beyond incredible. They gave above and beyond a 5* welcome and service. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them, and everyone from the reception staff, cleaners and waitresses always went out of their way to have a chat and make us feel so welcome and at home. Personalised, friendly service is so rare to find nowadays, but this hotel has tonnes of it. Vanessa at reception was particularly lovely.
Our room was beautiful - spacious, clean, cosy, and it overlooked a sensual view of the grand houses beyond, with a beautiful church in the background. I loved looking out of the window watching the sunrise, watching all of the planes on the horizon. Proper city hotel, but with so much charm, you just can't go wrong!
The breakfast was wonderful - there was so much selection, and although the dining room is quite small, we never felt cramped or had to queue.
Location wise, it is very close to both Paddington Underground and Overground stations, with easy links across the city. We got the tube direct to the theater district one evening, and felt safe coming back late at night.
I really can't wait for my next stay at this hotel, and it is definitely going to be the one that I return to in London!",5,2016,12,13
104,Great hotel for an overnight near Paddington Station,This is the perfect hotel for a quick overnight stay in London. The hotel was conveniently located near Paddington Station and an easy tube ride into the shopping of London. My son and I recently stayed here on a trip back from Paris and the room was comfortable and clean. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were good size. Great spot would return back.,4,2016,12,12
104,What a lovely hotel and services ,"I stayed in this hotel frequently while I was visiting London during my business trip . I find the location, the staff are hospitable and facilities are superb. It offers direct access to the main shopping areas , theatre, restaurants and many more attractions London offers. The bars rear to reception offers high quality beers and light meals ( chicken/ lamb curry and sandwiches) . 
Hotel is based stone throw away from Paddington station and Hyde park winter wonderland. 
Mr Sakar and Mr Zain been extremely helpful to me every time I stay and I would always highly recommend this hotel for all travelers visiting London for either business or leisure. ",5,2016,12,11
104,Tiny Small Room,"The room that we got was so small you would have had hard time swinging a cat.
The room consisted of a double bad a closet that you could hang only 2 coats a table and one chair.
No dresser to unpack your suitcases. Actually we had a hard time placing our suitcases, there was no room.
The bathroom consisted of a commode, a shower and sink. The towels were placed on two racks near the sealing over the commode. We had to climb on the commode with a coat hanger and jump to be able reach the towels. No place for my wife to place her make up, our 2 electric toothbrushes or my razor.
But it was not all bad, I do have to recommend the front desk especially Ms. Vanesa, the doorman Lucian and the handyman from the island of Madeira, sorry I forgot his name.
The breakfast was very good and the waitresses were very helpful especially Ms Ana.
The best was the location of the hotel.",1,2016,12,11
104,Excellent hotel and service ,"I was here with my fianc√©e . We stayed here for four nights . The room we stayed was top notch . Bathroom was extremely spotless and very pressurized shower .Housekeeping here is very helpful and does the perfect job . 
At front desk all staff were helpful .
Lucian , Arina and more special mention manager Sakar been very helpful too . 
Hotel facilititates parking spot outside which is very handy , being next to paddington station and almost close to winter wonder land Hyde park is a plus point . 
And again the big assets to this hotel is their staff , friendliness and professionalism is out standing and received 5 star service . 
Lastly I would like to thanks Sakar and Lucian for recommending the most romantic restaurant on our last night . 
Me , my wife to be and all our family will be back to park grand after our vacation in Barbados . 
Thank you very much ",5,2016,12,08
104,A good stay,"I stayed here for one night due to an early train to catch from Paddington. 

The hotel is a converted set of houses and was comfortable, clean and spacious.

The bathroom is nice and the bed large and comfortable. I wasn't able to make use of any other facilities but the hotel was good value for the location and late booking.",4,2016,12,08
104,Decent price for decent accommodation ,Great location on Westbourne terrace not far from Hyde park or oxford street. Close to Paddington station. And has good bus access. We stayed one night and were upgraded to a duplex room. Our breakfast was adequate with a choice from a buffet of full English or continental. The hotel was clean. Only downside is that we were sleeping on the main road side and the noise came through the windows so we were up from around 5am onwards ,4,2016,12,08
104,"By London standards, good value and location","We stayed there for 5 nights in total. We got a special deal on lastminute.com. The reception staff were friendly, professional, and efficient. The room was reasonably big and clean. We did have to ask the staff to change the sheets more frequently however. The bathroom was a little small too.The large continental breakfast option, at ¬£7 represented very good value. The location was relatively central, but quiet.",4,2016,12,07
104,Good hotel ,"I recommend it and it is only 15 mins walking from winter wonderland 
I stayed their 8 days 
Especially the receptionist are nice manager Mr Sakar  is very helpful and Lucian was so kind and friendly.
I love the area , love the room and everything exceeded my expectations .
Hotel is near paddington and lancaster gate and hyde park . 
Easy to access to all major London attractions. 
I will be back with my family soon . 
",5,2016,12,07
104,My ideal hotel in london ,"The hotel provide a very good service, and the location is good as well. Warm and friendly atmosphere. The staff Sakar and Lucian have been very helpful. The availability of the rooms were perfect all the time. ",5,2016,12,07
104,Sakar thank you so much for wonderful stay ,"I am staying with my brother. I came across Sakar the manager he guided us with everything. He is very friendly and very nice person. He also recommended us various areas in london to find a property. 
Hotel is very close to hyde park and paddington station . More than likely its our favourite hotel purely due to a location and wonderful staff led my Sakar . 
Rooms are very big , comfortable furniture and good layout. We always sleep with no problem like a log . 
I highly recommend this place and i am glad to find it . It will be our ideal private London residence for many years to come . 

",5,2016,12,07
104,"Great Location, Great staff","We spent 3 nights here and from start to finish the staff were helpful and polite, nothing was too much trouble. Tips on how to reach places pointed out on a complimentary city map. We had a club room which was spacious and very comfortable, the complimentary ""handy"" mobile phone was brilliant for finding the best routes to attractions and as a walking sat nav. The breakfast was warm and plentiful,the only fault was creaky floorboards as people in the room above walked about, it was probably the same for people below us as we walked about! but at the end of the day its an old building so it is to be expected.  I will use this hotel again on my next visit to London!",5,2016,12,02
104,Great location,"Found this one by accident since my reservation got ""lost"" in another property and was the one with availability in that region we wanted to stay.
Staff is friendly and overall accommodating.
Price-value is good specially if you want that area, I (we) would definitely would visit it again.",4,2016,11,30
104,service leaves a lot to be desired,"The hotel was somewhat comfortable with a largish duplex room.  We were 2 adults and 2 kids and the sofa bed on the lower floor was very small - it worked for the kids, but I can't imagine how 2 adults would sleep on it. The bathroom was actually a good size and quite clean.

There are a number of unfortunate choices that have been made in the room exacerbated by what I would consider poor management.
- there is a pillar supporting the upper level that severely restricts movement when the sofa bed is open.
- the whole property is dated - the carpets in the room look like they haven't been shampooed for years
- the heater is installed at the extreme top of the duplex level room - this makes the upper level very hot while the lower level is still cold.
- the towels were so threadbare we went out and purchased our own for the little one.
- The ""handy"" phone in our room was not working, and the manager tried to brush us off claiming it was just a free extra service.  Only after I insisted did they try to fix it.  I thing this attitude of the management to do the minimum work required permeates the whole hotel.
- Housekeeping would miss obvious things - dirty towel lying in the corner for 3 days, ironing table left half folded but not put away, no cleaning/checking for things under the bed, leaving dirty dishes in the sink.
- We asked for the body lotion to be replaced, but it was not done even once during our stay.  Eventually, we asked the front desk to send us some right away and they brought one little bottle, and again it was not replaced by housekeeping next day or day after.
- The breakfast in the restaurant was nice but essentially identical day after day.  The only thing that changed was cooked potatoes instead of hash browns some days.  Some variety would have been nice.

Having said all this, the size of the room was good for London.  However I don't think the hotel deserves 4 stars.  It was a very average hotel that could do much better with a few fixes.",3,2016,11,30
104,"Good Location, Dated but Cosy","Spent 5 days in London and lodged at the Park Grand in Paddington. The location is great, a 5 minute walk to Paddington overland & tube stations, 10 minutes to Hyde Park and about 25 minutes to Buckingham Palace or into Knightsbridge. The hotel is old and the rooms are on the small side. The single rooms are tiny but the double rooms are comfy enough. The decor is a little tired but the rooms are clean and sort of old world cosy. The hotels biggest asset is its friendly & helpful staff. Front of house, restaurant or house keeping, they were all great. Take the ¬£10 breakfast option, they serve a good breaky.",3,2016,11,27
104,Great Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location, walking distance to Oxford Street. Paddington tub station just around the corner. The staff were very friendly. The beds and hotel very clean and comfortable. My family and I had a great time.",5,2016,11,24
104,Thanks Sakar and team!,Very friendly and comfortable hotel. Quiet rooms and a nice breakfast! Anthony in the restaurant is also always very welcoming and from the door staff to front desk team there is always a very friendly welcome,5,2016,11,23
104,Park Grand and sister hotel,"I had a booking at this hotel accidentally cancelled by bookings.com I showed up at the hotel anyway half an our later and they could not have been more heplful. They arranged for a taxi to take me around the corner to their sister hotel at no cost with complimentary drink while i waited for the cab plus complimentary breakfast.
when i arrived at the other hotel, Senator i think its called...again...the staff were amazing. I had forgotten my phone charger...they went extremely out of their way to locate one in the hotel for me.All of the staff were on a completely excellent level of customer service the likes of which I have never seen. I regularly stay in London hotels in the centre of town every month 2 or three times over the last 25 years on business. I have to say in all honesty, really, even though this hotel is not a 5 star etc.....the staff in this place are outstanding. As for the hotel itself- very clean and comfortable with good facilities.",5,2016,11,23
104,"Charming Staff, great location","This Hotel is in a very good location, near Paddington Station, Hyde Park.  Close to good restaurants and pubs and easy to get to central London.  The Staff were absolutely lovely, whether or Reception, in the breakfast room, so warm and friendly and also efficient.  The breakfast was lovely, hot and cold buffet.",4,2016,11,22
104,brilliant hotel with fantastic staff,"my 18 year old daughter wanted me to take her shopping in London for her 18th and we chose to stay at the Park grand, what a wise choice, the staff were fantastic, the rooms were clean and included everything we needed for a 3 day stay, the breakfast really set us up for a full day of exploring and nothing was too much for the staff to do from hailing  a taxi for us, accommodating a late night check in and even looking after our luggage on the last day after we had checked out to allow us aan extra few hours shopping, we will be staying here again, cannot recommend this hotel and its staff enough",5,2016,11,21
104,Great service and very nice staff ,"I stayed 12 nights at hotel during November 2016, the hotel is clean, staff is really very nice and helpful, all of them, those whom I remember their names are Manager Mr Sakar, Sania, driana , Gaia , Venessa , Arina , Pavel and Lucian.  Rooms may be a little tight but this is general in London, however  windows insulation is not good . 
We had breakfast every morning , staff are again very helpful I would like thank Anthony super fresh and delicious breakfast. Also maintenance
Manager Mr Ahmed is also very helpful. I had a good time at hotel. ",5,2016,11,16
104,Fantastic hotel,"Great hotel , excellent staff.
Rooms are a reasonable size and clean. Everything you need in a hotel, complementary wifi, close to shops and train stations. Near little Venice which is worth a trip too.",5,2016,11,14
104,Good value for money Hotel,"Have just returned from staying in the hotel for 2 nights. The location was only a few minutes away from Paddington tube station. Comfortable bed with nice linen. With our room we were given bottled water, fruit and small bottle of red wine. Bathroom was small and  clean with sufficient toiletries provided. Breakfast was included in the room rate and cooked options were tasty, with selection of cereals, toast, croissants, Danish pastry, bowl of fresh fruit salad, sliced cheese, cooked ham and yoghurts. I'm fussy about my coffee and have to say it was fine. All in all if I was visiting London again I would have no hesation about staying here again and have already recommended to a friend for their next stay. The most outstanding feature of this hotel is their helpful staff who seem to enjoy what they do. The team is headed by a wonderful man Sarkar who's customer service and hospitality would make anyone want to return. Well done to everyone and keep up the good work.",5,2016,11,13
104,Rooms TOO hot!!,"Okay hotel is nice as expected. Staff very friendly and helpful, received a comp upgrade on check in which was great (we booked direct). 
Our room was so HOT (stayed in November) there was no temperature control and we couldn't work out where heat was coming from as radiators were cold, & air con wasn't working. Unfortunately this ruined our experience, we left as soon as we could after breakfast as it was just too uncomfortable. We had friends staying in two other rooms and they all experienced the same problem.
Breakfast was basic to be honest, and the cooked breakfast was cold. 
Great location, easy to find and walk to from Paddington. ",3,2016,11,13

104,Great Staff ,I have been there last year the stay was very good and the service also is very nice and lovely. We met the manager Sakar he was very helpful and nice to us and helps us a lot. The hotel location is very close to Paddington express train station so if you came from the airport you won't even needs a taxi it is about 8 minutes walk to the hotel. If you want to go there I really recommend it and don't forget about Sakar the manager if you need any help he will be there for you. ,5,2016,11,12
104,"Not Grand at all, and not very Park either.","This hotel, booked as a secret hotel deal through Lastminute is not in any way as you would expect.
Situated amongst a parade of generally budget travellers' hotels on Westbourne Terrace, conveniently close to Paddington Station, it has an air of seediness which is masked by a very shiny sign and a tiny marble lined reception area which seems bigger when viewed  through the wide angled lens used for the publicity.
The staff are friendly enough, the welcome convivial, but they were rather more interested in being friendly to each other. People stood outside, smoking and chatting and generally looking like they lived there.
The little lift hoisted us to a 3rd floor room arranged over two levels, allowing a large windowed room to have a small footprint whilst accomodating a sofa (nasty brown faux leather), a chair, a marble topped round table more suited to outside, a kitchenette area with the dishwasher removed, a choice of Tetley or Nescafe, a tiny bathroom and stairs to a mezannine with a very large bed and a dressing table and TV. A feeling of space provided by the layout and high ceiling was soon counteracted by the realisation that you can't see the tv from the sofa downstairs, you have to go downstairs in the night to use the bathroom, there is a lot of wasted and very depressing space dotted around under the stairs and you have to carry your tea, clothes, towel, whatever upstairs after a shower in order to get dressed and use the hairdryer and mirror.
The decor is depressingly Brown. Toffee coloured walls, Dark Blue curtains, old, poorly prepared paintwork in Gloss white, brown squiggly carpet which will never ever look clean, worn fabric on the chair (brown) - the place looks like something out of the early '80's favoured by travelling salesmen. The first thing that hit us was the overpowering scent of ""air freshener"". The place smelt like a south london mini cab. I quickly located the electric plug-in liquid air freshener and removed it before we went out for a nightcap, exiting through the throng of smoking, joking, chatting friends / staff / countrymen.
That said, it is clean, the bed was comfortable and huge, the linen crisp and white.
Not in a million years was this ever, nor ever will be, a 4* hotel. It is not a secret location contender, as these are, or should, certainly were once, great hotels who happen to have a last minute room available. I once stayed at the Mayfair hotel for less money than this place. It wasn't good value at ¬£132, let alone the ¬£180 or so I was hoodwinked into believing I should have paid.
I would not go so far as to say do not use this hotel, as it does it's job. It's just that it was not what I wanted or was lead to believe I was getting. The park is a few minutes walk away but we never saw it and it certainly is not in any way Grand.",2,2016,11,10
104,Nice hotel near station ,This hotel is pretty quaint but the rooms are not bad! About a two minute walk from Paddington station and a 15 minute cab ride to Kings Cross station. Rooms and near and clean. The bar downstairs offers food until 10pm. ,4,2016,11,07
104,""" Sakar "" ","
My husband booked this hotel fourtimes and i must say they 
Always remembered us by name and well looked after till we leave .
Excellent welcome from Sakar at the reception and that glass of cold water just the way i like it was a real treat upon arrival .
Although the hotel is upmarket and in a very expensive part of london , its homely and staff are really helpful and friendly . 
Mr Sakar has always been a fab host everytime we stayed and great spacious rooms as well .
Its my ideal london residence for many years to come .
Will definately come back for winterwonderland with our littleones soon .

104,"Great location, clean, friendly, great wifi","It took me a long time to find a hotel in London because the prices are through the roof. The Park Grand London Hyde Park is a 'find', and I will stay there again. It cost ¬£270 for two nights, including breakfast. It is a short walk from Hyde Park and Paddington Tube Station (handy for Heathrow). A stroll through Hyde Park on a crisp October morning was beautiful. Breakfast was plentiful and the coffee was okay ‚Äì I'm a coffee person, so okay from me is a compliment. Wherever I go I need good wifi, and this hotel did not disappoint, in spite of being told honestly before booking that the wifi signal it can fluctuate. I had a high-speed connection in my room for the duration. I booked for one person, and the room had a double bed. Do not expect large spacious rooms. The room was very small. But it had everything I needed, and I was very comfortable. Besides comfortable, it is fitted out to an extremely high modern standard ‚Äì especially the bathroom ‚Äì and was spotlessly clean. You will see in the lift a small menu, and one day I chose to have lunch in my room. I was very surprised to get a lamb dish on a par with the nicest I've ever tasted. I would highly recommend! On my last day I wanted to fit in some shopping in the morning, so to discover check-out is up to 12 noon was a huge bonus. Other hotels, please note. I found all of the staff very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2016,11,07
104,Birthday break for Mr and Mrs,"We are newlyweds and decided to do something diffrent for my birthday this year. So we had a look around and found this beautiful hotel online.  I'm not normally a fan of London as I don't like the hustle and bustle but this hotel is nicely tucked away.  We drove there so saved the money on train and they were kind enough to allow us to keep the car there the second day while we stopped too.  It was outside the congestion charge so handy there!  Staff were very friendly and polite nothing was too much trouble. After going to the west end for the evening we came back to be greeted by an evening turn down service with chocolates on our pillow.  We had a beautiful room upgrade -  iv never stayed in a hotel room that has a staircase inside before!  Just amazing! Room had lots of wash bits,  robes slippers, cold drinks fruit biscuits tea ans coffee to offer.  Nice air con plus heating with your own dial to suit whatever needs you have. Wish we stayed for more than one night but we are planning on returning closer to Christmas while we enjoy winter wonderland for the first time too!  

We had 4 ubber cars while in London and it was alot more relaxed than the underground.  Best visit to London yet thank you!",5,2016,11,05
104,Great hotel wonderful location and super friendly staff,"Had a 2 nights stay . Reception staff checked in quickly and nice spacious room .Bell boy helped us us the bags which was very nice . 
Hotel is right next to paddington station and hyde park . And also lancaster gate is 10 mins walk . The breakfast is quite good with eggs, bacon ,susages and kots of other choices . We had a mouth full of fruits and hot crossaints , very tasty .
Ok the good part was the wonderful staff let by manager Sakar , who is wonderful host and he make sures his guest feels like home away from home .
I would highly recommend this hotel . A walk from hotel to hydepark (bring bird seeds) . Buckingham palace, Trafalgar square, Bigben and lots of attraction walkable .
My only critics was lack of choice in the bar and no cocktails. 
Sakar you made our stay very pleasant .

104,A fabulous place to stay,"Park Grand London Hyde Park were able to offer us accommodation for 3 nights,  a wonderful Hotel, great accommodation, beautiful room, late stay as we were returning to Brisbane Australia late at night.  Wonderful staff, thank you Sakar, Arina, Sanya,Darja, Lucan and everyone else who looked after us.  Great breakfast great choice. The only place to stay in London for us.

104,Exceptional 4* hotel,"Stayed at many hotels from the UK to Far East - from budget to luxury. Stayed 1 night on business at the Park Grand. 
Check in was very good - efficient and very friendly. Room wasn't quite ready, so offered a drink from the bar. Cases delivered to my bedroom - a rare touch in the UK.
Booked a Club Room and worth every penny. Lounge area with kitchenette, stairs leading to mezzanine and comfortable bed. Bathroom well equipped and good decor. Large walk in shower with good water flow. Room very clean with lots of extra touches - mini bar, fruit, dressing gown and slippers, and night time turn down service.
Breakfast was busy, but good choice and quality of food good. 
All staff were helpful and friendly, special mention to Sanya on Reception.
Check out was good and hotel location was close to tube network with easy access into the City. 
Quite simply, this hotel exceeded expectations and for London, was good value. Keep up the standards and look forward to a return visit.",5,2016,11,04
104,Great staff makes great hotel ,"I stayed in this hotel for one night and I really like it. The people in the reception are very friendly and helpful specially mr. Sakar who help me to find a good and suitable room for me.
Hotel is converted from London Town house and well appointed rooms . Very clean , good modern furniture and super comfy showers . 
Didn't had time for food at the restaurant so can't comment on it but overall I was very happy that I choose to stay at this hotel . 
And lastly it's only 5 minutes to paddington . 
Sakar and rest of the team thank you for memorable stay . Surely be back soon . ",5,2016,11,04
104,Great hotel in a great location ,"Great hotel a short walk from Paddington, modern rooms and bathrooms that were lovely and clean! We were able to drop our bags off before check in and pick them up later in the afternoon after checkout! Breakfast had plenty of choice and an iron was available from reception! Lovely hotel!!!",4,2016,10,31
104,Friendly and clean,"I stayed here for 2 nights and we were upgraded to a split level suite. It was very clean and the bed was very comfy. The sleeping area was too warm (must be unbearably hot in summer) the aircon cooled the lower level but not the sleeping area. Bathroom was ""compact"" but clean. 1st night there was no extras however on retiring to the hotel for our second night there was dressing gowns, fruit and drinks and toiletries left for us.  Overall a recommended stay close to Paddington and Hyde park. Not quite 4* hotel more like a 3*. We would stay again.",3,2016,10,29
104,"Terrific spot, nice clean hotel","I chose this hotel for it's proximity to Paddington station to catch the Heathrow Express with my small child. We caught the National Express Coach from Stanstead and it was only a couple of minutes walk to the hotel with our cases. We were about an hour before check in but our room was ready and we were able to check in which was a big relief to get rid of our bulky cases. The room was clean and in good condition which I have found a rarity in London hotels. I loved the location as it was really easy to get to food,shops, transport etc though we walked a lot too. The staff were all very helpful and I would most definitely recommend this property and stay here again myself if I ever get the chance to return to London.",4,2016,10,26
104,"Good location and value, but uncomfortable room/bed","Had an overnight layover, so booked the Park Grand as it was a 5 minute walk to the Paddington Station/Heathrow Express. After reading other reviews, I expected the Deluxe Single room to be small and have a tight squeeze in the bathroom, but unfortunately a couple of things stood out: 
- Soft and lumpy bed - I could feel the spring coils flex and give way as I tried to fall asleep
- Thin Walls - Woke up at 3 AM to my next door neighbor coughing
- Tiny Shower - If you drop a bar of soap, there was no way to pick it up without leaning against the shower wall. 

Breakfast and location were good...but that was about it.",3,2016,10,26
104,Good value for money,"We enjoyed our stay at the Park Grand. We chose it for it's reasonable price and great location. Indeed, it is located 5 minutes from Paddington Station with its Connect train service to Heathrow and multiple tube routes. It is also located close to restaurants, pubs and convenience shops. 

The price included a hearty English breakfast and free wifi. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. 

Our room, although small, was typical of rooms in other hotels in which we have stayed in the Paddington area. It was clean with an updated ensuite. 

",4,2016,10,24
104,"Good hotel, central location, friendly and helpful staff","The room was of good quality, clean,, excellent shower, the hotel is centrally located. The staff were very polite and professional, want to say thanks to Sakar for being very cool and upgrading my room.",4,2016,10,23
104,Great team at a really great hotel,"Thank you for making our trip to London really enjoyable.
Front desk staff really nice and very helpful-Sakar, Adriana and the young man who helped with cases whose name I have forgotten.(Sorry)
Breakfasts are really great with the staff there also so nice. We did miss Anthony this trip who in our previous visits to the Park Grand has made us feel really welcome.
We have found this hotel is a good base for our trips to London as it is walking distance from Paddington stations, main line and undergroup which makes travel round the city easy.",5,2016,10,18
104,weekend in london,"This was the 4th time we have stayed here and find the staff the most friendliest from any other hotel we have stayed in. Sakar and Adriana are very helpful and efficient and do everything possible yo make your stay a pleasant one. The hotel location is great being within walking distance of Paddington and Hyde Park. The Breakfast is brilliant and the staff there very pleasant and always ensure the buffet is well stocked.. Rooms are clean tidy and well appointed. we do not need to look for anywhere else to stay when this hotel and its staff are so welcoming. we will be back next year. Alan, Margarete and Norrie from the Stirling area.",5,2016,10,18
104,Thanks Sakar for helping out with my booking,"I stayed around about 3-4 weeks and the staff was one of most friendliest I have seen. Nothing too much trouble, Plus the location wise hotel is perfect and the room is perfect . 
Hotel is converted from a town house but very well appointed room . 
Paddington station is short distance walk and Hyde park is nearly, plenty of restaurant and shops stone throw away . 
Will surely be back soon .",5,2016,10,15
104,"Great friendly Service, particularly from Sakar on reception","We've had stayed here several times and have always enjoyed  very friendly and efficient service from all of the staff, Sakar was especially helpful and made sure we were checked in quickly and happy with our room. Breakfast is great value for money and well presented.",5,2016,10,09
104,Many thanks to the great staff!,"Great staff and nice hotel, special thanks to Sakar for helping us out with our check in, highly recommended. Rooms are cool and clean, and it has a bar which is rare in this area! Would stay again, cheers",5,2016,10,09
104,weekend in London,"clean & cozy room.   close to Paddington station and walking distance to bus stops.
safe neighborhood.   bathroom floor is heat which was nice but bathroom was rather small.   bed was very comfortable. hotel is an hour away from Gatwick and cost me 97 euro taxi to get to hotel.   Hotel site say it offers airport shuttle which is not the case, that needs to be corrected as I book this hotel specific for this amenity",4,2016,10,09
104,"Decent hotel vs price vs location but very, very, very small single room","The location of the hotel is spot on (5min from Paddington) and the price compared to other hotels is competitive.

I stayed at a single room on the lower ground level. The bathroom as renovated and good but the room overall (bathroom incl.) was practically a shoe box. In order to iron I have to move the staff around. The other two people who were with me had single rooms and they were as small as mine.

Another thing to consider is that the dining options offered are very limited (a curry dish only I think) so have to go out for dinner.

In summary, great location, ok price but the single rooms are tiny.",3,2016,10,08
104,"Not a 4 stars hotel, but more then a 3 stars hotel","We stayed for 8 nights and enjoyed our selves very much. 
We had 2 rooms, one for us which was upgraded from delux room to studio room by the hotel and the kids were at delux room. The size of the studio room is okay for a European hotel in the middle of the city, certanly for this price and was clean and comfortable. The hotel is very generous with the coffee facilitiy in the room.
The staff at the hotel are really nice and tried to help as much as they could with every question we had.
The hotel location is great, the Tube is very close and from the Pedington station one train will take you to most locations with no need to switch.
The breakfast is very good and generous. 
The delux room is very small and certanly does not suit a 4 stars hotel. 
The bath room is small and in both rooms there is no place to put your things near the sink which is not comfurtable. 
The rooms are clean but the hotel is old and the rooms need to be ventilated every day because they smell of mold",4,2016,10,08
104,Basic ,"Not quite as good as the 4 star rating...

Temperamental air-con, smell of smoke coming through the extractor fan in the bathroom, showers don't get hot enough, cleaner knocked on my door at 11am when check out is 12! 

Wouldn't visit again. ",3,2016,10,08
104,Great hotel with excellent staff,"The Park Grand is my hotel of choice when I visit London. Great rooms, friendly and helpful staff (Sakar especially) and a central location. Handy for Paddington, local restaurants and Kensington Gardens. ",5,2016,10,05
104,Many Thanks Sakar you have been a wonderful host ,"I stayed at this hotel for few times during my trip to London . 
And every time I arrive , everyone greeted me with welcoming smiles . 
Especial mention Mr Sakar remembers us and greets us like his own family . 
We have always been lucky enough with room . Very spacious , cosy bed and descent size bathroom . 
I called up and made reservations directly with the hotel , room rates was affordable and very tasty breakfast was free of charge . 
I was very happy with my stay , as far as it goes it's been very memorable . 
Big thank you to all staff members of this hotel and I will always be returning. ",5,2016,10,04
104,Very Good staff ,"I stayed at this hotel few times with myself and my friends. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay . Centrally located, easy to get to anywhere. Good facilities, very helpful staff and very good choices of breakfast. We were given a room in third floor, which was nice , clean and Modern. Reception area is very clean and very comfortable sofa , next to reception is a bar which is very cosy , stocked with various drinks and very handy which opens till 23:00 hrs 

Tea and coffee making facilities and cookies was a plus point .  

I will surely be again when I am at London next time . 

Thank you very much all the staff of park grand from room 310

104,Decent hotel,"We used this hotel for a weekend break and were more than satisfied with our stay.

It's a little further out than some hotels but is no more than a short tube ride into central London.

The room itself was okay, it was a little tired in areas but you will not find bigger rooms for the price - ours had a mezzanine, which is unbelievable in London.

The breakfast was good and the staff were always happy to help.

Bottom line it was good value.",4,2016,10,04
104,Mixed feeling review for solo traveller..,"A pretty mixed feeling review as a solo traveller..
Talk about the unhappiness first.
Got a room at 126 for a single room.
Room size pretty small but I m used to this kind of room size in Europe. 

Glance out of the window, directly the Air-con compressor unit is outside the window. Making those humming sound through out the day and night time. As I m pretty sensitive to sound ie the clock ticking at night, decided to cut short my stay of 3 nights.

The front desk lady which I don't bother to get her name, offered to change to another room, but then more and bigger air con compressors outside the window.
I have rejected the offer and asked for cancellation of my 3rd nite stay. A face of irritation shown immediately..

Although a third room is offer with almost the same view..again..

To add on, sound insulation is as though does not exist..but most Europe rooms are build in this way..
You can hear doors banging, TV sound from other room...

The pros.. 
It is in a quiet part of Paddington. Probably 6mins walk to the station. 
Price wise, pretty attractive.
And the breakfast is good too..

To end..
Probably only the single room is designed in this way.",3,2016,10,02
104,Outstanding Place to Stay in Hyde Park/Paddington Area,"Outstanding service and location made up for the tight corridors, small bathrooms and creaky floors of this hotel. We stayed here for 6 nights as our first stop in London to explore the Hyde Park/Paddington area. Location was perfect for early morning runs to Hyde/Kensington Park. Paddington and Lancaster Gate station were a short way away. The laundromat was 1 block away. 
Service staff was first class. They went beyond their duties to help us acclimate to the new time zone and place. Though we arrived at 10 am, Adriana (concierge) and Lucian (door/bellman) let us sit and relax in the bar area and offered us free cookies and bottled water. They stored our luggages while we waited for our room.  At 1 pm, they let us in our room. A handy phone was available to us during our stay so we could call anyone in the UK and abroad which was very helpful for anyone without a UK sim card.  Wifi was available too but it was weak - it dropped off a few times in the day. Free breakfast was very good.  Anthony who was in charge of the breakfast was very good at managing the seating of guests.  The breakfast area in the basement could not accommodate every guest so you either come very early or wait for your turn. The servers were very efficient so the wait time was not an issue. We had the duplex suite so you had to go up the stairs (13 steps) for the double bed. The sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable. Noisy because the room faced the street and the door/window did not close properly. The bathroom was very tight and not comfortable for tall or huge guests. Plenty of towels which was nice. Hair dryers and safe were available. Despite the nuances, the service team made our stay worthwhile.  Kudos to Lucian, Adriana, Pavel, Anthony, Sanya, Monica, Florentina, Arina,Claudia, Darja and Gaia. We would definitely be back here on our next trip to London.",4,2016,10,01
104,"Great hotel, lovely staff","Second stay at this hotel for work, and really happy I chose it on both occasions. The location is great, and the staff are so friendly - especially Sakar on reception. Great value, comfortable, clean, excellent all round.",5,2016,09,27
104,Great Stay,"Nice hotel. We booked just for one night to go and see David Gilmour at the Albert Hall. It's only a 4 min walk from Paddinton station.

We also got an upgrade to a Duplex suit. Many thanks for that it made our stay. Clean rooms, and very polite staff. Would recommend friends.",5,2016,09,25
104,A wonderful stay,"My wife and I just spent 2 nights at this hotel. What a pleasant experience. The staff are wonderful and the room was lovely. 
All hotels are on the small size in London but we did have a king size bed...
The staff was wonderful especially Sanya and Gaia (forgive me if my spelling is incorrect) they could not have done any more to make our stay any better, they answered our questions and concerns and made us feel very welcome. This even extends to the bellman who answered all our needs. The location is great, a short walk to the tube, there are buses and the Big Bus London tour stop is only a couple of blocks away...

we started each day with a lovely full breakfast and they even supply a cellular phone for you to take and use while out and about. The phone is a huge plus as we could phone our family and friends (and the hotel when we got lost) at anytime to let them know we were having a wonderful time.

We will stay at this hotel the next time we go to London, that is a for sure.",5,2016,09,23
104,Mr Sakar thank you very much for your hospitality ,"i was alone and missed my train to another city. I decided to stay the night at this hotel because it is cheap and it is near the paddington station. I met Sakar in the hotel he is very kind and he upgraded my room for free to a better and much bigger room. everytime i came to this hotel they helps with everything i need specially mr. Sakar big thanks to him. he is one of the best hotel managers i have met.
",5,2016,09,20
104,Thank you very much Mr Sakar ,I came back to the park grand because of my first phenomenal stay and I can safely say it was more than worth the money .. The customer service is way above standard and the staff are amazing .. Lucian and the manager mr Sakar are extremely welcoming and do their best to make it a home from home .. The food in the restaurant was easily worth a Michelin star and the room was again impeccable!! ..  ,5,2016,09,19
104,Surprised by an upgrade,"Initially we were not given a room but Night Supervisor Mr Ivan promised to change it next day. We reminded Adeel in the morning when we were having late breakfast and he said a note is already left on your profile for  better room, please check with the front desk. Also discuss with our manager Gurdeep who will definitely help you out.
We were given a very surprising and pretty big and nice room with complimentary drinks. We had a lovely time and enjoyed our wedding anniversary.
You all were great and treated us like a family guest.I just wanted to say thanks to Mr Gurdeep, Ivan, Adeel and rest of the team.",4,2016,09,18
104,Great location. Tiny room,"I chose this hotel because of the proximity to Paddington station. Heathrow express terminates at Paddington. This station is well-connected in the tube network. The hotel is about 5 minute walk from the station. Yes, you can drag the luggage. There are plenty of restaurants around the station. So this location is great.
But I was very disappointed with the size of the room (I got room 110, single occupancy). I could hardly move in and out of the room. I guess this is the compromise you have to make when you want a convenient location in a big city but a reasonable price.
I really appreciate the cleanliness of the room and the bathroom area. Housekeeping was good. They need not change the towels everyday and they need to use fabric softeners as the towels are not soft.
Breakfast buffet was good. Some items could be changed, as it got boring to eat the same items for 4 days.
Like many other UK hotels, this property is also very old (100+ years?). So there are many winding steps, narrow corridors and very confusing to reach your room. People who have difficulty in climbing stairs have to watch out while booking.
Overall, I would go back here (as a single, for business trip) because of the great location and reasonable price.",3,2016,09,17
104,Excellent stay with the best service,"We stayed there for a couple of days to attend a British festivals in Hyde park which was literally 2 minutes away from the hotel.
Quite comfortable place and we were amazed by the staff service such as Mr Adil who served us in the bar and he almost made our night. I requested Mr Ravi, who was the manger there night time to promote him for his brilliant and warmed service.
Mr Gurdeep also gave a hand to get a cab for us,You guys were amazing and we would love to see you again. 
Thank you all brilliant staff who made our best holidays.",4,2016,09,13
104,Brief Overnight in London,"We chose Park Grand London Hyde Park because of its proximity to Paddington station. We wanted to be in a nice part of London, access to the park, shops, pubs, etc, but easy to leave our bags and then grab them right before hopping on Heathrow Express to catch our flight. The hotel was clean, the service was friendly, and our room was comfortable. They even provided a mobile phone for us to use while wandering around London to save our international mobile roaming charges, which was an added benefit.",5,2016,09,11
104,We were forced to leave a review on here,"Really annoying stay because two guys forced us to leave a comment in tripadvisor and they asked us to put there name and they will give us some drinks complimentary, well we enjoyed those drinks but did not like the way they took our mobile and used without our happiness , we did not want to be rude with them but clearing it for management , please train your staff , we stayed in 309 and 805 and persons who forced us were Zan and Ravee . Rest hotel was nice place to stay to spend  nice time.",3,2016,09,09
104,If you have a CPAP or allergies . . . Beware of the must,"Let me start by saying that we did LOVE this hotel!  The room was great and the property with AC and a Lift, were just what we needed. The staff is AMAZING! **Shout out to our favorite RockStar Lucian!!**
The problem that I had with this property was after we got home.
While in London, each night of the 10 days we were there, when we would open the door to the room from a day of touring we could smell something, but we could never find a source and then we would grow accustomed to it and it didn't seem so bad.  When we returned home from our trip, and opened out suitcases, we were blown away by the smell!  We had to air everything out outside for several days, we had to wash all the clothes 2 or 3 times with vinegar or soda to get the stink out.  Now the worst of all, I am going to have to pay over $1500 USD to replace my CPAP machine because there is no way to get the stink out and it is too soon for my insurance company to buy a new one. We have been home for 3 weeks now and no matter what I have done, I cannot get the smell out of that machine, so I haven't been able to use it since we got home.  As much as I need this machine for my health, if I had known that this would be the outcome, I would have left the machine home or stayed at a different hotel.",2,2016,09,07
104,Not a 4 star hotel,"Our stay in the hotel started with negative surprise. We booked the single room for me and twin room for my children. Prior arrival I wrote to the contact email from the website whether we can be accomodated on the same floor. The reservation manager for the hotel group answered - don¬¥t worry, you will be accomodated next to each other. During the checking the reception told me the room numbers - 114 and 407. The rooms were not only on differnet floors, but also in different part of the building! The receptionist explained that they don¬¥t have the single rooms and twin rooms in the same area. It is sad that the reservation manager doesn¬¥t know it. The laidies from reception tried to solve the situation and they offered to move us on ground floor on the next day - to a single room and a double room. We don¬¥t want to waste the time on another day by movement to the rooms with view to opposite wall (similarly like the single room on 1st floor) and I was also affraid that the double room would be probably smaller than the twin room on 4th floor. So we  decided to stay in original rooms. 

The best thing about the hotel is the in-hotel staff - very polite and helpfull (especially Adriana and Lucian) We appreciated the complimentary handy during our stay with free local calls and internet, which we used during exploring London and South England. The breakfast is tasty, the variety of food is not big, but sufficient.

The rooms correspond to 3 stars. The furniture is outdated. The single room is very small, but I expected this according the photos on the website and reviews. The twin room was enough spacious. We really miss the minifridge in hot August days, I thought that minifridge is a mandatory standard in UK 4 stars hotel. If you need a TV during your holiday, the TV is modern and  with big screen. I would exchange TV for a minifridge, AC Works properly, but is is badly situated in the single room - directly above your head when you are in bed. Unfortunatelly, the old window can be open on max 20cm, so in hot nights no fresh air flows from the window. So, you can either risk the illness from AC above your head or sleep in hot room.

The bathrooms are small, but nice renovated and quite practical. I only miss a holder or a shelf for tooth-brush and tooth-paste. 

Generally - don¬¥t expect too much, and the hotel in good location and nice staff allow you to enjoy your holiday in London.",3,2016,09,07
104,Sakar and Darja great host ,"I stayed here twice on business trip now and I cannot recommend this hotel enough .
When I arrive staff remember me and greet me with my name .
Was checked in to a very spacious room . I am more than thrilled to say the staff are so pleasant and go above your expectations. Great rooms , very comfortable bathroom and 
Breakfast is always a wow , love their fresh hot croissant.
Oh yeah doorman Lucian and paved  is always  cheerful and smiling .
 I am always overwhelmed with their service and satisfied at this place . It's like my own residence in London .
Thanks to Mr Sakar and his team .",5,2016,09,06
104,Pleasant and Satisfactory,"Stayed at the hotel for 8 nights. Prior to my arrival, I walk in to verbally addressed my requests and follow up with an written email whereby Ms Adriana has very attentively and promptly dealt with which I am grateful and appreciate.The room assigned was fully functional and required amenities were prepared upon our checking into the hotel. Saia, Gaia and Sekar of the front office that were helpful attending and arranging my request which were much appreciated too.

The breakfast in the hotel was very basic and lesser in variety compared to the other sister hotel. Coffee served daily was quite inconsistent whereby there was one instance it tasted old (i.e. few left over pots mixed into one) and luke warm. However, the sauteed mushrooms was tasty as they were properly spiced and flavoured daily. Their alternate day hash brown and sauteed potatoes were good as well.

One point to take note is the housekeepers/cleaners, they are consistently eager to hurry opening the door and getting into the room after one knock even though we responded to them in many occasions to hold on. Would appreciate that the duty manager or whoever in charge to properly notify/train them the correct protocol of "" knocking the door and addressing themselves loudly housekeeping repeatedly for thrice"" before entering the room.

Hopefully the team keep up the good work consistently and I look forward to returning to this hotel!",4,2016,09,06
104,Excellent central location for tourists ,"We stayed here with our 3 adolescent daughters and the room was very cramped with 2 beds and little other space. Had to situate luggage around the floor space remaining. I've heard London hotel rooms are tiny but this was the tiniest we'd been in our of 7 in total through our trip in Germany and Switzerland. Good location though with plenty of food choices around the corner. Don't be afraid to walk around this neighborhood. Plenty of good Indian , fish and chips and Italian to be found !  Loved going to the Dylan dog cafe or the Raffles for a hearty egg and beans breakfast. Don't eat at the hotel buffet!  Waste of your money unless you eat a lot. One day we had the 'healthy breakfast' for under $6 ¬£ but it was so bad I wouldn't recommend it. Their pancakes were cold and they used honey for syrup. Never again. Always went out after that. Go out for your coffee and breakfast.  The front counter staff at the hotel were very good and welcoming. Other than the small size of the room it was a good hotel to organize our sightseeing for 4 days. ",4,2016,09,05
104,Exactly what is needed when working away from home,"I have stayed here for a total of 7 weeks and it has been a pleasant stay. The staff are always friendly, available and personal. The hotel is in a good location as it is close to Paddington train station and also Lancaster Gate underground train station. Sakar and Adriana have been exceptional!",5,2016,09,04
104,Not suitable for families.,"Stayed in superior quad room which I thought would have separate beds for my daughter and son as they dont share and it also makes it more peaceful. Unfortunately they dont have this arrangement which I found out after a lot of time wasted at the reception.  The room allocated for us had narrow windy stairs..totally unsuitable for us to manoeuvre with a stroller and a difficulty to use numerous times with a young family.

After an hour of discussion we managed to explain to the staff that even if the identical room arrangement was available without the stairs...it would be ok.  This was sorted out due to our own foresight.  The next day I was stopped several times by staff including the manager mr.sikar (who was not there the day before) to ask for car parking payment that I already paid for first day....as if I was going to abscond without paying!! A bit unprofessional in my opinion.

The parking charge itself is reasonable at ¬£20 per day.  The wifi here is good...I was even able to stream.  The breakfast was pretty basic continental style...and we were sent back up away from the basement restaurant as it was too busy and very small with no waiting area.

The room itself although its called superior is pretty basic and little room for moving about. Some pictures of this room show a area with tub chairs and round table but our room did not have this. The bathroom is ok but again small and no area to stack towels etc and no toiletry area near sink.  Space clearly comes at a premium in this establishment and although a little cheaper to stay here...next time ill be paying a bit more with the knowledge that I will have a far pleasant stay.  Although staying here may be fine for most people...a true testament for a establishment is how they handle disgruntled guests when things go wrong. Unfortunately in my case...they handled it poorly.

Its a bit of a shame my experience here was dampened as staff on the whole seem fairly pleasant especially the gentleman who helped up with luggage and was working on the entrance.",2,2016,09,03
104,Fantastic and Awesome staff ,"Oh God I love this place . I have been roaming around England for while and on my last few days I choose to stay at this place .
Checking in was very quick and I was given a room 002 , which was very spacious , comfortable and clean .
All the staff I came across is incredibly helpful , that's over the top .
I was given invaluable travel assistance by Mr Sakar which actually save me incredible amount of money.  
Miss Adriana is pretty , nice and friendly and always keen to help me and Lucian is way too hospitable too .
I loved the location and had a perfect stay .
I will be back again next year . 
 I could have given 10plus star if I could

104,Amazing stay!!,"Stayed at this hotel with my cousin for 5 nights. Great location only 5 mins walk to paddington station and Lancaster Gate/Hyde Park. neat and clean rooms. Full english and continental breakfast buffet available and definitely worth a try. 
Staff was outstanding and very helpful all the time especially Zain, Ravi and Ivan at night who ensured our stay was most pleasant and enjoyable. Would definitely be visiting again soon. ",5,2016,09,02
104,Mr. Ravi Dasondi & Zain are Star of the Hotel,"Ravi & Zain are very good and help full in the middle of the night.

I am always impressed with the welcoming environment Ravi and his team provides to their guests!!

More importantly, Ravi and team will remember your face and any requirements you have.

This hotel will always be my first choice when searching for a night or more stay and highly  satisfied with the choice of the hotel.
 Good service friendly relation which the guest and good service overall. 

Once more time cannot thank Ravi and Zain friendly team at the Park Grand Hyde park enough.",5,2016,09,02
104,Brilliant stay ,"I recently stayed at the hotel and it was the best visit so far to London I've had - I've been visiting London for over 12 years. All the staff were incredibly hospitable, welcoming and it's a place I would really recommend to others.

I have stayed once or twice at the Park Grand, but this particular visit was really quite something. The staff and manager remembered me as soon as I walked in, which was great, I got upgraded within 5 mins of checking in  and my room was lovely. As a single female travelling, having such great staff made me feel alot safer in central London. 

I would like to give special thanks to Sakar, Aidrianna and Lucian. They kept me smiling from the time i walked in, until the moment I left, and as I was on a  mini break from stressful work, I really appreciate all that you did. Staff like that really make your visit special. Actually all the staff from portering, catering and cleaning, were very helpful and kind.

Centrally located, lots of shops nearby, a good mix of visitors, tube/station in walking distance, it ticks alot of boxes. I will definitely be staying again. 

Many many thanks Park Grand hotel team!",5,2016,09,02
104,Quadruple room ,"Stayed at the hotel from the 1st -3rd sept 2016
I be stayed here a few times now 
Recommend this for the location to central London and all attractions as only a few minutes away. 
This stay , the staff at the reception ( darja & dalia) were extremely helpful and lovely.
The hotel in itself is abit dated but not moaning as , I've said it is a good hotel .
Stayed in the quadruple room which is big enough for 4 adults.( bathroom is small)
Overall this hotel is good ..",4,2016,09,01
104,Nice hotel for short breaks,"Stayed from 24th to 27th August 2016. In a excellent position for exploring London a short walk from Paddington station, underground and bus stops.
Staff are very helpful and polite and the hotel was very clean. The room which was small but as it was just somewhere to sleep it suited our needs (we had a deluxe double).
The complimentary breakfast was buffet style and had plenty of choice with full English and continental available. The bar prices were typical London hotel high but there are plenty of pubs nearby. We will use this hotel again when we next visit London but would most likely up grade on our room.",4,2016,08,29
104,Excellent over night stay,"Stayed here with friends Saturday night after the Rugby at Wembley. Excellent location for tubes and city centre, fabulous friendly staff, good size clean rooms with tea, coffee etc. On site parking a bonus and reasonably priced. Got back today and have already booked for next year. Well done and thanks to all the staff at Park Grand.",5,2016,08,28
104,Not a 4 star hotel ,"My husband and I booked to stay at this hotel for two nights with our three children,as a family of 5 we needed to book two separate rooms,I stayed in a double room with my daughter(611) and husband was in (202) with our other two daughters. My room was ok it was a little on the small side but we wasn't planning on spending too much time in the room so I wasn't to bothered by this. My husbands room on the other hand was terrible as soon as he walked in the room he was greeted by a terrible smell I can only describe as 'sweaty feet' there was a damp patch on the Celin above the a/c unit,the chair by the desk has seen better days,the window was so dirty you couldn't see through it and the most shocking part was my 6 year old daughter got a glass of water from the room luckily she only took a sip of it because 5 minutes after it had been poured the water was cloudy with dirt grains in the bottom of the glass. My husband phoned reception about the smell in the room and the only offer to resolve this matter was a can of Air freshener which only masked the smell for a very short time.we payed just under ¬£800 to stay for two nights so we were expecting a lot more for our money.
However the staff at the hotel are very friendly,the lady who checked us in(sorry I didn't get her name) was lovely and very helpful and the gentlemen who were stood at the door each day greeting guests were also very friendly and chatted to the children about what they had been up to during our stay in London.
Overall a nice hotel but not 4 star",3,2016,08,25
104,Great stay in London,"Stayed in July 2016 as a solo traveler. I arrived earlier then check-in and the front desk was lovely to accommodate me checking in early, they even phoned me after a couple of hours to check that I was okay (I must have looked disheveled after being caught in the rain that day!). My room was on the ground floor, next to the front desk. Great room, and good size for London standards, but it must be close to a staff entry because I would get woken up around 5am every morning when people started arriving, but that would be my only reservation, maybe ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid this.

Front desk was always helpful with directions and booking things, I had breakfast one day, but would prefer to eat out if I didn't have to eat at the hotel. 

All round great stay and would stay again.",4,2016,08,22
104,Super Staff,"Have stayed here a few times when I go back to London for business and I am never disappointed. The location is great - convenient for the  Heathrow Express (from Paddington) and only a quick walk to Lancaster Gate tube. Rooms are small, cozy and clean. A big plus is A/C in each room, which I was very thankful for this week!
The staff is what makes this place great. Lucian, Adriana and Darsa are always pleasant and it is obvious they luv their jobs. When my cab did not show up, they took it upon themselves to sort it out, and with a few phone calls a new cab was on its way. Thank you!",5,2016,08,21
104,Stevie Wonder Concery,"A great venue very close to the tube station and a half hour walk to Hyde Park open air concert venue all in all ticks every box had a very reasonable price for a top location.

The rooms are very functional and the bathroom was a little cramped however everything was very clean and very tidy and very presentable excellent for a 1/2 night stay.",4,2016,08,20
104,A pleasant transfer to this hotel!,"We stayed here during 17th - 19th August. We weren‚Äôt actually meant to stay here. We were transferred from another nearby hotel due to an undescribed problem with the room - so we were tired and not in the best of moods when we arrived. Fortunately the reception staff were reasonably quick enough to deal with the situation. 

As for our room (M1), it was located at the back of the hotel. It was spotlessly clean, nicely furbished with minimal signs of wear, well presented and I was very pleasantly surprised with the addition of the ‚ÄòHandy‚Äô phone - which really did come in handy! A nice flatscreen television too. I was also impressed to see the inclusion of air conditioning - which when we arrived was ‚Äòa must‚Äô due to the temperature outside! It wouldn‚Äôt go any lower than 19oC unfortunately, but at least the lowest temperature it would drop to did help. The bathroom was also very nice indeed. A nice sink and a excellent sized shower with good water pressure. We did however see a small ingress of mould in the top corner of the room above the shower cubicle. I don‚Äôt think the extractor fan was working or if it was, it wasn‚Äôt having any noticeable effect. The beds were also comfortable.

Downsides to the room? Firstly, it‚Äôs quite small and there really wasn‚Äôt much space around the beds (it was split into a twin as per our request) and the view was basically of other buildings and fans. However in a place like London, you don‚Äôt exactly spend all day in a hotel room - so it was fine for our own purposes. The fans did produce a small amount of background noise overnight but not necessarily to the point it was overbearing or noisy. I did sleep quite well. 

The reception and small bar area directly off that are beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and I really liked the addition of newspapers. The staff welcomed us just about every time we were either entering or leaving the building also. I do like little touches like that and in a place like this, I would expect it. 

The only disappointing aspect we found about the hotel during our two days/nights in general was the overall experience at breakfast. Not the quality of the products, but we found the general experience to be chaotic. It‚Äôs all self-service (not something we‚Äôre used to in this price bracket - then again, we don‚Äôt often come to London) and the breakfast room itself felt claustrophobic, with too many tables and chairs squeezed together. Also due to the limited space, if you‚Äôre in a party of more than two people as we were, we did find ourselves having to sit on the same table as other residents. I have never experienced this in any hotel I‚Äôve stayed at before. Ideally, the room needs to be around twice it‚Äôs current size - but maybe there‚Äôs nothing that can be done due to building restrictions. Overall whilst the food was fine, we didn‚Äôt enjoy the experience on either morning we were there.

I‚Äôd happily stay here again if I return to the area as overall I had no major issue with the hotel barring breakfast. Everything else I‚Äôd happily rate as the four stars the hotel has been rated as.",4,2016,08,19
104,"BEST PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON, GREAT LOCATION, AFFORDABLE, AND HIGH LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. THANKS SAKAR AND TEAM","i have stayed at this hotel numerous of times, first stayed here in 2012. Each and every time my guests and I stay here, the service has always been immaculate. The rooms are all very nice and modern, with free wifi throughout the hotel, flat screen TV'S with freeview channels, as well as screen mirroring with your phone works too, some of the rooms extending across two floors with kitchen and living room on one floor and bedroom upstairs..This changes the perception of Hotel Living. Cleanliness in the rooms is of a high standard and should you want to request anything; the staff are more than happy to assist.
location is perfect for anyone who needs to stay in West London, with Paddington aND Edgware road stations close by, and car parking is available, very close to A40 and M4.
Upon arrival, the doormen are more than willing to help, even taking bags to room,even though we persist to do it ourselves. smiles all around even before we walk in to the hotel. 
SAKAR is an awesome addition to the team, he was ever so helpful and considerate to our needs and any requests we needed. upon arrival at the reception desk, it was speedy check in, then off to a restaurant and bar, recommended by Sakar. 
More importantly,Sakar and the team will defo remember your faces and any requirements you have.
this hotel will always be my first choice when searching for a night or more stay. i have checked out every morning and was happy and highly satisfied with the choice of hotel.

Kudos to Sakar and his team.

see you soon and many more times to come.",5,2016,08,19

The breakfast buffet and the bar is always well stocked! 

The rooms are always clean and provide a welcoming and calming environment! 

I most certainly will make this my home in London! ",5,2016,08,17

Again, location is massively important for me therefore the hotel ticks all the right boxes as proximity to Paddington is ideal.

104,Amazing Location ,"Visited with my 2 friends when down from Glasgow this week. Generally a very good stay!

Pro's 
- Central location. 5 minutes walk to Paddington tube station
- friendly staff. Very attentive and willing to help

- room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels given 
- Free Wifi 

Con's 

- breakfast was a bit of a shambles. Food was average but poorly organised with staff being very unorganised & unsure

Generally a good stay in London. Hotel had an absolutely fabulous location and I would recommend. ",4,2016,08,14
104,Sakar And Adriana ,"Good service friendly relations which the guest. Good service overall. 

I hardly spent time at the hotel but do spend time at the bar and reception. The staff I was bummed into was extremely helpful and friendly and as a matter of fact all staff members are polite . 
These guys have helped me with maps , booking restaurant and city attraction information. 
Thanks guys .

The location is not bad , pretty convenient to get around . 
Room is small but nice and cold bed just the way I liked it . 
It's got a window where I get to see outside. 
The only bad points in my room is my bathroom tiny !!!!!!!!!!!

I know have anymore to say but yes I will surely be back to this hotel when I am back in London . 

Thank you so much ",5,2016,08,13

Buffet breakfast was reasonably priced.

The location was central and the staff were very helpful and polite. 
In all it was a great city break for my husband and I. 
And we'll be visiting again soon.",5,2016,08,12
104,Thank you Sakar ,"Cannot thank Sakar and the friendly team at Park Grand enough. Our rooms are fantastic, and we were upgraded to the duplex which I highly recommend 
Great location too
Beds are extremely comfortable and the bathroom roomy and clean with lovely clean robes and slippers
Loads of comp bits and bobs in the bathroom ",5,2016,08,12
104,"Bumps in the night, freak fire alarms & mysterious light switches","Generally speaking this hotel does do the job. It has a renovated appearance, the rooms have a nice decor and it doesn't look run down. The bathroom are small but very nice and the bed was rather comfortable. The girl at reception was lovely and accommodating... So far so good... 

BUT.. Unfortunately I was put in a room in the basement. It still had a window but this seemed to be the walkway for all things utility related.. The noise from the street was already quite loud but the constant moving around by staff members through this walkway along with the loud conversations they were having at all times of the day & night was unbearable! And when it wasn't the walkway every time of my neighbours opened or closed a door, It sounded like someone was trying to tear through the wall.

When I went to bed it was rather peculiar because I couldn't find one of the light switches. I tried every switch in the room, some of which did nothing, but the light above the bed was still on. In the end I decided just to remove the key card out of it ""power socket""

I then almost fell out of my bed when the smoke alarm in my room went off for 10secs at 6:30am for no apparent reason and then again at 9am. 

So all in all I think I may have just had w bit of bad luck.. If you do stay at this hotel ask for a room on one of the upper floors!",3,2016,08,11

When i reached , it exceeded my expectations.  A warm friendly lucian helped me with my bags as soon as i got out of car and when i approached reception an overwhelmingly greetings from Adriana . She swiftly checked into rokm 820 single . 
When i saw the room it was small and i went back to reception again and requested her to speak to the manager .
Then i was approached by a very handsome professional smart man Mr Sakar . He explained me what catagory of room i booked and advised me to upgrade into a double room . I was showed various rooms and was a bit unhappy paying ulgrade charge . However i was offered a compact double room 203 with small amount.  
I am very haply with my room . Spacious,  sper clean , bed is very ideal for my back which was good and shower pressure is something i am very pleased.  
Again restaurants serve breakfast which is good and Mr Anthony is very helpful and 
Friendly.  
I highly recommend this hotel as it ticks all the boxes and centrally located to explore london or should i say it in the very heart of this magical Kingdom.

104,Best hotel in London and fantastic manager ,All staff very friendly and welcoming. Sakar and Adrianna were particularly helpful and ensured we had a comfortable stay. Great location to get around London and has safe parking outside the hotel of you're driving in. ,5,2016,08,06
104,Small boutique hotel chain in a great location with friendly staff,"Having to work in London on a weekly basis for my current project i have over time moved away from the large chain hotels to the Shaftesbury Group and in particular this hotel.  It is in a great location with easy access to transport links as well as open spaces in Hyde Park and Kenssington Gardens, and plenty of international cuisine in the many local restaurants.

Front of house staff are friendly and always keen to be of service, in particular Sakar, Sylvia and Lucian always greet me by name and make me feel welcome.

Whilst the rooms are small they are typical of the room size in London, well laid out and always scrupulously clean.",5,2016,08,05
104,Wonderful find!,"I have been looking for a great and decently priced hotel near Paddington to connect to Heathrow and I believe I have found it!  A quick walk from Paddington Station (and all flat and no stairs or escalators).  Beautiful older building, and they have done it up very nicely - keeping the character with modern charm and conveniences.

I had an early morning arrival at Heathrow, so arrived at the hotel prior to check-in time.  The receptionist who greeted me, and all the staff were so very welcoming and told me they would have a room ready in an hour or so, and went into the bar area and they made me a wonderful latte.

In less than an hour they had a club room ready for me.  I had joined the club when I booked the hotel on the website.  I do not know what the non-club rooms are like but I was very impressed with the room, especially considering the rate I had received on their website.

The room had two levels, so the bedroom and bathroom were downstairs and the sitting area and sink and microwave, safe and cupboard were upstairs.  There was a TV upstairs and another downstairs.

The bathroom was small but functional and there was enough room in the compact area.  Shower had a rain head and a handheld shower.  Water pressure was great and the water would get nice and hot.  There were many different toiletries and a separate shampoo and conditioner.  Toothbrush, toothpaste.  Wonderful.  Only downside (and completely minor) was the towels were on the smallish side.

Upstairs the tea and coffee making facilities together with milk and biscuits were great and fresh fruit and sodas.

The air conditioning was a little warm for me, but there was a window to a balcony area and I loved having the window open - great fresh air and very little road noise could be heard although I faced the road and was on the first floor (room #124 - great room!)

The location was close the tube station of Lancaster Gate, as well as Paddington.  Felt very safe in the area walking and great Indian restaurant.

Next morning went downstairs to the basement (via the stairs which were very easy to walk) for the breakfast.  Great spread and efficient service.

And now the only thing that marred this other than fantastic experience.  I asked a taxi to take me to my next hotel which was in the Belgrave area, and this is the e-mail I sent to the car company and I hope the hotel considers the policy of not calling black cabs.

"" I asked for a taxi this morning (around 11am) to take me from my hotel, Park Grand London Hyde Park to Belgrade Road.  I was quoted a price of GBP17, and the receptionist checked the car would be able to get me there due to the bike rice that was going on in London.  When I got into the car the driver informed me that he had been told I wanted to go to Belgravia Square and if I wanted to go to Belgrave Road it would cost me extra ‚Äì I clarified GBP20 would be sufficient.

The driver was unable to drive me past Hyde Park and radioed into the base and they told him to return me to the hotel.  The driver then told me he would drop him at a tube station ‚Äì I would have been fine to go back to the hotel and walk to Paddington Station (which is what I had done with my luggage the day before).  We agreed he would drive me to Earl‚Äôs Court Station as I needed access to get my luggage to the tube station but he announced the traffic was too busy so he dropped me off about 13 minute walk to the station.  I asked him if GBP10 would cover the fare and he told me it was the same price as GBP20 which I paid him and got the receipt.  I have since ascertained from other people that the fare should have been in the range of GBP 6-7.

Since I know the driver called in to say he was not delivering me to my destination I suspect you do not condone his action of charging me nearly three times the appropriate amount.  I wanted to ensure you understand that I am plan on reporting the incident.""

So with the warning of requesting a black cab and not the car service they use, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, and will be back for my next trip when I am looking for a hotel near Paddington.",5,2016,08,04
104,Fantastic Hotel with Great Staff ,"A regular visitor at London Hyde Park hotel and what great hotel it is! The hotel is just a short walk from Paddington station, with great amenities surrounding it. The rooms are always clean and well presented and have everything you'll need. The air conditioning is fantastic on a hot humid day!

The staff are the biggest asset of the hotel and provide a sincerely welcoming environment for all guests! During my time staying at this hotel, I have never been let down. 

",5,2016,08,04
104,Great Hotel next to Paddington,"This is my second visit to this hotel this year and it continues to improve !  Now they have free mobile phones in each room that have Internet access, free local calls and free calls to several other counties (although the quality of the voice calls isn't great). 

Last time I got a single room and although the it was very, very small (although very comfortable) and this time I got a double room (still small, but very live able). 

Pros: just around the corner from Paddington Station, walking distance to places like Portabello Road and Hyde Park, very clean, breakfast included in rates, great front desk staff!!!

Cons: staff in the breakfast area very slow and unresponsive, coffee can double as motor oil...

I will definitely return next time I'm in town. 

",4,2016,08,04
104,Fantastic location,"The location of this hotel was fantastic with bus and tube stations close by. The front reception staff as well as any staff you came across in the hall ways and of course the doormen were all very friendly and courteous and professional in their role. The rooms were snug but there was  good hanging space and luggage racks available in rooms. There was tea & coffee facilities in the room as well as a bar downstairs. There was a small fridge in the room (which during our travels was not always the case). The rooms were also air conditioned, which was appreciated as we travelled to London when they had a few very warm days. I really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it.",5,2016,08,02
104,"""City View"" rooms with NO view!","There was NO city view as advertised on Hotels.com under the room description
Room was clean
Staff was friendly
Room was beyond TINY even for London

This is definitely a budget hotel.  You are not getting a deal - you are getting what you pay for with their ""discounted"" prices.",3,2016,08,02
104,Average,"We arrived at this hotel at just past 3pm, having read we could check in from 2pm, to find that our room wasn't ready.  We were told it would be half an hour and they offered us a complementary drink in the bar, however it turned out only to be 5 minutes in the end so no biggie.

The room - we booked a Club room for ¬£198, it wasn't worth it.  Although the actual room was large, with a downstairs and an upstairs, there wasn't anywhere to sit with a mirror to get ready, it was also advised that the room had robes, which it didn't, and the floor was very creeky.  The bed itself was very comfortable, with good pillows, however this doesn't help when you are woken up by people walking around as it isn't very sound proof.

The bathroom - tiny!  For a large room the bathroom was ridiculously small, I couldn't stand it in with my arms stretched out.  On the plus side the shower was very good, but there is no room to comforbtably stand and dry yourself afterwards, and whilst on the subject of drying yourself the towels were awful.  They were very small (me and my husband are average size) and they were very old, one of them had a hole in.

The room was however very clean, so no complaints on that side.

We were supposed to have breakfast included, however when we went down for breakfast we were told it wasn't included.  We spoke to reception who quickly sorted this and gave us breakfast anyway.

The bar - we ordered a panini each and a bottle of wine for lunch, the panini took ages to arrive, and when it did mine wasn't what I ordered, and the wine was barely drinkable.  We did complain about this and the staff refunded us.

Saving graces for this hotel, the cleanliness and the customer service.  Out of everything the staff were amazing, so polite and helpful, nothing was ever too much trouble.",3,2016,08,02
104,Excellent hotel,Top quality hotel. Stayed one night back in 2010  as wanted to surprise my boyfriend. Got resally good last minute deal through booking.com and paid only 65L. Room very comfortable and clean. Not too big but we were happy as we only needed it for a sleepover. Clean and modern bathroom . Location is just great,5,2016,08,01
104,Sakar you have again made our stay pleasurable ,"I have been staying at this hotel since last year with my boyfriend and it has always exceeded my expectation. 
From front desk to restaurant and housekeeping team .
Each and every member of staff we came across were extremely helpful and the manager here Mr Sakar always goes out of his way . 
He books us into various romantic restaurants and clubs and his recommendation has always been the best .
I am from Germany myself and I never had this kind of hospitality in my life ...
Rooms are clean equipped with comfortable furniture,  very comfortable bed and good size bathrooms. 
Hotel is in a central location in london and it's a very good base to explore all attractions. 
We love strolling in Hyde Park on the morning and it's only few minutes away. 
I recommend this hotel to all travellers visiting london and good value for money too .",5,2016,07,31

It took a little time to find a reasonable priced place in that would accommodate us . Sakar at the reception been helpful while check-in and he gave us a very comfortable upgraded duplex room 121 . It's was very spacious , super comfy bed and modern . 
This hotel is in a very nice location of Paddington area . Short walking distance to Hyde Park and underground stations . We had a breakfast included in our package but never been up early . So can't comment on that but we had an amazing time and would back in a heartbeat . 
I would like to thank Sakar and all his team . 
Thank you very much . ",5,2016,07,31
104,"Great location, wonderful staff!","We stayed there for 7 days after the apartment we had rented fell through. The staff were friendly and helpful. They did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable. When we returned each day from sight seeing we were greeted with smiles and asked how our day had been. The rooms were comfortable and clean and had air conditioning . We really appreciated the free cell phone with GPS to use during our stay, it was very helpful. Thank you for making us feel so welcome after a bad start to our vacation Sauya, Pavel, Secar, Adriana, Dajar, and Lucian. I don't know when we will be in London again but we would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,30

I checked in yesterday with Sanya & even though she said my room would not be ready until another 45 minutes, she made it happen and had me in my room in 5. Short walk from Paddington station with direct route to London Heathrow airport. Room was typical European size room, but quite comfortable and clean. I did not realize I would have a TV as well as a ""handy"" cell phone where I could use during the day for telephone calls, map locations,GPS guides and no extra cost. Staff is very friendly and interested in hearing about my excursions for the day. Great value for the price. Will definitely stay again!",4,2016,07,29
104,Thanks you Sakar and Adriana ,"We have had a brilliant stay. The staff has been very friendly and the service overall was very nice. The food was very nice 
Hotel is near Paddington stations and very good area with lots and lots of satires . 
I would like to thanks Mr Sakar and Miss Adriana . That really made our stay stress free . I will recommend this place to all my friends and family and I will be back to this hotel only in future as it feels like home . ",5,2016,07,29
104,Thank you Sakar ,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights . 
I was very happy with my stay . Everything was perfect. Hotel is located near the padding ton station and Hyde park .

104,Mr.Ravi Dasondi  is star of The Park grand London Hyde Hotel,"Ravi Dasondi and Ivan 
They helped me and my girlfriend find our Hotel when we got lost in the night of London.

Really good people and outstanding service, very helpful.

My girlfriend become scared and tired and these guys got her calm by ordering a taxi to our Hotel for free. 

Offered something to drink in the meentime we waited for our taxi. 

Really got us calm.

Kind people.

Good service ",5,2016,07,27
104,"Acceptable, If it's just for two nights","What a disappointing surprise, when I entered my room on 1st Floor. Well, actually I shouldn't call it a room as it was small like a middle cabin on a container ship, although the bath room was exactly providing what's needed. Bad thing to me was, if you need to work, given space in this kind of room wasn't enough at all and there's not really a Lobby or Bar you can sit down. But hey, if the prices are going up on high season, you might be happy that this Hotel is just 5 minutes away from Paddington Station. So if you take Heathrow Express, you can arrive within 30 minutes from there.",3,2016,07,26
104,No rooms again from this hotel chain,"A shaftesbury group hotel again with the same excuses apparently. Based on my 100% failure rate with this group do not expect to actually stay in this hotel! As this is the best in the group im unlikely to be happy with what im paying for!

104,Lovely stay in London,We had a lovely stay in the Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel. Everyone there was so hospitable. The breakfast was delicious and a great way to start the day. Our family room with two double beds worked great for our family of four with two teenagers. Great location as well. We would be happy to return.,5,2016,07,23
104,Ravi Dasondi is star for the park grand london hotel,Ravi Dasondi and Zain have been absolutely fantastic. I work in customer services and the level of service I received was world class. I arrived late and my booking had been cancelled due to my own fault as the card I used didn't have sufficient funds but that didnt faze Ravi and zain... wht a couple of stars.. I stay regularly at hotels around the country and I can say with full honesty that my stay at Park Grand London Hyde park is the finest and all credit is due to Ravi and his fellow attendant Zain.,5,2016,07,21
104,Solo trip - was ok,Staff was pleasant and accommodating but the single room is tiny. Bathroom and shower are also really small. The water pressure was great! I was disappointed. Also an unusual thing is they charge the whole amount for the room up front and you have to call your travel agent if you want to adjust the length of your stay (even when you have a nightly rate) with cancellation. It was a little challenging since the travel agent was in another country. I switched hotels after a night as I was expecting something bigger. ,3,2016,07,20
104,Great Hotel,"Terrific location just three or so blocks from Paddington Station.  Very professional staff with terrific customer service.  They greeted us after a long trip from the U.S. with great courtesy and allowed us to check into our room several hours early and also stored our bags while we explored London.  The breakfast is excellent, but can get crowded so you may have to wait a bit.  The room was spacious for London, well appointed, and the air conditioning and internet were great.  Our only complaint was a fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night because one of the guests somewhere in the hotel had a smoke.... would be nice if that would not wake the whole hotel.  But otherwise, highly recommended.",5,2016,07,20
104,Miss Adriana and Mr Sakar,"I was recommended this hotel by my friend . 
I stayed here for 7 nights . I overall very happy with my stay . Can't complain anything. 
All staff are very friendly and especially Miss Adriana,  Mr Sakar and Mr Lucian .
I am so thankful that they helped me to buy my Samsung S7 from John lewis and they also helped me to fix my broken phone .
Hotel is very central in London . 
I will be visiting again .
",5,2016,07,19
104,Ideal location for Hyde Park.,"Stayed at this hotel with my daughter as we were going to BST . The hotel is ideally situated for this.
On arrival we were told our room wasn't ready so we waited , we were offered a beverage whilst waiting and the staff were extremely apologetic. The reception staff told us our room was ready but on entering the room it was still being made up so back to reception we went wait. After about 10 mins the room was ready and to make up for the wait the hotel offered us a bottle of wine on the house - nice touch.
The room itself wasn't big infact quite snug ( i booked a deluxe double!) but was clean and tidy. having paid in excess of ¬£160 for the room I don't think it was really value for money, you can hear the next door room chatting and it was little noisy.
Tea and coffee facilities are in the room but on opening the milk pods the next morning they were all off and solid so we skipped a morning brew.
Despite the hiccups the hotel is nicely situated and easy to find. I maybe would stay here again if i got a better deal on the price.
The staff were all polite and extremely helpful.",4,2016,07,18
104,Near Paddington,10 minute walk from Paddington in quite a nice area this is a modernised hotel with a small bar area serving a small selection of dishes. Nice restaurant area and very warmly received by all staff. A good alternative sat price wise in between the 4 star chain hotels and the many 2 star ones you probably don't want to stay at.,4,2016,07,17
104,Average rooms with lack of facilities and old windows,"I normally don,t leave negative feedback but i would have to for this time because my problem was really annoying and it made my journey a bit unpleasant.
I stayed in room 502 with my family member and we came to know that we can not close the windows of our room, A boy ""staff member"" came around 1:30  who was sent by front desk said I can not fix this so you would have to compromise with this for today.
we did manage day time but it was realy noisy later in the night and we requsted again to do something, anohter indian guy adel came and made a couple of hard attempts, finnaly he closed it. we complained him as well that morning guy did not fix it and left us to compromise for the whole day. all day we were left with the noise of road traffic, but thanks to adel who made our night compfortable.",3,2016,07,15
104,Good situated hotel close to London Paddington,"I am regularly staying at that hotel during my business trips. It's well situated near Paddington station, it is the perfect starting point for sight seeing as well as business trips. 
Sakar and his colleagues are always very friendly and helpful and help every guest to have a pleasant stay.

I really can recommend that one ",4,2016,07,15
104,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"Having had to find hotel in last minute for two nights , I choose this hotel . Wan not sure what to expect ??? 
I book it randomly. When we arrived been greeted with warm smile and checked in to a nice room in sixth floor 611 . 
Room small but clean and not too great view but the positive part is spotless clean place and super friendly staff . Breakfast is a plus point . 
I loved everything about this hotel despite the fact they had small rooms . Special mention sakar who help me and my wife with all information. 
Hotel is short distance walk from paddington station and hyde park and plenty of eateries around . 
We highly recommend this place . ",5,2016,07,14
104,Value for money for the location ,"I booked this hotel after searching the area around Hyde Park and it stood out as great value for money! 
The pictures online didn't reflect the hotel room we were allocated at all. 

We were put in a basement room with the view (and the sound) of a loud generator. The room was basic and small. 

Most of the staff were friendly and helpful (on reception) but when we ordered room service after a full on day of walking around the city, we were told they were sold out of hot food but we could have crisps! After waiting an hour I called reception and the guy on the desk said 'I am extremely busy, can you come and get it yourself?' 

Obviously not quite the response we had expected! We refused and he finally bought it to our room... 

Breakfasts were nice but not enough tables to cater for the amount of people, so we had to share on the first morning. Not particularly a negative thing but sometimes nice to have space to eat. 

On check out we were asked how the stay was and I was honest and mentioned all that had happened and we were refunded the cost of our room service. 

All in all a cheap and cheerful place, despite some hiccups. 

",3,2016,07,13
104,Holiday in London ,"I have been visiting London for number of times as a leisure , business and holiday . 
I have had good and bad experience staying at several hotels in London . 
But now in park grand London Hyde , myself and all my family had lovely times . 
All staff here from front desk to housekeeping team to restaurant teams are very helpful . Everyone is very polite , smiling and very respectful to their guest . 
Whatever we ask noting too much trouble for them . 
Hotel is very convenient location and easy access to anywhere in London . 
Therefore I recommend this hotel to all travelers  and most importantly I would like to mention Mr Sakar and Ms Sanya for everything , you guys are great host . ",5,2016,07,13
104,Average stay - hotel is tired!,"I stayed for 1 night very last minute last Tuesday

When i checked in I had room 407 on the 4th floor which had 2 double beds. The window was completely broken - half of it was just leaning up against the frame and could be lifted out - i was in such a rush to get out I left it in the comfort that nobody could climb up to the 4th floor! I did inform them when i returned that night 

Room was clean and there was a good selection of shampoo etc in the bathroom

My one disappointment was the smell of the sheets which didn't smell very fresh. They were clean but smelt quite musky

The room was in excess of ¬£160 for a night so there is a level of expectation and i'm not sure it lived up to it for me. I arrived back at 12am and there was a fair amount of noise, the walls must be quite thin as I could hear someone talking on the phone for a while

The staff were helpful especially the man on reception when I arrived back and he got me a bottle of water to take to my room, as was the lady when I arrived that booked my taxi and the young chap in the morning that helped me get a taxi from the road.",4,2016,07,10
104,Very nice hotel,"We stayed here with 2 friends for 2 nights whilst attending the BST festival in Hyde Park and we were all pleasantly surprised given the price we had paid.

We had a quad room which had a bathroom and living room/studio on the ground floor with a sofa bed and kitchenette and a queen sized bed on a mezzanine level upstairs.
The room was spotless and very well equipped with two flatscreen TV's, aircon, iron and ironing board, hair dryer etc.
It was very nicely decorated and furnished.
The staff were all pleasant and helpful and insisted on carrying our cases on arrival and departure.

The location is good, just a 5 minute walk to Paddington Station and the bus stops for the sightseeing tours.

The only negatives (and the reasons I cant given 5 stars):

The sofa bed is not a double bed, more of a 3/4 bed so although this was a room for 4 adults, 2 of them have to enjoy 'spooning'. 

There is no wardrobe upstairs on the mezzanine level, only a minor thing though as we hung our clothes along the supports for the railings.

The hotel bar has ridiculously uncomfortable seats and it closes at 11pm, but there is a pub just down the road so no major issue.

Breakfast was very good, although a little 'herby'. (Herbs on the sliced potatoes, herbs in the sausage) Bit strange for breakfast but overall very good.
We didn't eat here in the evening as the menu has just a choice of 3 different curries or a salad. Nothing else! How strange. 

READ THE SMALL PRINT!!
Our friend booked this for us on her credit card which she rarely uses and didn't take it with her on the trip. When we went to check in they asked to see it. She explained she hadn't brought that card, but had all of her ID and other bank cards etc. But they insisted they had to see the card. The payment had been made in full at the time of booking so we asked why they now needed the card again and they said it was to check her signature. We pointed out that her signature is on her drivers license and her other cards but he then said it was incase she cancelled her payment. When we explained that the payment had been made 4 months ago and therefore it was out of the cooling off period he said he still needed to see the card for himself.
We offered to video call her husband so he could see it over the phone but he said no to this option too.
Having travelled from Sheffield (and it was now 10pm) we were not in a position to go home and collect it so the only option he gave was to credit the original card for the booking and then charge it to a card that was present. Then in the morning we could speak to the manager who would credit the new card and charge it back to the original card. Seriously! Bare in mind a credit will take 4 working days to appear but a charge is instant that is highly inconvenient!
Apparently it is stated in the small print that the card must be present.
How you would go on if this was booked on a works credit card or the trip was booked as a gift for someone I have no idea.

And finally the room was really really hot and the bathroom was unbearably so. There was an AC unit in the room although it didn't work very well and just recirculated the warm air. Even with the windows open it was uncomfortable. 

Despite these negatives I wouldn't rule out staying here again as we liked the room layout, the location, the price and the good service from the staff. I wouldn't stay here and pay full price though because of the reasons I have mentioned, but as we got this room at a bargain price we were happy overall. ",3,2016,07,10
104,Not really a four star hotel,"We stayed here on 2nd July 16, in a room on the 6th floor. The decor was tired, ripped and scratched wallpaper with dark furniture. The bathroom was so small, a large person would not be able to sit on the toilet as the sink was so close. The shower leaked more water from the pipe than the shower head. The finish to the decoration is poor and the windows are a mess. I appreciate that its an old building but taking this into account, the paintwork was still a mess. 

The picture makes it look like the hotel is a large grand place but in reality it is not. The 1 lift is slow ans impracticable. Breakfast, although cooked well was basic with no choice- scrambled eggs or no eggs, smoked bacon and make your own toast. We went down to breakfast on Sunday to be told that there was no room for us and we'd have to wait. There is a very limited evening meal service and the bar is small to say the least. One couple ordered a bottle of wine from room service and after a 30 minute wait was told that they were too busy to deliver it and if they wanted it, they'd have to fetch it! 

However, that said, the reception staff were very pleasant and check in/out was efficient and a quiet room was provided as requested. I would not rate this hotel as a satisfactory 3 star at the the most. Location is good for paddington/hyde park, oxford street etc.",3,2016,07,10
104,First time at Park Grand ,"I've never been to London before . It's my first trip and I must say this city is one of the best place and multicultural society .

And now this hotel park grand , it's absolutely amazing , rooms are nice , very clean place and staff are extremely helpful . Nothing ever is too much of trouble . All staff assisted me with every thing , I cannot complain with one little things . 
I would like to thanks Sakar for his kindness , hospitality and all his team for making my stay pleasurable . 
I highly recommend this place .  ",5,2016,07,08
104,"Hotel is good, the staff is the best","It was indeed a great stay. There are some really some very very friendly staff like Sakar, Adriana, Lucian and Pavel. Though I was not so much impressed when I checked in, the staff at the hotel made the difference. Their cordial behaviour, their assisting nature on everything, their help in everything made a huge difference in the stay. If at all I want to recommend this place, instead of all the good thing that it offers, it is the staff. Great stay, great place. I would truly recommend this place to anyone.

104,Great stay!,"After a trip to London for work I decided to stay a couple of extra days and chose the Park Grand London.  The hotel staff was wonderful and kind, the location just a quick walk from paddington and the hotel was safe and quiet at night

Would definitely recommend to other solo travelers as the price was great!",5,2016,07,04
104,Location is the best thing everything else is poor,"Location to Paddington and Hyde park great and that's it!
Booked as a last minute secret hotel, and I can safely say that had this not been a top secret hotel we'd have never booked it! 
The cost at ¬£150 would have got us a lot more else where, the room was up 2 flights of stairs, the 1st was acceptable the second set I can only describe as stairs you'd have going to a budget attics conversion. The room was small, bed may have been firm a decade ago, and the bathroom, you could sit on the toilet and actually put your head in the sink they where so close together. In need of a lot of renovation as looking very tired and dated now.",2,2016,07,04
104,Great Home Base in London for a Family,"Our family of four (children ages 11 and 9) stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park for 5 nights.  We really enjoyed our stay and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a room for 4 in a good, quiet location in London.  

The Room: 
We booked a Superior Quad (two queens) but we were offered the Superior Duplex upon arrival.  I am so happy we were able to stay in the duplex room!  It was two floors with a main floor consisting of a small kitchenette, very small bathroom, a fold out couch, a closet, and a desk.  The loft area had a king size bed and a wardrobe.  This room had a LOT of space for our family of four and it was nice to have a separate sleeping area for the adults and kids.  The kitchenette was nice and supplied with a tea kettle and coffee/tea supplies along with some snacks.  The room was always very clean.  The bathroom was tiny but the shower was great...great water pressure and plenty of hot water.  The fold out couch is small, so would probably only work for smaller children if you have more than one but it fit our needs fine.  The room had gorgeous two-story windows that could open for fresh air.  There is an air conditioner in the room, too, as well as floor heaters for the bathroom.  

The location: 
Great quiet street with pretty buildings around.  An 8 minute walk to Paddington Station and 7 minute to Lancaster Gate, so many Tube lines available close by.  Hyde Park is very close and there are many restaurants nearby.  We enjoyed being a little bit off the beaten path to get away from the crowds of London, but still able to get anywhere in the city quickly. 

Service: 
Very friendly, helpful staff.  They quickly made our room available after we checked in.  Helpful with the bags and always attentive if we requested more towels or anything.  

Food: 
There is a restaurant in the basement that serves a nice breakfast buffet.  We didn't know about it until our 3rd morning (make sure to ask if it's included in your room rate...it was in ours but we didn't know!).  

Overall we really enjoyed this place.  I would recommend it as a reasonably priced hotel for families.  It was hard for me to find rooms that would accommodate 4 people at  good rate and this hotel fit that bill.  It is NOT at the level of a four-star property like the Four Seasons, but it was clean, convenient, spacious, and met or exceeded all of our expectations. 

Only cons...our room smelled so strongly of air freshener or cleaners every day.  Better than a ""bad"" smell, but they need to throttle back on the air freshener.  Also, was disappointed about missing out on 2 days of free breakfast b/c no one told us about it.  Be sure to ask!",5,2016,07,04
104,Perfect ,"Well done to Sakar, Lucian and Adriana who as usual gave me a warm welcome. Nothing is too much trouble.
The rooms are clean good value and the service is top class
The breakfasts are also worth ordering.
I keep coming back because there's no point going elsewhere

104,excellent hotel,We stayed one night at this hotel whilst attending an event in Hyde park. The hotel is in ideal walking distance from the park - about 20 mins. The welcome on arrival was really good. Easy check in too. Our room was extremely comfortable. King sized bed and good bathroom. Breakfast was excellent. I would stay here again.,5,2016,07,03
104,Amazing Staff and Lovely Services,"The hotel is good and is very near to Paddington Station as we arrived from Edinburgh, Scotland and wanted to be near some station. The staff is very kind and supportive specially Sakar and Adriana who made are holidays wonderful by helping us in many ways as this was our first visit to London.",5,2016,07,03
104,Park Grand is Grand due to ADRIANA AND SAKAR ,"We stayed here for one week. The location of the hotel is great, close to Hyde Park and very close to paddington station that connects with all London! You can find different small restaurants and coffee houses close to the hotel. The hotel is clean and nice and the personnel is very friendly and nice. Enjoy your stay!!

104,"Miss  Adriana , Mr Sakar and Mr Lucian","I stayed here with my wife three nights . 
This is my third visit at Park Grand . 
The reason I am back to this hotel is due to a friendly , welcoming and professional staff . 
As soon as we arrive , Lucian is out there to help with our bags and when we got to reception Mr Sakar and Miss  Adriana is welcoming with our names with a very warm smiles . Checking in is swift and was given a very spacious rooms as always . I loved their breakfast , it's simply delicious,  perfectly cooked and fresh and on the top of that service is excellent.

104,Lovely weekend,"We stayed as a family at the Park Grand Hotel Hyde park. Staff were extremely helpful, nothing was too much for them, breakfast was good, the eating room was a little small but not a problem. It was in an excellent location for us, close to Paddington station. The room was clean, beds comfortable and we had a great family weekend. Would book again.",5,2016,07,02
104,Very good,"The hotel is good, and the rooms are also ok. The internet works perfectly and is very quick (good for job travel). People are very kind and polite, especially Sakar was very corteous and helped me at finding things in London when I had some organization trouble at work.",5,2016,07,02
104,Typical London hotel close to Paddington station,"As our booking at Grand Paddington was tuned down and we were transferred to this hotel. Close to Paddington station in an up mid level residential area. A typical London hotel. Our room (a quad) was in two floors and actually suited for four people, if you discount the tiny bathroom. Lots of electrical sockets!",3,2016,06,29
104,"Park ""good for what it is"" London Hyde Park","This Park Grand London came up as the lowest priced room in a search for a hotel near Paddington Station.  I needed to take the 05:10 London Express to Heathrow.  For that purpose I recommend the hotel.  With an easy, 10 minute walk (or 5 GBP Uber ride) to Paddington and a 15 minute train to LHR, guests may have a faster transit to check-in for their flight than people staying at the much more expensive airport hotels.

""Grand"" is an optimistic moniker.  ""Good for what it is"",""acceptable"", or ""cheap and cheerful"" are more accurate.

What's good?
- Proximity to Paddington Station 
- Updated, clean bathroom with good water pressure in the shower
- Attractive price
- Friendly front desk staff.  My rate included breakfast and they packed me a to-go bag of fruit and yogurt because of my early departure.

What's a disappointment?
- Lumpy bed.  This is what knocks my review from 4 to 3 stars.  

What isn't surprising, but you should consider?
- Tiny room (I had the lowest price tier).  With outstretched arms I was less than a meter from touching the two closest walls simultaneously.  This isn't the type of room where a guest will feel comfortable passing time.
- Tiny bathroom.  The toilet is squeezed between a wall and the shower so tightly that my shoulder hit the wall. 

If the Park Grand London continues to offer aggressive pricing, I recommend them as a smart choice for a short night's stay before catching a morning train from Paddington.",3,2016,06,28
104,Nice place close to Paddington,"Nice room, very tiny, in particular a very nice bathroom, great beds, but the window did not shut properly and the furniture is a bit unstable. Also, nice and prompt service. Location not far from Paddington Station.",4,2016,06,27
104,Really Nice Place ,"Very nice and clean rooms great service. Excelent location.
 I st√•yed here for Three nights , was checked into a spacious room which exceeded my expectations . Reasonable Price for London hotels . 
Especially i would like to thank Sakar , Lucian and Adriana . 
Without hesitation i Will ve back . ",5,2016,06,25
104,One of my best stays in London,"Park Grand London Hyde Park located in Central London's Paddington area is a nice a cozy hotel at an affordable rate. Excellent location and more than that hospitality by all staff members is something which you usually do not see in busy and sometimes not so busy London hotels. Special mention of Gurdeep Singh, Front Office Manager who took special care for needs while during stay. Must compliment his friendly and helpful attitude which made the stay much more enjoyable. A great feature techno this time was that the hotel gave a phone to each guest with free internet access and international calls! Overall a great stay.",4,2016,06,23
104,Good location and warm welcoming staff,"I stayed for just over a week . 
I thoroughly enjoyed my time here at this hotel . Room is very spacious , clean and mordern . Breakfast at this hotel was very yummy . And 
Staff are extremely helpful especial mention ADRIANA , SAKAR , DARJA and LUCIAN always there to help me with anything . 
I will be back soon guys 
Thanks ",5,2016,06,22
104,A good hotel in a convenient location with great staff. ,"This hotel is comfortable and well appointed.

The two girls who were on reception were incredibly polite and helpful. Darija & Adriana are superb
We were given a complimentary upgrade. Breakfast was tasty and served on time.  This hotel even supplies a complimentary smart phone",5,2016,06,21
104,First class hotel.,I stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel several times over the past year. The service and hospitality offered by the hotel's staff and management have been second to none. The breakfast has been significantly improved and the rooms have always been spotless and comfortable. Mr Sakar and Mr Gurdeep always do their very best to fulfil their guests' expectations.,5,2016,06,20
104,Exceeded expectations,"Hotel exceeded my expectations. Room was new and modern, as well as all the hotel facilities. Breakfast was probably the best part with a really good full English breakfast plus continental options. Liked the free smartphone option, even though I did not use it. Prices a bit above average... Keep up the good work!",5,2016,06,19
104,Perfectly located with great staff,Catching the Heathrow Flyer to Paddington station and then walking the short walk down the tree lined Westbourne Street was a welcome to this hotel. The staff were fantastic and extremely helpful. Unfortunately our room was small made more difficult because it was split level with the ensuite up a few steps. The room was clean with limited hanging space. Location was a short walk to Craven street with its many restaurants. We enjoyed breakfast at Raffles in Craven St.,3,2016,06,19
104,Very good service ,"Arrived for business . The secretary ordered a small room. The night shift manager Ravi dasondi was very helpfull and proffessional assisting us
Until we solved the problem
The hotel is located very close to paddington
Breakfast is good

104,Amazing experience at the Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel,"I stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel for a few nights and it really has been excellent - so much so I extended my stay whilst there. There really are no faults - room service has been impeccable and has assisted me beyond what I ever expected. Special mention has to go to the very friendly Sakar, who actually upgraded my room (not once, but twice to a duplex!) at no extra cost after realising I was 6ft 2 and staying in the single. If that isn't five star service I don't know what is. The rooms themselves are kept very clean and come with a large flatscreen television in each one, and are beautifully laid out and furnished. Every day my room was made to an excellent standard. Free wifi usually is a concern - I have found in most hotels I have stayed in the speed has been poor and I have often been charged a premium to have internet fast enough to be useful. Here, the speed was extremely fast - I never experienced any issues at all. The hotel is very conveniently located just a short walk from Paddington tube station and Hyde Park on a beautiful London street. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in London. You really shouldn't have any doubts about coming here - 5 star experience for a great price. ",5,2016,06,14
104,Would have been great but the initial night was horrible.,"The Parrk Grand is a good hotel, location is great, the rooms are ok for London and the staff in general is friendly. 
I actually enjoyed the time I DID spend there, rooms were clean with nice amenities and having a club room allowed me good pace to work and even prepare my own food had I wanted to.
My major problem was the horrible experience I had when I arrived at the hotel; despite the fact that I had let the hotel know I would arrive late - and they promising me that a room would be available, when I reached the hotel I was told there is no room, and that they could find me no replacement room anywhere. The local staff tried to assist but the hotel-chain management asked them to ask me to default (i.e., go out without a place to sleep) and cancel at 3:30 am. I was very angry of course, and local Night Manager (Rani) did his utmost to help, finally finding a place to stay the night.
If it weren't for this ordeal I would have said the hotel was excellent, but as they are at the mercy of the Chain's laws - this reduces the score.",4,2016,06,13
104,Small hotel reasonable rooms,I stayed here for a recent visit to Lords cricket ground the hotel was 1.4 miles from the ground but it was a nice walk through Maida Vale and little Venice the hotel was small and there was no electric on in the room but it was soon sorted out.The room was a twin and the beds were very comfy but the bathroom was a little on the small side but clean enough there was restaurants within a 5 minute walk and only 5 minutes to Hyde park so it was a good central location ,3,2016,06,11
104,Shaftesbury Hotels Group,"Simply put the shaftsburys hotels group in London is highly recommended for its simplicity,quality and service.The key element is also usually price and a big thing called location with most of the hotels within distance of each other and in the same area.Its perfect and within 25mins of all interests and directions into central London,So access is perfect.Hotels are very nice and clean and value wise is brilliant, considering a lot of London is ridiculously expensive.Hotels offer breakfast and daily house keeping which was also part of the excellent service.Check in and check out was simple and quick.Some of the hotels also offer a nice little bar,A nice little touch for get to know and quietness and a sign off.Cant speak highly enough and will now probably always use these hotels for the rest of my London trips in life ! To all the cool staff,Keep up the good work,See you all soon again :)",4,2016,06,10
104,"Great hotel, great location, great service!",I have stayed here a few times now with friends for a London weekend down from Glasgow.

104,Not even worthy of 2*,"Booked this for a fairly cheap rate on last minute, thinking we'd bagged a bargain for a ""4* luxury hotel""
I can tell you now there was nothing luxurious about this hotel. 
First of all we arrived about half an hour before the official ""check in"" time. Upon entering, the lobby felt a little bit shabby and run down and the lady who checked us in looked a bit bored! We asked if it was possible to check in slightly early to which we were told no as the room was not yet ready. No problem, we asked to leave the luggage and I enquired about using a toilet. The lady directed me through some doors and immediately on walking into the corridor that housed the loo I was hit with a VERY strong smell of curry. Assumed this was just because it was near to restaurant so went on my way. The public toilet was not the cleanest of conditions. 
We popped out and then arrived back a few hours later to check in. The man at the desk looked bemused when we asked for our bag back but thankfully another friendly man stepped in and retrieved our bag. We were pointed to our room on the 6th floor and told to take the lift. Arrived at our room and figured out that smell of curry was not only carried on the ground floor but 6 floors up too! We weren't expecting grand things for our ""deluxe double room"" bearing in mind the price but the small size seriously shocked me! The bedroom area just about squeezed in a double and a small desk. The window was open but the room just smelt stale with a hint of curry. Immediately we were struck by a loud whirring noise, like an extractor fan but once I'd been to the loo (could lean on the bath whilst sitting on loo! No room to swing a cat!) and we'd hung up our clothes (decent sized wardrobe) the noise stopped so we thought no more of it. I did however find a single hair on the bed cover but chose to give benefit of the doubt when I found no more rogue hairs. We then went out for the rest of the evening. We arrived back at the hotel relatively late, shattered from a 13 mile walk around London and went straight up to our room. Got into bed and fell asleep.  We were both woken a short time afterwards by extremely loud banging and scraping of furniture above us. We thought we were on the top floor so who knows where it was coming from but this went on and off for a couple of hours. Fell back to sleep again only to be woken up again by the whirring fan noise starting up again, VERY LOUDLY!! we were so tired and by this point it was so late that quite frankly we just wanted morning to come so we could leave. We got up early and straight away went to the bathroom - which now stunk of stale smoke. Neither my husband nor I smoke so can only think it was coming from the room next to us. We got ready quickly and made our way downstairs. We informed the desk lady about our issues to which she asked why we didn't ring in the night. I explained that I didn't want to be traipsing through corridors moving rooms at 3am in my pjs! She looked bemused by this and said ""well sorry but I can't do anything then."" We didn't want anything but just an apology or at least look genuinely concerned at the issues we raised but she was just mildly confused and impatient for us to leave. Which we did..... Gladly!!!",1,2016,06,05

104,Mr Legend Sakar ,"My girlfriend booked us a room for the night at the Grand Park hotel in Hyde park . I would throughly recommend staying here, the staff are fantastic the facilities are very good ,  the room was lovely, the breakfast was very good also .I would most definitely come back here again ,we are currently planning our next stay here at the end if the month. ",5,2016,06,03
104,Deluxe Double Room... Really? Really? You sure?,"I booked this hotel, as I had surprised my wife with tickets to see The Lion King (Highly recommended). I looked at images on various booking agents, and opted for a deluxe double as they appeared nicer than a bog standard double. The room was not cheap by any means, so my expectations were high. It is a 4 star hotel after all.
We sent a request to the hotel asking if it would be possible to check in early as check in was from 14:00 hours. Our show was to start at 14:30 hours. They didn't respond. I was travelling up to the hotel and phoned them, asking about the possibility of an early check in, advising the young lady on the phone that I had previously sent a request, which was ignored. I was advised that it wouldn't be possible. But we could leave our luggage. Fine I didn't have a problem with that.
After the show we returned to the hotel to check in and get changed for an evening on the town. Check in was painless and up to our room we went.
We were on the 6th floor, and found our room easily. 
On entering our room I was flabbergasted. It was large enough to fit a double bed in, and a small amount of room to move about the bed. The ensuite shower room was so tiny that after using the facilities that it provided, you couldn't actually get dry in the room and had to step out into the main room to towel off. The toilet was fitted in between a wall and the end of the shower unit. I could not easily use it, and had to stand at a jaunty angle in order to fit my shoulders in the space.
This room was so small that I was expecting George Clarke to appear to film an episode of amazing spaces.
I phoned down to query the room allocation, as I explained I had booked a deluxe double and this appeared to be a single with a double bed in. I was spoken to by the man on the phone as though I was stupid. Telling me to refer back to my booking through Booking.com and look at the photos of a deluxe double, and that it would show the room we're in. I did that you pretentious service engineer , and guess what? It wasn't the same room. The fruit basket promised in the booking turned out to be an apple and pear on a plate cling filmed.
I was also advised that there are no larger rooms that I could be moved to and this in fact was one of the largest. Now I don't mind most things, but I hate being lied to. All you had to do is look at the fire alarm map and instructions to see the room next to mine was larger, and that went for quite a few on our floor. 
Now in the spirit of fairness I will try to give a balanced review, even though I was lied to. The room was clean, and well stocked with tea coffee etc. The small fridge in the cupboard was heating the cupboard nicely but wasn't effective at keeping a bottle of water chilled. The windows were old and didn't fit or close properly. They weren't double glazed, so it was quite noisy. 
My wife informed me that she got up in the night to use the loo, (now i'm of average height) but she had to move my feet from hanging over the bed so she could get past.
I have registered my disgust with the hotel and have since been offered a discount for a future stay. Believe me when I say that won't be getting used, as I will never stay in this hotel again. I would like to know who issued a 4 star to this property.",2,2016,06,01
104,Ear plugs .,"My gf decided on a last minute break to London and having looked on lastminute.com she chose this four star hotel near Paddington station .

On the booking site the pictures of the rooms looked pretty good .

The reception is good and staff friendly and polite we got given our room key which was number m3 which was at the back of the hotel overlooking a little courtyard. 

The room was quite small and the bathroom even smaller just enough room for one person at a time with a little shower .

The bed was fine but a little short for anyone over 6,2 .
The room had a small fridge and a large TV 

My one really complaint was the large AC units on the ground in the little courtyard that were on all the time so we were unable to keep the window open as they were loud and even annoying with the window closed.  

I would have given a higher score but due to the small room and fan noise I think a score of two is fair for this room .

104,Mr Sakar and Mr Lucian great team ,"I was here with my family as a birthday stay of my wife . 
We booked a three room family suites . We had a fantastic time. The management went out of their way to make our stay special. They really 'pushed the boat' out for us and couldn't do any more. Very clean rooms and a great breakfast. 
Mr Sakar thank you very much you are a fantastic host . ",5,2016,05,30
104,The grimbliest of hotels,"A long review, but I would suggest reading if you are thinking of staying here.
I booked this hotel, as we were lucky enough to be going on the Flying Scotsman from Paddington station early Saturday morning. We thought it best to stay at a hotel near the station rather than risk getting stuck in traffic or tube delays and get a good nights sleep before our early start.
When we arrived there were three members of staff behind the counter. There was one member of staff dealing with a family one side, with two staff members behind the other. Noone spoke to us as we approached. I lingered in front of the two staff members and waited. My husband then went to get something from the car leaving me to check in, when he returned they had still not spoken to me. Eventually the female member of staff (who had been free the whole time) said hello to me and checked us in. I paid the ¬£20 parking charge, and informed we would likely be back around 10pm for the car (give or take) due to our trip. She said we would have to pay a further ¬£10 for this. I realise it is private property and they can charge what they like, but the car park was by no means full (and wasn‚Äôt when we left either), so seems a bit unnecessary to fleece your customer for further money when no one else would have been parked there anyway. We asked for a quiet room, as we wanted an early night as we had an early start. We were told we had been given an upgrade, so we were thinking we had lucked out there ‚Äì we have been lucky enough to have this happen at a couple of hotels before and got an amazing room then.
We left the check in desk to find our room on the first floor. There was no pleasantries of ‚ÄúIf you just head to the right, you can take the elevator to the first floor‚Ä¶‚Äù or similar, just handed the card and left to it. We arrived at our room, and it absolutely stank. It smelt as though someone had eaten Indian takeout in the room and left the half eaten containers in there all night . We later noticed in the lift they didn‚Äôt do meals as such, but served a couple of currys in the bar so we must have been very near the kitchen and the smell was just going straight into our room. As anyone that‚Äôs ever cooked curry or other strong smelling food knows, it gets all in your clothes and just doesn‚Äôt go until they are washed, so not nice for our fresh things we had brought with us. We had the same in the morning with the cooked breakfast smelling in our room.
The room itself was very small and very shabby ‚Äì I have no idea what a standard room looked like if this was an upgrade! The paper was coming off the walls in places, the door frames were all peeling, the wardrobe was so wonky it was surprising it was still standing. We had a small main room with double bed and bathroom, with an open doorway into another part of the room which was slightly bigger than the size of a double bed with a double bed in (I guess this was the only difference with the upgrade part). There were a few hairs on the bedding ‚Äì as we were lucky enough to have the two duvets in there, we slept on one and put one over us. In the spirit of a fair review, they did smell clean like washing powder.
When we went to go to sleep, we realised that you could hear the elevator going up and down. So much for a ‚Äúquiet room‚Äù. I saw in other people‚Äôs reviews there had been a mention of an unknown generator stopping and starting ‚Äì this is what that noise is. Our room was near to the elevator and I imagine that any room near to the elevator would be able to hear it to as it was very loud (so be wary of that on each floor).  This is unbearably annoying.
Just as there had been a gap in the elevator noise at about midnight and we were drifting off, the LED reading lights next to the beds started flickering on their own, despite being off. They are very bright lights and light up the whole room. We called down to reception to get someone to help from our room phone and got no answer. I then called the hotel from my mobile, and someone answered almost straight away ‚Äì very strange. I explained the problem and was told someone would be right up. 5 minutes went by, and still no one came (the elevator is 1 meter from reception on the ground floor, our room is first door out of the elevator so a 30 second trip‚Ä¶). I called again and was assured someone was on their way. After another 5-10 minutes, my husband got dressed and went downstairs. He found 3 members of staff standing around having a chat (no customers were there). He asked if someone was actually coming up to our room, and one of the staff members pointed to another and said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs now coming‚Äù, and that staff member followed my husband up. He turned the lights on and off about 10 times and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. We said we needed to go to sleep as we had to be up early ‚Äì he said he would get someone else. Another man then came back with him and spent some time looking at them further. After about 20 minutes of fiddling with them, I suggested about putting tape over the LEDs, and he sent the first guy back down for tape. We were then back to listening to elevator noise but at least not with strobe lighting.
In the morning upon checking out, we asked if they had some sort of good nights sleep policy ‚Äì I see this advertised for some hotels, and have never had to enquire about it before. However given that the man checking us out had been fiddling around in our room at past midnight, they didn‚Äôt really need further proof that we had a bad nights sleep! He said that he didn‚Äôt know of anything so couldn‚Äôt do anything.
So to sum up, this is an absolutely appalling excuse for a hotel. I cannot believe that it is described as ‚Äúluxury‚Äù on the website. From other reviews (the better ones being the reason I booked), I am wondering whether either some rooms are vastly different to others, or whether some of the people staying here just think this is a normal London price for a shabby hotel (it‚Äôs not!!!). Usually if we are just wanting a base in London, we will stay at a Holiday Inn Express (so happy to stay at a clean, basic hotel). If we want something more luxurious, we go to the Brewery at the Montcalm (near Barbican). The Montcalm is a similar price for a really luxurious hotel ‚Äì if this is what you are looking for, I would recommend the Montcalm. I am so glad we could leave after one night, and would strongly suggest people look elsewhere for somewhere to stay ‚Äì you have been warned.",1,2016,05,29
104,Most welcoming hospitality received from the management Mr sakar,"OK we stayed here for 7 nights with my friends in a twin room and a single .
Upon arrival we were given a twin room in fourth floor .
I didn't liked that layout and requested manager to show me more rooms .
Mr sakar went out his way and showed us various rooms . We choose room 806 .was very spacious and lovely but down side was bed close to each other .
We request him to move apart .
He informed us that housekeeping left for the day as it was 9.30pm .
But no issue himself and Lucian managed to sort out bed . 
Everything we asked for not too much for them .
From booking a ticket of bus tour to restaurants reservations .
Darja at the front desk helped us with maps and London attractions .
Overall hotel is in perfect location .
Lots of restaurant nearby and train station too .

104,Great value and comfort. Excellent location ,ÎàáLocation of the hotel was excellent. We had arrived earlier than the check-in time and our rooms were not ready. The staff provided us an upgraded room that really helped us. The standard rooms are small but cosy and comfortable. We were provided prepaid smartphones to help us get around London which turned out to be a great boon! Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,05,28
104,Comfortable Stay !!,"We stayed here for 4 nights in their duplex suite a good option for 3 or more occupants. The room was comfortable with all the amenities  you expect. Bathroom is a bit small but then thats for most hotels in London.
The area is full of hotels next to each other all looked pretty much the same from outside.The hotel is located 5-7 minutes walk from Paddinton Station n Underground. Lots of places to eat there.
The staff at the hotel was very helpful from the ladies at the reception to the bellboy. We were even given a menu of a few restaurants that provided free delivery to hotel incase of a late night dinner. Breakfast at the hotel is good.

Overall good value for money !!",5,2016,05,28
104,A nice boutigue Hotel near Paddington,"This hotel is few minutes away from Paddington station and restaurants, very clean friendly staff and Free WIFI access. We booked Deluxe room and found it very small for a couple - unable to fit the luggages in the room and the bathroom was very small. But fortunately we got an upgrade which was good. Ask for room in higher floors to have any view of outside (first couple of floors will be facing the nearby walls or roof).  In overall it was good value for money as we just wanted a clean place to crash at night. Will go back next time.",4,2016,05,27

104,Four stars? Luxury?,"Having already stayed in a lot of different hotels in London (different parts of London, different chains...) and having read through the reviews on this one, I decided to give it a go.
I agree with the overall comments on cleanliness, friendliness of reception staff, luggage storage, room size (and can't comment on breakfast/bar service..). It's a good hotel, in a good location..I just can't get my head around why this is supposed to be a four star hotel, that's tagged ""luxury""?!
I would be expecting better quality (e.g. of bed, bedding, sheets, towels) for four stars, larger rooms, better sound proofing etc.
Would be staying here again - no doubt.",4,2016,05,25
104,Perfect!!!,"My husband and I stayed here with our baby for two nights and loved every minute of our stay! Staff are so helpful and friendly, nothing was a problem! Room was perfect, very clean, had tea and coffee, kettle, fresh towels! The bed was so cosy and comfortable. Drinks in the bar were reasonable priced. The hotel has got storage to look after your bags until your ready to collect them. There was always staff around to help us with our pram. The location is perfect as you can walk to all the attractions. Harrods was only 40mins walk through the park and Oxford street was on 20mins walk away! Staying at this hotel my our city break even more enjoyable and perfect! We would stay here again on our next London break!",5,2016,05,24
104,Good location for the night,"We booked the hotel on a last minute deal so it wasn't overly expensive, especially considering the convenient location.

It was an easy walk from Paddington or Lancaster Gate tube stations so getting anywhere in London is a doddle. Hyde Park is also a very easy walk down the road if you fancy getting away from the hustle and bustle for a bit.

Upon arriving I couldn't help feeling that the place could just do with a bit of doing up. Not exactly run down but not just refurbished either.

Reception were friendly and even checked if our room was ok with a courtesy call.

The room was a bit on the small side, a deluxe double, with a smallish double bed and what felt like duvet, especially during the night when there didn't seem to be enough for us both. The bed was comfortable though, and the air con worked well. 

The room had everything you need, tv, tea and coffee facilities, toiletries etc. Unfortunately the decoration didn't appear to be finished to a professional standard. For example, missing grouting, messy paintwork. I couldn't argue with the cleanliness though.

For a 4 star hotel I would expect a better finish and little things like better quality toiletries, towels' and bedding. Together they can make a bit of a difference.

After a good nights' sleep checkout was quick and easy.

Overall I wouldn't complain at staying again but hope that the little touches can be made to make the place as good as the service.",3,2016,05,22
104,Sakar is the best host ,"Stayed 5 nights which included breakfast

104,"Amazing staff, immaculate room","All the hotel staff were immediately very friendly and attentive. Upon entry we were greeted by manager Sakar and were offered free drinks courtesy of himself, served and poured, making us feel very welcomed and cared for. He was very talkative and friendly and as there was a slight complication with our room, he upgraded us and gave us a complimentary breakfast all free of charge. We stayed in room 202 and the room was immaculate,  the beds were incr4edibly comfortable and the large walk in shower was very refreshing. Would gladly stay here again anytime and would recommend it to anyone. Very clean and smartly presented throughout",5,2016,05,20
104,"Convenient,clean, amazing staff","Stayed for 3 nights . Clean compact and very convenient for airport, Eurostar and London sights.  Good breakfast.Staff were very friendly and amazingly helpful, they really made our short stay very special.",5,2016,05,18
104,Great rooms and great service,"Lovely, welcoming and helpful service from all staff especially Adriana and Sakar. Very comfortable and well equipped rooms. My girlfriend and I couldn't have asked for more. It's great to find such a lovely hotel in such a useful and central location. We will be using this hotel again.",5,2016,05,15
104,"Good location, lovely staff","Had booked this hotel for 3 nights, 2 nights in the beginning and one at a gap of few days.

It is a very well located hotel as it's just 2-3mins walking distance from Paddington station.

I reached the hotel at 8:00 AM, way before the check-in time and requested for an early check-in. I was provided a first floor room immediately. Booked a single bed room, it is slightly small in size with limited space to walk around but with a comfortable bed.

I must say staff is very polite and friendly and quite helpful.

When I checked-in the second time I was given a room in the ground floor, though the same room type this room was comparatively smaller in size and slightly cramped.

If you don't leave a 'dont disturb' tag outside your room, it will be cleaned ...so no tag means room cleaning, which I didn't know about as mostly you have to leave a -  'clean the room tag' outside your room. Had left all my stuff outside and bag open with some cash inside, when I returned was worried after seeing the room made up, but was relieved as everything including cash was intact.

2nd time room had leaking shower area...
Hotel had very very limited breakfast options.

I think the room size and limited breakfast option has to do with the tariff as it comparatively lower than others of the same catagory in the area.

I would suggest don't take rooms on the ground floor as they r noisy and smaller than the ones on the other floor.

All the shortcomings are overshadowed by the honest, helpful, friendly and cooperative staff.",3,2016,05,13
104,Average ,"We booked through secret escapes where it was listed as a 4 star hotel, it definitely wasn't. The location is great, really useful for exploring that part of London, but the room was small, considering we stayed in a junior suite, it had two double beds but I would have preferred a bigger room, the furniture had all scratches over it, it whist wasn't what we expected. However it was ok for a night in the city. ",3,2016,05,13

104,"Tiny single room, not even an ironing board",Pictures presented by this property are misleading and the rooms are much smaller than you see on their website. No room even for an ironing board and bed was quite uncomfortable as well. The only positive was that it was close to Paddington Station but there are better options for a bit higher price.,2,2016,05,09

During our stay, I am so pleased about everything in this hotel-- the rooms, the amenities, the food, and especially the staff. I still remain to my previous word; the kind of service I received from the front desk receptionist, Ravi Dasondi, was exceptional. Either you're having a problem with your door keycard or you need a cab to go somewhere, just go to the front desk and everything that you wish will be granted.

104,Great Location and Service,"The Park Grand London Hyde Park hotel is very conveniently located close to Paddington train station, where you have quick access to Heathrow airport and the London underground tube. The hotel is on a street of row houses, some of which are still private residences. 
I was greeted at the front door by the hotels doorman, who helped me with my luggage. The receptionist was very friendly and I was helped very quickly. I stayed in room 405, a single bedroom. It was not large, but not small either.
There was water and apples in the room. The room also contains a coffee maker and cookies were provided each day. The bed was firm, but comfortable. and the entire room was very clean. The wi-fi reception was excellent throughout the hotel.
I booked on the hotels website and the rate included breakfast. It was a buffet style and included both hot and cold items. There was a much bigger selection than I expected and the servers were always there to help if anything was needed.
I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone needed a place to stay in London.",5,2016,05,07
104,Highly recommended ,"Booked this for one night with a work colleague. Was very impressed with everything. Rooms were clean and spacious. Bathroom was very nice - bit small but clean and a brillian shower. Breakfast was great as well with a huge choice of cooked and continental. Location is excellent for exploring London and the best part was the price. For central London it was excellent value. Will probably stay here again and is ideal for business or leisure.
Tip - book online direct with the hotel. I saved nearly ¬£50 for 2 rooms when i compared to prices on other sites.",5,2016,05,06

104,We highly recommend Park Grand London Hyde Park in London with Sakar and Adriana as your hosts,"We highly recommend that when you come to London, that you visit the Park Grand London Hyde Park hotel.  Very rarely when you travel do you feel comfortable in your surroundings right away. The hotel is on a beautiful tree-lined street just around the corner from Paddington station.  This inviting hotel is centrally located for exploring all parts of London via tube, bus, or train.  From the moment we walked into the Park Grand London Hyde Park, we were greeted warmly. When you meet them, you will agree with us that Sakar and Adriana will go out of their way to ensure that you have everything that you need while their guest. You can tell that they truly care that you have a high quality experience under their care.  Our check-in process was very quick, and our trip to our room was a pleasant experience as the bell person answered our questions about the hotel and assorted London sites. The rooms have high ceilings and are very clean. The beds provide a good night‚Äôs sleep. The lounges are very nice with a very relaxed feeling, making it easy to sit there and read the free newspaper or a favorite book. The elevator is very clean, fast, and quiet.  The breakfast each morning includes everything in a typical English Breakfast plus cereals, yogurt, fruits, croissants, a wonderful selection of jams, plus much more. The breakfast atmosphere is also warm and friendly in a good size room with fresh flowers on the tables. There is no sense of urgency at any time in this hotel. The staff are there to help you unwind and relax; when it is time to go out into London, they are ready to help you with a map and clear, concise instructions. The hotel is within walking distance of Paddington train station, around ten minutes. Restaurants and shops are on the way to Paddington on the Craven Road route. The first time we arrived, we took a taxi cab from Paddington Station because of our suitcases. The taxi cab fare was under five pounds sterling, and the cab driver got us there within five minutes. Inside of Paddington train station may be found the entrance to the London tube, so this hotel is ideally located for us when we want to go into any part of London.  Paddington station is on the yellow circle line, which intersects with others at easy transition points.  Even walking from Paddington station in the early evening hours, we felt safe.  Again, we highly recommend this hotel because of our positive experiences in it for eight nights in a row.",5,2016,05,01
104,Best of London,"This is a great chain of hotels, every time I come to London I stay here. The room size is great for London and they always upgrade me if an upgrade is available, the rooms are clean and the staff very helpful.

It's positioned in a great location, near Paddington station with Hyde Park not too far away. The staff are welcoming and helpful which makes the stay ever more satisfying. In the surrounding area there are great restaurants and pubs. The double rooms are comfortable and spacious, I would gladly stay for more than one night. There is plenty of choice for breakfast of well prepared food. I don't have a bad thing to say about it other than that I have been unable to stay for multiple nights to experience the hotel for longer.",4,2016,04,28

The location  wasn't that far from shops and public transportations (4-minute walk to Paddington station) too, making it accessible for travellers like us. The main highlight of the hotel, in my opinion, would be the service from the staff especially from the front desk receptionist, Ravi Dasondi, who accommodated us beautifully. He's really kind and hospitable-- he fully explained every question that we have in our minds. Really really good and very world-class. Hands down!",5,2016,04,25

The single room I was given was very small and not nice at all. The bathroom was so tiny that I had to step into  the room to towel-dry! I have been in many hotels world wide, but never experienced this small bathroom. Furthermore, I booked a hotel room with ""city view"", however my  view was directly into the ventilators  ( see picture)  and it was on same level as reception. It was raining most of the night and the rain hitting the ventilator made a drumming noise. Not good for sleep at all! There are a lot of restaurants and pubs in the area and it is not expensive area. I stayed only one night and would not have spent one more night in this room. I do not know how the other rooms looked like, however I was very disappointed. Furthermore this is no a 4 star hotel, more like a 3 star.",3,2016,04,25

Nice seating areas with little kitchenette, microwave, fridge, sofa , big flat screen TV in one level and on other level huge comfortable bed .
It was a very luxurious room. 
Miss Adriana even called in our room to make sure we liked it ü§ó. When we came downstairs heading for WICKED musicals 
Mr sakar recommended a signor sassi 
( Italian restaurant) located in Knights bridge . That was very delicious and fantastic recommendation . He even booked us a VIP Mercedes-Benz their private hire to Victoria.  We felt very special and that was top notch drive , can't beat it .
We were overwhelmed with the service received from Ms Adriana and Mr Sakar. 
Didn't  spend much time in a hotel and their restaurants.  So can't comment on that . Loved their breakfast that costs  ¬£10 per head . Attentive staff and very polite waitress and sorry I forgot to Catch name of restaurants mangers, he was very helpful with our request . 
Hotel is located in a great location plenty of bars , restaurants and only few minutes away from Paddington station . Good to know that they have car parking facilities on site ¬£20 per night.

Close to Paddington station and other undergrounds. Excellent breakfast.  Staff are friendly, helpful and always willing to help. ",5,2016,04,13
104,Good staff Sakar,Great friendly staff. Close to paddington train station. Comfortable room. II stayed here for 7 nights. The staff answered and helped all questions. Shops and great resturaunts close by. I will be using this hotel everytime i am in london. Thank you Sakar for making my stay memorable.,5,2016,04,11
104,London ,"Good hotel and Nice rooms. Comfortable beds and bathrooms, bath tubs are also an option. Kind and friendly staff. Always helpful at any time of the day. 
Close to central London, tube station near by.
Defo choosing this hotel the next time we come to London. 
Will reconmend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to London. A good hotel for a very reasonable price.",5,2016,04,11
104,Customer service at its best ,"After booking and paying for  2 night stay in a double room here through a 3rd party booking service, we arrived only to find the hotel had no double rooms available and the other company had made a mistake..just one of the few dramas we had at the start of our weekend away! Adriana on reception was lovely very apologetic (even though it wasn't the hotels mistake) and her and the manager Sakar upgraded us to a suite for our stay, and even bought us a drink each in the bar. 
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, it's very comfortable and clean, in a good location and with a lovely breakfast, but I am a big believer in customer service and the little details make a big difference, Sakar called our room that evening to recommend a nice restaurant and then when we returned to our room the next day we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of wine.
We will be returning
Thank you all again ",5,2016,04,11

104,One of the best hotels in london,"first of all the hotel is cheap and the staff are friendly, i like them. Mr. Sakkar and edriana helped me a lot with my stay at that night ..
pros
1- Good prices
2- rooms are clean
3- friendly and helpful staff
4- room are not very small compared with other hotels nearby.
5- there is a coffee and biscuits in the room :)
.. i think i will come again to this hotel",5,2016,04,10
104,Like going home,"I travel to London often, and I always try to include a stay at this hotel.  I certainly feel like an honored quest, and am always treated very well.  My recent stay proved once again a wonderful experience, being greeted so warmly by Sakak and Adriana.  You really get good value for your money here, and and excellent location.  Close to many Underground stations and Paddington Heathrow Express, and walking distance to many interesting parts of London.  I highly recommend this hotel.  An excellent room of theirs are the rooms that are actually like suites, with a kitchen area (microwave, frig, and silverwars) and two floors.",5,2016,04,10
104,Noisiest hotel we've ever visited,"We booked a family room in this hotel for three nights, and found it to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The fact that this is listed as a four star residence is a joke. In comparison to many other 3 & 4 star hotels that we have visited, this is the worst & should be avoided if at all possible. The facilities are extremely basic, the family room is cramped and the storage and hanging space would be more suited to a single room for one resident. Despite paying for a family of four, the room only provides sufficient towels, dressing gowns, toiletries etc for two. The shower is old and lacks pressure, as well as being nigh on impossible to control the temperature. The room decor is tired, with dirty windows, peeling wallpaper and poor lighting.
However, by far the most disappointing aspect of our stay was the incessant noise from the surrounding rooms. Never before have we encountered a hotel with absolutely no sound-proofing. The neighbours on the same floor spent hours on the landing discussing with the night staff how best to apply for residency visas and UK passports. When we asked them to be quiet or to continue elsewhere, the staff member told us that they were handling a complaint. 
The room above created so much noise that on one evening, we were forced to complain. The staff explained that the residents above had several non residential guests in their 'family room' and despite being asked to keep the noise down, were not willing to co-operate. The proposed solution from the night staff was to move us to the other end of the building, rather than to deal with those responsible for the disturbance.
So to summarise, as a location, it's near to Lancaster Gate & Paddington, so ideal as a base for exploring.  Facilities are very basic, 2 star at best. Food is also very basic, self-service breakfast was cold. Noise was appalling, with staff seemingly unable to resolve our concerns. 
If looking for a short-term base to stay, there are literally hundreds of better alternatives.",1,2016,04,09
104,The perfect stay!,"After travelling around Europe for a month we needed a place to stay at in London and the Park Grand London Hyde Park was the perfect location.

The highlight of the stay was the friendly staff who helped us out on a daily basis with trip planning and advice. Special mention to Sakar Adrian who helped us in the last minute to get us to the airport on time!

I'll definitely be back here!",5,2016,04,09
104,In London on business,"The hotel was nice and clean, and good value by London standards. Perfect for a business trip to London. The reception staff were very helpful and polite and happy to assist with any problems. I'd stay there again",4,2016,04,09
104,"Amazing hotel, great staff","We booked our room at the Park Grand last minute and were really happy with our choice. The staff were really friendly from the start, we came back from dinner and mentioned that we had a small room, the people at the desk, Adriana and Sakar, offered us an upgrade free of charge to a larger room. The room was amazing, really clean and spacious. The breakfast was really lovely too.
Thank you so much for an amazing evening!! Will be back again soon!",5,2016,04,09
104,I loved it ,"I stayed here for two nights as my office is at sheldon square  ,  which is few minutes away . Very convenient location near Paddington.

104,Fantastic!!,"I was in London for a fabulous weekend with friends and family and I found this hotel extremely comfortable and clean, it's located at a 5-minute walk to Paddington station and Tube(Circle and District line, the Bakerloo will be closed until mid August) as well as buses to Camden, Liverpool Street etc. The rooms are not very large but cosy and clean, the breakfast good. The reception staff: Sakar, Adriana e Mattia the best I'd ever met in my travels, they have been very useful and kind. This hotel in my opinion has the best value for money in London!",5,2016,04,07
104,Big thank you to the manager and staff,"My self and my family would like to thank Mr. Sakar , Sylvia and the rest of the staff for a wonderful stay at the hotel . We found that the staff and management went out of there way more than expected to rectify a complaint we had . We left very happy and will book our next stay with them . After we experienced some bed linen having fluff I the sheets from the laundry company, we was offered a new room , given excellent service including the use of their luxury taxi and a discount all to make us happy with our stay . It showed their commitment to giving a customer a quality and satisfied stay . Thanks again see you soon ",5,2016,04,07
104,"""ANOTHER AMAZING STAY""","I stayed at this hotel last week with my wife for one night .I cant thank Mr SAKAR and his team enough for such a lovely stay . Having had 5* service delivered each time we stay , i called it HOSPITALITY .
From the moment we arrived staff were friendly, helpful and doorman helped our bags to our room . 
We were upgraded and room was beautiful , clean and spacious. Our bed was made a heart out of rose petals , it was perfect . 
They dont do much of a food in the evening but we love our chicken curry and it was delicious as always . 
Next morning , we  had breakfast  , restaurant is at the basement level . They have variety of pastries , fruit , cereal and choice of various flavored yougart . I must admit love their sausages and freshly cooked bacon and staff are too attentive..
Hotel has a bar next to  reception area . Very chilled out bar area and nicely decorated which serves large choice of drinks . But the only downside is due to their licensing bar shuts at 2300  Which is a bit of pain . 
We also used the room service drinks brought to our room . 
All staff at park grand Hyde park  very friendly , welcoming and always had time to help you with your request . 
They are big assets to the company .
The hotel is well situated with a bus stop and underground station nearby . 
A short walk takes you to Hyde park and towards Paddington station with a lot of varied shops and restaurants eateries for all tastes .. 
We would only choose this hotel  just  to all the staff who made our stay so welcoming ,, especial mention
Mr Sakar . 
Would i recommend ? 10000%  Yes ! 
",5,2016,04,06
104,Best service,"I regularly come to this hotel and what makes it unique is the service. I recently had another wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were all so kind when they discovered it was my birthday that day. In particular the Manager, Sakar went out of his way to make our stay very special. We got upgraded to the duplex room which was extremely spacious and comfortable. 

I very much appreciate the effort made and will certainly be visiting again.",5,2016,04,06
104,overnight stay,"Literally 5 mins walk from Paddington Stn. Good, clean room, despite leaving the bedroom window open a little, did not hear any noise from anywhere. Bedroom was clean, tidy & pleasant surprise to see fresh fruit in the room. Would recommend the hotel",4,2016,04,06
104,Perfect for family,"Hotel is located near the paddington station.we visit here as a family trip and booked for quadple room .rooms are nice and well setup.Gurdeep and Darja very helpful at reception.

Bathrooms are smaller in size but did not bother us .restaurant staff is very helpful including breakfast lady.",5,2016,04,06
104,Messed us about in the middle of the night,"We were checking in late so I called them earlier in the evening confirm our rooms would be held. 

I was told the rooms were held but got some story about maintenance meaning they had to put us in the hotel opposite. Cut a very long story short but when we arrived we were taken to a hotel opposite only to then be told there were no rooms - overbooked - and we would have to go to Notting Hill. Needless to say I have told them what they can do with their rooms and booked into another hotel in Paddington. 

Not good - bad enough overbooking but at least tell people when they call up to check what you have done instead of coming up with stories / messing them about in the middle of the night.",1,2016,04,06
104,Excellent visit,"Upgraded to duplex suite on arrival with my two teenage sons.  This layout worked perfect for us.  Two twins upstairs in a loft area with desk and TV and wardrobe.  Main floor had pull out sofa larger than a twin with fridge and microwave and plasma.  We had plenty of space for suitcases etc.  Very clean, good service.  Breakfast was good, however you can see the frustration on those who arrive post 9am to eat - had to wait.  We chose to skip it one day rather than wait.  Great bacon.  Nice coffee.  Location was perfect, we were on the road and did not have any issues with road noise (and we live in the woods).  Would not hesitate to return or recommend!",5,2016,04,05
104,April 2016,"I need a hotel close to Paddington Station for an early train journey. This hotel is a five minute walk. I had booked a deluxe double for 1 night and this cost ¬£95 and this was worth the money, The bathroom was nice, did miss a bath and the bed was very comfortable. I would stay here again if I need to be close to Paddington. Very impressed",4,2016,04,05
104,short break,"this hotel is great every time we stay here we are treated very very well 
the staff are amazing and can not do enough for you 
the rooms are great 
the breakfast are very good and the choice is fantastic",5,2016,04,04
104,Comfortable stay in London,"The Park Grand London Hyde Park has become ""our"" hotel on our yearly London weekend. It's conveniant, close to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express, and the staff is very friendly and service minded.",4,2016,04,04
104,"Lovely rooms, but it's noisy!","Stayed here for one night, and on arrival I was given an upgraded room. (I think this was due to the fact they forgot to book my room). I was very pleased with my room, as I wasn't expecting 2 floors! The bed was huge, as well as the shower. There was a living room space, and a little kitchen area. I didn't use the bar downstairs or have any food, but I know it was ¬£10 each for breakfast. The only down side I can say was that at night the noise outside on the road flooded the hotel room, as well as noises from people going up and down the stairs in the next room, and just general stomping around... This happened for most of the night.",4,2016,04,03
104,London visit ,"It was fantastic, we stay for one night,The staff was very lovely. The bed was confortable very nice room... Sakar The manager is The best. 
Best confortable bed ever s'est in h√¥tel .

Great location, near Paddington station, great amenities,
Great 5 stars. 
Definite recommendation and will visit again! ",5,2016,04,02
104,My hotel of choice for a business stay when working at Paddington Central,"Staff are very welcoming & helpful - Sakar, Adriana on the desk (and others) & Lucian the doorman who always brings me an iron and anything else I need.  The room service menu is not extensive but the curry is good and easily enough for me when I cant be doing with going out at all - though there are plenty of restaurants not 300m away.",4,2016,03,31
104,Great Hotel,"This hotel was a great place for our family.
Affordable, yet service was that of a 5 star property. The breakfast is awesome, plentiful, lots of selections, great for families and service was spot on.
The entire team went out of the way to make us feel special.",5,2016,03,31
104,Mr Sakar Ms Adriana Mr Lucian ,"Stayed at this hotel 1 night with my mates . 
We had a show award at the Hilton metropole . 
We were greeted by Manager Sakar , Adriana and Lucian with very welcoming and friendly smiles . My room was one level down 004 , which was spacious , good decor and comfortable bed . I am not much a fan of basement room but I did really liked it . 
Bathroom was a bit small . Restaurant serves breakfast which is in same level . 
Close to Paddington. Very close to everywhere to get to in London . 
I would Definately be this hotel when I am back at London again . 
I would recommend this place to all travellers .   ",5,2016,03,31
104,Combat Chef,"What a lovely hotel, great location, excellent rooms and the most friendliest staff I've met during all my stays in London. Sakar was an absolute fantastic host.
Hotel is near Paddington mail line station and plenty of shops and restaurants around the corner .
Good base to explore London .
Thanks Sakar ",5,2016,03,31
104,Meeting,"Great hotel, great staff and treated great. Great location, superb breakfast can highly recommend . 
Room was very comfortable, clean and tidy. Everything you need with in walking distance. Easy access to public transport. 
The hotel manager Sakar is brilliant and very hospitable.
I'll be back",5,2016,03,31
104,Stayed 3 nights,"The room was clean, staff are very nice. I was booked on bed an breakfast but i couldnt use my breakfast at it only start at 7 and i had to leve the hotel by then to be at work 7:30 üòí but beside that very nice stay",4,2016,03,30
104,Didn't sleep for two days - disappointed,"Positives:
- Some reception staff were really helpful and nice
- tv in the room and selection of channels available 

Some of the negatives 
- Didn't sleep because windows too fin (single glaze) and could hear traffic, wind, birds  like the window was open. Bearing in mind when I did the booking I did ask for a quiet room, as we had our little one with us.
- Heating wasn't working and took ages to fix - the duvet was really fin and had to ask for a second duvet
- no information in the room 
- no iron - no hairdryer 
- room had a mini bar - but it was empty 
- Uncomfortable toilet - couldn't sit properly on toilet because the sink was in the way, so had to sit diagonally!! also no shelves to put your things in the bathroom 
- Breakfast - had to wait to be seated on the first day - second day I called before going  for breakfast to reserve a table, when we got down they gave the table away! the breakfast room is really small and we were back to back with other people/really tight spaces - then plates and food would finish very quickly - also not much choice
- one lift in the hotel and waiting for ages to use it - we often gave up and use the stairs (we were on 6th floor!)",2,2016,03,29
104,Brilliant stay! ,"I brought my girlfriend to London for a trip to Harry Potter tours and thought I would add an extra day and take her into London. I chose this hotel for the good location and good reviews and I couldn't be more pleased about it! 
Firstly, we were able to check in nearly 2 hours early after arriving earlier than expected and we were helped by the friendly staff to our room. It was spacious and very clean; excellent value for money. 
The excellent service didn't stop there, we were assisted with parking by Sakar, he was just so helpful and friendly, he really made us feel welcome. Other members of staff whose service stood out were Darja and Lucian. 
All in all I would definitely stay here again, brilliant stay in London for any occasion. ",5,2016,03,29
104,Staff are absolutely amazing ,"I have never been made to feel more welcome and comfortable in a hotel in London. Although the rooms are quite small, once you are greeted by Darja and Sakir, it won't matter. It's been a rainy couple of days and I didn't fancy walking around trying to find food so I had a tasty curry in the bar and a friendly chat with the hotel staff. I will be asking my company to book me in to this hotel the next time I'm in London for sure.",5,2016,03,29
104,Hidden gem,"This was the first time I stayed there. I am a very loyal customer, but when loyalty is not rewarded in a place, I move on. The Park Grand will definitely profit from my change, as my stay there was absolutely pleasant. I learned on the website that there are more than one Park Grand in various locations. This one was excellent for me and I probably will choose it again. The hotel itself is rather small, but that is no disadvantage. Lobby is big enough, the elevator could be bigger (two adult and luggage is OK), but all in all very fine. The only two things that I wanted to mention are: the breakfast room - it is almost a hotel-law in London, that breakfast rooms are in the cellar, or basement. I am not a big fan of that because I'd prefer daylight with my coffee. Breakfast is quite alright, everything you might wish for, except space. Tables are so closely put together that you can't even pass when no one is sitting there. The other thing is, as good as the room itself was, the bathroom was very small, tiny really. But it is a modern bathroom, great shower. Nevertheless, both things are no reason to give less than five stars.",5,2016,03,29
104,Nice hotel. ,"We stayed here with our 2 children (aged 9 & 4) during the February half term holiday, we booked a superior quad room which was a fantastic size for the price we payed, it had 2 double beds, tea & coffee making facilities, free wifi, our room was at the back of the hotel so it was really quite, the hotel is on quite a busy road so I can imagine the rooms at the front being a little noisy. 

The only down side to the room was the size of the bathroom, it was tiny which made it a little difficult when my 4 year old was in the shower. 

The breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice and the staff in the hotel were very helpful. 

I would defiantly book to stay here again. ",4,2016,03,29
104,Weekend visit ,"Turned up and was treated my the by host we've ever met  sakar made us welcome and helped us through our visit . We highly recommend  this hotel down to sakar and his team ,rooms are excellent and modern with an excellent bathroom and comfy beds. 
",5,2016,03,28
104,Great Stay - Awesome service,"We stayed at Park Grand London Hyde Park for 4 nights. The hotel is centrally located with easy access to train stations and bus stops. Beds are very comfortable and the bathroom facilities are reasonably good. However the best part of our stay was the excellent service we received from the hotel staff. That made our stay in London a very pleasant experience. 
I would like to especially mention 
Mr Sakar , Ms Darja and Mr Lucian for fantastic service . 
Thank you very much

After some confusion and being sent from hotel to hotel we finally ended up in the park grand hotel, the staff was very welcoming and mr sakar who made sure we had the best time ever... The hotel is very convenient to all tourist attractions and edgeware road. 
A Big Fat thank you to Mr Sakar for accomdating us abd making our stay memorable . Will be back 
Thank you ",5,2016,03,28
104,"smallest room, but terrific staff","for a ""club"" bi-level room, which was technically an upgraded room, it was tiny.  the bathroom barely had enough room for one.  the layout was also incredibly strange...  but the bed was ridiculously comfortable, and after a long day of travel and walking around, it was more than welcome.  location of the hotel was also very convenient.  about 5 minutes walk from the paddington station, with an overabundance of dining choices.  i do definitely have to say a word about the staff, they were absolutely amazing.  from the moment we walked in, to the moment we walked out, they made up for any shortcomings the room may have had.  next time in london, we'll definitely considering staying here again.",3,2016,03,27
104,Amazing stay !!,Recently stayed at the Park grand hotel after a mix up with booking.com put us into an unavailable room. The hotel was still able to accommodate us making our stay exceptional. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable  especially Sakar and Adriana! and even offered a complementary breakfast even though it wasn't their mistake. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone as very central to Edgeware Rd and other tourist attractions.,5,2016,03,27
104,Disappointing stay,"Two night stay in a 'Deluxe' room, well the room was 6"" wide than the bed so my wife had to edge sideways just to get to her side of the bed while minding her head on the wall mounted TV. the room was so small we had to put the suitcase behind the front door and move it every time we went in or out.
Both nights we endured broken sleep as the doors weren't fitted with soft closers so there was a loud bang EVERY time someone went in of out of their room.
And to top it all when we went for breakfast it was too busy so we were asked to go back to our room and they would call us when it was our turn, the call never came so we went back 30 mins later to be told they tried to call us 4 times, like hell you did!
On check out when we were asked if we enjoyed are stay we explain but were made to feel it was our fault! She did give us an email address to complain and ask for discount on our next stay, as if we would visit this hotel again!",3,2016,03,27
104,London holiday,"This hotel was amazing! The staff were extremely kind and caring, especially the manager, sakar, he looked after us, and showcased all the tourist hotspots and sights to see. The rooms were very clean and spacious, and the morning breakfast was delightful. The location was perfect, as many food places and sites were nearby. An all round amazing hotel, 10/10!
",5,2016,03,27
104,London stay,"Booked with booking. Com was messed about and left with no where to stay. Came to park grand hotel and the staff were brilliant especially the manager sakar whom offered me and my brothers a room straight away without any hassle and he made sure our stay was the best possible. Would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone the rooms, shower and restaurant was brilliant. There was also a fridge in the room and ac. 
I will be back ",5,2016,03,27
104,amazing place to stay. Great manager Sakar!!,"Good rooms. Amazing staff especially sakar.
Location was really good. Breakfast in the morning was amazing!
Really liked the staff. Lucien, silvia, anthony all of them were great!

104,Really friendly manager sakar and comfortable facilities,We had an amazing stay here over 2 times during december and the manager Sakar went out of his way to make our stay more comfortable. The hotel was perfectly situated near paddington station and all the other staffs were always at the ready to attend to all of our needs. ,5,2016,03,26
104,Unforgettable bed!,"I had a great one night stay in this hotel at a great last minute price. I arrived early expecting to be told to return later, but the lady at the front desk, Silvia, was very accommodating and helpful and was able to get me an early check in, which was extremely appreciated!
Apart from the great front desk, the room was nice and I had the best night's sleep ever because of the amazing bed, sheets and the most comfortable pillow!!
The location was perfect too, just minutes from Paddinton station, and walking to Oxford street was an easy 20 minutes.",5,2016,03,25
104,Fairly good stay near Paddington station,"Park Grand Hyde Park London is a good 5 minutes, 2-3 blocks walking distance to Paddington station; thus it is convenient for traveling in/out of London (to Heathrow airport, Oxford, Windsor, Bristol etc). 
However, the room is small and tight space - had my legs and head hit a couple of times as I get in the room and while taking a shower. Our room have 2 twin beds but they are placed beside each other & there's no way we can move it separately because there just isn't any room left to move around. There is a table and chair, a two-seater sofa, small closet, & bed-side table on side of each bed. There's electric kettle, apple and banana on a platter covered with wrap plastic, coffee, tea, creamer/milk & sugar, 3 cups & saucer and spoon. A small refrigerator can be found under the table,& the hair dryer is tucked inside the drawer. 

For consolation, the reception staff are helpful & ready to assist (your luggage and opening/closing the door). 
However, for anyone who would like to rest, the cleaning staff doesn't seem to understand what ""Do not Disturb"" means because there were at least 2 staff, twice a day, & on 2 out of the 3 days we stayed, who entered the room (the other times, they knocked first before entering). Still, our sleep was disturbed (we were hoping to sleep until late morning to catch sleep and recuperate), but that didn't happen. 

The restaurant charges more if you don't book ahead (¬£15 on the day, ¬£10 if advanced). There are places to eat just 2 blocks away, where English breakfast can costs only ¬£5-7 each person. Also, they charged the room/stay in US dollars without asking if we want it in US$ or in UK¬£. So beware. ",3,2016,03,23
104,Lovely Hotel,"My friend and I stayed here in March, the staff were very nice helpful in every way. The room was clean and very comfortable, with two double beds and ample room to move around. The breakfast was very enjoyable with plenty of choice. We only stayed one night as we came to see a show but would definitely come back again as it was easy to get around. Hyde park is about 10 minuet walk and Paddington tube station a 5 minuet walk. Plenty of shops, restaurants and bars close by. ",5,2016,03,23
104,Fantastic staff but give them a room that is not over your bedroom!,"The staff were wonderful but I believe their break room was above our bedroom and all night long it sounded as if Riverdance was being performed with relentless noise and movement.  Avoid room 202 which is also accessed by a 5ft 5inch door and you will be ok.  
Otherwise clean, efficient and fantastic location",4,2016,03,21
104,Business trip,"I have frequently stayed at this hotel over the course of a number of weeks, and have been very glad to come back each and every time. From the facilities, to the breakfast, to its location a short walk away from Paddington station- every part of staying at this hotel has been a fantastic experience. Made all the more special by its incredible, professional and thoughtful staff- with particular reference to the manager Sakar, Adriana and Lucian. I would definitely rate this hotel very highly and recommend it to anyone looking for quality accommodation.",5,2016,03,20
104,My Home in London,"I stayed at Park Grand London Hyde Park two years ago. Just landed at Heathrow for a Sunday afternoon business meeting from my office in New Jersey, on my way to Istanbul. 

While checking hotels in Paddington area I recognized this beautiful cozy hotel. 

I have fund memories from my prior visit. It was such a pleasure to meet the front desk team, lovely Silvia, Darja and Lucian the best porter in the world. 

So, I'm pleased to say I'm back at my home away home here in London. ",5,2016,03,20
104,Simply Nice ,"Nice Hotel , Nice staff , Nice Location, 
Nice room , nice bed , nice pillow overall very very nice and staff are extremely nice .
Hotel is surrounded by a green belt of big trees in westbourne terrace in paddington . 
Lots of choices of restaurants nearby and grocery store too . 
Prices are not too expensive, it's probably a good rate in london having staying in boutique hotel . 
Thanks for 5star services from Mr Sakar and his team . ",5,2016,03,19

104,Smallest room in my life of traveller,"I was given a room which was the smallest I have ever slept into. No minibar, no drawers, micro bathroom, No space for even opening a suitcase. I have given a score of 2 becasue I was then moved to another room which was more human, even if I could listen everything conversation in the room next to mine. Personnel was kind however I would not recommend this place and I will not stay here again. I wonder how this could have got so good ratings.",2,2016,03,19
104,Service above the rest ,"Having stayed in several hotels in london, I must say that this is the best hotel service that I have experienced. Although the rooms are not large and the bathroom/shower area quite small, it was good value for money. But it was the service offered by Darja and Lucian that made the difference. This is the sort of service that makes it worth a return stay should I visit london again. ",5,2016,03,18
104,NICE STAY,"I have choosen this hotel for my family holidays.we.stayed last year as well and we enjoyed every momement spend at park grand hotels.

104,Fantastic Hotel with Superb Staff,"I have stayed a number of times at the Park Grand Hyde Park hotel and I have always been impressed with the staff; especially the manager Sakar and the front desk staff -  Lucian, Pavel and Adriana. 

The rooms I have stayed in have always been remarkably presented. 

The hotels location is very close to Paddington and a short walk from Edgware Road.

I most certainly will make this my preferred hotel when required to stay in London in the future.",5,2016,03,17
104,Good location and very impressive staff,"While the hotel is cosy and not large, like its rooms, the staff are gems. There were 3 ladies Gaia, Pamela and Darja who were cheerful even when hard at work.  In particular, Darja made the difference in my stay -- from ordinary to superb and memorable. She helped me with a change of rooms when I was uncomfortable in the first one assigned and followed up with calls to ensure I was alright.  

She was professional, responsive and patient, even with other guests who had issues; this I noticed as I was waiting in line. 

I must also mention Lucian who was attentive, observant and quick to assist. 

The staff have really done the hotel proud. I would stay here again. ",5,2016,03,16
104,FANTASTIC,"If you need anything - speak to Sakar!  An absolute pleasure, as on previous visits.
Great Hotel - will be recommending to friends and colleagues.

Everybody here has always been welcoming and helpful for any of the needs I have had. This mixed with the perfect location and extremely well maintained facilities  makes this an amazing hotel for any stay.",5,2016,03,14
104,Best manager in London,"First time in this Hotel.  Greeted Mr Sakar the manager,  Was so lovely warm and welcoming smile and made us smile straight way.

104,Disappointed with room size,"We were on a business trip and I recommended this hotel based on TA reviews, we booked 7 individual rooms, none of them having front view, mine was infact the smallest in size, window overlooking a wall. Having visited london lot many times, I have stayed in many hotels near Hyde park, so this was probably slightly better of the lot in terms of cleanliness and service that was exceptionally friendly. The room size was the only big disappointment and the feel.",3,2016,03,12
104,Perfect stay,"First solo trip to London 
So far it has been a very comfortable stay. 
Loved my room very modern and spacious. 
H√¥tel staff have been very friendly and helpful. 
Definitely reccommend this h√¥tel to anyone coming to London. 

Thank you for everything .",5,2016,03,12
104,FAB,My stay was extremely enjoyable. The staff was pleasant from the point of checking in to the room to checking out. Rooms were spacious and bed was very very comfy. The breakfast was delicious and the service was spot on. Definitely recommend!!!,5,2016,03,11
104,Fine,"Really everything we expected.. a great value for the price, first class accomodation, excellent service and friendly staff. Two not-that-important details though, the room was tiny and the bar closes at 11:00 pm. ",4,2016,03,11
104,Mr Daniel lockton,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights with my work colleagues . 
I really enjoyed my stay , the staff and the manager, mr sakar were extremely welcoming and made it feel like a home from home, definitely the best hotel staff I have ever come across . The room was finished out to a high standard with flat screen TVs , really comfy beds and a beautiful bathroom suit . The food in the hotel was five star . All in all the best trip away with work I've ever had . I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone! When in London , stay at the park grand ! ",5,2016,03,09
104,Pleasant stay,"This hotel is a cosy, intimate hotel with friendly and service-minded staff.

We wanted to try another hotel in the Shaftesbury Collection this time as we have stayed with Shaftesbury once before and we chose this one. I read a little about the hotel before booking and was not expecting it to be huge. The fact is that this is a pretty small hotel, with small rooms. We had a superior triple room and some friends of ours had a duplex suite.

The superior triple room is basically a double room with an extra bed. The duplex suite is a room with to floors where a big double bed is upstairs while a sleeping couch, a small kitchen and bathroom is downstairs.

The bathroom in both rooms were small. You need to take a step over the toilet to go into the shower and I don't think there is room for two at the same time in those bathrooms. It wasn't an issue for us but it is something visitors should know about. 

Rooms were clean, tidy and well equipped. We also received a plate of refreshing fruit on arrival. It's always nice to get your blood sugar up after travelling :)

The hotel is pretty close to Paddington station and Hyde Park. Walking to Oxford Street will take you about half an hour. 

The only ""negative"" I have on this hotel is the variety of food, fruit, drinks etc for breakfast. It could be better both in terms of different drinks and food. The breakfast is not very spacious though, so I understand that they can't fill it up with a ""meat fest"", but I would have enjoyed more choices of jam, bread, flavours of juice etc.

I believe we had direct contact with 5 or 6 different employees while we were there and everyone of them were service-minded, pleasant and great to talk to. I really felt that they wanted to help us because they wanted to, not because they got paid to do it. We really felt the service was personal and on a high level. Thanks!",4,2016,03,09
104,Wonderful service,"My boyfriend and I stay here regularly. Not only is the location of this hotel really central on a nice quiet road close to Paddington station, but the service is of very high quality. I can tell they make an effort to ensure their customers are satisfied with each stay. 

The staff are very welcoming and friendly throughout our stay. I have booked to stay again next month, and mentioned that it will be for my boyfriends birthday and the manager said they will make it special for us. 

I would recommend staying in one of the Duplex rooms, they're very comfortable and spacious. 

To sum up, I'm very impressed with the personalised service this hotel offers which aims to make guests feel more special. ",5,2016,03,08
104,Wow,"Was a fantastic hotel and stay . Highly recommended. Close to public transport , good amenities, friendly staff. The manager of the hotel is a great reflection of the word  hospitality. A****

Sakar and Adriana were very helpful, they sorted out our parking for the week and made sure our stay at the hotel was the best it could be. Great hotel would definitely come back again!",5,2016,03,06
104,Great manager Sakar,"We used this hotel whilst working in Farringdon. The rooms are excellent, clean, shower is good, great location, right near Paddington station.

104,Only the best in london,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 days the service I received was of the highest level that I've had in any hotel for a very long time. All of the staff are very helpful and friendly, also for shopping and travel it is the full package. I will be recommending to all my peers. Mr Sakar was from the start very welcoming and funny allowed us to feel as if we home away from home, also miss Adriana was very helpful with all our enquiries and also had a very welcoming smile. Defo a hotel I will be coming back to. 
Thanks Mr Sakar",5,2016,03,04
104,Love the manager Sakar,"This hotel is great! I really love it here. The manager Mr Sakar went  far and beyond to assist us and help with the many questions that I bombarded him with, in fact all the staff are really helpful and friendly and make you feel at home..that's the reason that this is my second stay at this hotel and won't be the last. It's very close to Paddington shopping centre and the tube station.
Miss Adriana thank you for your restaurant choices . 
Thanks guys ",5,2016,03,04
104,Great location and very helpful staff,The location is very central and about a mile from Marylebone railway station and Oxford Street.  Hyde Park is on the doorstep and a lovely walk to Kensington palace and Harvey Nichols.  We had a great duplex room which was very roomy and comfortable.  Would definitely recommend and stay again.   Breakfast was a bit hectic on the Sunday morning and there was a bit of wait for food items & juice to be replenished.,4,2016,03,04
104,Very comfortable stay,"Very central and reasonably priced for the location. Decent cooked breakfast in the morning and late (12 noon) checkout included in the price, definitely a bonus if you've had a late night like i did. I would stay here again.",4,2016,03,02
104,Convenient but ...,"I've been staying at the hotel during the week while I work in London and the hotel is conveniently located between Paddington Station and Bayswater station.  This is good for food and commuting to sites around London.

The quality of the rooms differ depending on the location of the room.  Some rooms are better than others but I would have to say that the deluxe rooms are not really worth the extra money.

Every bed I have found to be very soft and not always the most comfortable to sleep on.  The beds could use firmer mattresses or have rooms with firmer mattresses and rooms with less firm mattresses.

The decor in the rooms are the same ... dark and I would have to say old ... but not as old as me ... LOL

The food in the restaurant is OK ... I tend to have breakfast there as it is include in my price.  I sometimes find the mushrooms too salty.  It would be nice if they offered other food other than a full English.  It would be great if you could get oatmeal or pancakes or something different.  Maybe you can and you just need to ask for it.

The staff at the hotel are very good ... Silvia, Darja and Lucan (evening concierge) are fantastic.  After my first stay they all knew who I was ... They have made my stay at this hotel enjoyable.

In general my stays have been pleasant ... their website could do with some improvements and the pricing on the site doesn't include any taxes and the taxes are added when you are ready to book.  They sometimes have different prices even against their own ""members"" site so do check and compare the costs.",3,2016,03,01
104,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night and we would certainly return. Had a lovely room , 121, fresh fruit, tea, coffee and biscuits, bottled water in the fridge. Bathroom was small but perfect for us with a good size shower underfloor heating and plenty of towels and toiletries. The staff where extremely helpful , breakfast was very good with a choice for every taste. Good location for tube stations and would highly recommend ",5,2016,03,01
104,Perfect for London break,"Booked Club double room online on morning of stay which was lovely. The bed being on the mezzanine was a nice touch as it means that you have a nice lounge area with fridge, microwave and sink unit along with the tea/coffee making facilities. Breakfast was good. Free wifi was an added bonus!
No bath in room 125 and shower room is a bit cramped.
Hotel is a couple of minutes walk from Paddington station and just right for a few nights in th being city.",4,2016,02,29
104,Great value close to Paddington,"My second stay at the Park Grand Hyde Park. Room, whilst not huge, was a decent size for a solo traveller (especially by London standards) and was smartly furnished. It was nice and quiet, at the back of the hotel.

The staff again proved to be warm and friendly, especially Sakar who welcomed me by name following my earlier visit.

Location is great - just a few minutes walk from my office and the tube in Paddington, and convenient for my early morning run in Hyde Park.
",4,2016,02,29
104,Avoid room 006,"The hotel is in a beautiful building in a good location for accessing shops, tube station and tourist attractions.  Staff were friendly. Stayed in Room 006.  There is limited parking outside which is charged at ¬£20 per night, although my husband got this reduced to ¬£10 because we were messed around when checking in.  Room was small for a double but clean and well decorated.  Some damage to bottom of doorframe in bathroom looks like it needs replacing.   On returning from night out met with a loud noise I can only liken to a plane engine from a generator right outside the window which went on until 8.30am in the morning.  Needless to say we hardly got any sleep.  Would have reported the problem but we'd already been made aware that some guests that had booked the hotel were being moved to the sister property across the road due to maintenance problems, so wasn't keen on the prospect of having to move just for one night.  Reported the problem in the morning when checking out and received the obligatory apology, which did northing to relieve  my headache from lack of sleep!  Cost ¬£132 for one night, with no breakfast or parking included.  Good location and friendly staff so perhaps we were just unlucky with the room allocated.  ",3,2016,02,29
104,Great location ,"My daughter and I stayed here first 2 nights whilst visiting London.  It's in a great location and very near Paddington Station, 5 min walking distance.
The staff are very nice and efficient.  I was unhappy with the room we were given and we were promptly moved to a more suitable room.
I booked a Club Room, I realised the rooms were the sane but the club came with extras such as drinks, bathrobe and slippers and a  fruit bowl etc ... however the fruit bowl was 3 pieces of fruit on a plate.  I think it may be best just to do away with the fruit plate as it was very disappointing ... or present it better üòï
Breakfast was good but the breakfast room cramped.
Overall the stay was ok and the location was great.",4,2016,02,28
104,Friendly environment!,"The rooms are smaller than you used to but that is the norm in UK.  Stores, tube and restaurants close by.  The Hotel staff are accommodating and most friendly.  They are willing to assist with anything.  Had a wonderful stay at the Park Grand.",5,2016,02,25
104,Amazing!,"This was probably the nicest hotel myself and my partner have ever stayed at!
From the second we arrived to when we left it was apparent that nothing was too much trouble for the staff.
When we arrived we were given a complementary upgrade which was amazing. We got back late from the theatre and asked at reception for a jug of iced water that we could take to our room, the staff unexpectedly and very promptly bought it up to us!
Breakfast was faultless. We were very sad to leave the hotel and simply cannot wait to return!",5,2016,02,25
104,My famille in londres ,"I stayed  here 3 nights with m'y son and m'y daughter.

104,Great stay!,"Really great hotel, I stayed in a single room for four nights. Staff were lovely and helpful. Bed was clean and comfortable, and the room was quiet (despite being next to the breakfast room stairs). Towels changed and room cleaned daily. I didn't try breakfast so can't comment on this. Just round the corner from Paddington Underground. Wifi was fast. Would happily stay here again in the future!",5,2016,02,20
104,Great location and quiet !,Could not find fault at all - room was great and very quiet. We stayed for two nights and would have no hesitation in returning. We felt very welcome and found the location to be perfect for our trip.,4,2016,02,20
104,Great customer service,Me and my partner originally booked to stay in London premier Nottinghill but when we arrived there had been some problem and were moved to park grand Hyde park and given complimentary breakfast and upgrade which we were happy with. The doorman was so happy and helpful he really stands out and made our stay very welcoming. Stayed in room 116 we thought room was quite small and could do with a update but bathroom was lovely and there was a big tv. Love that it had a fridge in as well to keep are drinks cool. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and even though it was a busy Saturday morning staff kept on top of things. ,4,2016,02,20
104,pretty nice location in a quite area,"I can,t express everything here but I would say it was very quite building and comfortable place to stay.Thanks to Mr Adeel who was fantastic to make our stay happy by serving us so nicely and with a pleasent mode, also thanks for making a fruit plate, quite impressing hospitality by night staff, thank you Mr Ivan you upgraded us in a bigger room.",4,2016,02,14
104,There is a reason why this is top class,"One of the most impressive hotel I've ever stayed in London . 
So many things that just makes you feel comfortable and welcome . 
Greeted at the reception by Manager Mr Sakar and Ms Adriana with smiles and handshakes and all in all a service I experienced from these guys is absolutely chuffed ...

The hotel itself is very beautiful and the rooms as very pleasant . 
It's stone throw away from Paddington station , various choice of restaurants and grocery nearby . 
A visit to this hotel is a must if you are visiting London . 
Cheers .",5,2016,02,13
104,Excellent value for money in London,"This hotel gave us absolutely everything we wanted for our stay in London at a very reasonable price in comparison to most other hotels' exorbitant charges. The hotel was spotlessly clean and looked recently decorated. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom modern with a lovely shower. To top it all, without exception the staff were very friendly, professional, efficient and made us feel very welcome. The location was great - especially as our train came into Paddington. At 5 minute walk from the station it was very convenient and meant there were no additional travel charges. Next time we want to stay in London we will not spend time looking at other hotels - we will simply book here. Thank you.",5,2016,02,13
104,Nice small Hotel near Paddington,"Conveniently located behind Paddington station connecting all across Central London. Easy to walk around to Hyde Park also and Hop On Hop Off stops at Paddington. 

Nice looking hotel with a nice lobby and breakfast area. Great cooperative staff. Great breakfast spread. Unfortunately, selected a single room which was way too small to fit my suitcase and bathroom too small to fit as well. Always choose a double room. 

Overall a good stay on a quiet lane in Central London. ",4,2016,02,13
104,Friendly helpful staff,"Welcoming,comfortable,great breakfast. We would thoroughly recommend and definitely coming back.
We arrived by train. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from Paddington and a few minutes from Hyde Park. All in all very convenient.",5,2016,02,12

104,Quality service over anything else ,"I stayed with Park Grand London Hyde Park for only a night last year and the concierge Ivan and Adeel helped me a lot during the night I stayed. It has been a year and I am surprised they still remember me and still serving me with great attitude and patience. It is the service that actually makes me stay with this hotel every time I come down to London now. Great price, excellent service and good people! ",4,2016,02,08
104,Definitely coming back,"Clean, friendly, welcoming, excellent customer service, good breakfast. Definitely coming back - in fact are booking it tomorrow !   I couldn't fault one thing at this lovely hotel. Every member of staff were friendly helpful and smiling. Comfortable beds in very clean rooms. Excellent location, Hyde park close by and we had a nice walk through the park to Buckingham palace.  Tube stations a short walk away and found some nice pubs nearby. Highly recommended.",5,2016,02,08
104,Moved ,"My friend and I booked a twin room at the Park Grand Hyde Park for ease of location and 4* quality at a decent price for a Saturday night in London. After booking, I read even more reviews and was slightly worried but on arrival it was easy to find and very clean and shiny looking, outside and in reception. We watched the fish for a while as the receptionist (only one) dealt with two difficult customers ahead of us. Unfortunately that's all we got to experience as we were told that we had been moved to a different hotel (not as big a surprise as I had read previous reviews, but still annoying) because of some rooms being out of action. The friendly porter took our cases and led us across the road to the Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington, in a similar building and of apparently the same standard (I shall continue my review for that hotel on their page!). The receptionist was not exactly apologetic about the situation, just matter of fact, you have been moved (didn't tell us where to!) but then I didn't make a fuss as it didn't come as a huge surprise. Still disappointing as I would have liked to experience what I actually booked and paid for.",3,2016,02,07
104,Theatre break,A lovely clean hotel with an excellent breakfast  buffet . We booked the deluxe room and was surprised it had a kitchen / lounge area and a spacious bedroom .Our room faced the road which I personally found noisy but it didn't bother my husband . It wouldn't detract me from booking again as I would have a room on the other side. overall a great stay at a lovely hotel at a great price ..Thank you,5,2016,02,05
104,Real London Experince,"Hotel does justice for being part of posh central London area, really clean lobby and room. 
Breakfast was up to par and consisted of healthy and hearty items.
Staff was adept in handling mainly all situations professionally, special thanks to Darja and Sanya.",4,2016,02,04
104,Fab location ,The location of this hotel is perfect when travelling around London. Less than 5 minute walk to Paddington station. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Especially Lucian the barman and concierge who went out of his way to help us with our bags and was always so smiley and friendly so a huge thank you to Lucian! Would definitely return if coming back to London,4,2016,02,03
104,Surprisingly Good ,"We stayed here to go to the Royal Albert Hall and London Eye with my husband , and it was the perfect location , only 5 mins walk from Paddington station. Hyde park is around 10 mins away and many many choices of restaurants and grocery shops nearby . 

The hotel was in fantastic location to get by anywhere you want in London , was in perfect condition, with a very cosy late bar , airy reception with very very very friendly and cheerful staff . 
Unfortunately I didn't get chance to catch names but all of them were perfect in what they do . 

We booked a double room for one night , and thankfully we were upgraded to a duplex suite which was amazing. Very spacious , spotless clean and very comfortable bed . 
Bathroom was very descent size too with high pressure showers . 
We didn't eat anything at the restaurant, therefore I cannot comment on that . 
I would definitely definitely be back and would recommend this hotel to every travellers who wish to visit London . ",5,2016,02,01
104,Really Friendly Hotel.,"Arrived too early to go to my room but no problem. I was checked in and relieved of my luggage and allowed to go on my way. When I returned later that evening I was given my key and directed to my room. The room was spotlessly clean, well equipped and more than adequate for my needs.After a good nights sleep I went  down to breakfast and was greeted in a warm and friendly manner and shown to my table. Breakfast is buffet style with a comprehensive choice. Later, when checking out I was again treated in a friendly and efficient manner.Five minutes walk from Paddington station so east to get anywhere in London. Budget prices but a first class hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2016,02,01
104,Superior triple room,"We chose this hotel for a girls' weekend in London. It is very difficult to find a 4* hotel room for three people! I have to admit to being a bit worried when I looked at the reviews after I had booked but overall we had a positive experience. We arrived too early for check-in but staff were happy to check our bags for us so we could head out for the day. To my relief we weren't relocated to another hotel as others have experienced.  The hotel is set back from the road so the traffic noise isn't as loud as we expected from other reviews either. The room was lovely; certainly big enough and the bathroom was nice and clean with a very powerful shower.

Breakfast was a bit of a let down the next morning as we had to wait with several others for tables to become available. (This gave us a chance to watch the fish swimming in their inadequately sized tank in the reception area.) Then, just as we were finally able to help ourselves to the breakfast, a waiter took the baked beans away for a top-up and didn't return for at least ten minutes which meant that the food we had already plated-up had gone cold.  We were over halfway through our breakfast by the time we were offered coffee.

All in all, a nice hotel and we would probably stay there again though next time we would like to see the reception fish upgraded to a larger tank!",4,2016,01,31
104,Trip to London for tea at the Ritz to celebrate my wife's retirement,Hotel staff were all friendly polite and welcoming. Room was excellent with lounge kitchen area and wall TV with stairs to mezzanine bedroom with another large wall tv. Good breakfast available unti 10 am which suited our needs. Location of hotel very convenient to Paddington. Will definitely return and would recommend.,5,2016,01,30
104,"Comfortable, Convenient and Most Importantly Amazingly Friendly!","So we checked into this hotel..it was super quick (Thanks to Silvia)! The lift apparently is super slow but there is not much one can do about it..so try and take a room on lower floors! The rooms are small but alright considering you are in London..but they are well equipped and very comfortable with all the amenities! They aren't stingy on the toiletries or coffee sachets and are always renewed everyday!
The cupboard is smaller then usual so I would recommend them to install a pole with a few hangers for extra storage (which is there in some rooms I noticed but not all rooms).
You will have to let them know if you want air conditioner because it might be on heater depending on which month you go in! So don't be surprised if you feel hot because the heater maybe on..you just have to ask them to switch the A/C on for you in case you want a cooler room.
The bathrooms are temperature controlled which I love the most..so you will always have a hot bathroom even before you enter the bathroom! Another thing I loved a lot was the shower is very quick..the pressure is amazing and best part is the water can be quickly switched between hot and cold as you like! So hot shower is never a problem!
The breakfast is nice and cozy and easy to avail with not much hassle of making you sign etc etc.
Coming to the best part..the staff..Vlad is a sweetheart..he would help you with just about anything..including directions or printing you a map of the tube station as well as converse with you if you want to talk to someone while smoking..Hes always greeting you and helps you with everything..
Silvia is awesome too and always wears a smile all the time..and she too will help you in detail with everything you require and will make sure its delivered as requested..
Almost whatever you require will be provided to you including iron and iron stand, extra toiletries or towels or cookies..and that too quicker than you can imagine!
All in all..its a great place to stay..I would recommend my fellow TripAdvisor to book here!",4,2016,01,28
104,Great staff,"Another business week in London and I'm glad I stayed again in Park Grand. The warm welcome of the staff is the perfect start in the morning and perfect to switch off your working Day. Thank you Sakar, Adriana, Lucian and Darja.",5,2016,01,28
104,Fantastic hotel in London,"First of all, I really like the managment in this reception particularly the Mr. Sakar hopitality in situation he is very very helpfull and professional. 
The hotel is near to the Paddington and Edgware Stations, and there are many restuarants and shops near by this hotel. Also, the Hotel has nice rooms and this regard , the beds are very clean and comfortable. 
All the staff are very friendly including the Mr. Lucian and Miss Adriana; they are very cheerful too. 
According to the breakfast, it is really tasty and fresh, I always enjoy the service at the Restaurant .
I would definately recommend all my friends and families to stay at this hotel. 

My greetings to Mr. Sakar and all of the Park Grand Hyde Park Team.",5,2016,01,28
104,Comfortable hotel with ultra friendly service,"we stayed for two nights over a social weekend, being joined on the second night by friends who also stayed at this hotel. Our room was quite small, but very well appointed and clean. Our friends struck lucky as there room was about twice as big, but equally well appointed and clean. The breakfast was great and the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. We advised reception on arrival that we were staying to celebrate our upcoming wedding anniversary and half an hour later a complimentary bottle of wine arrived, which was a really nice touch. We would happily stay here again.",5,2016,01,27
104,Best overall experience ,"Stayed the second time there and it was excellent again. The staff is very friendly, there is a rich breakfast bar (full english) and you'll get a quiet comfy, sleep. So if you're looking for a hotel in London, I can definitely recommend this one. ",5,2016,01,26
104,Wonderful hotel and convenient,"Very comfortable rooms and very friendly people. Particularly, Lucien, who greets you everytime you leave or come back in, Anthony and Tanya at the restaurant who very very courteous and Sakar who is very friendly. Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,01,26
104,"Great Value, Great Hospitality",Excellent value London hotel. Wonderful location for easy access. The staff are super helpful and offer what you would expect from a good quality hotel without busting the budget! Parking right outside too!,4,2016,01,25
104,Another great stay ,"5th time back here to this lovely hotel. Again  location is brilliant and front of house staff welcoming and friendly.  Beautiful room with some nice extras, such as wine and fruit.  Downstairs in the restaurant they serve an amazing self service buffet breakfast.  The restaurant staff are friendly and attentive. ",5,2016,01,24
104,All excellent,"After some internet searching I found that this hotel gave us the best location and quality for what we wanted to pay.
We were not disappointed with our choice. On arrival we were upgraded to a club duplex room. Very nice and very comfortable. The bathroom was functional with a nice large shower. The bathroom was a little on the snug size but that is it for any slightly negative comments. The room had a upper duplex lounge with a small kitchen with microwave and good sized fridge.
The location was very good being a few minutes walk to Paddington station and underground and about the same to Hyde Park.
Breakfast was one of the nicest hotel breakfast have have had in a long time. Good ingredients, well prepared and it was HOT. A rarity these days when most places seem to serve everything Luke warm.
All the staff were very helpful and pleasant and a special thanks to Sakar. 
I don't think this hotel can be beaten for the price paid.",5,2016,01,24
104,All good,Stayed for 3 nights and it was a nice stay. The room is clean and comfortable. I struggle sleeping in strange places but i had no issues. The staff are polite and friendly. Hyde park just 5 mins away which is a lovely walk and i highly recommend doing. There are a few places to eat in the area which all seem nice. Paddington is a few minutes walk away so access to the rest of L9ndon is easy,4,2016,01,21
104,Comfortable and convenient,"This hotel is situated about 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station, so is very convenient for Heathrow and the tube. It is part of an elegant terrace, set back from a not-very-busy road so the rooms are quiet. The staff are helpful, efficient and super friendly. We were upgraded to a large room on the top floor, which was beautifully decorated, light and spotlessly clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom modern. Free wifi, big flat screen tv, tea and coffee making facilities and biscuits are provided. Altogether a most impressive place and great value for money considering the quality of the rooms and its central location. Will certainly make a return visit.",4,2016,01,19
104,Affordable and great location,"Stayed here on a weekend trip to London. Very affordable hotel. I was in a small single room but it had everything I needed. Room was in good condition and well laid out. Convenient location, very near  Paddington so good access to Heathrow and the underground. Would stay there again.",4,2016,01,18
104,You get what you pay for,"Stayed at this hotel for four nights but nothing special. Had to wait around for check in although the staff did try their best. The room was old and stained, the curtains were feral and view was shocking. It's very old interior. The bathroom.... So small, can't believe it. Very noisy because the rooms are so close together. The breakfast was OK nothing special again.

Wouldn't stay again",2,2016,01,18
104,Canal Cafe Theatre Trip,"Perfectly located a short walk to Little Venice to visit to the Canal Cafe. A brisk walk through Hyde Park on Sunday morning a bit of fresh air, exercise and finished off with some retail therapy in Knightsbridge. The service was exemplary and Sakar and the other staff were very polite and helpful.",5,2016,01,17
104,Boat show visit,Stayed one night to visit the boat  show asked for an early check in we were up graded staff friendly and helpful would stay here again easy access to Paddington train station lots of restaurants around the hotel so spoilt for choice    ,5,2016,01,15
104,"Good value-for-money hotel, but nothing to write home about","I stayed in this hotel with my wonderful boyfriend. 
Located within walking distance of paddington station and also hyde park, this hotel was good value for money considering the generally high prices of London. 

However, the double room we were given was very small and claustrophobic. The room was clean and had free wifi, but unfortunately the breakfast was an absolute disaster. 
The breakfast room was very small and we were told there was not enough space for us to eat (our purchase included breakfast with the room) when we first went down, and this affected our plans for the day as we were delayed. When we finally got space to eat (half an hour later), the breakfast was OK but the mushrooms had a piece of mud in it! We were not impressed and when we showed this to the waitress she just laughed and took it away without an explanation of how it got there! 

Overall an adequate but unimpressive hotel.",3,2016,01,14
104,Located on tree line street,"Located on a street with Residential/Business row house properties. Quiet inside and out. We(3 adults) stayed 5 days. Rooms to fit any size of family. Comfortable. Breakfast Buffet very good. Breakfast room clean. Front Desk to Housekeepers very helpful and nice.Small Lobby and Bar area. We had  2 issues,but taken care of. Walking distance to Pubs, Shopping and Paddington Station We love London!",4,2016,01,13
104,Little Gem!,"We decided last minute to have a three night new year break in London, and opted for the mystery of a ""top secret"" hotel, not knowing the name of your hotel until you've booked. We weren't disappointed!  The hotel itself is a five minute walk from Paddington Station, accessible to shops, pubs and restaurants.  An impressive, elegant looking building.  Our  room was cosy, but had everything you need, comfortable bed, large TV, safe and a kettle for tea/coffe (we asked for extra tea/coffee on arriving back one evening, and the housekeeper was waiting by our door by the time we got up to sixth floor in the lift)!  The room and en-suite were spotlessly clean each day.  The only downside was the room tended to be on the warm side at night, but being on the sixth floor and with the mild weather outside we simply opened the window.  There was no problem to us with traffic noise, being at the front, overlooking the road.  Breakfast was nice and tasty.  You couldn't wish for friendlier, helpful staff for whom nothing was too much trouble.  We enjoyed our whole break so much so, we opted to stay an extra night.  We wish to thank the hotel for their hospitality during our stay and would certainly opt to stay there again.",4,2016,01,08
104,Nice & Simple,"I stayed in this hotel during Christmas & New year 2015. Hotel has an easy access to Paddington Station. It is close to Hyde Park and some grocery stores. We were a family of five and Staff were very kind and helpful especially Sakar, Lucian and Adriana. The Hotel offered us a complementary Breakfast for first night which was very nice.

Although we had some issues with the door access cards as they are very sensitive and we had to changed them three times, the room service was excellent,  however family rooms are little small and double beds looked more like Queen size beds. 

Rate is little high during Christmas and New year. 

We recommend this hotel for other London visitors and definitely will stay again in next visit.",4,2016,01,07
104,Good Location and Good value,"Its very central location around paddington, take 5 min to the station. Room was tidy everyday and  modern. Staff was helpfull, breakfast is extra point, but only one minus, which is room feels too hot. But overall is convenience stay for my trip. ",4,2016,01,06
104,Pride of Paddington,"Its my second time i stopped after X-Mas for one night . 
Why i choose to stay in this hotel is of their caring and most helpful staff i've experienced in london .
Hotel is only a stone throw away from paddington station .
Paddington is lovely area to stay if you've not visited london before & this hotel is an ideal base to explore from .
The hotel itself is bright , modern , clean and tidy . We stayed in a Deluxe Double Room and while not huge it was definately not as small as some of the reviews on here make you think . Comfy bed , nice big telly and facilities , excellent shower and assorted shower gels , shampoo etc .
We had fruit plate , water , biscuits complimentary . There was an iron and safe in the room which were very useful . 
Another welcome bonus , All staff are very attentive and extremely helpful with any request and multi- lingual . 
Breakfast is as perfect as last stay . Each and every member of staff are fantastic. Thanks guys , Unfortunately i do not remember all the staff but one person i came is Manager Mr Sakar who always goes extra miles to keep up with our requests . 

Super easy to blast off and see the city without the price tag of the downtown hotels in london .
We would definately happily stay again .",5,2016,01,05
104,Lovely Stay,"We visited London for 6 Nights and very much enjoyed our stay. Our room was nice and clean and kept that way daily. (It was small but from what I had read all rooms in London are small) Reception organised us transport to Victoria Station with ease and the car was ready and waiting for us bright and early for our departure. 
Location was also fantastic! Right around the corner from many shops and restaurants as well as bars. 
Would definitely return! ",4,2016,01,05
104,Overnight stay,Booked a single room over new year's season. Excellent service. The room was very clean and the interior is of high quality. Single room is quite small but very good for travellers that don't spend a lot of time at the hotel,5,2016,01,05
104,"Superb stay, highly recommend!","Our family searched through a number of hotels/ apartments to stay for the Christmas and New Year break and came across this hotel, actually located in Paddington.
Have to say from the outset and on leaving in January, after 7 nights, we found the staff to be very accomodating, friendly and efficient in dealing with any issues we had. The welcome and efficiency in sorting out our room by May and Pamela went far and beyond, making sure we were happy. There was the efficient and friendly help of the porters Lucian and Alex, who always had a ready smile and were ever so helpful. Finally the kitchen staff Anthony, Tatiana and Sol stood out for their welcoming and attentive service.
The rooms were kept immaculate and the bathrooms were nice. All in all we could have stayed another week and look forward to returning. Keep up the good work Singh, your staff are doing you proud!üëåüèΩ  ",5,2016,01,04
104,"Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Staff, Wonderful Location!","Our family of four just spent a week at this wonderful hotel. The staff is superb, and went above and beyond to make our stay a pleasant one. After looking at many hotels in London, this is THE best value and an excellent place to stay. 

The front desk team headed by Gurdeep, was so kind. I want to include as many names as I can because Silvia, Sakar, Adriana, Pamela, Mayva and all of the team including Lucian and Ivan were so very helpful and friendly. When I needed help with directions or re-booking, Silvia and Adriana saw me through; Lucian tracked down a book I had lost, and the rest of the team also helped in so many ways.

Our room was clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. We enjoyed the breakfast on site, and were taken good care of every morning at breakfast by Anthony, Tatiana, and Sol.

The hotel is a short walk from Paddington Tube Station and Lancaster Gate, and it's a short walking distance from Hyde Park, and a doable walk to Marble Arch. 

We will miss our ""home"" in London at the Park Grand!",5,2016,01,04
104,"Great location, staff and value for money.","We (5, in a double and triple room) spent 3 nights here. Both rooms were clean, renovated baths, offered tea/coffee in room. Cheerful and friendly staff. We were helped when needed. 
I would say it was a good London hotel relative to price.",3,2015,12,31
104,My favourite Hotel in London,"from the moment we arrive . The service desk Mr Sakar greets me with a very welcoming smile .
The service and hotel is absolutely perfect and in near the Paddington main line station. Being tube station only few minutes away , its easy to get to all the important sight seeing places in london .
I stayed during christmas , Hotel decor was fabulous . Didnt felt like i was away .
Ms Adriana at the front desk was incredibly helpful with maps , directions and choice of restaurants .  
Our room was again as nice as my previous stay . The bed AAAAAmazing !!
Shower is full of pressure and i always love it . Tea , kettle , biscuits are very nice 
we always book from their site , therefore breakfast is free . Again , All staff at restaurants are very attentive and especially Mr Anthony always very friendly abd hellful with my request .
We took hotel private to heathrow . I found it rip-off . My husband loved the fact that the mirror after a hot shower was fog free shaving . Hotel itself is bit old ,  but well maintained and decorated beautifully.
We always stay in this hotel because of their geniune service . People have left bad reviews due a size of rooms but what they need understand is its CENTRAL LODON & ITS BOUTIQUE ......
I would like to thank Mr Sakar , Ms Adriana , Mr Anthony and rest of the team.
We wish you all a very happy , healthy & prosperous New Year .
Thank you .

104,Much room for improvement,"The window in our room was broken on arrival. A member of staff came to see to it and jammed it closed saying he would fix it whilst we were out. When we arrived back it had not been fixed so we asked it we could move rooms as the room was quite stuffy and we wanted some fresh air, we were told this wasn't possible.

The breakfast room was chaotic in the morning. The food had not been replenished, neither had the fruit juices and there was also no plates left by the hot food. We were also not offered tea or coffee when we sat at our table. The staff didn't appear to know how to keep the place running smoothly and guests had to ask for everything. I had also requested when booking that gluten free options were available for my mum who has a gluten intolerance and all they had was bread. When I asked, the staff member said they could get cereal for he following morning. 

The rooms are small but clean and the shower was a tight fit. However we found the beds and pillows very comfortable. 

I wouldn't say this is a 4* hotel based on the service we received.",3,2015,12,24
104,What an awfull place,"Given a room with bathroom on the lower ground floor that combined was smaller than my bedroom at home, and believe me my bedroom is not that big. I had to stand sideways in the bathroom to have a shave, and I am not that big ( A 42"" chest ).
The room was at the front of the hotel so when I finished work around midnight and returned to the room I was kept awake until around 02:30 by traffic and people standing outside my room smoking and laughing and joking. After finally falling asleep I was rudely woken at 05:40 by non-stop banging of doors in the corridor outside my room. It sounded like a delivery being made with trolleys being bashed into the doors to open them. The staff are rude and unhelpful, it was a total disaster . I really object to paying ¬£119 for that experience.",1,2015,12,21
104,Nice hotel at a good price ,"Spent one night here. Booked a club room which was excellent value for London. Lovely room with 2 floors. Bathroom a bit small but great shower. Fridge and complimentary wine, soft drinks and fruit. Breakfast OK. Bit of a problem with lights in the room not working but quickly resolved. Would stay here again. ",5,2015,12,21
104,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for a night. Very easy to get to from Lancaster Gate tube station, and is well situated for Hyde park. When checking in we was upgraded by a very friendly member of staff, which was really nice. The room was split over two levels and was nice and clean. The only thing I would say is the bathroom was very small, although this never effected us in any way. 
Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,12,19
104,Two night break,"Spent a couple of nights at this hotel which is well situated and close to Paddington station. On arrival we were greeted by Sakar who was very helpful and even upgraded us to a duplex room.

The room itself was okay, quite basic and a bit tired in places, could probably do with a lick of paint and new carpet. The shower room was a good size, though it would be helpful to have a shelf above the sink as there's not any space to put anything out on.

We only had breakfast on one of the mornings, it was okay especially as it was included in the room price. All staff we spoke with in the restaurant and at reception were very helpful and attentive, which is why I'm giving the hotel 4/5. The hotel is a 4 star, however I would say it is more like a good 3 star. ",4,2015,12,18
104,Very friendly staff,"I stayed here for three nights during December 2015 and there was very little to fault this hotel.  Good location and close to Tube station / taxi ranks.  Rooms are basic but very clean and nothing is broken. However, what makes this hotel is the staff - all are very friendly and helpful.  Sakar on front desk deserves particular mention - he went out of his way to make my stay pleasant.",5,2015,12,17
104,Customer Service was (A) grade quality,"Was pretty impressed w the customer service I received. I recommend dealing with Sakar in regards to hospitality. He will make sure your looked after a great deal. Thank me later. As far as rooms. Very spacious, eloquent, neat, great view of the paddington/Hyde park area. Make sure you book a spacious room away from the basement because life can be a little tough in a smaller room. The service I received from the restaurant was a little suspicious. Overall, I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the london area.",4,2015,12,17
104,Wonderful hotel - a real gem in London!,"We arrived at the hotel and were met with a very warm welcome. In particular Sakar, the receptionist, ensured we had a smooth check in. He was very polite and friendly and provided excellent customer service instantly reassuring us that we would have a pleasant stay. The room itself was simply perfect. Spacious, quiet and clean. Small touches make a big difference. The room had a fridge, tea and biscuits and in the evening they provided fruit. Breakfast was also included in the room rate. The bathroom was great as sometimes they can be very pokey. We have stayed in London numerous times but this has now become our favourite hotel. Great location too just 5 minutes from Paddington. Amongst a very busy city we were made to feel at home. A must stay if visiting London!",5,2015,12,16
104,Great stay!,"We stayed here for the location for hyde park winter wonderland last weekend,the hotel cannot be faulted,we had 2 quad rooms next to each other,comfy beds,lovely breakfast,nice shower,clean,kettle,biscuits,fridge,fruit,nice quiet area a five min walk from Paddington,lovely receptionists and very helpful when we had checked out and returned later for luggage and my 11 year old daughter had left her cuddly toy she's had from birth in the room!the reunion was a real tearjerker!thanks again Hyde park grand!",5,2015,12,15
104,Welcome back to the 90's,"Having booked this hotel on arrival I was told that due to an issue with the rooms I would have to go to the sister hotel across the street. ""It's the same rooms""
The hotel is dated and tired, wall paper peeling, I can hear the people in the rooms adjacent talking and then there is the fabulous views which include the next door neighbours living room and the air conditioning system. 
All in all, not recommended and very disappointed.",2,2015,12,15
104,"Great location, cozy room and great service !","I am giving one extra star to Park Grand Hyde Park for their amazing service at the hotel. Right from the fellows at the door to restaurant to housekeeping guys, service levels are truly appreciable; coming with a personal touch. All the guys at the reception are exceptional in their service. I don't remember names of everyone at the front desk but all of them are always there to help you with a great smile on their face. I would like to make a special mention of Sakar who helped me a lot with my check-in and bill payment. Hotel is located at the heart of London with easy access to Paddington station. Places of interest like Oxford street, Marble Arch, Hyde Park are really close-by - few minutes ride on London bus. There is also a stop for hop on hop off bus near Paddington station. Hotel also has lot of good eating options around. Couple of suggestions from my side to the hotel management: room size is little small for my comfort especially you have to stay longish duration such as 3 weeks as i did. I know space is costliest thing in London but if you guys can allocate slightly bigger room to guests staying for longer duration that would help. Secondly breakfast menu is too monotonous. It would do you guys good if you can add some more variety in overall food option. But other than that, I was really happy at staying at Park Grand Hyde Park.",5,2015,12,14
104,"Hotel Good, peaceful and friendly","London is not a place to go if you wish to relax. But at this hotel, it was very peaceful and comfortable. Breakfast was good although the restaurant was a little crowded.
Staff were really friendly, informative and friendly.
Ideally located for Paddington overground and underground stations, easy access to the whole of London.
Visited all of the tourists attractions and marvelled at the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. 
A lovely family weekend.",3,2015,12,14
104,It is a four star hotel and it provided us 7 star services .,"I booked this hotel via last minute.com and when checked in i was uograded to duplex  suite . The manager at the reception was friendly and polite .
I was vegetarian and he arranged me a pure vegetarian meal that was going out of his way . 
Room was spacious , location is superb and hospitality was fantastic . 
I would like to  mention Mr Sakar for been very kind and hospitable and Miss Adriana for recommending us choice of restaurant . 
I sill be back guys . 
Cheers from Hemant .",5,2015,12,13
104,How can this room be in a hotel rated 4-star?,"One of the worst rooms I have been into. I didn't even know it was possible for a 4-star hotel to rent rooms like this one. If you see the photos of the hotel rooms, they look quite nice, so I based myself on those to book my room. Now imagine a room with a single-sized bed where even a small 1.65m person would feel tight, a small table with chair, a small wardrobe, a flat screen hanging on the side wall, a tiny bathroom with a small shower, a toilet and a small sink, where there is no space even to hang a towel (towels are left on the bed) and a 60-cm wide corridor that goes from the door to the window. And nothing else. From my calculations, the room must be below 5 sq meters. I am a small person, but I found it difficult not to feel myself locked in a straightjacket in this tiny hotel room. That feeling was increased by the fact that the room was in the basement with a view overtaken by a 4-meter high white wall towering in front of the window. Adding to this, I forgot to take a plug adapter from european to english plugs and the hotel could not find me an adapter or any other way to fill the batery of my portable, since the only european plug in the bathroom did not work (for health and safety reasons, they said). So I could not work in my portable, which had its battery down. And the matress was too soft, so I found it difficult to sleep. Finally, all this for a price close to 200 Euros, which would have granted me a deluxe room in most of the cities in the world. Ah, and when I arrived I discovered that the price that was given to me did not include VAT, so I ended up paying 20% more than I expected. This was the first time that I made a reservation in a hotel in Europe, as an individual, and was not provided a quote including VAT.
So for me the Park Grand hotel chain is stricken out of my choices for the future, never again!",2,2015,12,12
104,Business stay,"Friendly Staff and a good room the hotel is good value for central London and is situated within 5 mins walk of Paddington station, very approachable and friendly greeting at reception , the room I stayed was of a good standard although the bathroom was a little cramped",5,2015,12,11
104,Don't book a taxi from reception!,"Hotel staff lovely, friendly and helpful.
Great breakfast.
Room ok - in need of update as looked but worn in places.
Bathroom minute - like a caravan bathroom with no room to move.
Booked a taxi from reception and was ripped off!  Same journey back with black cab cost half the amount.
Ideal for Hyde park.

104,Compact but lovely rooms,"My father and I stayed for four nights at this hotel. We wanted twin beds and ended up being upgraded to a double each. The room was compact but had everything we needed and we weren't there much anyway. Good wifi in the rooms and tea/coffee making facilities. The staff are super nice and helpful. Good, hot, strong showers and the rooms were relatively quiet. Breakfast was extra - we only paid for continental rather than the full breakfast.  7 mins walk to Paddington station. I would stay here again.",4,2015,12,09
104,Lovely staff,We have just got back from our stay at the park grand . I have to say I was very impressed for the price room was small but spotlessly clean . beds were really comfortable . The staff were really friendly and helpful . we had young children with us and they were running around being noisy and excitable but the staff were really good with them . would definitely choose this hotel again . breakfast was great too .,4,2015,12,09
104,Fabulous Family stay,"Our family recently stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park whilst visiting Winter Wonderland. From the moment we was greeted and booked in to the moment we left they couldn`t do enough for us. 
For the first time ever as a family travelling, within the group we had a baby and they offered to help us with pushchair, arranged for the cot to be in the correct room and  was very accommodating in every way possible, even down to ensuring a high chair was available at breakfast.
The Rooms where lovely and had everything we needed to make our stay very special. I would recommend this lovely hotel and have already started making plans to stay again next year.",5,2015,12,08
104,Lovely hotel in a great location,"I stayed in a single room for 2 nights. It was compact, but comfortable, I wouldn't expect a huge room for central London at this price. It was immaculately clean and everything worked well and was well presented.

The staff were warm, welcoming and helpful. Front desk staff were fantastic (thank you to Sakar and Adriana in particular), concierge were attentive and housekeeping kept my room lovely and clean. My only disappointment was the service at breakfast. The food itself was great, but I felt a little neglected as I was a solo diner. The waiting staff put me in the middle of a large shared table and didn't provide me with tea/coffee like they did for the other guests, even after I got up, found someone and asked.

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Paddington station, has great tube and bus links, so very accessible and convenient. Overall a great stay and I would visit again.",4,2015,12,05
104,A little Gem in London!,"My partner booked this hotel as we couldn't get into our usual preferred hotel.  I was disappointed as I do like our regular hotel.  When we arrived at The Park Grand, I was pleasantly surprised.  The room was on the top floor and was beautifully appointed with everythi9ng any one could need.  The bathroom was smaller than I am used to but had everything I needed.  The amenities are lovely and fabulous fluffy bathrobes.
The bed was large and comfortable and the room was exceptionally clean.  The only downside was brighter lights would add value for ladies to put their make up on as a little dark.  Breakfast was good and staff in the hotel were welcoming and helpful.   I would definitely recommend and will stay again next time in London.",5,2015,12,04
104,Can I give it a minus star rating ?,"Without a doubt, this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The room was tiny, the bathroom even smaller. The room furnishings look like they were what the local homeless shelter threw away. Everything about this hotel is a disaster from the front desk to the room itself.  

I paid for a Club room, thinking it was a higher quality room. Wrong ! This was a Club that I did not want to be a member of. The front desk staff were overwhelmed and confused. I saw myself in a very bad movie.

I went into the breakfast room for a coffee. The Bellhop came in, made the coffee and presented me with a bill. But I paid for breakfast ? Oh, the coffee was not included in the breakfast, but an extra charge. Excuse me ! Scene Two...

This place was a series of scenes from a very bad movie. But some of the guests there didn't seem to mind so I'm assuming this hotel has a deal with the local government to take in homeless. Or maybe it's where the immigrants stay until they find housing. Or maybe it's a halfway house for recently released prisoners. 

Whatever it really is, a 4 star hotel is one thing it isn't.",1,2015,12,04
104,Terrible from start to finish,"I like to pride myself on being fair and will always give an honest opinion of a place. I can safely say this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had and I have stayed in some terrible places over the years. The website will state 4* I can only deduce this is for Sh1t service.

The booking was made via the business who dutifully sent the 3rd party form as requested so that payment would be made prior to my arrival. Sadly this was not enough for the hotel and I had to pay for the hotel myself with the promise I would be refunded the following day once payment had been taken from my company, easier said than done. My company tried to contact the hotel throughout the day (6 or 7 times) the phone was either hung up or the person at the end of the line didn't understand what was required of them. Once the business finally got through to someone who didn't hang up we where told that the payment had been made via the correct card and I could finally 2 days later get the refund I was promised, alas this was not true and the excuse given was the person is training, no apology. Never mind we shall try again tomorrow...

The room! At the point of trying to reclaim my money owed from a refund I also mentioned that the air conditioning was broken in my room. I was told that it will be looked at and fixed. Alas once again this didn't happen and upon my return the room felt as though I was in the Algarve in the middle of summer. I could deal with this apart from its winter. I once again complained and someone was sent to my room who played around with the buttons and I have to admit it made a difference for 5 minutes and then it stopped again. I then had to get on the phone to reception again to say that I was not happy. They offered me a room swap which I was happy to except at 01:30 in the morning, I asked if it was possible to leave my stuff in the old room and pack in the morning. I was not allowed as appaerntly the cleaning staff would be cleaning at 2am... I think not!

The new room is a lot cooler but smaller than the last room and still the air con does not work. I am still yet to receive the refund promised the following day after checkin as the people in the back office do not seem to know how to run a business.

Overall the service has been poor, the room has been like a sauna and being made to move rooms at 01:20 and having to pack is unacceptable.

Please never book this hotel and from this experince don't look at the others

P.S the fire alarm also went off at 05:30 and nothing was said as an apology as this only lasted 20 secs.",1,2015,12,01
104,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, room was immaculate and amenities spot on, great breakfast and excellent staff, great location. Only fault was our 3 night stay wasn't longer. The extras like the bedding turn down service with chocolates left on pillows and the heated bathroom floor were lovely.",5,2015,12,01
104,Elegant Property 5 Minutes from Paddington Station,"Love this little place! Typical room size (tiny) for London, but high quality, high end bathroom (also tiny), helpful staff and fantastic morning breakfast.

Easy walk to tons of restaurants, pubs and shops as well as Paddington Station.

If you don't mind a small boutique property, this is a real gem.",5,2015,11,30
104,Overnight stay in London,"Warm, helpful welcome, comfortable room,well presented. Very well sited for Paddington Station, but a little way from any restaurants. Breakfast was extra, Which we did not try. All in all a good value hotel, well situated with warm and helpful staff.",4,2015,11,30
104,Great location,"We stayed here In May 2015 the location is fantastic just a few mins walk from paddington station. When we first arrived we were told our room wasn't available as it was undergoing renovation but a sister hotel on the same street could accommodate us , we refused and requested to speak to a manager as we felt we should have been given notice prior to arrival so that we could then find our own alternative accommodation if we wished. The manager was very helpful and instead provided us with a duplex room in place of the family room we had booked. The duplex room was lovely large and clean. We did not spend a massive amount of time In The hotel as we wanted to get out and explore London however we would happily stay here again.",4,2015,11,30
104,Will definitely return,"My husband & I stayed just one night here this weekend & it was lovely. We were unexpectedly upgraded to a mezzanine suite, which was a rare treat. The bed was super comfy in a cosy room. The staff were so friendly, we felt so welcomed. I don't think I have been to such a receptive hotel before.",5,2015,11,29
104,Comfortable Stay with Attentive Staff,"A nice hotel, a comfortable room, a very good staff that is very attentive. The doormen are very helpful. The front desk staff is very attentive and knowledgeable. The restaurant staff is also very attentive. Close to Paddington Station (though Cross Rail construction has temporarily closed the nearest entrance).",4,2015,11,28
104,Great location. Local Experience,"Staying here was a great opportunity to try out the whole Paddington terrace experience. However it seemed like the entire hotel staff had just been hired and was under 25 years old. The team did not know the layout of the hotel and was overwhelmed handing customer questions. The rooms are upgraded, modern rooms that still maintain the charm of the older building. The shower is VERY small and not recommended for larger guests. I would also not recommend for guests with disabilities. Navigating the old stairs awkward landings can be a challenge. I would recommend this hotel for single business guests who need access to Paddington.",3,2015,11,27
104,LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION,"Good location and good price, but tiny rooms, even tinier bathrooms and narrow, winding stairs and corridors. Lovely staff, all of whom were really friendly and helpful without fail. Worst thing was screeching fire alarm went off 3 times during my 2 day visit, once at 6.30am, apparently due to people illegally smoking in their rooms. This will have to be sorted out! Arguably not a 4-star hotel, as claimed, but good budget place to stay near Paddington Station.",3,2015,11,27
104,Just not good enough.,"I travelled with my partner to the Park Grand Hyde Park to celebrate our birthdays and as an early Christmas present to our selves to take a break. I was so excited to see the hotel after spending a huge amount of time organising and saving and was thrilled when we pulled up outside to see the beautiful building and the interior. I had splashed out and went for the Duplex suite even though it was beyond our needs, it was a special occasion after all.

Unfortunately once inside things start to go downhill rather quickly.

The room itself was spacious and clean but I felt let down by the promise of the Duplex suite, the finish of the room was poor at best with pieces of skirting board and staircase missing, paint on the carpets, holes in the ceiling light fixtures and windows that were near useless. The bathroom again was very clean and well stocked with all the essentials however oddly the toilet roll was mounted on the wall opposite the toilet meaning anyone with a shorter reach may struggle with it.

Elsewhere in the hotel the theme of half finished DIY jobs kept popping up with paint on carpets and signs glued to walls... with these then melting off the wall???

The location of the hotel was perfect for what we needed and we managed to get to the majority of the places we wanted to see without much trouble and the staff were very helpful in calling us a car when we needed.

For a supposedly 4-star hotel I have to say I am very disappointed.",2,2015,11,26
104,good place to stay when you visit London,"Have checked in two times in the hotel when I was in London for business. It¬¥s a nice hotel with very friendly and service orientated staff. The rooms are not so big but I only stayed there for sleeping. It`s not far away from Paddington Station ( 5 min by feet ) and so you can use it as an initial point for your London trip. The Breakfast is international and comprehensive. You can order Sandwiches at night, too. There are many restaurants around the Paddington Station where you can go for lunch or diner. I like this hotel and now it is my standard hotel when I am in London.",5,2015,11,26
104,another great stay,"we stayed here from the 13th november till the 18th november 
what a great hotel the staff are very very good 
the breakfast was excellent 
the rooms are very clean and items replaced each day 
this is are second trip and will be back next year",5,2015,11,24
104,Great hotel and location,"Hotel is within 5 mins walk of Paddington Underground and 10mins from Lancaster Gate.

Great location and lovely area with easy access to taxi' and local shops.

Staff at the hotel are very friendly particularly Sakar and Adriana on reception.

Clean and tidy hotel with all the services you would expect.

Would definitely book again and great value for money for the central location.",5,2015,11,22
104,"Tiny, tired hotel - can do better on a budget in London","We stayed at this hotel for 1 night due to an early engagement the next day. 
The positives:  The location is fair for walking to some of the sights, close to Paddington station and underground. The area is fairly quiet/safe. Beds were comfy and room was clean. There was a safe and tea and coffee making facilities which was a plus. Free wifi in room.

 The negatives: The hotel wasn't a good standard for 4 star Hyde Park. You can get better for your money (we paid ¬£129 through a secret deals offer). We allegedly had a complimentary upgrade  - however the bathroom was beyond TINY! You couldn't wash in the sink without standing at an angle. No room to move your arms. The toilet - well you could sit on it - but beyond that (sorry to get graphic) could be a challenge for anyone with anyone with bodily limitations! Towels were small. The windows seriously need updating - they looked like original fittings and you couldn't shut the window fully (causing a draught - but luckily it wasn't too cold or noisy). The radiators needed bleeding - in the middle of the night they started making an awful noise which resulted in us turning them off to shut them up. Even when on they didn't heat up fully due to issues (cold at top, tepid at bottom). I appreciate I could have complained and move rooms but at 1.30am when I have a 7.00am appointment - I didn't want to change rooms at that time. The restaurant only had indian food options for main courses - very limited menu so we ate out and the bar was very small. Unfortunately the hotel looked like it had been put together on a budget and lacked the simpler things whilst trying to achieve luxury things.

Staff were pleasant and apologised for poor stay - having stayed in London a few times I was really hoping this had a boutique feel - but it was more travel lodge than boutique lodge - not the worst but by no means the best.",2,2015,11,20
104,Good hotel for a London stay,"The bed and breakfast offer and a quiet location make this hotel an ideal choice for London.  The rooms are spotlessly clean, modern with all toiletry, coffee and tea amenities and the staff are very polite and helpful.  In fact if you are over 60 you can ask for additional discount!!  Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice.  I will return and also recommend the hotel to friends wanting to stay in London.",5,2015,11,20
104,Good quality and good value,I booked a single room which was small by any standards but perfectly adequate with all the amenities you could wish for and a comfy bed. The bathroom was similar with good shower. My room faced another building so was very quiet for central London. There's no fridge in the rooms which is ok as there are so many shops close by. Very handy for Paddington. I would definitely stay again. Good value ,5,2015,11,18
104,Amazing Stay,"I bought my 11 year old daughter for a one night stay for her birthday and we were thrilled with our visit! Easy to find and not far from Paddington Station we were greeted by the friendliest staff who took our luggage and were super helpful with helping us find our way around and organising cabs for us. The room although not the biggest was just perfect with a lovely bathroom and everything we needed. And super clean! The main thing for us was the Staff with every single one of them with big smiles and so eager to help. We would definitely return-infact I'm going to book here again when we visit.

Thankyou to all for making our stay so enjoyable.

Top marks from us!!!",5,2015,11,15
104,Weekend Break,"The room was smaller than expected although big enough for the much needed weekend break, that rapidly escalated into a Christmas shopping trip! Paddington underground station was within walking distance, so getting to all the major shopping/tourist areas was easy. The staff were friendly, polite and extremely helpful, and were happy to store our luggage for the entire day AFTER checkout, and offered us sanctuary with coffee, biscuits, a much needed seat in the reception area and use of the toilet facilities before we left for our return journey home.",4,2015,11,15
104,5 Nights at Park Grand ,"I stayed at this hotel with little daughter for five nights in a double room .
It's been a fantastic experience. All staff were very polite and very friendly especially Lucian, Sanya and Sakar. Rooms are spacious and very neatly arranged. I most enjoyed the proximity to shopping at Oxford Street. They gave a free one hour extended check out time and luggage storage till late on my departure date. I will surely visit again.",5,2015,11,14
104,Lost booking and bad customer service,"We booked online, on the hotel's own website, only to be told the day before arrival, that they had no record of our booking. During the booking process there was no mention of receiving confirmation, so we did not expect an email, or letter. However the day before arrival, when we phoned we were told quite curtly, that there was no record of our booking, and as they were now fully booked, there was nothing they could do. We were forced to find other accommodation.
We have booked many hotels and holidays via the internet so we are very familiar with the processes involved and this is the first time anything like this has happened to us. We believe this is the fault of th hotel and not ours.",1,2015,11,12
104,"Not bad, but there is better in this price range","I guess it's true that 'you get what you pay for', especially in central London, but when there are hotels like the Motel One at Tower Hill that are similarly priced & similarly central, the Park Grand London Hyde Park is left lacking in comparison.

Stayed two nights in a single room, quite small but not to a fault. Pleasantly fast wifi in the room that was included with the price. Convenient for Paddington station & thus a single tube ride from Kings Cross.",3,2015,11,09
104,Great location,"I stayed here for 4 nights from Oct 22 through October 25, 2015.  There were 4 of us in a double room.  The bedroom had plenty of space and was very comfortable.  My only criticism is that the bathroom was very small.  One could hardly stand directly in front of the sink BUT that being said, we managed.  The breakfast at the hotel was great...plenty of choices with good coffee.",4,2015,11,09
104,Highly recommend ,Stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and felt very relaxed and welcomed. Super clean and in a great location. Staff was wonderful and always willing to help with any questions!! Also in a great location which was very convenient. Love to stay here again during my next visit ,5,2015,11,09
104,Super friendly staff,All staff were helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble for them. Our original room was clean and tidy but very small I asked if we could have a bigger room and it was dealt with immediately. Breakfast was very good again fantastic staff. Would definitely stay again. 5 minutes walk from Paddington station. Special mentions for Valeria and May. Thank you to you all. TIP ask reception staff to book a cab for you its half the price of a black cab. ,4,2015,11,08
104,Decent,"Stayed here for three nights:hotel staff were very welcoming and check in/out was extremely quick. However the hotel has some problems. The bathroom was tiny, the windows in the rooms were very old and we had to wait to get our breakfast each morning because there weren't any tables free. However, the staff were lovely and the hotel was in a great location (walking distance to Paddington St, Hyde Park and Notting Hill). So overall, it was a good experience!",3,2015,11,08
104,Nice place for a short break,"Stayed 2 nights. Room on the ground floor close to small bar area next to reception surprisingly quiet, being at the back of the hotel away from the road. Very spacious with a third bed available, so would suit a couple with a child. No view, whatsoever, as the room looked out at the back to similar backs of large buildings.
Handily close to Paddington station. The room was very warm, probably not helped by the unseasonably warm weather. Thankfully the air conditioning worked well.
Having a small fridge in the room was a great touch, particularly given the warmth.
Unable to comment on the food as we didn't eat at the hotel.
Friendly, helpful staff.
I would definitely stay here again and would be happy to be in the same room - 801.",4,2015,11,07
104,Wow ,"Was here for one week at park grand hyde Park . Felt very welcoming as i stayed at home . 
Checkin was swift , booked a single room , wasnt as big as i expected but was very cosy . 
I requested member of staff sakar to move me into a better room , he kindly did it . 
I had breakfast at the restaurant which was good and fresh . 
I would like thank sakar for making r√©servations big bus tour , that was fantastic . Member of staff in park grand ( Sanya , Gurdeep , Sakar , Lucian and rest of the team are brilliant ) 
Keep up your good work . 
I will be back . ",5,2015,11,03
104,OK,"Room small, window and window sill very dirty, window needs replacing. Fan in bathroom not working. Room otherwise clean. Free wifi was good, but so also was the 4G.
Staff were very helpful and breakfast was excellent.",3,2015,11,03
104,Good for the price.,"I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel close to the Tube. It was about a 5-7 min walk to the Tube and had some decent restaurants close by. The rooms were small, as expected, but the bed was nice sized and comfortable.",4,2015,11,02
104,Park Grand stay,"Good quality hotel within easy walking distance of Paddington.

Room was clean and tidy as was the rest of the hotel, good quality breakfast.

The hotel doesn't serve evening meals, but there are many restraunts within walking distance",4,2015,11,02
104,Didn't make it to the room ,"We had 2 club rooms booked.  Arrived at 5pm to be told that our rooms are not available due to a maintenance issue that just this minute happened.  We were told that we would be transferred to sister hotel up the road.  We were not happy about this and found it most unlikely that both rooms had an issue the second we arrive? It's more likely they double booked and thought we'd just accept as instructed 

Anyway, when they offered the sister hotel I checked on trip advisor and the reviews were poor so I refused and asked them to come up with an alternative.  We were ushered into a tiny empty bar and offered a drink.  We were served 3 half glasses of wine which he poured into tumblers.  

Eventually the manager arrived and offered us their hotel on Shaftesbury Avenue.  Actually worked in our favour as we were going to be in Soho for dinner and it turned out to be much nicer than Park Grand Hyde Park

I would be most unlikely to choose this hotel again.  

",3,2015,11,01
104,A great stay ,"My first stay in London n it's been a great
 one. A very special thanks to Sakar for  making this a special one. Breakfast is awesome. If you wanna stay London cbd then this is a great option. Rooms are clean and tidy too Thanks. Keep it up guys. Thanks                                ",5,2015,11,01

104,Great staff!,I have stayed at the Park Grand Hyde Park several times recently. The staff are brilliant and nothing is too much trouble. I was given a small room on one of the occasions that I stayed here which I mentioned when I checked in the next time. The Deputy Manager upgraded me to a much larger room which was lovely. The hotel is located close to Paddington station and also several nice restaurants.,4,2015,11,01
104,Touring Europe,"Its first time here in this hotel .
Normally used to stay in hilton but was pushing my luck experiencing typical boutique hotel in London and here I am at park grand hyde park .
I must admit from checking in to my entire stay been so comfortable.  
As I am a very strict with cleaness and services.  I am very pleased . All staffs are extremely helpful and attentive .
Sakar the Manager is very helpful and he made sure my stay was comfortable. 
Breakfast was delicious and so fresh . I loved it .
No doubt will definitely be back at park grand when I am back in London . 
Cheers

104,Continuing to deliver an enjoyable experience,"As my experiences previously were good, I have stayed in this hotel on several more occassions for single and multi night business trips.
It is great to report that the hotel quality, interaction with staff, and value for money remain high.
It is great to see a hotel at this location offering Business travellers personal touches which are never too intrusive.
Sakar and latterly May are a delight to interact with so well done to them and to the wider team!",4,2015,11,01
104,Holiday ,"I stayed at this hotel  3 nights and ive hot to say i enjoyed it so much .

104,"Lilliputian room, but clean and up-to-date","I don't typically come to London to spend a lot of time in my hotel room, so it didn't bother me too much that my room (and the bathroom in particular) was miniscule.  What does matter to me when I travel is cleanliness, free Wi-fi, and complimentary breakfast.  This hotel definitely checks all those boxes.  The breakfast buffet was comprehensive, and regularly replenished.  Offerings were of a high quality.  I found hotel staff to be consistently pleasant.  Retreating to my little room after a long day of sightseeing was a pleasure.  The heating in the room was easy to control.  Finally, the hotel is a very easy walk to Paddington Station, so the location is particularly convenient if one is arriving in London via the Heathrow Express rail service.",4,2015,10,29
104,Beware of Check-In,"The hotel is nice and is in a good location to have you close to Paddington Station.  I booked this hotel through Booking.com and I'm not sure if this is the cause of the horrible check-in process.  As now looking, a few reviews mention the ""switch-up"" this Shaftesbury Hotel Chain is known for.

When I arrived, I was told there was a maintenance issue with my room.  A colleague would walk me down the street to their ""sister"" hotel where a room would be available for me.  Upon walking into this ""sister"" hotel you could tell it was of inferior quality.  I asked to see the room which was of a very small size.  I refused to stay and demanded that I have a room at Park Grand Hyde Park where I had a reservation.  Over 45min later I was finally into a room at Park Grand Hyde Park.  The staff at Park Grand told me they would just bump another guest over to the hotel I didn't want to stay in.  I'm sorry for whoever that happened to.  But again, by reviews, this is a common practice of theirs.  Poor business model!

Once settled I felt the rooms were clean and of a good size.  The bathroom was cramped with nowhere to place toiletries and the shower does not have a shower curtain, so water poured daily onto the bathroom floor as the shower head sprayed out at an angle.

 The staff upon entering and departing the lobby always greeted you.  Save your money and avoid paying for their breakfast.  It's located in the basement and nothing that special.  Your standard eggs, sausage, potatoes, and selection of breads.  Get out enjoy London and eat elsewhere!

I doubt I would stay with this hotel or any of its ""sister"" hotels again.  But for what I look for in a hotel when traveling overseas- safe area, clean rooms, convenient location - it did provide.",3,2015,10,29
104,Warm welcome close to Paddington,"I regularly stay in the Paddington area due to an office base nearby, and frequently use hotels in the Shaftesbury Group as they offer good facilities and service for a reasonable budget.

This week I had my first stay at the Park Grand London Hyde Park in that group. As typical for a Shaftesbury hotel, my room was well finished and comfortable, and I slept very well thanks to a good bed and quiet environment. 

The staff have been very welcoming, most notably Sakar who welcomed me by name each day and checked that I was having a comfortable stay.

A solid hotel with a warm welcome and very convenient location for Paddington, the Heathrow Express and tube to Central London.",5,2015,10,28
104,Nice ambience ..great hotel ,"Great hotel ..

Break fast and room services are  is good .
Any body planning to visit can come and stay with no 2 nd thought about the hotel 
 ",5,2015,10,28
104,Tiny room,"The location of the hotel is fine however i had a single room which was tiny and you could hardly move in it, it made an ibis look lavish and spacious.
Bathroom was also very small and the room seemed to be situated out the back somewhere.
The bar seemed ok but small and unstaffed.

Very welcoming smile and very hospitable . 
Rooms are descent , comfort and nice . 
Breakfast is good too with a wide variety to choose from .

Overall extremely impressed with the service received from Sakar! Definitely recommend and will be be back again soon! 

5*'s to Sakar! ",5,2015,10,28
104,Good Service,"My reason for giving a 5 rating is one Mr.Sakar - very professional and very taking responsibility.
It probably would have been no lesser than 4, but Sakar's personal intervention to sort out my issue (I had to change my booking from 6 to 4 nights and refund) made me move to a 5.
Location, accessibility - all very good",5,2015,10,28

104,consistant caring service at the park grand,"I have spend many nights away from home in London and most stays are spend at the Park Grand Hyde Park. 

Tonight I arrive and Sakar duty front manager greets me with my name and a warm hello as I arrive- before I reach the desk. Check in no problem and I order my favourite chicken  masala and off to my room.
Wonderful comfortable room allocated . While I am still unpacking Lucian the loyal duty porter arrives with my meal. He is such a professional person who always provides a very responsive service.

If you reading this and undecided where to stay you can do far worse than stay at the Park Grand.
One tube line (Bakerloo) and you are in the heart of London. I work at Piccadilly circus and this is my selected hotel.

Well done Sakar and the team for a great service.",4,2015,10,27
104,Short break,A very pleasant stay at this hotel which is ideally located. The staff were extremely helpful and this made for an excellent stay. The room we had although small was very clean. Plenty of choice for breakfast. We would certainly stay at this hotel again.,5,2015,10,27
104,Second trip - never disappointed.,"I have stayed here twice with my boyfriend.
The first time was in the summer, the second was shortly after on New Years Eve.

As most hotels inflated their prices, due to it being New Years Eve, we were happy to see Park Grand was still affordable and the service was great. The concierge was very helpful and allowed my boyfriend to choose a particular room and surprised me with a towel swan and some chocolates before we arrived.

I highly recommend 7th floor due to the view over London's historic town houses!! ",5,2015,10,27
104,Very good hotel,"My son and I stayed here for two nights. The room was compact but OK,  the beds were really comfy and we both slept well. The bathroom was fine and the shower powerful and good. I would rather have a proper shower than an over bath affair. The room was on the 5th floor and we had no problem with noise
We booked direct with the hotel so had breakfast included. This was a buffet affair with full English cereal and croissants. Food was very nice and set us up for the day. Check in and out was easy and I must say all the staff we spoke to were really polite and helpful. The hotel is close to 2 tube stations we used Lancaster gate and it's a nice walk down to Hyde Park if you use that one. We are coming back to London in February, this time with my wife and daughter and will definitely use this hotel or one in its chain again. Thank you.",5,2015,10,27
104,Fantastic experience!,"I am a returning visitor and this was my second stay at the hotel. The deluxe double room was spacious for London standards, all the  staff was super friendly, polite and helpful. The breakfast was excellent and location ideal as it is a 3-minute walk from Paddington Station and a 5-7 minute walk from Lancaster Gate Station. Fantastic value for money especially when you book through their site which offers free breakfast. I would love to go back!",5,2015,10,27
104,Great location - small rooms,"We had two 3 day stays one late September, the other mid-October. The first stay was in room M4 and the second on the top floor in 602. Both rooms are small and when like us you are travelling for a long time and have quite a lot of luggage it gets a bit cramped. The decor is dated and could do with a coat of paint.
Despite these negatives the rooms are clean and kept clean, the breakfast is a good way to start the day, and all the staff we dealt with in both our visits were polite and helpful. 
The hotel is in a great location close to Paddington Station, several Underground stations and easy walking distance to buses and a pleasant stroll to Kensington Gardens.",3,2015,10,26
104,I expected more,"My stay at this hotel was quite strange. You check-in at one hotel and they provide you with a room across the road. The room was so small I had to jump over the bed to get to the window. I honestly don't know how this hotel has a 4* rating. It was a reasonable priced hotel considering the prices in general in London, but I expected a room that I could at least feel comfortable in.",3,2015,10,23
104,GREAT STAY,"Very nice hotel,lovely staff, great breakfast and in a very good location for the tube and for Paddington station.
The lift need looking at, very slow to operate. We would stay there again if we were ever in London again.",4,2015,10,23
104,#1 on my list next time I'm in London,"When I'm in London I like to stay in the area around Paddington station.  It's a nice neighborhood with reasonable prices and within (for me) walking distance or a short metro ride from central London.

Pro:
Good location, right next to Paddington station, and within easy walking distance from Lancaster Gate station.  
Room clean and tidy, though a bit small.  
Complimentary wireless internet of good quality.
Breakfast adequate, but could do with a bit more variety. 
Good staff, unfailingly polite and helpful.

Con:
Restaurant isn't a restaurant, only open for breakfast. But loads of options close by.
Can be a bit confusing to find your way around the hotel.",4,2015,10,22
104,Great,"Once again the perfect spot. Besides the good location, this time I have to address my compliments entirely to the perfect staff Sakar, Adriana, Lucien. Great and helpfull in every aspect. Thank you very much",5,2015,10,22
104,Friendly staff quiet room and nice breakfast,"Really friendly staff, and a nice quiet room, nothing fancy but perfectly nice, comes with free wifi and fruit and water, comfortable bed and excellent breakfast for a hotel of this price range. Highly recommmended",5,2015,10,22
104,Great Stay,"As soon as we arrived all the Staff were so friendly and very helpful, the room was lovely and we even had two roses and rose petals on the bed when we returned after a  night out for our anniversary! The breakfast was very tasty and we would definitely stay again.",5,2015,10,20
104,"Great Staff and Nice, Cozy Room!","This hotel is excellent!  From the time we walked through the doors, the entire staff was extremely pleasant and so ready and willing to help.  We stayed for 4 nights beginning October 13.  Sanya checked us in and she was so helpful to us throughout our stay - we are thankful for her hospitality and patience with out of towners!  

We originally got booked into a room on the 6th floor but we didn't like that the room angled a bit at the window so we requested to be moved.  No problem, Sanya and staff showed us another room more to our liking and there was no hassle. Also, when we checked-in, the concierge man was so nice.  He insisted we leave our bags and head up to the room and that he would bring the bags up.  We tipped the man, but I don't think he was expecting it - I think the staff here genuinely just wants to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  

We had 2 large suitcases and a carry-on and some backpacks, and we managed just fine with the space.  It's probably more a business hotel, but we found the central location near Paddington station to be perfect for our needs.  There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance as well.  

We got a refresh on our cookies in room daily.  The breakfast was great as well - everything you can ask for to start the day.  We mostly devoured the chocolate croissants with nutella spread and had eggs/potatoes/mushrooms.  They had all sorts of other meat, cereals, fruits as well.

All in all, I would definitely come back to any of their Park Grand hotels.  Sanya and the entire front desk and concierge staff...one word sums them up...amazing!",5,2015,10,19
104,Very good stay ,"It was a very nice hotel with good location. Very nice, friendly staff and the breakfast was tasty. I was served by a female staff, I think her name was Sanya if I'm not wrong. She was helpful and very welcoming. I will like to stay again. A very nice stay. ",5,2015,10,19
104,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights.  It was extremely well located being only a five minute walk from Paddington station, and a 10 - 15 min walk to Hyde park itself.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to help providing maps etc.  The rooms are small and cozy with very comfortable beds, and were nice and modern.  We had room 007 which was in the basement, which was just a maze of little corridors.  If you are a light sleeper this room won't be for you as the main generator was right outside the window.  I didn't sleep well the first night and it didn't help but slept fine the second night.  

Unlike a lot of London hotels the Park Grand does offer breakfast included if you book with them online.  There is a small buffet breakfast but provides English and continental. Last time we started in London we stayed at a bigger more expensive hotel but it didn't include breakfast and the beds weren't as comfy 

If I had to be picky my criticism would be that there was a lack of space to put toiletries in the bathroom and as there was underfloor heating I didn't want to put them on the floor.  The beds were also quite short, but that maybe because we are used to a king Size!

We would definitely go back and stay again next time we are in London .",5,2015,10,18
104,Charming Boutique Hotel.,"What a lovely spot! This building is a little older, but it shows more London charm than any other place we stayed. The room we stayed in was spread over two floors, with the bathroom, kitchenette, and living room downstairs. Take the charming creaky spiral staircase to the top floor and you find a luscious queen size bedroom. There was a small balcony area in the bedroom overlooking the living room area. Nice and clean. 
Location was ideal, as it is within walking distance to Paddington Station. 
Staff here were very friendly and helpful. ( Thanks again, Gurdeep for your assistance with our luggage malfunction) the room also came with a lovely buffet breakfast with all the trimmings. 
We will be back. Thanks for showing us the quaint side of London that we had been missing.",4,2015,10,15
104,Nice hotel near Paddington station,Stayed here for business meeting in the area. This hotel is a little quirky but on the whole is fine. A comfortable bed well laid out room. Can't ask for more. It is not particularly cheap but this is London so what do you expect. If I visit the area again I will probably stay at this hotel,4,2015,10,15
104,Very Good,"Hotel was very good and staff where supportive and freindly. rooms were clean and hygenic. location and the place of the hotel was convenient and is located near to paddington, lancaster gate and bayswater tube station",5,2015,10,14
104,"Good location and service, disappointed with the room allotted","Excellent staff... Valeria, Silvia, Sanya to name a few. Excellent location as well... 5mins from Paddington and Lancaster gate tube stations and 2 - 3mins from the bus stand. Had taken a Club room which was supposed to be a superior category. It had steps which made it very inconvenient to move luggage in and out. Also, the carpet, sofa and some fittings gave the room a very jaded look. Room faced the road which made it very noisy. The Bed and pillows were of very good quality. The supplements in the room were also very generous with tea, coffee, biscuits, shampoos etc. Must also add that the service was very good and they went the extra length esp considering i was staying for 10 days. Also stayed a extra night in a single room which was pretty small, but cosy and silent. Also had a pretty fresh look. So, i guess you need to check whether room is new or old one. Overall, good stay",4,2015,10,14
104,Good location but disappointed with room allocated.,"Very friendly staff ,warmly greeted. Had requested room on high floor at point of booking but we were 'upgraded' to another room. Room 801, on ground floor , opposite bar area and main thoroughfare to breakfast area and other rooms. Very noisy.  The smell of bacon cooking filled the room from 5am, which made me feel nauseous. The beds were uncomfortable ...I could feel the springs. We were only staying for 1 night and were in a rush to meet up with family otherwise I would have requested a change of room based on the fact of its location initially. Room was clean but needs updating. Bathroom was fine. Location was very good.",3,2015,10,12
104,An unexpected gem of a hotel!,"This hotel is situated a ten minute walk from Paddington Station and is well placed for Hyde Park and Kensington Park.  The hotel is fantastic, well priced, clean, quiet and very comfortable.  The staff are all excellent - very friendly and helpful and made me feel very welcome.  I had an unexpected, and very welcome, upgrade to a large room with a huge bedroom on a mezzanine. The room was very well appointed with all the amenities you would expect from a hotel of this standard but with the extras of complementary water, fruit, and a small bottle of wine.  I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2015,10,12
104,Excellent hotel and amazing staff!,"Nice, clean and cosy hotel in Paddington. Great price, about 10 minutes walk to the Hyde park and 10 minutes walk to Paddington station. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely like to stay here again next time I'm in London! :)",5,2015,10,11
104,VERY WELCOMING STAFF,"we chose this hotel for being very central to the places we were visiting. we were greeted by a very friendly and competent lady on the desk who said we could be upgraded to a suite! the room was very spacious and clean and the bed very comfortable.
i would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again",5,2015,10,10
104,Great hotel near Paddington,"The name is slightly misleading as it is really near Paddington Rail Station.  This is part of the Park Grand series of hotels.

The WiFi is ok. Rooms are clean and well kept. Staff is polite and professional. The location is one of its greatest values being very close to Paddington Station thus enabling getting to anywhere in London easy by using the 'Tube' (their subway).

The only negative was loud and boorish guests, which unfortunately seems to happen anywhere nowadays.",4,2015,10,09
104,My preffered London hotel,"I stay in London 3 or 4 times a month on business as I have an office in central London but commute from the South West,  and normally use this hotel. I cannot really fault it - the rooms are clean, stocked with tea and coffee, the staff first class and the breakfast is very good. 

The location is perfect - close to Paddington and they will look after your bag for you if necessary.

There is free wifi, a bar and shops and restaurants are all close by. I am a premier club member which means a discount but often a free upgrade on the room.

My wife and daughter also recently stayed with me when watching Florence and the machine; I booked a larger room with two floors which was perfect

If you need to be close to Paddington of Hyde Park you cannot really go wrong",5,2015,10,09
104,Great Hotel ,"I had a lovely stay there. My room was very nice and the bed was comfortable. 
There is a full english breakfast included in the price. 
The best thing about the hotel is the staff. They are all very helpful and friendly, especially the receptions Sanya.
So I would recommend to my friends and family. 
",5,2015,10,08
104,have a nice time with Park Grand London Hyde Park,"I had a nice time with Park Grand London Hyde Park at September.  The room was not big, but very comfortable.  Nourishing meals were provided for breakfasts. I‚Äôd like to bring into focus the responsive the staff: they are always friendly, ready to help. Especially I would say thank you to Valeria, who is able to understand touristic interests of guest and provide a valued advice.",5,2015,10,07

104,Friendly and unique hotel,The minute we walked through the doors the staff were welcoming with nothing being to much trouble. Felt like we were treated as individuals instead of the standard courtesy that feels it's off a script. Stayed 2 nights and the room was spacious with little extras making it an enjoyable experience would definately recommend  professional staff made our stay enjoyable with nothing being to much trouble. ,5,2015,10,06
104,quite location pretty nice to stay peaceful,i was impressed with service provided by staff in all means specially by Mr Ivan who was working in night shift because he provided the best welcome service i have ever had. hotel is quite nice to stay because it is centrally. located,5,2015,10,06
104,welcome home,"We always use this hotel when in London. Very friendly and helpful staff who welcome your return and make you feel welcome.
The hotel itself is excellent and central to two underground stations.
Excellent rooms. Great breakfast and staff who make you feel like friends.",5,2015,10,06

The environment and the staff were really friendly and helpful especially its manager: Sanya Mehra, she really made us feel comfortable and awesome. Thank you for making our trip memorable. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. :) :)",5,2015,10,05
104,nice stay as a Premier club Member,"i am using this hotel from last year and joined their premier club membership to avail 10%discount on my stay .initially i was given small room but after speaking with reception team ,they changed me to a bigger room .
staff is very friendly and helpful and always eager to help their clients.highly recommended",5,2015,10,05
104,Great hotel and amazing staff,"I booked a room at park grand based on views on trip advisor and have to say that I had an amazing time. Hotel staff is extremely helpful and very friendly especially Valeria, Adriana and Sri. I stayed for few nights and their team helped me a lot with recommendation where to go after long day at the conference . I would like to mention that hotel location is very central. It was a pleasure to stay here and I will definitely be back very soon. ",5,2015,10,04
104,Great customer service !!,"Me and my friends stayed at park grand Hyde park in October 2015. I would like to thank Valeria and Adriana for exceptional customer service during stay. They made our stay very pleasurable, I've enjoyed so much as well as my friends. The hotel was in very good location very closed to Paddington and Hyde park. It was extremely clean and housekeeping service  was amazing. Adriana and Valeria helped us during our stay with restaurant and attraction recommendation and assisted us with any other queries. Will definitely stay here again and highly recommend to my friends around the world. I am very pleased with the service and hope that management will appreciate their effort. ",5,2015,10,04
104,Very good location,"Good value hotel located close to Paddington Station and Lancaster Tube Station, Hyde Park is just down the road and Oxford Street within walking distance.

I had a free upgrade to a spacious and clean duplex room with a lounge/sitting area when coming in and the bedroom upstairs. Very nice. Bathroom was modern, clean and compared to some other hotels in the area rather large. 

Breakfast room is on the lower ground level, offer is rather limited. Staff is very friendly and forthcoming.",4,2015,09,28
104,Not as good as hoped for....,"Great location. 

Check-in 'ok' .... Original online booking hadn't logged, so spent a nervous 15 minutes hoping all would be ok. It was, though the 'special club room' wasn't so special, and the complimentary items being sent to the room never materialised.

The club room, first impression was ok, the reality was noisy stairs in our room, and all surrounding rooms too! The window was wedged open with a block of wood which we had to ask to be moved. Once shut, the road noise went and it was ok. 

Watching the TV either up or down the stairs was tricky, as both TVs are set to right-angles to the seats/bed.

Breakfast was good, with good service from the fairly hard pressed staff. 

All in all.... 4star breakfast, 3star hotel.",3,2015,09,26
104,Ok for 1 night,"I went here as a group of 4 as we were going to the Radio 2 concert in Hyde Park. Staff were friendly and professional. Room was small but very clean and had everything we needed. Beds were comfortable and we couldn't hear any noise from outside. Breakfast was ok. A reasonable selection of foods, but just not enough staff to cope. The hotel was fine for a short break but I wouldn't want to stay here for longer than that.",3,2015,09,25
104,lovely hotel for holiday or business,"Location is good. 2 station on different lines are walking distance. Paddington and Lancaster gate. 
Check is at 2pm we reached at 9am. We were asked to wait for an hour and the room would be given and it was.. 
For 1st 5 days I stayed in a twin room as we were 2 of us. Room was facing the road on the 5th floor (Rm 501). Nice and well lite. Bed and pillows are comfortable. limited space for luggage. free coffee and biscuits.. enough plug points. there is air-condition and heater (We did not use). room is clean and well maintained. Bathroom is spacious. had a tub. well stocked with basic things. enough toiletries and towels. 
For 2nd 3 days I used a single room. Spacious and comfortable. Small bathroom. room 405 faces inside so no view.
Wifi included for multiple devices. good quality. 
Breakfast basic English breakfast. Good. 
The reception and bell desk is very helpful and friendly. 
Cons: Only 1 elevator takes time and is slow. Breakfast on weekend is not managed will due to crowds. 
will definitely stay again.",4,2015,09,24
104,1 Night in Heaven,"So I'd been in and out of hotels with work for the best part of a week. I was exhausted. I'd done another full day at a different office, hopped on/off the tube and headed out into the downpour to find the place. It's literally on the opposite side of the road to the Park Grand London Paddington. Crossing the road saved me ¬£20 online for the same room. 
I arrived drenched, starving and exhausted to find that they'd given me a free upgrade to a suite. YES, I thought. And to top it all off, someone had ordered pizza to reception, assuring me that it was an ok thing to do as I had been wondering whether ordering takeaway was the done thing at a place that looked so fancy. I settled in, ordered my pizza (reception even rang me when it arrived) and spent a perfect night in my lovely room. 
The only complaint was I could hear the people next door when they went up/down their stairs to the mezzanine level as the wall was a bit thin and the stairs were creaky. Also the lights are operated by putting the room key into a slot on the wall, it was a bit fiddly and it took a while for me to put it in at the right angle, I spent five minutes wondering if I'd have to get ready for work in the dark the following morning! 

But they gave me a free upgrade, so no complaints really.",4,2015,09,22
104,Good location,"The hotel is well located near Kensington Park and Paddington . Staff Sylvia and Alex were friendly and helpful, especially Alex the valet. The twin room was tiny although clean except for the sewerage odour coming thru the bathroom, mirrors not well lit but overall it was ok",3,2015,09,22
104,no tea,"we found this hotel very clean and cosy friendly staff, the bed was very comfortable. we stayed in room 121 which was almost like a flat when you went in the room you had the bathroom and a sitting room whith a small kitchen, then you had to go upstairs to the bed room the stairs were long and narrow , the problem was the bathroom was downstairs so if you got up in the middle of the night you had to go dowstairs.  the bathroom was very small with the washbasin in between the wall and the shower  and i almost had to stand sideways to get to the basin, and there were two dressing gowns on the door to use the loo you had to move the dressing gowns first and then put them back. on the back of the door  when you had finished         problem we had when we first got there we thought we would make a cup of tea after a long tiring journey wrong the kettle did not work we phoned down to the reception to report this and was told the matter would be sorted.
we went to the theatre arriving back we thought a cup of tea would be nice, low and behold the kettle was not working, we complained to the night porter who came up checked it out and found the socked on the wall was not working so he carried the kettle upstairs to the bedroom plugged it in and it worked only problem we had to go downstairs to get the water, the guy said someone would come at eight the following morning to fix, did they turn up of course not,!!!!!! we went down to the basement for breakfast to the restaurant the food was ok the tables were to close together and it was a problem squeezing through to your table you had to ask people if they could pull the their chair in a bit so you could get past the other problem was it was a long way out from central london",3,2015,09,22
104,Looking Forward ,"I booked the hotel at the last minute from lastminute.com . 
When arrived at the hotel staff were very friendly , they couldn't find my reservation due to a last minute problems . While they were dealing to sort out , I was given a complimentary tea and relaxed at the lounge .
I booked for 1 night and they even upgraded me to a club room , my booking did not include breakfast, had to pay ¬£10 but well worth it . 
Clean superb comfy room , great decor and all staff went out of their way to make my stay peasurable . 
I will be back soon guys and thank you so much ",5,2015,09,21
104,Short stay in park grand ,"We stayed here with our family in a family room . 
Rooms are spacious and good size , bathroom is clean . Staff are nice and very much helpful . 
Fron desk staff are friendly especially mention Sakar who guided us our tour in london and he is always available to help us out with anything. 
We are happy with service 
Will be back again ",5,2015,09,21
104,Superb!,"Best hotel, excellent customer service and discounted room prices. Food is awesome and mouth watering. Clean, good smell and lots of room options. All facilities are very accessible and markets are pretty close to the hotel. If i visit London again, this hotel would be my first preference!!!",5,2015,09,21
104,Great service,Reception staff were very helpful in assisting us and a room on the ground floor made for easy access.  The hotel location is very good being within easy walking distance of Paddington station.  An enjoyable stay.,4,2015,09,18
104,Had a nice stay...,"I stayed here for one night in a single room. Things were perfect. Thanks to Sanya, Gurdeep and other team members for making my stay memorable. They helped me with an early check-in without any hassles. They could also advise me well in how to go about seeing London in my short period of stay.",5,2015,09,17
104,Avoid at all costs,"I am on a business trip,where my sleep is mission critical. My institution has paid ¬£200 a night for what is supposed to be a comfortable stay. When I arrived, the hotel had allocated me a tiny single bedroom, room in the wardrobe for five garments, no space at all for a suitcase to be placed on the floor. I complained and was then allocated a room in the basement - 002 - a slightly bigger room, same wardrobe size, a single bed, more like the YMCA than a four star luxury hotel. I cannot stand square on to use the sink in the bathroom and instead have to lean against the wall or contort my body into a strange angle to get to the taps. If the hotel knew anything about ergonomic design, they would know that the bathroom alone is a health and safety hazard. I was told that this would be a quiet room, but staff are outside the room, chatting away beyond midnight. It is noisy (traffic and people), uncomfortable, reminiscent of a 1970's boarding school room (first hand experience) and hardly justifies ¬£50 a night, yet alone the hefty ¬£200 price tag per night. It is impossible to sleep. I have no idea what state I will be in come the morning. An atrocious place.",1,2015,09,16
104,Wonderful reception and porter staff,"lovely comfortable bed the  reception staff and porters  were so helpful, friendly and professional. 
The bathroom was very small but the shower was lovely, except when it suddenly went very hot for a second or two intermittently.",4,2015,09,16
104,Weekend break,"A friendly hotel a few minutes walk from Paddington.  Reception staff made us feel very welcome. My sister and I arrived at the hotel early and were allocated a larger room at the back which was very quiet.  The hotel set in a quiet area so it was pobably quiet in the front also. Facilities were basic only a small bar with no real lounge. Breakfast fair but in a basement with no windows. 
Room cleaned daily with fresh linen and towels. 
A lovely place to stay quiet with no lounge area. Rooms very good.",4,2015,09,16
104,Unfair rate!,"Hotel is in a good position but this is the only plus I've noticed! If I pay 366 pounds for a night I expect good quality while the hotel is at most average. Rooms are small and cold. I did not manage to start the heating in the room, I just managed to make it work in the bathroom. Front desk guy was not friendly at all. There is just an elevator and it happened to wait minutes until I managed to take it in the right direction. Lobby almost does not exist.  We need to have a pre-business meeting briefing and we had to stand up all the time. In short this is not the place to be if you are in London for business, and with these rates I would never come here for a vacation. First and last time here.",1,2015,09,16
104,Hyde park  one night stop over,"Great, clean and smart hotel , good hot breakfast although the staff DONT smile ! , good bathroom and shower ,quite location although door slamming was a bit noisy inside the hotel ! 10 minute walk to hyde park , would use again for sure.",5,2015,09,14

Didnt tried breakfast so cant comment on that but overall been excellent experience.
staff at reception Sakar and Adriana been very helpful accomodating and giving us a nice rooms . i will be back . Thanks guys . ",5,2015,09,12
104,Uprgraded!,"I booked the Park Grand through Lastminute.com - it was less than ¬£90 which is VERY reasonable for a week night in London.  I stay in London regularly and have had my fair share of pretty awful hotel rooms, so wasn't expecting all that much for my modest sum.

I didn't check in until 1am (work night out!) and was given what I assume to be an upgrade as I seriously doubt a large room with kitchenette, and stairs to a mezzanine where a very large, soft double bed was situated was a standard room.  The room was really lovely.  Very spacious, clean, and the bed was possibly the most comfortable bed I have slept in recently.  

I can't comment that much on the staff as I checked in so late, and checked out in the morning to go to work.  They were very polite and helpful though, and the doorman got me a cab without me having to move from the reception.  

If you can wangle an upgrade though its definitely a good place to stay.  Walkable to paddington and in the room I was in, you could stay a few days quite happily.  I was very impressed overall, but I think I may have lucked out!",4,2015,09,11
104,amazing from start to finish,"A wonderful stay at the park grand from start to finish, cannot recommend this place enough. The staff, the hotel, the room, the cleanliness,,,, everything was spot on from start to finish, also a a mention to sanya who helped me greatly, a real credit to your team, thanks again park grand will definitely be back! ",5,2015,09,11
104,Great Service and Location,"From the moment we arrived, the service provided was fantastic. Friendly reception staff when we checked in, we even received a call to our room to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. On top of that, we received a bowl of fruit and bottles of water delivered to our room. We stayed in a twin room, size wasn't huge, but compared to others in London, it is passable. We needed an iron and ironing board which was delivered to our room free of charge. There was also a very good laundromat close by. Location was very handy to access Heathrow airport for the Paddington Express (especially if these strikes continue). You could even base yourself here as the tube from Paddington connects to all the main areas. Breakfast was very good as well, though we paid extra for that, it was worth it. Some good restaurants and pubs near by. Would stay here again.",5,2015,09,10
104,Nice hotel premium location,"Very nice hotel with comfortable and clean rooms . Service is excellent stuff very polite and welcoming staff . You do feel almost like at home .
Location is great in nice part of paddington with good conectivity . Nice hyde park is at 15 min walk .
They have a restaurant which is a bit odd for breakfast only but accomodating me with my gluten-free diet was lovely .Bathroom very nice with great water pressure and very clean .",5,2015,09,09
104,Well positioned near Kensington Gardens and Hyde park ,"Nice hotel, mid range, clean and comfortable. The room was not massive but perfectly adequate for an overnight stay. Small bar area which is not inviting but does the job. Would recommend for a mid range hotel, all the staff team were very engaging and professional :) ",3,2015,09,09
104,Superb staff - delighted with the service,"Having stayed in a number of the neighbouring hotels in recent weeks, I have now found the one I will use again without question. Upon arrival I was greeted by a gentleman named Sakar, who was exceptionally polite and helpful and despite my company messing up with sending payment details through (they more often than not do this), was very helpful and called them on my behalf to sort it all out whilst I was able to relax with a drink at the bar. The rooms are perfectly equipped, clean and comfortable - you really couldn's ask for more - especially at this price!! I'd highly recommend this hotel to all.",5,2015,09,07
104,Perfect stay for London outskit,"Our room was a delux double room: great shower pressure, modern decor. Cleaners were wonderful and did a great job of the general upkeep ever day. 
Things missing: no iron/board in room, had to ring in for one each time we wanted to use it.
No face cloths. Like, at all. I found that really strange.
The bed was rock solid hard.
Generally the staff were fair and friendly. We were about a 5 minute walk from Paddington station or Lancaster square. Hyde park was in walking distance. The hotel was nice and quiet. But I would not recommend staying there to my family or friends - nothing to do with the hotel, let me stress that, because it was fine in itself and fine if you don't mind travelling on the tube every day, we did it everyday for the 5 days we were there and let me tell you - it does get exhausting. If we did it again we would 100% stay in Trafalgar square/ Covent garden area, simply because that really is the heart of London. We were travelling to Trafalgar square every day and then going on our excursions from there. If you're a first timer to London like we were- stay somewhere near Trafalgar or convent garden. We chose it because it was cheaper, but would probably spend a bit more to be closer to town. 
Room service was good. And they had free wifi.",3,2015,09,07
104,conviniently located,"It is one of those places you pick because of the location...well' surprise it took me 20 minutes to locate it despite the GPS, the maps and all...it is probably just me! Anyway the service is good and the staff is helpful..the rooms are small and average but ok for 1-2 nights stay.",3,2015,09,06

Thank you sakar from room 806 ",5,2015,09,05
104,Average or below.,"I had a five nights stay in August. A location is perfect 5 minutes walk to London Paddington or Lancaster stations. Check in was fast but I realize that the staff never smiles which was kept allover my stay. The hotel did not care about my recommendation in online booking when I asked for a hard pillow. The room was very small but well arranged it got unpleasant decoration including the carpets and the wall color. The AC was not working but thanks God London was work at this time. The window was leaking air with another unpleasant view. The corridor was ancient and smelly. Amenities were basic, but enough. The bathroom was small but well arranged. The towels were smelly.
Sleeping was OK. The staffs were helpful when asking but never smile when facing customers also did not look overloaded. The hotel did not contain any facilities and I wonder how it got 4 stars. Check out was express and it was the best thing happened during my stay.
In summary, I won't be staying again.",2,2015,09,05
104,Superb,I stayed there in june with my family and last week as a business visitor. Its a superbly located hotel. Everything what i needed as a family and a business visitor is jist stones throaway. Paddington station is just 2 min walk..yet this hotel is in a quiet place. Though the rooms are a bit small the service levels are of top notch quality. Especially there is a gentlman called anthony at the mini restaurent who takes care of you as if you are one of his family members..exceptional..these guys are flexible as well and will try to accomodate any special requests you may have...great job guys keep it up...,5,2015,09,05
104,Business trip,"I love this  hotel hotel Park grand london hyde Park very much. It is very close to my office at Sheldon square Paddington station. I like Sakar and May, the way they present themselves. He made me an Indian masala tea and it was amazing. He goes out of his way to make customers happy. Nice hotel.  Nice staff. Rooms are not too big but good based on the price here in central London.  Thank you Sakar. Thank you Park Grant. Will look forward to come again.",5,2015,09,04
104,"Great hotel, great and friendly staff","My first visit to London, I stayed at Park Grand Hotel, and it was an amazing 10 days stay over. I really liked the staff,they were very friendly, helpful, and amazing. I would also really like to mention their names for any future reference because they were really there for me whenever i needed help and they deserve a positive recommendation. the receptionists are Sakar, Velenia, Adriana, and Lucian. I would highly recommend this hotel overall. Cheers",5,2015,09,03
104,"Fantastic value, nice boutique hotel...","Great service, quick check in, breakfast included, nice clean room (worth upgrading to a club double) all for a very reasonable rate.

Although the hotel is close to Paddington tube, it is situated further outside of the West End than I normally like to stay. Upon having a late night, and missing the last tube the taxi fare was very expensive (as are the tube fares nowadays) thanks Boris!",4,2015,09,03
104,"""excellent experience""",It was an excellent experience.the place is affordable and the staff was really very helpful.rooms were comfortable and very clean.the location is also very convenient.i will happily come back again when visiting london.speacial thanks to the indian girl named sanya from the staff for helping with names of nice places to eat in london.hotel restaurant serves excellent food aswell. I recommend this hotel to everyone.5 stars cheers,5,2015,09,02
104,good hotel,"it was first class supper<< wonderful I will be back again.
I would recommencement to another,I was so happy with the Hotel .

I will be back again. My family so happy. The Hotel was fantastic, the staffs was helpeful, 5 star",5,2015,09,01
104,Not coming back,"The room was too small, not enough space on the wardrobe. 
The first night somebody near our room was making a party in their room and we couldn't sleep until they stopped the music. Nobody called their attention from the hotel.
Breakfast was minumum. They serve exactly the minimum types of food that you can expect from a breakfast buffet, and for the price they charge it's not worthy.

The toilet was trapped. They said the would send someone to fix it but they didn't.
At the bar,when we arrive at 12 the person was almost closing, by law service has to be opened until 2,  the waiter didn't know the drinks we were ordering, even though they were there, he could't see them. And they didn't have ice in the whole hotel to serve our drinks. 
A complete failure.",1,2015,09,01
104,London Stay,"Needed an affordable hotel in the Paddington area and this ticked all the boxes. I initially only booked by myself to get a comfy bed and Park Grand did not disappoint there. They also provided great service (most important) and the staff seemed genuinely interested in helping and going out of their way to do so. Special mention to Sakar, Adriana, Alex, Lucian and the rest of the concierge team for their help during my stays (for 1 night and then 3 nights) - especially for booking my windsor and hampton court tour.
Much appreciated - thanks guys! Will recommend it for anyone coming to London. 
Cheers from Australia",5,2015,08,30
104,Hotel stay,"What a wonderful hotel with the most welcoming staff.   The bedroom was attractive, clean and comfortable with so many extras like fruit and snacks and drinks.
The breakfast was excellent, with a wide choice..
We shall certainly return when next in London, and we recommend this lovely
hotel to everyone.
The manager and receptionist Sanya went out of their way to please and made us feel at home.",4,2015,08,30
104,Comfortable Holiday!,"Very helpful and friendly staff.  Ms.Sanya, Ms Mayya, Mr.Gurdeep, Mr.Lucian. Mr.Alex in the front office took care of our daily program and made it easy and comfortable as we are senior citizens with walking disability. At the breakfast table was Mr.Anthony who made the unchanging breakfast menu tasty with his attention. All in all it was a comfortable centrally located hotel with friendly staff. (If I have missed the names other helpful staff it is unintentional)",4,2015,08,30
104,Was concerned but need not have been.,"Booked 2 nights in a twin room directly with hotel after finding it on a discount site and then checking on the hotel site directly to see if price was cheaper, the hotel itself was cheaper so booked with them. My mum and I were arriving in London early morning so I knew that our room would not be ready but we dropped our bags off in order to start our fun around London.  The reception staff could not be more helpful or attentive and we're apologetic that our room was not ready, I would not have expected it have been as most London hotels I have stayed in are strict on their check in policies. 
The hotel is ideally located as a base to explore London.  It's a 5 minute walk to Paddington station in one direction and 5 minutes to Lancaster Gate and Kensington Gardens in the other. 
I had booked a twin room, and yes some would say small but it is London and what space do you need? The room was clean and fresh. Plenty of towels both in the room and bathroom. Plenty of tea and coffee and fresh fruit. Yes the room was slightly warm but everywhere was warm in London while were there, can not blame the hotel for that. 
Could not fault breakfast. Full choice of cereals, toast, fruit, yoghurt,  cooked, pastries and the waiting  staff were helpful but not intrusive. Yes the restaurant is in the basement but again what do people expect? Roof terrace with hanging baskets? I really feel that some of the 'not so polite ' reviews on here are by travellers who need a reality check. Breakfast meant that did not have to eat in till tea time on both days and we had to walk the lengths of London and carry bags of shopping much to our husbands dismay to burn it off!
Granted we were out enjoying all that London had to offer whilst down there and used the room and hotel as a base. I will most definately use it again. 
The staff were extremely friendly and polite and need to be praised highly for this. It has to be said maybe some customers need to realise that a kind word gets more results than ranting. I witnessed  hotel staff being extremely polite and friendly at all times to fellow guests who were not the same back. 
A huge thumbs up from me and will definately be staying again in the future. ",5,2015,08,29
104,Good for the price,"Located very centrally between the paddington and lancaster gate stations, the hotel though small was good enough for my one night stay. the rooms are small and the route from the reception to the room is a bit odd, possibly because of the way the hotel is constructed. if you have heavy luggage getting to rooms around 106 etc is some fun. I'm not commenting on the other floors and one shouldn't assume all are this way, there were lifts to other floors. Once in the room, these don't matter and is sound sleep. the breakfast for GBP 10 was comparable to other places and was quite filling. for london standards, the price of GBP 80 was a steal. rooms were spic and span. overall a good bargain for a short stay . ",4,2015,08,28
104,Anniversary ,"Excellent room, fantastic service and very friendly staff. The hotel is in a great location and does have a few car parking spaces which you do have to pay ¬£20 for however the very affordable price for the room compensates for that. Enjoyed my stay and will most definitely stay there again.",5,2015,08,28
104,Nice hotel shame about parking charges ...,"Nothing is to much of an issue and the staff did everything to make my stay as great as is possible. Being disabled they found me a room to suit my needs. If there was one issue I have it is the ¬£20 per day parking charge which luckily I was only there for 2 days but this was an additional ¬£40 I had to pay. I don't have any choice but to use my car, I was promised that the manager would look into but nothing ever happened. I can recommend the hotel if you arrive by public transport but because of the parking charges I would not stop there again, a hotel just down the road I've found out makes no charge.",3,2015,08,27
104,As good as it gets.,"If you want a comfortable, clean, efficiently run hotel within 5 mins walk of Paddington Station that won't cost an arm and a leg, you won't beat this place. I've stayed here several times on business trips and the unfailingly polite staff now greet me like an old friend. Sakar, the manager, is always especially helpful, and goes out of his way to ensure that my stay is problem free and pleasant. If you book with them direct - rather than a discount website - the excellent breakfast is complimentary, and the bar just off reception - unlike many small hotel bars - really is a nice place to nag out after a busy day in the city. As Arnie said, ""I'll be back""",5,2015,08,26
104,Lovely boutique hotel :),"Stayed here for 3nights over Easter with my boyfriend for both our birthdays... I had never been to London before and this hotel was the perfect first stay

Check in was quick and staff were friendly.

We got put in a two storey room which was lovely. Bathroom was modern, good size room, great storage, comfy bed.

We didn't spend a lot of time in the room but what we did was lovely and comfortable.

The breakfast was brilliant with a wide range of choice for all appetites.

Hotel was slightly overpriced at ¬£437 for three nights but this could be down to it being bank holiday.

Would definately return and recommend.

",4,2015,08,24
104,Very Happy Stay,"We have just returned from a very pleasant 3 night stay at The Park Grand Hyde Park. We had a nice room that was roomy which is unusual for London. We have stayed in London 3 times in the past 12 months and this is by far our new favourite. The location is good, near Hyde Park and walking distance to Oxford Street. It was our 25th Wedding Anniversary whilst we were there and on our return from the day  sightseeing had a lovely surprise waiting for us in our room which was a very nice touch. The staff were very polite and extremely helpful from the moment we entered to the time we left, nothing seemed to be too much trouble and i must in particular mention Valerie who is a very helpful and a credit to the hotel. We will definitely be returning to The Park Grand on our next visit to London.",5,2015,08,21

104,"First choice for London stays: friendly staff, ideal location, great rooms, & GLUTEN FREE breakfasts!","I've been traveling from Cornwall to London each week for nearly a year now, and am really happy to have found the Park Grand, London Hyde Park as a 'home from home' base.

The staff are always really friendly, especially Sanya on reception who's usually working when I arrive, and when I leave at the end of the week.  

All the rooms are well presented, the beds are wonderfully comfortable, and as an extra bonus, I can get a safe hot gluten free breakfast! Ideal for taking the stress away for a working coeliac traveler.

Great location for getting into the centre or out to places like Camden Town or Hackney by bus or tube for live music events in the evenings too.",5,2015,08,19

104,Not a triple but priced like one,"We rented a triple room, paid for a triple, but ended up what looked to me like a double with our teenage son sleeping on a pull-out chair.  I wouldn't mind the pull-out, except this was the only chair, and once his bed was open, there was no room for us to move around or even open our cases.  I wouldn't have even minded the crowding if we had paid for a double. 

Also, the room reeked of cheap cleaning products - absolutely overwhelming, and I have never complained about such a thing before. The air conditioner was broken.  The bathroom had one of those trendy sinks but no countertop to speak of.  

To be fair: The shower was excellent. And the location was good.

Will not use this chain again.",1,2015,08,15
104,Great service!!!

The breakfast was free and delicious. Really we feel comfortable while staying in this hotel .no noise ,and no loud voices. 
Next time again we will book in the same hotel.",4,2015,08,14
104,Comfortable central hotel,"Stayed here with my 2 teenage kids. It's about 5 mins walk from Paddington tube and is in a quietish road off the main road.

Reception staff were pleasant and helpful. The card reader was on a go slow though.

The lift was reasonably sized but only one lift so got busy on check out.

The room was acceptable in size for London. The room was twin beds and a sofa bed, all were comfortable.

TV had the usual free chanels. Wifi worked but was variable at peak times.

Ward robe was small and not really big enough for 3 people. Shower room was well presented. Large walk in shower. Not much shelf space to put toiletries for 3 people though.

We didn't eat at the hotel, as I prefer to explore the places i go and I can never understand how on booking sites the breakfast can cost ¬£15 etc.

Overall this was ideal for our weekend break. Probably would have been cramped if staying for a week though.

Bakerloo line to Paddington was the most efficient service.",4,2015,08,14
104,Did not feel like 4*,"Lots of positives about this hotel and great value for London but didn't have the feel of a 4* hotel. Location is good and parking a bonus, especially as you park right outside front door but set back from road. Rooms tiny but expected that. Top quality Grohe bathroom fittings but slightly scruffy bedroom furniture seemed a mismatch. Fridge/minibar in room but empty and switched off? Thought all 4* have minibar. No pay to view movies. Fruit plate nice notion but just 2 clingwrapped apples. Breakfast excellent and decor nice. ",3,2015,08,12
104,""" Loved it ""","Absolutely loved my stay in this hotel last month . My mate and I spent 1 night here but we wish we were there longer !

The hotel itself is very cosy ,  lovely and a cute bar near reception . 
I have to give a big well done and thank you to all the staff at park grand who were absolutely wondetful !!!!!!

Thank you,5,2015,08,10
104,"Perfect ""Home"" for One","With the original plans tossed out the window three days prior to departure, I booked a single room at this lovely, quiet hotel.  Those seeking voracious space will not be amused.  I was, however, delighted, and felt at home immediately.  I appreciated the tea/coffee and cookies in my room each night before bed!  

Close to Paddington Station, (and The Pride of Paddington Pub) so taking the Tube or National Rail is not a hassle.  Breakfast offerings (buffet) were hot and fresh; wait staff very pleasant.  

I would stay here again, without a question.  Next time would be with my family for sure!",4,2015,08,09

104,"Lovely staff, shame about the hotel ","Think the featured pictures on the website have been photoshopped!! Whilst I cannot fault the staff who were lovely and polite, the whole place needs a bit of a refresh. The outside looked drab, the first room smelt of old food so we were happily moved by the helpful team on the front desk. The 2nd room was better but still quite small. The bathroom could only stand 1 person upright at a time. Not sure I'd agree it's 4* - it's felt marginally better than a travel lodge. ",2,2015,08,06

104,Enjoying stay,"What a great stay at this hotel! As the location was perfect and price range was reasonable and the rooms are clean and perfect, comparing to other hotels.
I enjoyed staying there because the staff managed to give me a quiet room to stay in as it was the most important thing. 
The hotel location was perfect, because the paddington station and the main rail station were 3 minutes away. it's useful for people who like to travel from place to another. 
Lovely stay, lovely staff and amazing price.

Special thanks to Valeria and Lucian who made my stay such an amazing time.",5,2015,08,04
104,very pleasant stay,"I stayed for one night in a quadruple room with 2 double beds with my partner and my teenage children. The beds were exceptionally comfortable, and the room was so quiet (we were at the back of the hotel) even though we were in Paddington and close to so many amenities. Everything was very clean and breakfast was nice with usual cereals, fruit juice, yogurt, pastries and cooked food. In the room, there were plenty of tea and coffee, biscuits, bottled water and some fruit. Easy accessible Wifi.

This was not an issue for us as we were only staying 1 night but there was only 1 single wardrobe in this room for 4. For a stay of 1-3 nights, I don't think that would be an issue for most people. 

This hotel is a few minutes walk from Paddington station and we were able to walk to Hyde park and Oxford street without the expense of using the tube. We would definitely use again.",5,2015,08,03
104,Great family room in London,"My family (two parents and two teenagers) stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park in late July 2015.  The hotel is an older and quirky building that has lots of charm and is located in a fantastic area of London near Paddington station, Hyde Park and Nottinghill/Portobello Rd.  Our quad room was small but clean and it also had a safe.  Breakfast was included (when booked through the hotel's own website) and it was excellent.  The hotel is in a wonderful part of London and is very close to a major subway station that links to the rest of the city.  We would definitely stay again at the Park Grand London Hyde Park hotel.",5,2015,08,01
104,Great Hotel,"Love the place, well located, lots of restaurants, Paddington station right there.
The hotel is clean, the customer service is really good.the rooms are small but comfortables.
My family and I enjoyed our stay there.",5,2015,07,31
104,Good as Ever,"Another enjoyable stay at the Park Grand London Hyde Park. Fast & efficient checkin from friendly and informative staff. Excellent bi-level suite room, with bedroom on lower floor, extremely clean and small kitchen area well stocked with free water, soft drinks and bottle of wine. En-suite shower room a little on small side but more than adequate for Business Trip purposes, with plentiful toiletries including shaving/dental kits so need to bring any in flight hand luggage. Good choice of hot/cold buffet at breakfast time, with good service. I like location of hotel near to Paddington for Heathrow Express and stayed a few times now, with no complaints on any stay. Will definitely return on next trip to London. Thanks to all for making my stay most enjoyable.",4,2015,07,29
104,Well worth the money,"Staff gave us a warm welcome as we entered and all staff were friendly and helpful. When you think of a London Hotel, it is always the high cost or being ripped off we all think about. THINK AGAIN. Value for money, central location (Lancaster Gate tube and buses into central London around the corner), Paddington just a 6 minute walk. Even using the odd taxi into Oxford Street did not cost the earth. Front of house staff were helpful and gave advice if you asked. Did not feel intimiated at all in the surrounding area.
Club Room excellent, lovely and spacious, two chairs, fridge, coffee making facilities and plenty of wardrobe space and drawers for storage. We we in a room at the side of the hotel and could not hear any traffic or other guests. Bed was comfortable and lovely and firm.
Well done to all team at Park Grand London Hyde Park. I will be happy to",4,2015,07,29
104,An Enjoyable Stay ,"We are a family of four and had stayed here for 6 nights in a superior quadruple room. Well, after reading tons of reviews, we knew what we would be expecting. Yes hotel was abit dated, size of room was small but it was sufficient for the four of us. Bathroom was also small, the triangular shower cubicle was tiny, we could hear people walking on top of us. All of these were expected. The good things about this hotel was its location, it's only a  5 min walk to Paddington station while located on the quiet Westbourne Terrace, check in was swift, all the hotel staff we have met were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was tasty although there wasnt too much variety. We especially like the sausages and pastries. Room although small but kept very clean, everyone who knows me know I am very picky person on this. Bedsheets and towels were changed everyday although not really necessary for us. Toiletries,  tea/coffee and biscuits were also replenished everyday. We usually went out for 10 to 11 hours straight but would always come back with Lucian greeting us at the main entrance. Thank you all Park Grand London Hyde Park Team for making our stay such an enjoyable one. Keep up the good work guys and although housekeeping had accidentally rolled away my daughter's favorite stuffed toy, a very cute penguin which I love too, I would still give this hotel a 4 star !",4,2015,07,28
104,Fantastic Staff ! A gem of a hotel in Central London,"My Wife and I stayed here with our 3 sons, 9,12,14. We booked 2 double rooms at 24 hours notice with an extra bed for the 9 year old. When we arrived, we had been upgraded to a duplex treble room studio for the kids and our room was set up as a ""romantic suite"" with complimentary wine/fruit/minerals. We had the best full English breakfast of our trip the following morning and they allowed us park our car for the day after checking out so we could go shopping. On our,return, our boarding cards for flights home had been printed for us and we were offered complimentary tea/coffee before leaving. Overall, the staff could not do enough for us. We will be back!",5,2015,07,26
104,Highly recommended hotel,"Lovely hotel! Staff very friendly and helpful, Sakar gave lots of advice on places to visit and nearby places of interest and nice restaurants and made us feel very welcome. Very good location, walking distance to Hyde park and Marble Arch, Hyde park is an amazing area to walk around and explore. Our room was fantastic and children were absolutely delighted with it, it made our stay in London extremely enjoyable. Breakfast was lovely, good food and lots of choice, and again staff lovely and always happy to bring over teas and coffee. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again this year!",5,2015,07,26
104,A last minute one night stay.,"I booked this hotel on the move and needed something close to Paddington, coming off the Heathrow Express late at night. To be honest, there are so many terrible hotels in London that i didn't have high hopes... however... This one was different. The front desk staff were super friendly and chatted to me whilst checking in, which in general doesn't happen too often in London! It was a bit of an ""old school"" good service, they had a bell boy bring my luggage up and called the room after about 5 minutes to see if everything was ok, really nice touches! I just had a single room which was small, but all I needed. the room was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was compact and modern and the water pressure was great.
I honestly can't fault it, I will definitely stay here again. I would recommend to anyone wanting something that you can walk to Bayswater/ Queensway area as well as Notting Hill/ Portobello Road. It won't break the bank and the staff are so welcoming.",4,2015,07,26
104,Great place would come again!!!!,"We stayed here for one night and the room was fabulous. Really 

friendly staff and was treated very 

well, one member of staff who was the most helpful was sakar who 
couldn't do enough for us.. Will be coming back 5******
 Clean and tidy rooms and bed was comfortable and also the location was perfect.

Breakfast is brilliant, help yourself buffet and the restaurant staff are very attentive.",5,2015,07,26
104,Park Grand London Hyde Park Stay,I stayed at this hotel from 18 July till 25 July. Hotel is well located and near to 2 stations i.e. within 10 min walk. Rooms are good and English breakfast is excellent. The staff is very good and am more impressed with hospitality of one Mr.Sakar. He takes good care of the guests by knowing their requirements. I would certainly return to this hotel next time as well and hope Mr.Sakar continues here along with his excellent service.,4,2015,07,26

104,Senior analyst- edgeverve,"The hotel is very nice, homely. Breakfast was really good, room service was excellent. The staff were very helpful...especially I would like to mention Sakar who was instrumental in assisting us throughout our stay and made it more pleasant and comfortable.......I would consider him as one of the most valuable employees of the hotel .....
",5,2015,07,25
104,Excellent hotel!,"I stayed here with my friend for a girly few days in London. We arrived 2 hours before check in and were warmly welcomed by the hotel staff who checked us in quickly and were  shown to our room by a very pleasant young man.
The room  consisted of 2 single beds pushed together and were so comfortable we even tried to see what make the mattress was as my friend would like to purchase one. When we looked the mattress was immaculate and even had dates on the corners for when the mattress should be turned! (No make on mattress though : (    )
The shower was powerful and easy to control.  When we couldn't see an iron and ironing board the reception had one sent to the room within minutes. The only downside was the fridge was not working but we did not mention this at the time. 
The hotel is so quiet and 5 minutes walk from Paddington station. It's set on a tree lined street away from hustle and bustle. 
We did have breakfast on both days and again the staff were always smiling  and pleasant. The room is admittingly small but we had no problem being seated. The breakfast is nice and replenished constantly.
I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning here myself. 
On our departure they were more than happy to hold on to our luggage  for several hours while we squeezed in more shopping before our train left.

A quick note the management of this hotel....... your staff are exceptional!!!
Please pass on my appreciation to them. See you again soon.",5,2015,07,24
104,Good quality and Friendly Staff,"Very friendly staff and good quality rooms, some rooms can be small but no more than other hotels at a similar or higher cost. Staff are helpful and friendly and the breakfast is standard, but has everything you would need (hot and cold food).",5,2015,07,24
104,Service was delightful,"Even though we arrived earlier than expected the hotel manager pulled out all the stops to get us a room early unfortunately we still waited an hour and because of that the manager upgraded our room at no extra charge!
I have stayed here at least 5 times and the service and helpfulness of the staff has always been of the highest quality.
The rooms are spotless and the beds are amazingly comfortable.
I would recommend anyone to stay here when visiting London its 5 minutes walk to Paddington station.",5,2015,07,24
104,Fabulous hotel,In London for few days. This hotel is the best. Staff excellent especially Sakar (10 out of 10!) Made us all feel very welcome and couldn't do enough to help us. Would recommend it. Close to Hyde Park and St Paul's. Definitely be back here again. Thank you Sakar for making our stay so pleasant.,5,2015,07,23
104,Enjoyable stay in a clean and comfortable hotel  ,"We decided to stay at the four star AA rated hotel after reading  the good reviews.  We were spending four nights at the hotel for our 13th anniversary. It was a great location, easy to get around London. The hotel was clean and all staff are very attentive and extremely helpful.  The hotel provided us with a complementary bottle of champagne and fruit to celebrate our  anniversary. . ",4,2015,07,22
104,Convenient Location,"Hotel is walkable distance from Paddington  Station, having connections to Heathrow Airport, Tube railway & First Great Western Railway. Location is convenient to move around city, through any kind of transport. Reception is good.The room on the ground floor is neat but very congested, it may be, because I had opted for Single bed accommodation. The AC  was not satisfactory as it might need servicing or replacement. Staff are friendly. Complementary Buffet  Breakfast is nice & satisfying.",4,2015,07,22
104,Nice service but not great,"I would urge extreme caution when reading the reviews of this hotel.
Its ok. The staff are nice.
The rooms - and i looked at 3 of them - are very very small, I couldn't turn round in the shower. 
The rooms have windows that belong on a 1970s office building and the air conditioning is rudimentary at best and noisy.
My bedding was far from spotless and the general air of it being slightly grimy is hard to ignore.
The corridors are dusty and very old feeling.
The breakfast in a basement room was fine.
Overall im very shocked this is a 4 star hotel. It merits three at best i would say.",2,2015,07,20
104,"""""Enjoyable stay with my family in London """"","I stayed at this hotel with my wife and my two kids .
Hotel is clean , rooms are very descent size , shower is just the way I wanted . Housekeeping staff are very good at their job , my room is always spotless clean 
Hotel is situated near Paddington station , which is short distance walk . 
Breakfast is superb, I love this hotel and service provided . 
Mr sakar has always been helpful towards my questions and his hospitality towards his guest is simply outstanding. 
Mr Anthony ( restaurant manager ) has always provided my needs at the restaurant. Service is brilliant and very organised . 
All staff are very helpful and friendly . 
I always walk towards the Paddington station which is a very friendly neighbourhood, 
Oxford street , Marble Arch is not too far . 
There is a awesome HYDE PARK , which is the attraction of London is 10 mins walk from hotel . 
I had a very enjoyable stay at park grand . 
Very week managed and the only best in Paddington areas . 
Thank you park grand and thank you MR SAKAR for making my stay enjoyable ",5,2015,07,19
104,An enjoyable Stay,"I booked here for my wife who was traveling to London alone. She was more than happy with her stay. The hotel staff are very friendly and professional. The rooms are well kept and clean, although the upper floors are much quieter than the ground levels. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and quite sumptuous. I would recommend it to my friends who are looking for efficient, functional and comfortable stay.",4,2015,07,18
104,Great place!,"Decent sized compared to the rest of the hotels in the same bracket, very helpful staff 'Ivan' specifically the night in charge was super helpful. The hotel even offers a parking which is rare again for london hotels, (at a price obviously). 
.",5,2015,07,17
104,Not Bad!,The staff in this hotel were very professional kind and friendly. the hotel was clean and modern. The rooms were of a generous size for London and breakfast was self service and again all the staff were polite,4,2015,07,17
104,Watch out for the basement rooms!,"Ok, so it was a reduced rate on last minute.com and it is very convenient for Paddington and Hyde park  but this single room in a basement is really very small indeed. In a relatively quiet street in central west London and smartly presented this hotel looks elegant enough and the staff are friendly. I'm sure the rooms above ground are spacious and light but these converted box  rooms in the basement are not! If you were planning to swing a cat you would be disappointed! The space has been converted cleverly and so it does ""work"" just but the sound of running water down drain pipes past the bed head and the smell of cooking for the kitchen extract don't make for q great experience. So if you get offered a room that begins with ""0"" I'd have a good look before you accept. ",2,2015,07,17
104,Average,"My review of this hotel is that it is just very average. I had a one night stay in July.  I'll split it down for ease:

Check in
Somewhat condescending attitude from the check in staff and I'm not really sure why.  I was asked to provide photo ID which is odd, and joining their loyalty scheme was forced on me to some extent, by including the application form in things I needed to sign. 
I was on business and my company uses a travel agent who pre-pay bookings with a credit card.  There was much consternation over this  which meant I had to wait 15 minutes in the reception area whilst they sorted it out. This is not an uncommon problem, but most hotels just allow you to go to your room and they make a phone call and sort it.  I'd had a long day so this grated somewhat. It was also the assumption that I was basically there to try and run off without paying.  
I was asked to pre-authorise ¬£10 on my credit card as well, despite my bill being pre-paid.  Baffling. 

Room
When this was finally sorted the check in desk advised me I had been upgraded to an executive club double room.  Excellent I thought, this will be nice.   On opening the door the room was large for London but tired.  Ancient single glazed windows, no iron or ironing board (essential on business) but it did have aircon and a nice bathroom,  although I would not describe the tiling as having been done by someone who knew what they were doing.
Amenities were basic, very miserable selection of tea and coffee and pretty low rent cosmetics.
I slept OK, but it was noisy and hot. They provided me with a lethal ironing board that collapsed at random.

Breakfast
Another massive debate about whether my breakfast was pre-paid on arrival in the basement breakfast room.  Eventually they agreed, made me feel like I was again trying to steal it.  I wasn't offered coffee and the food was average at best.

Check out
Quick and simple, but no-one asked me how my stay was. I would have advised them of the above. 

In summary, I won't be staying again. Unsure of who offered them 4 stars, but I'd say three was about right.  ",3,2015,07,15
104,Exellent and generous service,"I have just checked into the Park Grand Hotel (London Hyde Park) and was greeted with a smile straight away. I work for a charitable organisation and the booking agent we use got the booking wrong (which is not the first time), the booking should have been for a double but instead a single room was booked. The reception staff where extremely helpful and contacted the booking agent on my behalf to try and resolve the issue. I mentioned to the gentlemen on reception (Sakar) which charity I work for and without hesitation he said he was a keen supporter of the charity and offered to move me to a double room without any charge to the charity. What a kind and generous gesture towards the charity I work for. If that doesn‚Äôt give you peace of mind to stay at the Park Grand Hotel nothing will! Thanks very much Sakar.",5,2015,07,13
104,Overnight stay ,"Lovely, friendly staff. Clean, spacious deluxe triple room. Nice varied cooked & continental breakfast for ¬£10, ¬£5 for children. Great location, walking distance to Paddington underground, stretch of bars, shops & restaurant 5 minute walk away. ",4,2015,07,13
104,Adequate for a short stay,"First time I've spent a couple of nights in London for some years, this hotel was quite reasonable by London standards although significantly more expensive than comparable hotels in other cities. Small rooms and pretty noisy around the lifts and hallways. Location is okay as not to far from Paddington tube station and a bonus to find it pretty much on the Big Bus hop on hop off bus route. ",3,2015,07,13
104,Gem Near Paddington,"This hotel saved us. We had booked into another nearby and were terribly disappointed! Went searching for a better stay and Park Grand more than satisfied.  The front desk ladies worked extra hard to help us and truly saved our stay in London. The room was lovely, quiet and the breakfast was wonderful.  The location is great. Short walk to Paddington station and several other tube stops. Some great restaurants nearby and easy access to Hyde Park and beyond. A delightful stay!!",5,2015,07,12
104,Excellent,"Nice quiet room, free wifi, nice people and very good breakfast! I have stayed at several other hotels in the area but normally the breakfast has cheap ingredients, not here. Staff at front desk also very helpful.",5,2015,07,09
104,Three night quick turnaround trip to London,"I was travelling alone from Paris on Eurostar and had planned a few days of reunion with my good friends who were staying in Central London. I used the London Underground to get from St. Pancras to Paddington station and called the reservation number to get directions to the hotel from Paddington station. The person connected me to the front desk of the hotel and I spoke to a Ms. Valeria who was very clear and precise in providing directions to the hotel as I walked there (7 min walk).  Since I was coming from Paris where even the Information Desk provides little or no information, this was such a pleasant change!!! As it turned out Ms. Valeria was the person who checked me in and recognized that it was I she had provided the directions to.  Since I was from the US, she was honest enough to warn me that the single-person room I had booked online, by US standards, would seem small.  She offered to let me view the room and then decide if I wanted to upgrade to a larger room.  She proactively spoke to her colleagues and supervisor to move me the next day (all I had to do was to be packed to be moved) to a larger room.  However, since I was travelling alone, it was adequate for my purpose and did not bother to move ‚Äì but the thought that she had pre-planned it with her colleagues was great.   My interaction at the front desk was mainly with Ms. Valeria but everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful.  Ms. Valeria was courteous, attentive, professional, helpful and pleasant on every occasion.  However, I could see that the porters were also available for helping customers with loading and unloading the cars or families with strollers.
While the room was compact, it was adequate ‚Äì clean everything, a good-sized safe (with a small light that comes on when you first open it), tea kettle available in the room and some biscuits too!! ÔÅä

Great value for the money, considering the Hyde Park location and close proximity to Paddington station for getting to Heathrow on the London Express!!!  The staff was so courteous and helpful that I have to say that this cannot be just a coincidence, but it also reflects very well on the hotel‚Äôs management policy to be welcoming and obliging to their customers.  Extremely pleased !!!",5,2015,07,07
104,Business trip - parking was a plus! ,"Nice hotel, small room (but big enough for 1) good service, plus was great to have parking onsite for ¬£20!! with no need to book. 

Right next to station (5mins by foot) and really near some great restaurants and pubs. 

Recommend for any business trip.  ",3,2015,07,07
104,"Great hotel, excellent breakfast, good value, wonderful and attentive staff","We stayed in a quadruple room (two double beds) with 3 adults and an infant. The room was large enough to accommodate us. Good location, close to Notting Hill and the Portobello Road market. I'd recommend purchasing breakfast for 10 pounds (each) at check-in; it's a very good value as the breakfast was excellent (scrambled eggs, sausage, ham, beans, potatoes, roasted tomatoes, pastries, milk, oj, coffee and tea, as well as some fresh fruit and cheese). The staff, especially porters, were wonderful. They helped us numerous times getting our stroller in and out of the hotel, and, even once, down the stairs as the elevator was too crowded. Good value.",4,2015,07,06
104,Overnight stay - recommend it,"We were coming from Bristol and wanted to stay somewhere close to Paddington Station since we were flying out of Heathrow the following day. We didn't want to stay right by the station, but close enough that we could easily walk there. The hotel is about 12mins walk from the Station on a lovely street in Westminster. The hotel was exactly what we had expected from the reviews we read on tripadvisor. The staff was friendly and the room had plenty of space with the loft upstairs. Most importantly, it had AC in the room because it was stinking hot in London that week.",4,2015,07,06
104,Recent stay at Park Grand hotel.,Had very good service on check in from helpful staff.  Room was as requested and very clean; on the small side is only to be expected in central London. Hotel is well located for Paddington station. Efficient service the best feature; dining room the only negative as this did become congested.,4,2015,07,05
104,overnight stay in london,very nice hotel nice clean and tidy very friendly staff nice breakfast and the aircon in the room was very welcome as 36 c outside !!! would definitely go back and the separate area in the room of microwave fridge and another tv was superb,4,2015,07,05
104,Awesome stay,"I stayed at this hotel with my family .
I booked for 5 nights . Checking was very smooth , room was spacious,  breakfast was lovely .
Hotel is near Hyde park and Lancaster guest and Paddington stations .
I love everything in this hotel from 
Front desk staff to restaurant and housekeeping .
I booked directly from their site therefore breakfast complimentary. 
I have ephasize MR SAKAR & MS ADRIANA .
WHO are very helpful with my query and made my stay memoryable .
Obviously all staff are very helpful too .
I am surely be back to hotel in my next year trip to Uk .
And will decimate ly have a superpower stay like this time .
Thank you .",5,2015,07,03
104,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed 2 nights on business during a very hot few days in London. Walkable from Paddington, hotel was spotless and cool - air conditioning had been switched on in the room, which was very weclomed. Staff were very friendly.",4,2015,07,03
104,Good stopover location,"Stayed for two nights during the week for business meetings. The rooms were clean and bright and staff were pleasant. 

Breakfast was standard hotel fare and they only have a bar menu during the day/evening but the hotel is well placed for Paddington and Lancaster Gate so there are plenty of options on the door stop. 

We stayed during a particularly warm week and the aircon in my room was broken; I was moved to a different room and the receptionist got a colleague to double check it was cool before I moved.",4,2015,07,03
104,First stay,"I booked this hotel for my daughter and I to stay in, as we were attending a concert at Hyde Park. This hotel is in a great location for this purpose, with lots of small restaurants and pubs to eat in nearby. The staff at check in were excellent and we received a particularly warm greeting, we were asked why we were in London and what were our plans, I was very impressed. Our room was lovely and clean and very spacious. Although very central, there was no noise and upon checkout the concierge looked after our bags all day, so that we did not have to trail them around London. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,03
104,"Great location, Super staff!","I chose this hotel because of its central location. But what surprised me is the outstanding staff: I was received at the reception by Adriana, who was extremely helpful and took time to explain me how to reach places nearby. I mentioned that I am vegan and I was delighted the next day when the kitchen staff prepared a delightful vegan breakfast for me. Such outstanding staff is the reason for the additional ""star"" in my review.",4,2015,07,02
104,Small but clean and reasonably priced,"The room was very small, but not a problem for one person for a couple of nights (I even had space to do some work). The staff were very friendly and helpful. It is conveniently located. The breakfast was a little mediocre, but otherwise a good stay.",4,2015,07,02
104,Extremely cordial staff,The location of the hotel makes it very convenient. We had a very pleasant stay mostly because of the courteous staff and their vigilant manager . special mention of Mr.Anthony who was extremely cordial and made our stay very comfortable,5,2015,07,02
104,"Great stay, great hotel, great staff!","Great stay: room 407 really nice, small but clean and tidy. The staff were fantastic!So friendly and helpful. Great location, walking distance to everything you need. Loved it!Will definately go back.",5,2015,07,02
104,Great stay,"I stayed at Park Grand Hyde Park this spring and was very satisfied. The room is outdated in terms of decor, but QUIET, and the bed was very comfortable. I had very sound sleep here. A nice base for a trip.",4,2015,06,30
104,Disappointed by the shoe boxed size room!!,We recently booked two Deluxe rooms for a one night stay through later ooms.com only to be moved on the day of our arrival and moved to Shaftsbury Premier across the road and was put into one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever ever seen!! I couldn't even walk round the room it was so small and I had to turn sideways to gain access to the room and I couldnt get to either side of the bed. I was so embarrassing when we'd spent so much on the room booking on behalf of another family member...,2,2015,06,30
104,A little faded,"I am sure this hotel in its prime was a really good venue to stay, however, that was some time ago and its prime has now past. For the price I had to pay, (¬£200.00 for one night), this hotel was extremely expensive for what it had on offer. I am a regular business traveler to London and have stayed in many hotels so I know what can be purchased for a similar amount and the standard a customer can expect.

I was meeting up with a colleague to discuss some business matters before we started work the following day and asked the receptionist if there was a private area where we could talk.  The only two areas on offer was the restaurant, which was full with guests having breakfast, and the hotel lobby / bar area which had lots of guests passing through. Both were totally inappropriate.

I would have to be pretty desperate to stay here again and would look for other options.",3,2015,06,30
104,WARNING,"You work hard. You look forward to going away for a while. You research a place you want to go, you find the hotel you want in London after spending a lot of time doing your research. Then when its all booked, you start looking forward to your trip and everything you've got planned.

Then.....you turn up at the 'Park Grand' on Westbourne Terrance and get told you are being turned away, because of 'plumbing issues'.. and because you have booked through a 3rd party (we booked through a well known website which everyone will know and have used at some point). I did not believe the excuse the person gave for a number of reasons. Firstly .. he said because of plumbing issues and because you booked through another website. The two things are totally unrelated and just seemed like random excuses. The hotel was still obviously in use and they could have offered us another room, or informed us before we arrived.

The second reason which made me suspicious was because he seemed to know the 'legality' all too well. The person on reception just said..words to the effect of  ""all we are legally obliged to do is to put you in a same star rating hotel if there is not space here'. This part is the crux of the matter. This hotel from what we could fathom out is part of the 'Shaftsbury collection of hotels'. They seem to have quite a few hotels around London -- all of quite varying standards. 

What they appear to be doing is overbooking the 'better' sites and carting people off to hotels they haven't booked because of some legal loophole that allows them to do this. 

Within 1 minute of arriving at the hotel we were given the feable explanation described above and before we knew it a porter was carting our luggage off down the street and we had no choice but to follow him. We were sent to a vastly inferior hotel, and its very disappointing when you arrive. Yes it may have technically been a '4 star' just as the other one was - but it was a pretty shoddy hotel we were sent to. I'm sure everyone would agree that star ratings don't necessarily mean that much nowerdays. Tripadvisor reviews are a much more accurate way of telling how good a hotel is going to be. We booked a hotel that was ranked approximately 300 odd in London at transferred to a hotel that was ranked below 500 in London. That's quite a drop in quality - with no monetary compensation for it.

To top things off when we are at the new hotel - part of this 'Shaftsbury Collection' we saw them doing the same thing to 2 or 3  other parties just when we were in the reception area and carting these people off to other hotels. 

It all seems very bad business practice and things like that will only give them a bad reputation in the long run as more people will I'm sure complain about what they are doing - which is spoiling peoples trips. 

I certainly would never risk booking with this unreputable hotel chain ever again.",1,2015,06,30
104,Turned away as soon as we arrived!,"Booked a 3 night stay on lastminute.com as a birthday treat for my husband, when we arrived to check the receptionist, asked for our names and then confirmed if we had booked via lastminute.com, when I stated this was correct, we were informed they have maintenance problems and no hotel room is available, which is not a good start. We were told we were being moved to another hotel opposite and not to worry as it would be the same 4 star standard and we would get complimentary breakfast. We were moved to Shaftesbury Premier Hotel on Westbourne terrace just over the road and our luggage was carried over by the Park Grand Porter. As we arrived I overheard two other guests checking in stating they had booked via lastminute.com with another hotel and had been transferred here due to ""maintenance"" problems. I cant help but think that this chain of hotels are overbooking hotel rooms and that those guests who book via lastminute.com are then transferred to other hotels with empty rooms in their hotel chain, rather than being offered the original room they had booked in a more popular location. Although the hotel we were moved to was the same four star standard, it was significantly lower in the trip advisor ratings and I would not have booked it for this reason but we were left with no other option. So beware if you are using lastminute.com to book this hotel as the chances are you wont be staying here but will be moved elsewhere.",1,2015,06,29
104,Disappointing,"Although a very comfortable bed the shower room which we thought would be a bathroom was very small and the extracter fan was not working quite a number of ants were present, then in the morning we discovered thousands of ants below the children's bed. 
The steps in the room were very steep. 
A bag of rubbish had been left on a landing for at least 16 hours. 
Only one small lift which I had to wait 20 mins for there to be enough space to get me and my child's buggy in my wife had used the lift 20 mins before and was waiting in the lobby. 
On arrival no help was offered with the bags to the room despite having 3 young children with us.  
Breakfast was very good and the waiting staff great 
No help was offered exiting the hotel which has a number of steps despite a number of staff watching me struggle with a buggy and luggage.",2,2015,06,29
104,"Clean, compact & comfortable - if you get the room you booked.","Be wary - this hotel is OK, - it's clean, cosy and compact - but the rooms are tiny with barely any room to walk around the furniture or squeeze into the cupboard sized bathroom.

We also experienced what seems like a bit of regular occurrence, where we received an email the night before our booking saying 'due to essential maintenance we had to be moved into the sister hotel'.  Sister hotel had shocking reviews so we asked for a refund. They refused.  We kicked up a fuss and eventually the staff upgraded to us to their top room (the Club Room) which god..was tiny hate to think what the normal rooms are like.  Couldn't see any sign of 'maintenance men' there.  We were also told breakfast wasn't included in our rate which was disappointing.   If you have booked and can't cancel - don't panic as the hotel is fine for a night, but phone and persist for your room booking.  But if you can cancel do.",2,2015,06,29
104,This isn't even a review of the hotel I've booked,"When I arrived at the Park Grand London Hyde Park I went through the normal check in process only to be told to go to a different hotel. 

I was accompanied by a nice clerk and the walk was only a few minutes but I had to go through check in again at the sister hotel. 

The room was in the basement and very small, the sheets were nothing to write home about but it was clean. 

It's very close to Paddington station but you should be able to do better then this.",2,2015,06,28
104,Convenient stopover for Hyde Park event,"I accept a small room as par for the course in London, within any realistic price bracket, but the very small bathroom and extremely tiny wash basin in our double room were a surprise. Single-glazed windows and rather tired decor - but still a comfortable and convenient stopover for Paddington station / Hyde Park. The breakfast room is too small for the size of hotel but quite a decent breakfast, included in the room rate too, which is always welcome. I can't see this as a four-star at all, but would recommend it as a sensibly priced hotel for a short family break or business trip.",3,2015,06,27
104,Excellent Stay!!!!,"We decided on this hotel due to its closeness to Hyde Park and Paddington station. 
We requested an early check in and went to the room. It was spacious and clean. Our reservation included breakfast and everyone we encountered at the front desk and restaurant were pleasant and very helpful.
Unfortunately it was a short stay but I will be back again. 
Thank you Park Grand for a lovely stay! ",5,2015,06,27
104,"Great location for this ""Deluxe"" shoebox: staff were very friendly and helpful.","Fabulous location a short walk from Paddington Station and very convenient for Hyde Park.  Deluxe means, says my dictionary, ""Particularly elegant, luxurious, or elaborate for its kind; of superior quality or refinement.""  This tiny room was OK: a modestly sized double bed and just enough space to walk around it.  No bedside table on one side of the bed.  No easy way to close the tall curtains.  A tiny walk in shower room.  Two tea bags and a quantity of non fair-trade instant coffee.  The air-conditioning, had been left on ""heat the room"" - it needed a switch changing in the office to make it cool the room.

Breakfast was OK; very nice sausages.

Staff were very friendly and helpful.

We were given a lower ground floor room with a dingy view of some walls and very little daylight.  Pamela on Reception was very helpful and found us a first floor room: much more light and altogether more cheerful.

Don't expect the space you will get further out .... but the location and the friendliness of the staff make this a good place to stay.",4,2015,06,25
104,Rude Staff and Poor Room,"Came here for my mini moon and was left disappointed:

1.  Rang ahead to request champagne for our room as a surprise for my husband but was told rudely told that I needed to order at reception when we BOTHA checked in.

2.  Some staff had poor English which became very frustrating when trying to explain why I was unhappy with the champagne issue.

3.  Found hairs in our shower upon arrival to our room

4.  Fridge in room not working - when I brought it to the hotel's attention I was told that it wasn't a fridge!  It was on,y when I pushed the matter that they replaced the fridge with a working one.

5.  Hotel is EXTREMELY hot but air con doesn't below go 19 degrees and is very temperamental.

'Deluxe' room was cramped and apart from the fridge was very basic (no iron, phone etc).",2,2015,06,25
104,Shocking thieves and liars,"I booked 2 rooms at this hotel for a June visit, one for 3 nights for myself and my husband and 1 for 1 night for my son and his girlfriend. The night before I was due to travel, I received an email saying that my booking had been moved to their sister hotel, which had shocking reviews on here! I asked for my bookings to be cancelled as I want to book another hotel, of my choice, not theirs, which I cannot do without incurring charges. Miraculously, several hours later, they can find my original rooms available! Not interested, don't trust them, it's obviously some scam they run. Book at your peril!",1,2015,06,24
104,Wont be back,"Just back from an overnight trip to London and certainly will not be checking into this hotel ever again. The story starts when I arrived at 1.20am when I arrived by taxi after a delayed flight in from Glasgow. When I arrived in the reception i quickly felt a situation out of control. I was third in line to check in with Ivan the only person on duty along with a young porter. The first man was just leaving and I believe was booked into room 001...so off he went with the porter. The second gentleman tried to check in but was unable to due to his credit card being declined and his room had not been kept for him...so he left unhappy . In the middle of this the first gentlemn and porter arrived back as there appeared to be something wrong with room 001..and within seconds a realised why...they had actually sent him to a room where someone was sleeping and now the guest was in reception going mental with Ivan ! demanding to see the manager to find out why someone else should be given a key to his room and walk in on him while he was sleeping. After he calmed down and left to go back to his room it was no my turn ...its now 1.45 !! again I quickly realise that Ivan has an issue with my booking :-((...he is now on the phone to someone and everything is now taking place in Indian so as not to make me aware of what the issue is. Finally Ivan informs me that they have a room for me ....GREAT ...but its at their sister hotel !!!! serously its 1.45am and all I want is my room in the hotel I am standing in. Before setting to the sister hotel I ask if Ivan will compensate me ...yip with a free breakfast ! but I wont have time for breakfast sorry what else can you do for me I say ...Ivan  - sorry that is all I am allowed to offer you. !!! so realising I aint getting anywehere and all I want is my bed I walk round to the sister hotel. Guess what...the sister hotel has no idea I am coming so reception again get on the phone to a the same mysterious  person at the other end of the phone ...and again in Indian ! so its getting close to 2am and almost 45 mins past since I arrived. I am finally given a room which must be the smallest room I have slept in in my life..not much bigger than a caravan and all for a premium of ¬£180 not a small amount !!
I am now wide awake @2am and have a read through this site to see if its just me who was unlucky but NO !! pllenty others and I just couldnt wait to check out.
When I did check out the receptionist was very pleasant and smooth check out process and they did give me my ¬£10 cash deposit they had requested just a few hours before at check in. She asked how my stay was ...I said a disaster ...she smiled ...I left and now I am writing this.
Hugely disappointing experience and still dont have my receipt which they promised to email ...but why should I expect to receive it after the customer care I rec'd.
I will never again use the Shaftesbury group of hotels again and would not advise anyone else to risk getting the customer experience I rec'd ...note to self stick with the BIG boys like Hilton etc...as when they have let me down their incredible customer care kicks in and I always quickly forget the bad experience.
Sorry hotel but you just didn't perform and hope with more comments like mine you will address the situation seriously and others won't be let down as I was.",1,2015,06,24
104,I love coming back to this Hotel!,"I have been at Hotel Park Grand London Hyde Park twice. The location of the Hotel is perfect. It just a five minute walk from the Paddington Tube Station, (which has a good connectivity to the other areas). The Hotel staff are very helpful and kind. The staff is ready to help you out at any time. The rooms are good. And the service excellent!",4,2015,06,23
104,Nice stay,Booked the hotel for a weekend break with my boyfriend and found the overall experience of the hotel was nice. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I can't put my finger on why I was a little bit disappointed with the hotel...it's supposed to be a 4 star but I've stayed in much better 4 star hotels.  The breakfast was adequate but nothing special the rooms were comfortable and clean but small and basic the dining area was too small for the amount of guests eating....There was too many tables and not enough room for people to pass so you were constantly having to apologise for bumping into other guests or getting bumped yourself.  So if your looking for a hotel near it fits the bill!,3,2015,06,22
104,Good Hotel & Helpful staff,"First time we have been to this area and hotel. Stayed here to go to a festival in Hyde park. The reception staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 5th floor,  had steps down in our room which might cause some people a problem but was fine for us.We had a room in the front, lovely outlook of the tree lined road but if you like the window open at night this might cause you a problem with the noise but we were use to it. Friends of our had a back room and they didn't have this problem. There is air con but personally we don't like to use it. These are not very large rooms, in fact there is just enough room to get around the bed. Modern in appearance as was the bathroom but again this is very small but all perfectly  adequate. We had a very small corner shower and plenty of complimentary  products. Stayed for 2 nights and the towels were changed and the room cleaned. Plenty of tea/coffee with biscuits and these were replenished. We booked direct and had breakfast included, this is in the basement and can be accessed by stairs or lift. Good choice of food, which is buffet style , cereals, toast, bacon, sausages, fried potatoes, scramble eggs, tomatoes and beans. Staff again in the restaurant all very helpful and polite. 
This hotel is not far from Paddington underground/station and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from if you do not want to go far or if you have had a long day.
All in all this is a very good base and its clean, has good free wifi,  comfortable and has superb staff.",4,2015,06,22
104,It was OK,"Room just felt a little like it needed a spring clean, nothing really severe but just a bit tired. we found a hair grip on the carpet, I saw a couple of ants on the kitchen sink but nothing that would warrant me making a complaint. 
Restaurant for breakfast is small and functional.",3,2015,06,22
104,Good breakfast - Tiny rooms,"If you are a ""healthy"" person, I suggest you DON'T take the Delux rooms. You will not even be able to enter the room comfortably. I had a tough time trying to get my suitcase inside, despite being an average build. Maybe if you have a 4 wheel suitcase you wouldn't face too much of a problem except trying to fit yourself inside. Rooms are clean and bar downstairs is good. If you are longing for some Indian food, their sister concern hotel is just a street behind them (2 min walk). Otherwise, feel free to cross the road and explore the area near paddington station and you have a lot of options. Btw, you get good fresh cookies in the room to have with your tea/coffee everyday.

During my stay in May, the pollen level in this area was very high and my walk to Lancaster Gate station was a little tough. The pollen got into my eye at least twice during my week long stay here.",4,2015,06,22
104,Everything you need in a hotel stay!,"I will like to thank the team at Park Grand for our wonderful stay. 
First was when I wrote in to ask for early check-in and to ensure that we could get our 3 single beds in triple room.  Both my requests were noted and met.
The rooms are always neat and clean after a day out, and location is great- very short walk to either Paddington Station or Lancaster Gate. The beds are very comfy and definitely provide the much-needed good rest.
Breakfast is something to look forward to each morning too!
Thumbs up and definitely will return to stay in this hotel when we are back in London.",4,2015,06,22
104,Great hotel with superb staffs,"Although the hotel is rugged due to wear and tear, it was made up by its superb team of staffs. From front desk to F&N to housekeeping, all were professional and helpful to make my stay in London a memorable one. 

We stayed for 7 nights and were given upgrade for our rooms. Breakfast were a good spread and good from my family point of view.

Location of hotel is just a stone throw away from Paddington Underground station.

For Muslim travellers, there are a few halal restaurants around the corner of the hotel location. 

Kudos to Gurdeep and team and I wish success for this hotel. Will book this hotel again if I were to visit London again.",5,2015,06,20
104,Sisters Birthday Weekend,"I visited this Park Grand London Hyde Park on 12th June 2015 for the weekend as it was my sister birthday we had the Quad Room as they're were 4 of is girls staying.
I really enjoyed my stay here as the room were very clean and very cosy and the beds were comfortable. I was very impressed with the cleanliness and hygiene in the bathroom. House keeping were always on call and when requested for towels or pillows they arrived within 3-5 mins very impressive. They also had a wide range of breakfast and catered for everyone and breakfast was delicious.
The reception staff were absolutely helpful and very friendly and made are stay welcoming. The Hotel Manager SAKAR was absolutely helpful and friendly and assisted me and my sisters were to visit during our stay.
A huge thank you to SAKAR and his staff at the PARK GRAND LONDON HYDE PARK I would really rate this hotel 5* not a 4* 
I defiantly will be visiting again very soon

104,A PEACEFUL HOTEL IN LONDON.,"We had a great stay. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Great location, close to bus and tube stations. spacious rooms, as compared to other similar category hotels in the area. Overall a good stay, and would stay again without hesitation.",4,2015,06,19
104,Excellently functioning hotel,"The staff are really welcoming and helpful. On arrival we were given a free upgrade and we were very happy with the room. Everything was well cleaned and the room was an excellent sized (considering it's central London). Perfectly located for Paddington Rail; my husband and I had to walk too and from with suitcases and it was very quick. The complimentary breakfast was a great add-on. 

Only downside was the noise of people going up and down the staircase. This woke us up periodically through the night. Street noise was minimal and apart from the odd elephant running down the stairs, we were very comfy. We would rebook!",3,2015,06,17
104,Good functional hotel in a convenient location,"I stayed for a week at Park Grand London Hyde Park on a business trip. The hotel is located in a leafy quiet avenue about 4-5 minutes' walk from the Paddington tube station, which makes it an extremely convenient location. There are buses plying too. The rooms are small (but I believe, that is standard across UK), but comfortable. The bed was very soft and the bathroom had a bathtub.
The restaurant serves wholesome English breakfast - tasty and filling. Only, it would be nice, if they change the menu a bit more regularly, as people staying for a longer period will tend to get bored with the same menu.
The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, which makes it a pleasant stay.
The WiFi does not work well in some places. I had issues with WiFi connection in my room. But otherwise I loved my stay.",4,2015,06,17
104,The Westbourne Supremacy?,"This four star hotel in Westbourne Terrace, Paddington was a real find.  The reception staff were courteous and extremely helpful even though they were under some pressure from an overly and unfairly demanding guest when we first arrived.  We were treated to a free upgrade to a superior room which was spacious enough, scrupulously clean, comfortable and air conditioned.  An ideally situated establishment - less than ten minutes walk to Paddington Station and Kensington Gardens.  Five minutes walk gets you into streets that have an abundance of convenience stores, cafes, reasonably priced restaurants and pubs.  We did not avail ourselves of the highly praised breakfast because of time pressures.  An enjoyable stay.  Recommended",4,2015,06,16
104,Not really,"Unfortunately I only read recent reviews of this hotel just prior to check-in, and a lot of my experience mirrors that. 

At check-in, after midnight following a long day, I was informed that I was going to be moved to ""another hotel"". I refused and said that was a breach of agreement and would expect the hotel to allow me to cancel without me paying any cancellation fees. The receptionist spoke with a mysterious manager (the same one who decided I should be moved presumably) who now decided that I should be upgraded. At his point I was quite chuffed with the results of my sleep-deprived rant at the receptionist. 

I quickly discovered that upgrade was really ""upgrade"": the room was in the basement. I was too tired to fight. My wife checked in the following morning and demanded a room with a window. Staff insisted there is a window. I suppose it depends on your definition of window: there was a rectangular hole in the wall filled with glass but it was glazed over, let in little light and as far as we could tell looked straight into another wall. We got downgraded to a room with windows. Life was now good. 

Then the room started making strange sounds at 6am the next morning. I say the room because the staff claimed to have no clue where the sounds could be coming from. Loud sounds, like drilling, lasting up to a minute and every half hour or so. Another room change. 

I won't say more than this other than to say most of the staff were friendly and tried to help, but there is clearly an issue with management / ownership. Will definitely not return. ",2,2015,06,16
104,Excellent staff,"I stayed at the hotel first time . I booked a double room , I was given a very pleasant room . checking in was very smooth and staff was very helpful . 
Hotel is very much at the central London , nearest tube is Paddington , which connects to pretty much everywhere I wanted to visit.  
Hotel is a Victorian building with high ceiling . very good room , very much modern and shower was fantastic .
Housekeeping team are superb , I am bit fussy with standard and saying that room is always cleaned spotless. 
A very big thank you to Mr sakar , who helped me with many things and miss May who checked me into nice room and miss Sanya is always helpful.
Security in this buildings is fantastic  . Reception is open 24/7 there is always someone there to help and breakfast is one the best here .

104,We love this hotel !!!!,"Every time we go to London we stay at this hotel. Great location close to Paddington station and underground. The staff are always superb. The very nice man behind the reception desk Mr Sakar was extremely pleasant and efficient when dealing with our request. The breakfast, as always extremely tasty and the staff again always polite and cheery.We will definitely be coming back again soon.",5,2015,06,15
104,"Very good service and food at breakfast, excellent location","the main strength of this hotel is the breakfast staff and food.
We were at hotel for a week and got to know Anthony and Monica who greeted us each AM in a pleasant fashion and other staff also were pleasant and helpful.
buffet breakfast was delicious and healthy.

Front desk was VERY inconsistent.  We were so impressed when we arrived in the AM, about 9 AM after an awful overnight train from Inverness to London and were in our room within an hour/  While waiting for our room we enjoyed a bowl of sliced fresh fruit brought up from the kitchen when we indicated some fresh fruit would taste good following our journey.

On the other hand, we were called one night at 1 AM in the morning and told our neighbors were complaining that we were making noise when we had been asleep for two hours.  The next morning I let the front desk know what happened and Judiith ( a trainee from Hungary who was also very good) immediately completed an incident report.  

Unfortunately our departure was not as smooth as our arrival.
Neither the hotel nor the taxi driver could tell us accurately how to get to the Healthrow Express at Paddington, even though the hotel is only a few blocks from the train station.  Furthermore, we were told we had to go the ticket office to buy tickets for the Healthrow Express.  That is accurate, but much faster to buy directly from a ticket office specifically for the Healthrow Express.
obviously, the hotel staff need better orientation to the organization and functions at Paddington.  In general staff were pleasant, even when incompetent or poorly informed. 

We had standard douible that was small, but beds comfortable.
unfortunately very little storage space in small bathroom.  
Lighting was also poor.  My wife put on her make up at the window.

the air nconditioning and internet access were also very good.",3,2015,06,14
104,Quick stay with family and baby. Loved it!,"Turned up with wife, 1yr old son and mother in law to stay a night. First room was fine but no stair gate.(the rooms are split level, with bedroom upstairs and lounge downstairs Room No 304-loads of room). We requested a change for safety reasons and they were very helpful and upgraded FOC to a lovely big room. Breakfast was great for me. However, slightly limited if you are a veggie. as no veggie sausages or hash browns. Overall-breakfast was grand! The front desk staff and porter and night manager who sorted our room out was superb and very professional! Want to name him but can't remember..but he will know who he was. Well done to all. Parked right outside for ¬£20 a night. Its steep, but its worth it. As for Night out, went to China town for meal. ¬£15 taxi.(reasonable and worth it for the insight and free guide by driver) and had a lovely meal in Wan Chi corner on Gerrard st. Loads of Chinese in there, so a good sign!",4,2015,06,14
104,Perfect stay,"I booked this with booking.com for business trip.i am staying in front facing room and quite happy with my stay.
Valeria is very helpful at reception.breakfast is served lower ground floor .

I will recommend this hote to my colleague for business traveller.",5,2015,06,13
104,A good experience,"The staff here were very helpful. I booked the single room for 4 nights, but I then found it was too small, so I requested a room upgrading, got some issues with the reservation department, but the reception staff were very helpful and have sorted out the problem for me, very good service!",4,2015,06,12
104,Such a wonderful experience!,"I love coming to this hotel- each time I'm here the staff remember me by name and always go out of their way to make me feel special. This is so appreciated as most four stars in hotel do not seem to care about their guests-- not here. I love that the staff celebrate small things and always add the last little final touch of amazing guest service. Shakar, thank you for being so kind and always welcoming me ""home"" when I come to west London. PS: I'm also addicted to the croissants they serve at breakfast. lol #smallthings ",5,2015,06,11
104,Short business trip,The hotel is well looked after and is in a great location. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and modern. Next time I would stay in a double as the room was really small which is OK for one night's stay but any longer you need a bigger room.,4,2015,06,11
104,Great Location and very Friendly and Helpful Staff,"Recently stayed at this hotel and it would be one of the first places I would check availability of when I am next in London. The location is great, its just 5 mins walk from Padding Underground and has easy access to all the tube lines.

The hotel room we booked was just the basic room but was perfect for our short stay. Everything we needed for a nice weekend away.

Whilst in London we attended the Color Run in Wembley (again, easy access from the Hotel), the hotel staff were happy to keep our bags whilst we were out in London before we departed for home (even though we had checked out).

What was even better (and not something every hotel would offer I am sure) was that after our Run, at don't forget it was a Color run, we were covered in paint. Sakar & Jackson offered us a shower before we left for our train journey home. This was completely unexpected and not something I would have asked for (thinking it would be slightly cheeky) so for them to offer it to us was amazing.

We had use of a room for both of us to get clean (at no extra cost) and enjoy our journey home, the perfect end to a great weekend.

Thanks Guys",5,2015,06,10
104,Very enjoyable stay,"Great location, just 10 min walk from Paddington station. Quiet, clean, very friendly staff.

Would stay here again.",4,2015,06,09

104,Destroyed last night of honeymoon,"This was to be our last stay on our honeymoon trip, we knew we had a long journey ahead of us from Turin to London, so we wanted some where nice, relaxing, quiet and special close to Padington train station. This seemed to be a good choice whilst booking from Italy so booked a superior double. After what was an extremely long and exhausting day of travel we arrived relieved and ready to chill out on our last night away. Unfortunately our hopes and dreams of a beautiful last night together were destroyed by the completely unprofessional way this hotel that claims to be 4* conducts itself.
My husband went to the desk to check us in ( due to a phobia of fish I constantly looked away from the desk), an extremly rude male receptionist, whilst shuffling around some paper, informed us that ""she"" would deal with us whilst shooing us further down the desk with his hand. Then the female receptionist took our name, looked blankly at the computer screen and asked us to take a seat. After a couple of minuets she asked us if we would like a drink? At this point I was exhausted and in extreme pain from my Rheumatoid Arthritis and also annoyed by our treatment so far answered ""No just the room please"". Both staff members looked at each other and mumbled then the lady got on the phone. After a little time she informed us that there had been an issue with the booking (we went through lastminute.com and they did not have a room for us there. She arranged a stay at their sister hotel Park Grand London Paddington, informing us that it was a lovely hotel of the same quality and not to worry. Also due to our inconvenience she would book a taxi to take us there and we would have complimentary breakfast as well. My alarm bells were riging at this point. The lady thanked us for being understanding in the matter, like we were given any choice and the fact that it was late at night and room already paid for. We took our seats and awaited the taxi.
Whilst waiting for said taxi to arrive what we witnessed next was truly disgusting and agressive behaviour by the male receptionist, who transpired to be the duty manager. A family of three arrived having been sent to them from one of the other hotels after booking and paying for their stay and not having their room. Again ALARM bells ringing very loud now! The gentleman was then asked to fill out a form that he had already completed and when he questioned this pointing out that they had the relevant information the so called professional hotel manager rudely informed him that he wasn't putting up with his attitude and if he continued to question him that he would not be booked in. The gentleman was clearly taken aback by being spoken to in this manner and continued to complain about the manner in which they were being treated asked to speak with the manager. It was at this point that the receptionist smirked and informed him that he was the manager and that he was already dealing with him. After some more discussion in which said manager kept talking over the gentleman, he raised his voice and informed the family that if they continued complaining that he would cancel their booking, leaving them with no where to stay late on a Starday night in London. At this point the gentleman gave up. The receptionist/manager also made a very inappropriate joke at the expense of the gentlman when he didn't understand what he was saying.
Our so called taxi arrived for us, although their was no taxi licence in the car so I can only assume that it was a private car used by the hotel. The driver was a surly rude person who rather than placing the luggage in the boot of the car dropped it in and took us to the other hotel.
For what is meant to be a 4* star hotel falls well short and in my opinion wouldn't even make 1* star due to the extremely poor customer service received and witnessed. As to the rooms  I can not comment. It is clear to me that this is a regular occurrence  by this chain of hotels and if you want a true 4* experience look elsewhere as you will not receive it from them. Check out Google reviews of this hotel. I would also take the opportunity to thank them for making our last night on our honeymoon a truly stressful and miserable experience that we will never get back.",1,2015,06,08
104,Park Grand London Hyde Park economic and clean convenient for Paddington,"Clean and friendly hotel chain (Shaftebury¬¥s). Small but comfortable rooms 
at a good price. Some of their hotels are better than others. This is my favourite one close to Paddington Station and Hyde Park.",3,2015,06,08
104,Bank holiday break,"We stayed at this hotel over the May Bank Holiday. I had not realised it was a bank holiday when booking it,  but on noticing the date I was surprised at how reasonably priced it was. The hotel is perfectly situated, as Bayswater Road is only a few minutes walk away, along with many landmarks, and Paddington Station. The staff were very helpful, although my room was not ready when we arrived to check in at 2pm. This said when we were eventually allocated a room it was large, comfortable and spotlessly clean. The hotel did have a restaurant but it only served breakfast. The only other food served seemed to be light bites (sandwiches etc) on room service. One very good plus point is that the hotel had onsite parking at a cost of ¬£20 per day, although this appeared to be limited. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends",4,2015,06,07
104,Very good stay.,"A party of female family members, we had struggled to find one reasonably priced room for 3 people in London for our weekend stay. Our spacious room with 3 proper beds, not just a sofa bed, was comfortable and relaxing. 
As well as being close to Hyde Park the location was also good being handy for both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations. 
The staff were friendly, polite and helpful. 
We did have a problem on the first evening when we found that our toilet did not flush but this was sorted outed as soon as possible.
We would deinitely stay here again.",4,2015,06,07
104,Best staff!,"I arrived at the hotel to realise my purse had been stolen at some point on the tube. Luckily my room was prepaid but the staff couldn't have been more helpful with allowing me to call my bank to cancel my cards and to call the police. The manager on duty, Sakar, was the most helpful hotel employee I've ever come across! He even let me transfer some money to his account so I could get some cash in order to get back to manchester without my purse. They also arranged for dinner to be made for me while I was trying to sort all of this out. 

Not the ideal situation but I was so lucky to be staying at this hotel with these people working and it certainly made the situation a lot less stressful for me. 

Thank you so so much!",5,2015,06,06
104,Good value for money,"Great location and good value for money. Room was a bit noisy but other than that very good, friendly staff and good breakfast. Very clean and smart, plus only 5 minutes from Paddington. I would definitely recommend using this hotel for business, plus I believe they also have family rooms. ",4,2015,06,06
104,Great stay in London,"We spent two nights in Park Grand. Special thanks to Sakar  at reception. You're the employee of the month ! Two nights in Very romantic room.. with bed on mezzanine. Very cool
Le personnel est tres accueillant et la prestation globale d'un bon niveau pour Londres.",5,2015,06,06

104,Convenient and well located for the business traveller,"This hotel is a 5minute walk away from Paddington station which connects you all around London and Heathrow. It is also a 10 minute walk from HydePark and is pleasantly located away from the noise and traffic associated with a business district.

The staff are pleasant, the breakfast just right to start you day and WiFi good. The only finger I can point is in the size of the rooms and the Bathroom, especially the shower cubicle, you'd be stuffed there and struggle to get around and soap the entire body.",4,2015,06,05
104,Good for business traveler,"I was the cameraman travelling with our producer staying here two nights. We arrived from Heathrow well before check-in time, but the staff accommodated us. THANK YOU. The rooms were tight, but no matter. Trash truck outside at 11am, but no big deal. I needed some help with getting all of our gear to our project site, but the hotel staff made it easy.",5,2015,06,04
104,Terrible Customer Service,"Having checked in to my shoe box of a room (reason enough not to stay there again), I left my things and went to eat and see some of London. I returned later to find that the lights in my room seemed to have failed. Of course, these things happen, so I called reception and asked them to send somebody. As the room was pitch black, I waited by the doorway, but the person who was sent walked past me several times to the fuse box without even acknowledging me. When I called out to him he just said he was checking the fuses then went away. 
After another 10 minutes stood in the doorway I called reception and asked what was going on; they said they didn't know as the porter was dealing with it. 
10 more minutes in the doorway and nobody had come so I called again, quite peeved by this point and I asked them who was actually helping me as I couldn't use my room in pitch darkness.
Another 10 minutes and finally somebody came to the room and managed to get the bedside light working, but by this point I was livid with the lack of service and asked to see the manager. Another 10 minutes and two people turned up, but they admitted neither of them were manager. Another 10 minutes and somebody came to say the manager was busy.
Finally he (Ivan) came and told me that it was my fault for not letting them know that having to stand in the doorway of a pitch black room was a problem. He offered no apology but said he could change my room, missing the point that I did now have some light and it was getting late. After much debating he offered to give me an extra 30 minutes before check-out, which wasn't much use as my meetings started at 9am the next day.
Breakfast was pretty poor, no customer service again and I never got my cup of tea. 
I complained when I checked out but I don't think they cared.
There are much better places to stay for an equivalent price, so I won't be considering this place again.",1,2015,06,04
104,Amazing staff....,"Great hotel, reasonably priced for 1min from Paddington. Rooms aren't huge but clean and modern with very high quality fixtures and fittings. Best part is definitely the staff. I made a mistake on my booking and Sakar got us sorted very quickly with an even better room than we expected. That's what I call customer service!!!!",5,2015,06,03
104,"OK place to get a night's sleep, insanely expensive","Our London office booked us in so I didn't have a choice. The price was absolutely insane for the level of hotel, and I don't care where it's located. The first night was 81 pounds, the 2nd night 180, and the 3rd was 360. Pounds. With this sort of geometric projection I was afraid to ask how much a 4th night would have cost. If you're not quick at math, that's $1,000 US for 3 nights for a small double room for one person, no breakfast included, miserable Wi-Fi, cheap Chinese toiletries in the bathroom and absolutely nothing of note that would indicate some self-awareness in terms of a budget hotel getting away with charging ridiculous prices. The front desk personnel were generally apathetic and unhelpful - I couldn't get them to put the room in my name at check-in even though my name was on the booking.com reservation for the 2nd room. I couldn't get a statement the night before checkout and had to waste time upon leaving, including finally getting them to agree to put my name on the room bill. The room contained a desk chair and nowhere else to sit except the bed and the floor. The room's mini-fridge, set at maximum cold, never got much below room temperature in 3 days. The room was quiet and I slept well, however, which is why I'm giving the hotel a 3-star rating and not less.",3,2015,06,03
104,A bit more of personal touch and it would deserve the best raiting,"I stayed at this place for two nights. Business trip. 
PROs:

- more or less central location;
- good pricing policy;
- nice interior of the room;
- good b/f (complimentary);
- free wifi;
- tea/coffee amenities in the room;
- no noise from the streets (room #205);
- free biscuits ))
- good shower;
- good housekeeping - very clean;
- quick check-in and check-out;

CONs:
- too narrow sink - no place at all to put your own stuff (toothbrush, toothpaste etc); (no bathtub - of someone needs it);
- no spare power adapter - I could only pick it up next morning (I checked-in very late);
- stairs - was a bit hard to take up your suitcase to the reception desk; no assistance offered;
- even with a/c being off I heard some rumble in the room - not very loud, but still...

As the Hotel was very close to my office next time I will choose it again fro sure! )",4,2015,06,03
104,City Sight Seeing Weekend,Lovely clean hotel within walking distance of Paddington and Hyde Park.  Lovely warm welcome especially from Sakar who made our booking-in process simple.  Beds were big and comfortable but disappointed that the fridge and the air conditioning unit didn't get cool!!  Restaurant staff could be a little bit more friendly and a smile would be nice.  On the whole we had a good time and would definitely go back again,4,2015,06,02
104,Convenient location yet surprisingly quiet,"I chose this hotel for its proximity to Paddington station and didn't expect the area to be quiet. In reality in our rear-facing room not a sound was heard from the outside. To be fair I have to add that my children said at some point they heard the neighbors very clearly, when I stepped out. Yet otherwise it was very peaceful. 
The staff was very nice and helpful, I loved chatting with Valeria at the reception.
The ¬£10 breakfast offers a choice of all the usual suspects, so anyone can find something to fill oneself although it probably won't make a highlight of your trip.",5,2015,06,02
104,London stay-sightseeing,"Good start to the trip
Travelled first class Virgin train from Birmingham,(food,wine,coffee,biscuits on train and hospitality in first class lounge in station at Brum,) and all staff were friendly and attentive. Directions to hotel were good, only a short walk from Paddington tube station. A good greeting from Romanian doorman and Pamela the receptionist.The check in was efficient and the room was ready, situated on the 6th floor.The room was a 'club' double with a very comfortable bed and fruit,wine,soft drinks and water laid out.The bathroom was small with only a shower and a very compact space for the sink and loo area.Larger guests may have found the space difficult.The room was clean and at the rear of the hotel with views over the surrounding properties.The room was well serviced every day with a very good range of toiletries and fresh towels etc. There was also a turning down service if required. Breakfast was in the basement with a buffet system for all food. The cooked choices were well prepared and plentiful. There was also a full range of 'continental' choices.The staff were efficient, friendly and polite. The hotel's greatest strength is the polite and friendly nature of all of the staff. The cost was also very reasonable for London prices. As we said, when leaving, yes we would return when next visiting London.",4,2015,06,01
104,A buisiness visit to London,"The room I had initially is on the ground floor, and but somehow it had some strange smell of food. When I raised this to the hotel manager, she quickly reacted and changed the room for me. The second room I had is much better, and it is on the first floor, and the room size is also very good. The hotel staff from the reception, house keeping to catering are all friendly and pleasant. I enjoyed my stay in this hotel and will definitely recommend to other people.",5,2015,05,31
104,Excellent value for money,"I have now stayed at Park Grand twice and will certainly return.  There are very few hotels that I say that about.  The customer service is amongst the best I have had at any hotel.  The rooms are great value for money though the ones I have stayed in, as a lone traveller, have been a little small.  That said, considering the value for money, this isn't a problem for me and the amenities are pretty good with a well equipped bathroom and bedroom. The hotel is well placed between Lancaster Gate and Paddington underground stations.  I usually walk to Lancaster Gate to quickly get over to Oxford St - but the walk through Hyde Park is pretty pleasant if you have the time.",5,2015,05,31
104,Great value for money,"Hotel location is a 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station, staff are professional & welcoming. Hotel lobby & rooms are nice & clean. Good place to stay when in London.
Quiet allover the hotel places , staff always offer help & advise.",5,2015,05,31
104,Robert,Modern and clean well organised hotel at a great central location nearby Paddington Station with friendly and helpful staff. I would certainly recommend this hotel to both business and leisure travellers.,5,2015,05,30
104,Great customer service with a great location.,"I wasn't expecting a lot for ¬£96 with the location but it was completely adequate for an overnight stay, very pleasantly surprised. Single room was fine, there is a small bar downstairs and it doesn't have the best seating arrangement however you won't be using the hotel bar when you are in London anyway. The reason this hotel gets a VERY GOOD rating from me is the fantastic and friendly customer service, each member of staff that I spoke too was extremely present and very helpful from the chap that helped me with my luggage to very helpful girl Sanyr who assisted me checking out. 
If you want a hotel that's got a great location with very friendly and helpful staff with a price tag that won't blow the bank then this is the hotel for you.

Recommend!",4,2015,05,30
104,London trip,"My mum, myself and my three kids stayed for two nights in one of the hotels quad rooms. We arrived into London early in the morning, and even though our room wasn't ready we checked in, and left our luggage at the hotel whilst going into London. The hotel staff was really helpful and friendly, and booked us a hop on hop off bus tour which we enjoyed, which also included a river Thames cruise. The hotel was close to paddington underground, shops and restaurants, but was still nice and quiet at nighttime which was nice when travelling with kids. The room wasn't huge, but it had everything we needed and it was nice and clean. Bathroom was nice and clean to. We had booked and paid for the breakfast,and found it really good, it had plenty to choose from; English, continental and plenty of fresh fruit as well. The staff in the restaurant was kind and helpful, especially to the kids even making them hot chocolates. We had three brilliant days in London, saw lion king, went to Harry potter world, seen main sights, did some shopping, and enjoyed eating out. We was super lucky with the weather to!! Sunshine every day!! All five of us had a great time in London, and a great stay at the hotel. The only thing we struggled with, was the underground with a pushchair...that was a right challenge...we did it though!!",4,2015,05,29
104,"Very clean, extremely helpful, all round perfect, great location","stayed here twice in short period in time, staff extremely helpful & friendly. Sanya really saved us a load of problems with baggage issues and early check in. Would absolutely recommend this hotel to friends for all the above reasons. Superb stay.",5,2015,05,29
104,CENTRAL LUXURY PAD  FOR LONDON WEEKEND,"What can I say - From checking into reception,and being shown to our room by the hotel porter we could see it was perfect for our needs whilst exploring London.It is very close to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace which is delightful. We also saw the magnificent Princess Diana Memorial water feature which had lots of families enjoying the water and was delightful to see. The location is excellent as it is near to tube station and there are plenty of black cabs passing outside. The hotel also provides a chauffeuring service should you require- very nice. We bought a red sightseeing touring bus pass for 48HRS (¬£50- negotiated for 2 persons) Which included a free river cruise - Excellent for getting around the main sites and attractions .The hotel staff looked to make our stay enjoyable - Thought the drinks at the hotel bar expensive -the breakfast was comprehensive in choice hot and cold buffet. For London it is generally good value considering its excellent location -
 Will be back !!!",5,2015,05,28
104,Not grand at all,"Arrived here after a grueling and strenuous day to be greeted by a foreign speaking lobby assistant. Rather than welcome us he seemed more bothered that we saved as much room as possible in the car park. Desk staff just as unwelcoming apart from one kind lady  Room is small but well equipped with tea\coffee facilities and large tv. Windows old and single glazed poorly sealed and noisy. Bathroom made for supermodels. Any bigger than a size 8 and its a struggle to get a decent shower or use the toilet. Don't try getting dry in the bathroom. You will injure yourself. The towels aren't very big either. Save time and disappointment, find a Travelodge instead.",3,2015,05,27
104,Last minute stay,"My husband and I ended up staying here after the first hotel we stayed at didn't work out and we booked this an hour before arriving. 
The staff were very welcoming and very efficient. The room, although small like most in London, was clean and tidy. 
The hotel was so close to Paddington but you couldn't hear any noise. 
The breakfasts were additional but since it was convenient we paid the extra for it. 
Would definitely stay here again. ",4,2015,05,26
104,Superb find.,"This hotel is ideal in so many ways.  Its location is ideal for travelling around central London with Paddington station and underground five minutes away.  We went to all our places of interest on the Bakerloo line, including The London Eye, the Tower of London, Madame Tussaud's and the West End of London.  The staff in the hotel were very friendly and were always available to help.  Rooms were cleaned and products refreshed every day and the rooms were more than adequate with plenty of space for a family of four.  Breakfast was superb with a wide choice of food which was continually replaced with fresh produce.  We couldn't have asked for a better hotel for our trip to London and will return without a second thought.",5,2015,05,26
104,Nice Hotel in a lovely neighborhood very close to Paddington Station,"Overall this is a nice property well located in Paddington a quick walk from Paddington Station.  There are great local restaurants in the neighborhood. I have stayed here multiple times while on business in London.  Staff is friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and comfortable.  Every room is configured differently which is the only challenge.  You may get a comfortable room one trip and the next book the same room category and get something with a very small bathroom or a room with a very low ceiling that is difficult to move around in.  Property has a restaurant for breakfast only.  If you are staying for longer than 4 days the breakfast may become a bit tired as they offer the exact same options everyday.   
During the Paddington mass construction project (going on until 2018) you can at times here construction noise depending on where your room is located within the property.",4,2015,05,26
104,Small but beautiful,"Stayed here for the weekend.  Easy to park and close to Paddington made this hotel ideal for touring London.  Hotel rooms are very small (as are the towels provided in the also very small bathrooms).  Having said that they were very clean and acceptable if you are not planning to speak too much time in the hotel.  Bar got full if 8 or more people were in it (again small) but well stocked.  Main reason for going back staff!  Their customer service skills are second to none.  Very welcoming, friendly and helpful.",4,2015,05,26
104,Weekend theatre break,"It was the first time we have stopped at the Park Grand and found it a lovely hotel with very friendly staff. We did arrive a little early for check in and had to wait about nearly an hour in the bar area before our room was ready. The hotel was spotless, breakfast was superb. Our only little gripe was that the bar area next to the reception was rather too small with limited seating. Would recommend this hotel and will certainly visit again.",4,2015,05,26
104,Customer Service,"I returned the this Hotel recently on business as it is of good quality and close to the station. The Staff especially Sakar provided excellent service and I felt a very valued customer. Nothing was too much trouble. Its nice to see loyalty rewarded and recognised, makes you want to come back. Thanks to all the staff.",5,2015,05,24
104,Great london style accommodation close to everything.,"We were really happy with our accommodation choice at The Park Grand. The staff were lovely, the room was large and had a great bed and bathroom plus we could walk to anywhere. Also they made the best breakfast of our entire European holiday.",5,2015,05,24
104,Not really for business travellers,"This is a reasonable hotel for London, but I would not recommend it for business.  The other guests in the hotel seem to be mostly leisure travelers, and this means that both nights I spent at this hotel I could hear other people up late (1130pm) in adjacent rooms.  I stay at a lot of hotels, and those that attract business travelers don't tend to have the same noise.

If you do stay here, the quieter rooms are on the 7th floor, but beware that the lift only goes to the 6th floor.  I'd also advise to avoid the rooms in the basement and first floors as they would be very noisey.",3,2015,05,22
104,among the best values for money in London,"I stayed in the hotel for business for a few days.
A comfortable, clean, quiet room, with a great bed - 
the room is not huge but adequate for my needs (also in line with the standards of the United Kingdom). 

I see there is wi-fi in public areas, but I've my connection, so I haven't use it.

I never ate at the restaurant so I can not express myself. The breakfast is rather good (without being excellent) but very abundant; bar also has a good selection of cocktails and wines.

Hotel location, close to transportation and in the city center is outstanding.

The best element in any case is the staff, always smiling and efficient.",4,2015,05,21
104,Perfect - in every sense!,"Stayed five nights at this excellent hotel in mid-May of 2015, and experienced perfect service according to our standards! Located only about five minutes' walk from Paddington station and also being fairly close to Hyde Park, this was a great choice for e.g. taking the Tube, walking towards Oxford street, and going to/from Heathrow and any other destination westwards. 

Very friendly and service-minded staff in the reception, always quick to respond to any question or request. Excellent breakfast buffet served, with many options (including hot breakfast), fresh fruit and even different cheeses. Rooms are tidy and well equipped and maintained, with good quality beds. Quite small rooms, but what else to expect - and you are not in London to stay in your hotel room, are you? The complementary WiFi service is great; AC works fine, and traffic is not disturbing, nor the fact that the walls between the rooms are rather ""thin"".

All in all exactly the hotel you need for an extended weekend in central London, traveling with children and spending most of the time ""doing London""! I will definitely consider staying here again! :)",5,2015,05,21
104,good location,"Stayed two nights in double room. Room was clean and user friendly. Good Free breakfast and very fast free wifi. Good location, very near Paddington Station. Helpful and friendly staff. Many restaurant nearby.",4,2015,05,19
104,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here on a week night last minute get away and what a find the hotel is lovely so beautiful from outside well furnished inside. Our room was huge and had an up and down stays with cooking facilities and settee. Check in was quick and easy as was check out, luggage room facility free of charge. Only 1 lift though which can take time to come. Didn't eat or drink in hotel as already booked up else where. Not far rom Paddington tube and main rail connections very easy to find.",5,2015,05,18
104,Disappointment,"Stayed for three nights in Duplex suite. Travel companions stayed in a double deluxe and a further deluxe single. In addition we were given new rooms upon complaint, so we have good impression on the general standard of the hotel. This cannot be regarded as a four star hotel, but rather as a two star hotel. Situated in a worn down, but seen from the street, classic and nice building. Rooms are small and very tight. Significant draft of wind from the old windows. Fairly new bathroom, but much too small. We had ordered the Duplex for four people. Room offered a tiny bathroom (under 3 sq.m.). No place to put your toilet articles, dry or wet towels etc. except two knobs on the door. Second bed only 120 centimetres wide. Could hardly contain two normal weighted children aged nine and thirteen. One closset available in the room. No where else to put clothes, coats, shopped goods. You get a very clear impression of what your neighbours are doing, just from listening while in your room. Breakfast was mediocre and they came short of basics like bread several days. Reception staff was not very assistant on request and did not handle our complaints very well. Rest of the stay we felt like persona non grata.The pictures on their website are VERY friendly to the hotel.",2,2015,05,18
104,Pleasant and relaxed stay at heart of London,"We stayed at Park Grand London Hyde Park hotel last weekend and we were surprised by the comfort and size of the room. It was lovely to have a spacious and comfortable room that perfectly suited us and our little daughter, where she had a space to run and play. The room was very carefully equipped with all necessary bits and pieces. The staff was friendly and welcoming.  We will definitely come back on our next trip to London. Thank  you.",4,2015,05,18
104,Worth the stay,"London is tricky, simply because there are so many hotels to choose from and they vary enormously in quality. Simply said, this hotel is worth the stay because it's dependable. The location is very good, the prices are fair, and the service is excellent. The rooms are small, but then again so are most rooms in London outside of the high end range. 

I received an email 2 days prior to the arrival and told that because of maintenance I had to be moved to another hotel. Thankfully I hadn't read my emails and thus ignored it - and was able to stay at the original location.

I stayed there with two small children and I'd like to extend a special thanks to Mr. Sakar and Mr. Lucian who were extremely courteous and helpful during our stay.",4,2015,05,17
104,Two nights stay,"The hotel is very near Paddington Station which made it ideal as a base.  Unfortunately we arrived at a time when several people were checking in.  However, it didn't take too long before we were in our room.  We thought the room was very well appointed situated at the back of the hotel.  A double bed, tea/coffee making facilities with a plate containing a couple of pieces of fruit which I thought was a nice touch.  The room itself had air conditioning which we needed to use on the second evening.  The unit itself was surprising quiet and didn't keep us awake at all.  Good shower, not huge bathroom but adequate.  The room and bathroom were very clean and the bed extremely comfortable.  Breakfast was served in the basement in a very pleasantly decorated room.  Usual assortment of cereals, juice, pastries and a very good cooked breakfast served buffet style.  In all a very comfortable stay in a hotel which you would think would be noisy but wasn't, hardly heard any traffic noise.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",4,2015,05,14
104,There Were Cupboards in the Wall!,"Awright geeezzaa! I've decided that since this hotel was in London, I will convert this whole review into cockney rhyming slang for added effect. So here goes...

Gawdon Bennet! One ov me mates was ge'in' married near Hyde park, so after searchin' fer 'otels fer da weekend I decided on da Light an' Dark Grand. For 'otels in da area dis one seemed slightly cheaper but also 'ad da same anemities as required. Top dwar! OK?

Awright geeezzaa! The slight, almost obscure downside was what da 'otel recepshunist required a full paymen' up front. I've never know dis befawer, but just wen' wiv i' anyway. So fer people who plan on doin' one befawer da bill is paid an' cancellin' a credi' card, yew'll be scuppered 'ere! Sorted mate.

I didn't actually eat in da 'otel awer drink in da bar, so I can only really commen' on da room. The room was a good size, big enuff TV an' da bed was also decen' enough. The bafroom was quite nice but da shaaahr was massive an' confusing. It was like 'avin' a shaaahr in da Tardis, but a real one rarfer van a prop one from a film set. This may in part be down ter me poor in'elligence. 

So far, so good right? Well 'ere is where i' gets be'er! All ov da walls an' stuff turned in'er cupboards an' desks! It was proper amazing, like bein' in a woman's 'andbag; loads ov room ter put fngs in a fairly finate space. I was proper impressed wiv da cupboards in da walls. I even an' allk photos, which I'll upload. Know what I mean?

Lor' luv a duck! The 'otel is a few minute walk from bof Bayswater an' Paddington (da stashun, not da bear. Don't worry, I was disappoin'ed an' all). There are some nice caf√©s in da area fer a cup ov tea an' bacon burry, Hyde park is round da corner if yew fancy a walk an' i' is generally central ter anythin' yew could do. I couldn't recommend a be'er area fer da money. 

Catch you later geeza",4,2015,05,14
104,Good location,"Hotel is very close to paddington station, made a good base if you are on a business trip. Bedroom and bathroom clean and tidy, staff very friendly and efficient . Would stay here again either on business or leisure",5,2015,05,11
104,Quiet hotel in the heart of London,"We knew nothing about this place when we booked in, other than the price was right, it had great reviews, and it was near Paddington Station and Hyde Park. When we arrived at the hotel, we were very pleasantly surprised. The staff at the front desk were very kind and helpful, the room was clean, quiet and spacious (easily accommodating me, my wife and my 14 year old son), and breakfast in the morning was quite good. Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,10
104,One Week Stay in London,"Pleasant enough Hotel, easy walk to Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate Tube, and the perfect location for access to Central London. Staff could not have been more helpful, particularly Sakar for whom nothing was too much trouble.",4,2015,05,09
104,"It's boutique, it's unique","This is how the hotel brands itself, and it is a very good description of the hotel.  With it being only 5 minutes walk from Paddingtom Station, it is an ideal hotel for this part of 
London.  The hotel is situated on a pleasant terrace that is quiet and away from the main traffic routes.  The rooms are comfortable, with good use of the spaces to maximise the room layout.  The breakfast is of a high standard, fresh and tasty.  The thing that makes this hotel a delight are the staff.  From the first welcoming smile and greeting on arrival to checkout, the staff are very courteous, friendly and professional in their approach to the customer and the customer experience and make the hotel the delightful treasure that it is.  It is a place that I will return to in the future when in London.",4,2015,05,08
104,Great find,"We found this great property through Hotels.com and had a great experience. Loved how close it was to Paddington Station for getting to LHR & and even close to Hyde Park which made our normal running routine very easy to do.  Hotel is not directly on a major street so it's pretty quiet and relaxed.  Staff was quick to help, gave us an unrequested upgrade, and even loaned us a power adapter when ours didn't work.  Would definitely go back!  Only thing to keep in mind is that this hotel is typical European style which means the elevators & hallways are small & there are some random staircases & fire doors.",5,2015,05,08
104,"A chilly reception, literally","Stayed here for two nights,the first night we had to complain about a window which wouldn't close.The person on duty at the time was unhelpful and we had to tolerate a howling gale blowing through the curtains into our room , thankfully the probelm was addressed the next night, poor considering it's a 4 **** establishment.
At breakfast time the bacon on the self service platter was cold, I brought this to a waiters attention who placed his hand on the bacon to verify this! Where did this guy receive his training?
The hotel in all fairness was clean and there was a few nice touches to welcome us, ie a small bottle of plonk, fruit, bottled water and canned drinks.Also a number of items in the bathroon too.
The hotel therefore does care about their guests-up to a point but needs  to work on it's staff training.",4,2015,05,08
104,Good Location,"The room and bathroom was small but very clean and well kept. Very quiet hotel, you would never know you were in a city. Good breakfast with several choices. Helpful staff and a quick check in process. Booked directly and got a bargain. Would happily stay again.",4,2015,05,07
104,Disappointing,"I stayed here for one night with work. Check in took ages - I was told to sit and wait and then more and more people came in and queued in front of me so it took even longer!

My room had two twin beds. Paying ¬£90 a night I hadn't expected luxury, but in my opinion it was worth than many Travelodges and Premier Inns I've stayed in. Peeling paint, lack of space, extremely steep stairs leading down from the wardrobe to the bed area (very bizarre), everything just looked pretty old and could do with an upgrade.

The window was propped open with a piece of wood, not very safely as when I removed it the (very old and heavy) window crashed down on my hand, resulting in a gash and now a big and painful bruise. Not great!

Breakfast was very limited, a pretty poor selection and worse than cheaper chain hotels. I won't stay here again, it felt more like a cheap guesthouse or hostel.",2,2015,05,06
104,Weekend Break,"This hotel is very central to all amenities only al 5 minutes walk from shops, restaurants, pubs and  tube station.  It is well maintained, spotlessly clean, very modern in its d√©cor and very reasonable for the area it is situated in. Clean towels every morning and no need to bring shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand soap or hair dryer as all these are supplied.    The choice for breakfast is a full English or continental, with a good choice of fruit, cheeses, croissants, yoghurts, cereals and juices, coffee and a variety of teas.  Definitely something to satisfy everyone's dietary needs and preferences. The staff are friendly, efficient and very helpful. A good range of daily newspapers are available in the hotel bar every morning.  I would give this hotel 10/10 and would have no hesitation recommending it to family or friends.  If every I return to London I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,05,05
104,A lovely hotel with a few flaws,"Overall I had a lovely stay here with my friends. We had room 403 which is a triple room. It was very spacious, clean and the shower was very large. The beds for me were heaven, however they are on the soft side so if you like your mattress firm this may not be the best choice for you. The breakfast was also very good, lots of choice and very attentive staff; one member of the party has a dairy intolerence and they made a fresh batch of scrambled eggs without any dairy in for her which was lovely. Some very minor negatives; you can hear the road from the room at the front so if you're very noise sensitive I would be aware of that. Also, if you have any members of your party that have difficulties with stairs beware; some of the rooms you have to go up a small flight of stairs after getting out of the lift so accessibility may be an issue for some. Overall a lovely stay and for me I would definitely return.",4,2015,05,04
104,"Expected a lot more, way over priced.","It was an okay weekend based on the location of the hotel but the hotel itself was very poor quality for the asking price of a room. 
The room was small, damaged, dusty and not what we were told we would be paying for. The bathroom was the size of two cupboards that you would usually keep a boiler in which didn't bother us to much however, on our first morning we woke up and went downstairs for our ""Complimentary English breakfast"" to find out that it would cost an extra ¬£10 each, we also noticed that our room didn't include the docking station that we were told would be in the room for us to use, neither was there fresh fruit or a choice of exotic aroma that was also advertised to us for our room. We found hairs that in no way could of belonged to either of us in the bed and bathroom and a blood stained pillowcase. As we looked further around our room there was also a fair few dents, scuffs and marks on the walls, followed by dust in most places and paint marks on the windows. We paid over ¬£400 for 3 nights in this hotel which we feel was a total rip-off. Unless the room quality is improved and the price of the rooms are lowered we will definitely not be returning to this hotel. ",2,2015,05,03
104,Great value and convenient location,"I recently stayed two nights in a single room, number 203. It was a perfect size for a single traveler, with enough floor space for a suitcase stand, a good sized desk and chair and still room to move around comfortably. The room and bathroom felt very clean. Coffee, tea and biscuits are provided in a generous quantity with the kettle. 

There were two potential negatives to this particular room. The bed is very soft, I would have preferred a firmer mattress. Also, it is adjacent to a stairwell, which could be disturbing if you wished to sleep late and other guests were using the stairs to go breakfast. This noise never bothered me as I was awake early.

The wifi signal was strong. My rate included the breakfast buffet, which was delicious and was constantly replenished. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The location was very convenient and I felt that it was an excellent value.",4,2015,05,03
104,Needs improving,"Boutique is a word that raises expectations and the same goes for de-luxe. Both should come with a health warning or trade description because this hotel fits neither. Rooms are tired and musty withe stained carpets and battered furniture. The single room is the smallest I have ever seen even by London standards - shoe box is a better description. I asked to move rooms as the first had a strong smell and was noisy to find the next room was just as inadequate. The sound proofing is poor so all corridor noise is heard in the rooms. Duvets, pillows and towels are thin and low grade - Premier inn do this so much better. This would have been an even lower review but was redeemed by friendly receptionist and ok breakfast. In short - way short of four stars.",2,2015,05,03
104,"Location, location, location","This hotel is very well situated just ten minutes walk from Paddington Station. I had booked a single room and got a small but very nice room on the basement level towards the back of the hotel. I'm particularly impressed with how space was utilised in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. It's not always easy to find your room in these hotels that are in rebuilt old terraces, but the staff was very helpful with this as with everything else. They had a good English Breakfast for a reasonable extra fee. All in all, this was very good value for the money.",5,2015,05,03
104,"Good hotel, good location, great staff","This was my second stay at the Park Grand Hyde park. The hotel is conveniently located within 10 mts from Paddington and Lancaster gate stations. It is on a quiet side street, thus giving advantages of both being in the hub of Paddington and yet in a peaceful area.  The staff at the hotel is excellent. Sanya was always looking out to make sure I was comfortable and when there was a small problem, both she and her manager Gurdeep went out of their way to correct things immediately. Their professionalism and caring do add to the hotels appeal. 

Overall a great hotel. I will stay there again when I get a chance.",5,2015,05,02
104,Pleasurable stay,"Booked this hotel online last minute for a business trip. Very close to Paddington rail station hence why I picked it. I was surprised just how easy it made my morning commute. I asked for a quiet room and was situated on the 6th floor. Quiet it was. Brilliant for a good nights sleep. The room itself was very compact, would have been nice to have been in a slightly larger one as I stayed for 5 nights. Nether the less it had everything I needed. Only fault was upon arrival I wasn't told about dining facilities. Would have been nice if the hotel offered in room dining. The fridge in my room also didn't work. The bathroom was rather on the small side but very modern and worked as required. The lighting in the room could also have been better. In wardrobe lighting would have worked wonders as it was difficult to see what was in there as it was so dark. I would definitely recommend this hotel but more for short breaks than long stay.",4,2015,05,01
104,Polite and friendly staff,"Good hotel, in a great location for Paddington.  I've stayed here on a couple of occassions and foudn the staff to be polite and friendly. Rooms are variable - I've stayed in two club rooms - one on two levels facing out to the front of the hotel where there wa bit of traffic noise which wasn't great, but the one at the back of the hotel on 4th flr was excellent.  Only downside is that the hotel do not offer food in the onsite restaurant in the evenings (they do a good breakfast in the mornibngs though).",4,2015,05,01
104,Nothing extraordinary,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in April. The hotel met our needs, and was comfortable and clean, but was not an extraordinary hotel. The room was very small and there was no minibar which was a shame, as my partner and I like to keep some cold snacks and drinks close by. 

I will note that the shower pressure and Wi-Fi were excellent, as was the location of the hotel - very short walk to Paddington Station.",4,2015,04,30
104,Best Customer Service,"From the moment we walked in to this hotel to the moment we checked out we received the most amazing customer service from each employee we had contact with. Front desk was helpful and friendly at all times. The doormen went above and beyond at all times. Great place to stay if you need easy access to the airport. The hotel is a short walk to Paddington Station to catch the Heathrow Express. 

Fantastic place to stay and I hope I make it to London again so I may stay here again.",5,2015,04,30
104,Don't be fooled by the misleading claims on the website.,"Currently staying at this hotel. Very dissapointed. We booked a Club Double room, unfortunately the room was so small that we had to turn sideways to move around the bed. We also realised that the fridge in the room did not work. Staff agreed to move us to a different room the next day. Unfortunately the new room, although a bit bigger, did not have the features of the Club Room, nor does the¬†fridge work. Maintenance has just advised us that all the fridges are the same and there is nothing he can do about it. Putting anything cold in the fridge will warm it up, even with the fridge set to maximum cool. If you are looking for an enjoyable holiday in London then please do not stay here. How they can claim it to be four star is beyond me. Advertising on website is wildly exaggerated and misleading. Staff are very pleasant, but in the end the hotel is not as claimed or advertised.",2,2015,04,30
104,"Welcoming, efficient and friendly staff","I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel, having booked it based on price and location. The staff throughout the hotel, from the reception to the porter and the breakfast staff were all polite, helpful and smiling. I was a single traveller, my room was small but seemed to be recently refurbished with a good bathroom. The only downside was a rather noisy neighbour making loud telephone calls in the early hours of the morning, however, the second night was much more peaceful. Good breakfast, fast and free WiFi. I would definitely book again if in London.",5,2015,04,30
104,excellent service,as i entered the hotel i was greeted by the receptionist sakar. i believe he was from nepal. after hearing the tragic accident in nepal the receptionist was still at his best service giving me everything i needed. he gave me a warming invite to london as i dont know my way around he advised me and suggested many places to g. top service by this man and if hes not the manager he should be!,5,2015,04,30
104,good weekend break in London,"Great hotel, in great part of London, close to two tube stations and walking distance from Hyde Park and with a couple of great restaurants nearby. 

The hotel should be proud of the staff that work there as the service was very good service, delivered by very helpful and friendly staff.

to top it all......Breakfast was Excellent",4,2015,04,29
104,Excellent hotel ,"Had a weekend away this hotel is excellent the room we stayed in was very good with a very comfortable bed 
 the staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you 
The breakfast is excellent with a wide choice of food to suit everyone 
Will use this hotel again ",5,2015,04,27
104,Good service,"I stayed at this hotel for a week time for business purpose. 
This hotel located very close to the Paddigton tube station & very convenient to reach by 10 min walk.
Hotel room was very nicely maintained, neat & clean.
The service & courtesy offered by hotel staff was very much appreciable. Specially i would like to put my thanks to Mr. Sakar, Ms. Sanya & Mr. Gurdeep, Ms. Pamela those who were very much courteous during my stay in this hotel. These staff are great asset to this lovely hotel. 
Would like to visit again to this hotel...",5,2015,04,27
104,good stay,"My overall stay was excellent. 

Staff and services were attentive and very good 

The place is convenient for shopping and visiting landmark places. The Wi-Fi is fast and very reliable. And it's easy to connect with your friends.

I would stay here again!!",4,2015,04,26
104,Fantastic value for your money....great stay!,"On a two day holiday with family, we needed something central yet not too expensive. Found this place within our criteria along with a breakfast option. Great price. The staff is very attentive and helpful. The stay was quiet and we were well rested. Of course its Europe, so real estate is small, but it gets the job done. Its not a cheap place, and has its fine touches. Lots of shops nearby, with Paddington station within an eye's view. Great stay, price, and value. What more can you ask for?",5,2015,04,25
104,Surprisingly quiet location,"Overall, a very comfortable stay. From the smiling, polite doorman to the reception staff who resolved a room allocation issue on arrival - everyone was friendly and helpful. Breakfast choices were also very good. The road to the front of the hotel was much quieter than I had anticipated for central London, which was a bonus when it came to sleeping well.",4,2015,04,24
104,Great Value,"Generally I had a good experience with the hotel.

Can't hide the fact I was really disappointed with the arrival part, my wife & I stay in London 3 times a year (birthdays & wedding anniversary) and I had emailed the hotel a few days before to say this was my wifes birthday, please can they acknowledge it upon arrival or have a note in the room just to say happy birthday (I have done this with the Park Plaza chain on a regular basis & they have never let me down!) So when we checked in and they didn't say anything, I felt quite let down to be honest.

The room itself, clean, comfy bed, nice shower and for the price you just cannot argue with the value.  It is 3 or 4 mins from Paddington station and therefore easy enough to get around London so pound for pound you wouldn't be disappointed.

The staff themselves were polite but to be fair, we didn't spend much time at the hotel.

What I would leave with is the fact that for the money it is fantastic value, I scoured the web looking for an alternative to the Park Plaza chain due to it being fully booked that day, ended up with this and the birthday message aside, I was pleased with the choice.",4,2015,04,22
104,"Great Hotel, Beds,  Breakfast & Location",The hotel allowed us an early checkin to drop our bags and to hold our bags at check out. the breakfast was great and one of the best nights sleep I've had in a hotel for years. The rooms are a quirky arrangement but as expected in a building that must have once been a beautiful palatial house. The staff were great and very helpful. But the location is superb if you get the train into Paddington.,5,2015,04,22
104,Fabulous,"Nice location..close to Hyde park,Paddington station and Lancaster gate tube station.Very Friendly staff.. Clean rooms..Reasonable prices..Free wifi in the rooms with high speed...which I consider a very important advantage not available in most of other hotels in London..
My overall rating is Super excellent.
I highly recommend.",5,2015,04,21
104,Great staff,"Excellent staff - very polite and friendly. I was welcomed on arrival and given the impression that nothing was too much. I would definitely return and recommend it as a warm, friendly, positive place to stay. Very close to Paddington station also.",4,2015,04,21
104,Convenient and clean hotel in central London,"We were welcomed by friendly staff and after requesting a change of room the response was positive, courteous and helpful. The rooms are small, but this is central London and price fair. Breakfast was underwhelming in terms of quality and flavour although the breakfast staff were friendly.",3,2015,04,20
104,What a pleasurable stay! Will be back,"As an American in London, I can say with confidence -- service is a big deal to me. 

The staff make this hotel! Hands down I come back all the time because of how well the staff treat their guests. A big massive shout out to Sakar and Adriana for always going above and beyond to help me when I check in. The hotel is such a great location so it's the perfect place to stay in west London. I sincerely appreciate the comfortable beds,  big rooms and convoence  I receive every time i stay. Thank you- and look forward to future stays.",4,2015,04,18
104,A Peaceful Night,"We needed one night accommodation with great location and we found this.  Very close to Paddington tube/train station and plenty of buses. On arrival the staff that greeted us were very pleasant and we got an upgrade in rooms. The room was a really good size, as was the shower.  The view from the room was pretty much what we expected from a hotel in London.  Will definitely come here again.",5,2015,04,17
104,Fantastic hotel and good value!,"Very accommodating. Polite and warm staff on arrival and during our stay. Included breakfast was brilliant. Easy access to Paddington Stations, only a short walk. Parking outside at a reasonable daily charge, which I have taken note for future visits!",5,2015,04,16
104,Good location!,"Really good location, right near Paddington station and Hyde Park, with easy access to Regents Park Canal. When we arrived, our room was not ready (as we were early), and they upgraded us to a club room, which was really good of them. Upon entering the room, it was ok in size, a little bit tired in places, overall - OK. The room was quite warm, but had air con which was a plus. After the first night, we went down for breakfast, which was meant to be prepaid, but as hotels.com had not sent the correct information, we ended up paying for it. They said initially it was ok to eat, I assumed at that point we didn't need to pay, so it was a bit of a shock that they came up to me with a piece of paper to sign to bill it to my room. This should have been explained before we started. Overall, a decent hotel in London.",3,2015,04,16
104,Everything I'd expect and more,"Clean and quiet.
Very comfortable, great bed and pillows - basic I know but rare!
The best breakfast I've had in London for a while...
Staff very helpful and friendly.
Great location.
Very competitively priced.
I'll stay there again.",5,2015,04,16
104,"Delicious breakfast, great location with luxury of an upgraded room","We've stayed at various Shaftesbury hotels and have always enjoyed our stay. The Park grand was no exception, upon arrival the staff were friendly and welcoming. We were told our room had been upgraded and was pleasantly surprised upon entering that we had a mezzanine. This floor had a little sofa, big flatscreen tv, desk area and a kitchenette area with tea making facilities.

The bed was very comfortable (as always) and there was the use of a safe. The bath room was tiny however the shower had good pressure so no complaints.

The typical English breakfast was nice, not much selection for any other things though but once again I can't fault it.

We will definitely be staying here again.",4,2015,04,15
104,excellent,"the last month we had twoo rooms in the hotel the attention of mr Sakar manager of hotel was great and marvelous the staff in the restaurant was very good with my child alex
he remember all the grat moments with this staff thank so much   peter cope and gonzalo",5,2015,04,15
104,Bad reservation system,"This hotel is conveniently located, The rooms are quite small and the bathrooms are very small. The hotel is well managed, but the reservation system is not. The night we arrived we, and several other guests, were told the rooms we had reserved were not available. Instead of two deluxe doubles for our family we were told to be very pleased that we had 3 rooms. We were not pleased. We were traveling with children, and that meant that the father could not be in the same room as his family. The two extra rooms were tiny and cost half that of the rooms we had reserved, but we had to argue to get a price adjustment. We were at the hotel for 7 days, so it would have been nice to have 2 deluxe rooms nearby, but when we were moved the second day it was to two different floors. I might also mention that the rooms do not match the descriptions on the reservations website. We would not stay at this hotel again.",4,2015,04,15
104,What a surprise.,"In fact, we did not expect the quality of this hotel, if one knows the hotel situation in London. The Park Grand is one of hundreds of hotels with a similar concept. Our (Family room with two double beds - 401) was very clean, relatively new (the building is renovated), very quiet, the bathroom was incredible small, but with good hot/cold water supply, the service (except when we have checked in) was friendly and helpful and the location is central. Good restaurants are just around the corner. The Park Grand has parking lots in front of the hotel. Now of course you can stay in a much better hotel in London, for example, Claridge's Hotel, but this is always a matter of personal budgets. Therefore, quickly forget the breakfast at the Park Grand, take a taxi and every morning have breakfast at Claridge's. Great.",4,2015,04,13
104,Excellent,"Had a great stay here, rooms are a good size, the staff were very friendly and accommodating and a huge thank you to Sakar Adriana for helping to sort complications arisen from booking through a third party.",5,2015,04,12
104,Do Not Trust Booking,"I booked and paid for this hotel through Last Minute - arrived at 9pm to check in.  Only to be told that there were no rooms available.  Instead transferred me to another (much lower standard hotel), which took 45 to transfer and check into.  I was travelling on my own, so this experience was very upsetting.  Do Not Trust this hotel.",1,2015,04,10
104,Great stay,"We had a fantastic stay and were thrilled with our room which was on two levels so there was plenty of space. The bed was so comfy - a real treat! Hotel ideally located, near to Paddington tube station so an excellent choice for a city break. Staff really friendly and there was a great choice for breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,09
104,Nice hotel! ,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding with other friends. Really nice place. Quiet but central location (recommend The Porchester pub down the road), decent brekky and a good sized bed! And it was a bargain! Felt there could have been more choice at brekky but otherwise a gem! ",5,2015,04,09
104,Theatre break,This was super accommodation with an excellent location. The staff were polite and welcoming on arrival. The bedrooms were spotlessly clean which were well equipped. Will definitely book again for business trips.,5,2015,04,08
104,spacious value,"no problems at check-in.  the room was on two levels; sleeping upstairs and lounge are and bathroom downstairs, so lots of space.  Staff were helpful to find somewhere to eat out and the breakfast selection had all I needed to choose from.",4,2015,04,07
104,""""""" Very pleasant stay """"""","The hotel is near padding ton tube station, which serves three different lines and therefore guarantees easy access to all parts of the city and Heatarow airport . 
There are restaurants, shops and supermarkets around , 5 minutes away . 

The rooms are very good size lovely, and the bed is very comfy!  Shower is powerful just the way I liked it , everything is very clean and well-maintained.
Some rooms may be a little loud as they are facing the street, but for a city hotel it is definitely fine.
WiFi works fine, breakfast is very tasty and proper English better than cafe outside . 
Staffs are very helpful and friendly and mr sakar is just a very big assets of this property . 
I genuinely booked this hotel because of the friendly staff they have and huge credit goes to mr sakar who help me to make my stay at London pleasant .
His attitude and his hospatilty is very welcoming and professional.

104,"Perfect Hotel to stay in Paddington, London","Park Grand London Hyde Park is a good 4 star hotel in Paddington, London, hotel is situated in 78-82 Westbourne Terrace, Paddington. it's a boutique hotel, i booked  Club Double Room - Inc. English Breakfast for 4 nights stay, staff of hotel is very supportive. 

Again Thanks! Park Grand London Hyde Park",4,2015,04,06
104,So good!,"Very friendly, attentive staff. Great water pressure, temperature, bedding, etc. Whenever I check into a low-price hotel I do my walk through: flush toilet, check shower pressure and temperature, sink pressure and temperature, bed firmness, tea, fridge and dust check before I even take my coat off. Goes to show the wild array of places that have charmed and traumatised me in the past! This place passes every test. Yes the rooms are small if you're on your own but if you're on your own in a city like London you're not going to be in your room all the time anyway. It's perfectly sized for one person actually and the ground-floor facing the back is great. The beds are particularly nice here. Very soft, warm and cozy and great TV channels, fast Wifi, the works. Will definitely stay here many times again :)",5,2015,04,04
104,"Nice place, brilliant staff.","Booked this hotel for myself and wife along with 5 children, always anxious when travelling with kids but I had no need to be here, the location is great, we could walk to Paddington station in 5 mins and more importantly be back in the hotel in 5 mins after returning from a day trip.
Rooms were clean and comfortable , bathroom was small, but, it fits the shower toilet and basin in so don't need much more, but, may be a problem if someone wanted the privacy of getting changed in there after a shower etc.
Breakfast was tasty enough and plenty of it, my only concern here was the tables were a bit close together and getting up to walk through could be inconvenient for other diners when busy, but that is minor to be honest.
Bar area is small and seemed to close at 11, which may be a problem to some but that didn't worry us with being with kids, but if you are expecting a residents late bar when you return from elsewhere I don't think it will happen. Having said that, the staff here are so helpful they may well do if you asked!
The few minor points above should get in the way of the fact this is a very good hotel and we had a lovely stay, and saving the best until last, the staff, I found the staff here to be some of the most pleasant, polite and helpful staff I have ever dealt with, from explaining the best way to get from a-b and general questions, to genuine smiles and greetings with nothing being too much trouble and we genuinely felt welcome, which is important. I would recommend this hotel for anyone staying a few days in London, it was good value and a nice place.",4,2015,04,04
104,We booked the wrong Park Grand,"I had previously stayed at Park Grand Paddington and was very very impressed, my wife thought she had booked the same hotel because it was nearer to Paddington station but unfortunately she booked the Park Grand Hyde Park. Very,  very disappointed, our room verging on dangerous, on the door ( room 501 )  says, mind the step, that's an understatement, as I opened the door I stumbled down four steps, only just remaining upright., the first step is within the width of the door opening!!

 We stayed two nights, fridge toppled out when door was opened and never achieved anything like a chill,  safe was not attached to the building fabric so could be carried out., blind between bathroom and bedroom had been pulled out of runner so just left hanging.  Very tried room, loo did 
not flush properly, room was not serviced after first night , we contacted reception at 4pm was offered a coffee while they rushed in to carry out room service, not really completed satisfactory, no fruit no water  and not even hoovered. 
Breakfast very good but restaurant not big enough for the numbers trying to eat at the same time, 

Would we stay again, that's an easy question, the answer, definitely NOT!!!

I had recommend the hotel chain to business friends, I am embarrassed, and shall be email my apologies.",1,2015,04,04
104,My New Favorite Hotel,"I have been to London several times, but this was my first time staying near Paddington at this hotel.  First,  I just want to say what a great location!  Close to the Station and several bus stops, made it around London easily and felt safe walking in the neighborhood returning from seeing a play on Tuesday night.  I shared the room with a friend and we agreed that there was plenty of room for our suitcases and our shopping treasures!  The beds were comfortable and we were able to adjust the temperature in the room to fit our needs.  The bathroom is tiny, very little room for our toiletries and other items, but for us no big deal.  There is storage, you need to put stuff away, it is hard to live out of a suitcase. WiFi was strong and the breakfast was plentiful.  The staff was very accommodating and answered our questions about activities in the area.  My one comment is to watch out when you take a shower, the water was scalding and we had to play with it to get it to a temperature that was comfortable. In addition, the water drained slowly and if you like long showers you may find that you flood the bathroom!  Overall, I would recommend and plan on staying here again on my next London adventure!",4,2015,04,03
104,Very satisfied,"I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel .. The people working at the reception were super friendly, I asked for an early check in and I was given one, and I asked for a a late check out and I was also given that !
Excellent location, close to everything you might need !
Very reasonable price for this type of hotel in that type of location.

Very very happy with my stay there .",5,2015,04,03
104,Just what I needed,"I came into London earlier than check in but was able to leave my bags at reception with no fuss. When I came back my room was ready and I was helped to carry my luggage upstairs by the lovely gentleman at reception. My room was a tiny bit worse for wear, there was a tear in one section of wall paper, there were a few scuff marks on the walls and one of the lights and one plug socket was a tad temperamental but there were plenty of other light and power sources in my room so it didn't matter! And more importantly the room was clean.

The bed was comfy, the shower was amazing and there was plenty of wardrobe, drawer and cupboard space, as well as a safe. Plenty of complimentary tea, coffee, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and soap on offer too! Just make sure your door is shut properly when you leave, mine needed a bit of a tug to close fully!

If you do book this hotel, book direct from them as you get breakfast included, the breakfast was delicious but not something I'd pay ¬£15 for on top of my room. That said the rooms here are incredibly well priced.

The wifi in this hotel is brilliant and a quick phone call down to reception will sort you out with the password (or ask on check in).

Check out is at 12pm which is plenty long enough and a quick ring down to reception meant I got a hand with my luggage again.

My only real downside to my trip was that the bar wasn't open very late, it'd have been nice to get a drink when I got in from the theatre. (on another note, this hotel is ~5 mins from paddington tube station- not hyde park as you may think- and it was really easy to get around from here)

This hotel is definitely worth booking, the staff are amazing, incredibly accommodating and the rooms are the perfect size. Good price, good experience. I'll definitely be back!",4,2015,04,02
104,Excellent stay,"Me and my partner stayed from 25th-27th March in room 307. We arrived to check in to our deluxe double room and were greeted by a lovely girl on reception she upgraded us to a club deluxe double which was lovely.

We had a small shower room with a very powerful shower, double bed which was clean and comfortable. We had an upstairs which included a sofa bed, tv and small kitchen. 

The room was lovely, the staff were lovely and showed brilliant customer service, the hotel was a 5 minute walk from paddington station and was in a central location.

I genuinely couldn't find any faults with this hotel and will most definitely be staying again. Also great value for money!

Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2015,03,31
104,Good hotel,"I stayed here with my mum and my brother and sisters . Hotel is very nice .
Staff are very friendly, especially Mr sakar been very helpful throught our stay . 
Its very close to central london . Harrods is 10 mins by taxi . Breakfast was yummy . Room was descent size and very clean .
We loved this hotel . Will be back again soon",5,2015,03,31
104,Perfect little find,"A clean super friendly little find. We stayed in London with my daughter and friends for a wedding. The staff were helpful, accommodating (my daughter travelled by train and arrived an hour before us) and very friendly. 
We were on the 7th floor (lift to the 6th and a short stair case to the seventh) - we were offered a swap but declined - the views were lovely from the top. The room was well appointed, clean and stocked with the usual - tea, coffee, buscuits,  2 pieces of fruit and bathroom samples. The shower was excellent with good power and plenty of hot water. The room was compact /bijoux - only just room to walk round the bed. But when you only need to sleep it's ok. Very comfortable beds.
The breakfast was included and there was a well cooked selection of full  English and cereals or continental. It was busy on Sunday at 9:15... not so on the Saturday at 7:30 (we dud have an early wedding to get to!)
The proximity to Paddington /Hyde Park/local bars was very convenient -The Union near the canal and The Porchester. 
I will certainly book again and go directly rather than through a booking agent.",4,2015,03,30
104,Brilliant value for money - book direct,"Myself and my partner enjoyed a weekend away in London here and we were very pleasantly surprised to find staff that couldn't do enough for you , fantastic facilities in room and the best nights sleep I've had in ages.breakfast looked good but due to the comfy bed we overslept and only caught the end of it ! ",5,2015,03,29
104,Great location and very clean,Stayed here for 2 nights mid week. Easy to locate and close to paddington tube station and Rail station. Arrived on an early flight but they had our room ready straight away. Room was clean and tidy and house keeping was at a very high standard. In a great location if you are looking to get around the city. Didn't avail of any food or drink on the premises so cannot comment on this. Very satisfied with the stay would definitely recommend it.,4,2015,03,29
104,EXCELLENT VALUE & LOCATION,"We stayed here for 2 nights & would honestly say that it's probably the best London hotel we've stayed in (so far!)
the hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Paddington Station & 5 minutes from Hyde park, in a very grand Victorian avenue.
Check-in was very quick & efficient & we were in our room within a matter of minutes.
We had booked a club room & were very pleased with it. On entering, there was a small passageway, with the bathroom to the right & the bedroom straight ahead. On the left of the passageway was a staircase to a mezzanine level, which contained a sofa, tv & small kitchenette area, which we hadn't expected.
As per most London hotels, the sleeping area was fairly small, with a standard double bed, wardrobe & desk area. The area under the stairs provided ample storage space for our cases, freeing up a bit of space around the bed. This wasn't an issue as, due to the mezzanine, there was ample room for us.
Our room was at the front of the hotel & we noticed very little noise from outside, always a bonus!
All of the staff that we had contact with were very welcoming, friendly & professional.
We had booked on a bed & breakfast basis & the breakfast certainly did not disappoint.
The restaurant was in the basement of the building, but was very light & welcoming, although not huge in size.
There was the standard array of hot & cold breakfast items to suit all tastes & it was served on a buffet basis with plenty of staff to keep things replenished.
I always use my own ""sausage test""(!) to gauge how good a hotel's breakfast is, poor quality or cheap sausages are always a disappointment & usually a good indication of the rest of the food. The hotel passed with flying colours, some of the nicest sausages I've had & the rest of the items were of a similar, high quality.
We paid ¬£260 for 2 nights bed &  breakfast & can honestly say that it's unbelievable value for central London, we looked at hotels further out of town & with lower star ratings & a lot of them wanted that amount for one night.
If I had to take issue with anything, it would be the size of the bathroom. If, like me, the sizing on the labels of your clothes begins with an ""X"", you may find it a little on the small side. That said, the fittings were all of a high standard, it was very clean & there were plenty of toiletries.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of visiting London, you certainly won't be disappointed, both with the quality of your stay or it's location.
We booked our stay directly through the hotel website.",5,2015,03,29
104,Great staff and good location,Very friendly and welcoming staff at this hotel. My room was fine and location good - just a short walk from Paddington station and underground. I was in London for business and will certainly return again.,5,2015,03,28
104,Hidden Gem,"Stayed here on business, what a great place to stay, staff were excellent and helpful, food was good and the accom was fantastic, definitely be staying again. A short walk to Paddington Station was also helpful.",5,2015,03,28
104,Great location near the tube station,Nice small hotel with a good breakfast included. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Small bathroom but good bed and a restful sleep after exploring London each day. Just around the corner from some good restaurants and shops.,4,2015,03,26
104,"Great value for the price, and great location.","Nice boutique style hotel between Paddington Station and Hyde Park. Very friendly and professional staff, they helped us make the most of our 2 days in London. Very clean, and a great breakfast. Bar available for drinks while we waited for our room.",4,2015,03,25
104,Pleasant surprise!,"I stayed here last night and was impressed by the welcome, the hospitality and the approach to service demonstrated by the staff. The rooms was great with comfy bed, warm shower with great pressure and the room was surprisingly well appointed. Particular thanks must go to Sakar who was on Reception - a cheery smile, warm welcome and great suggestion for some dinner close by. A really nice chap and a great asset to the hotel - THANKS!",5,2015,03,24
104,Excellent,"We just stayed her and we found it was a great place to stay. Close to restaurants, the tube, and the hop on hop off tour bus. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,03,22
104,A little bit of uniqueness,"We had a beautiful, clean and well stocked room. Everything you could ask for. And breakfast, OMG!!! You can't go wrong, everything was so fresh and tasty. All our requests were met with a smile and promptness. I can't fault this hotel for anything.",4,2015,03,22
104,The most helpful hotel staff in London,"Considering how close it is to Paddington Station and how handy it is for the West End this is not an expensive hotel, but the staff make you feel like you're staying at The Ritz. Gettign a room ready for me six hours before check-in time? No problem sir. Could I move to a larger room on an upper floor for the same price? No problem sir. Has anyone found my phone? Here it is sir. Has anyone found my wallet? Here it is sir. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the breakfast is great value, but it is the staff who make me want to come back. They are all friendly, helpful and courteous, and Sakar and Frederico deserve a special mention.",5,2015,03,22
104,Great London base,"The Park Grand is a reasonably good hotel.  The location is excellent and it is only a short walk to the Paddington tube and train station. The rooms and bathrooms are very small but given the central location in London thats not surprising. It is very quiet so you can get a good rest and the breakfast is basic but of a good standard. The wifi is a bit hit and miss, as is the service at times. Our room was not cleaned on one day and the heater was also broken all minor inconveniences though when considering the price and location.",3,2015,03,22
104,Good stay in Central London,"It is a very nice hotel, located very near to Paddington underground. Also,  close to many main bus routes. Rooms are nice but small (given central London).  It has good veg options also in the buffet breakfast - a plus point for Indians. Staff is very courteous and supportive. Nice facilities including free wifi and hot water kettle. The only problem we had was that the bed was not very comfortable and  the rooms are not sound proof (we could hear noises from around).
Otherwise it is great place to stay.",4,2015,03,20
104,Great staff and great location,"Arriving late, I was greeted by Pamela and Sakar at the front desk. They swiftly did all the formalities, but much more importantly: They made me feel genuinely WELCOME. This is something so many hotels get wrong.

The location is excellent: Easy walk to/from Paddington, Hyde Park, Oxford Street and so on. Starting the day with a jog through Hyde Park is the best way to start any day in London.

The room was also very good: big enough, decent and clean bathroom and surprisingly quiet considering the central location.

But the best part of my stay was to return to the hotel in the evening and be greeted by Pamela and Sakar with a warm and genuine welcome.

Whether it's for business or pleasure, this hotel ticks all the boxes and at a decent price too. Well worth the money.",5,2015,03,19
104,"""Excellent visit at park grand  """"","stayed here at 2011 with friends  and return visit as our anniversary present booked by my husband  was just as good as was in last visit .Lovely boutique hotel in excellent location .
Had breakfast included in our package at this time and i have to say it was excellent, lovely hot croissants, proper coffee and the cooked breakfast was great . 
Checking in was smooth, friendly  and professional staff  . Arrived early and our bags were stored and in our allocated room on return . 
we were given a two level room . one level was a reception , little kitchen , microwave , sofa and tv 
and one level was a descent size room  with  very comfy bed . a wonderful shower all that is needed for weekend stay , hairdryer , safe and coffee making facilities .
Reception staff make an excellent effort to reserve a table for us at shard tower , that was very impressive.
All in all most enjoyable stay in london and will definately be back .",5,2015,03,18
104,Home from home,"We came on this hotel by good luck over a year ago. We regularly use the hotel the last time being a week ago. Very near to a main railway station ,3 underground routes and Hyde Park. 
This is an excellent hotel which is kept spotless. The bedrooms are modern. The staff are excellent and very helpful.The housekeeping  staff are constantly checking to make  sure you have all you need . This is like home  from home....oooh and forgot an excellent breakfast.",5,2015,03,18
104,A lovely Unique Hotel,"I booked using the top secret hotels, so was pleasantly surprised to be stopping at this hotel. I was in a single room, which although best described as cosy was very comfortable with a HUGE tv on the wall.

Staff exceptionally friendly, and breakfast was very good.

Only minor issue was that the room I was in was only single glazed, and a bit drafty with the curtains open - fine with the (very heavy) curtains shut.

Very handy for both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube and the Paddington canal basin. Hyde Park a short walk too.

Recommended alternative to the big brand hotels.",5,2015,03,18
104,Courteous and helpful staff,An excellent value deal through laterooms. Impressed with club room. Very good breakfast included though that might have been an error by laterooms which was honoured by hotel. Arrived by minibus which staff went out of their way to find me a parking spot. Would definitely use again.,4,2015,03,18
104,Convenient and Good Hotel,"Turning up with 'man flu' and just wanting to sleep the check in was friendly and quick, the 1st floor club room was fairly small but comfortable. The bed was comfortable however the ensuite was pretty cramped. The shower drainage did not work very well and I was worried about flooding the bathroom. Breakfast was quite limited in choice but service was very good and attentive.

In sumary, a good place for me to stay for the one night, with the proviso,a little squeezed in the room and in the layout of the hotel.",4,2015,03,18
104,Surprising start but quick recovery,"After checking in about 2pm I made my way to my room only to discover that it was already occupied. Now, I'll try most things once but a m√©nage a trois with complete strangers was a little more than I was expecting, a green tea and decent wifi would have sufficed. Still, the hotel got it sorted very quickly, I made some pretty ladies laugh in reception (always a bonus) and the rest of the stay was fine. Decent enough hotel at a reasonable price overall and I think the mix up at the start was just a genuine mistake.",3,2015,03,18
104,Surprisingly good,"Excellent accommodation although suffering from some traffic noise
Staff extremely friendly and helpful
Accommodated on two floors with seating area on Ground and bedroom on first
Room well fitted and very comfortable",4,2015,03,16
104,best yet,Excellent location by Paddington station and first class connections to all of London we wanted to see. Service accommodation and cleanliness were faultless. Much more spacious than other more expensive places we have stayed. Very good fresh breakfast food,4,2015,03,16
104,Great Stay,I found the staff very friendly and cooperative. Though I had some hick ups initially Mr Sakar at the reception went out of his way to make my stay a memorable one. He was always available to attend to any issue and see to it that it was resolved. I would come back and stay. Location is great.,4,2015,03,15
104,Great experience.I surely recommend this hotel.,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Sakar guided us through the London attractions.He is very helpful and hospitable.

Hotel is very near to Paddington station,just ,5 minutes walk. Rooms are very clean and very well maintained.

Overall I rate 9 out of 10 and I am I will be back.",5,2015,03,15
104,Couldn't ask for more.,"Stayed for three (3) nights in this character filled hotel located in a renovated Georgian townhouse typical of the Paddington/Bayswater area.  Selected the hotel because of its location and we were not disappointed.  Arriving at Paddington Station we were able to easily walk to the hotel with our luggage.  Also we made great use of the easy access to the underground during our stay. 

First impressions of the hotel & staff were positive and we were not at anytime disappointed during our stay.  All reception staff went out of their way to be of assistance. 

Having read earlier reviews we selected a 'Club Room', which was a great choice as it came with a large mezzanine sitting space with a sofa, tub chair, second TV and small kitchenette.  The sleeping space on the lower level was tight, but this was well compensated for by the additional sitting area. 

Our room was at the front of the hotel and there was some traffic noise, but it in no way disturbed us.  In fact we liked the added advantage of being able to open the large windows.

As with such hotels the bathroom was tight but functional, with more personal products than you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The rooms and bathroom were well maintained and spotless. 

We would definitely stay at the Park Grand London Hyde Park again.",4,2015,03,11
104,"Three stars, not four.","Let me start by saying this hotel was adequate for my needs, which were simply a clean, affordable place to sleep for the night as I was up in London on my own to see a play. The location is great for everything a tourist would want to see and do, being just a four minute walk from Paddington Underground on both the Circle and Bakerloo lines. I made the booking through a discount website and got a fair deal. But for the benefit of visitors who may have a different set of requirements, the nit picks are: the bed did not afford a good night's sleep as the mattress needed turning or renewing completely, the pillows were so hard that my noggin barely made a dent, the walls are thin and I was privy to my neighbour's every utterance, pre-dawn expectoration and bowel movement, plus the ill-fitting window did not close properly. Any foreign visitor not au fait with London accommodation, which is notoriously Lilliputian, could be taken aback by the 'cosy' feel to the room, although it has all the basics you would need (bar a shower cap). The bathroom was a cubicle and you may, as I did, find yourself bruising your elbows on everything. I know this is turning into a major whinge, but I have to say that the underfloor heating was like stepping onto a scorching pavement in summer. I did not test the wifi or eat at the hotel, so can't comment on those things. In summary, I reckon you could book a private room in a hostel for less and have much the same experience. Not four star, but for the price I paid, I couldn't reasonably expect it.",3,2015,03,10
104,Very enjoyable stay,"This is second time we have stayed here, was very happy again,turned up early as wanted to make most of our time in London,asked if ok to leave car outside and staff said we could hsve our room which was great as only 9am,the staff over all great friendly and helpful, room clean and comfortable,breakfast best I've had in any hotel I've stayed in,will return again ",4,2015,03,09
104,"Far away from home, and still homely!!","It is my first ever long stay (5 days) in London than my usual touch and go business visits and I was looking at a place that's convenient, comfortable, clean, economical, good food and most importantly, people/staff managing the stay of their guests.... I must say that Park Grand London Hyde Park is a perfect blend of all you are looking for when you are visiting/holidaying in London. Situated strategically, it's few minutes by walk from Paddington station, lot of eateries around, pick-up point for Big Bus (hop-on hop-off), walk around the Hyde Park, and many more. The hotel staff are very welcoming and took good care during my stay, especially Sakar and Alexandra.",4,2015,03,09
104,Fabulous!!!,"The location, room, breakfast, staff, cleanliness.........I could not fault this hotel. We stayed last night and what a cheeky little find this was. From the minute we arrived we were impressed. Thank you so very much for a lovely stay.",5,2015,03,07
104,Perfect stay at small unique hotel,In London on business for 2 days and hotel was perfectly located next to Paddington station for me. Got upgrade from Club room to mini bi-level suite even on my first stay. Excellent service and extremely pleasant staff. Will definetly use again.,5,2015,03,05
104,Read this before booking,"So normally I don't write reviews and probably I was just unlucky given the reviews online. 
To start with the positive things: the staff is overall friendly.

Negative:
Room heating did not work and I got sick. I was upgraded to a double room but it stank of perfume and was very noisy so at 1 am I swapped back to the cold single room.
The mattress was terrible, the water of the shower was lukewarm...
I would have expected more from this hotel. Not worth the money...",1,2015,03,05
104,DON'T TELL TOO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT THIS LITTLE GEM,"Apart from being V handy for Paddington , This is truly a V nice place indeed !
Staff so friendly
4**** throughout
Lovely rooms and quality fittings
Nothing too much trouble :  Jamal always ready to assist 
Sensibly priced too",5,2015,03,04
104,Brilliant all rounder,"Stayed last night, we arrived 3hrs early and hour room was ready! Very pleasant staff! Tube station is about 5 min walk as is Hyde park.Parked the car ¬£20 a night,  they allowed us to leave the car after we had checked out for few hours while we went out so a nice gesture with no extra charge.Room was perfect it was clean, nice soft big bed, tv, lots of freebies really good stay. Breakfast was tasty and you could tell it was all fresh. Very pleased! Will return for sure! All round good value! The corrridors and lift were quite narrow so with lots of baggage would difficult but thankfully we travelled light ",5,2015,03,04
104,Great Hotel Great Price,"I work in London on a regular basis and always struggle to find decent hotels, well not any more!
This was   not a business trip so we upgraded to a club room which was fantastic.
Spotlessly clean and spacious.
the only small niggles are the bathroom is quite small and the fridge wasn't working but to be fair we didn't ask for it to be fixed.
I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.
PS good breakfast choice as well. and only 5 mins from Paddington or Lancaster Gate tube stations.",5,2015,03,02
104,Birthday surprise,"My husband booked this hotel as a birthday surprise. Very friendly and helpful,staff and the location was perfect as we just left the car parked (¬£20 per day) and walked everywhere. We covered miles. Just down the road from Hyde Park and Oxford Street and very close to a good choice of restaurants. The room was ok. We had a 2 story one. Lounge and kitchen area basically furnished. Upstairs to the bedroom. The bathroom which was downstairs and inconvenient for the nightly toilet trips (stairs were narrow and went round a corner and noisy) was well equipped but grouting was soiled in a lot of places. I didn't sleep well at all the first night due to an unpleasant smell which I found to be in the morning two air freshener plug ins. They were so strong and sickly so I unplugged them. Breakfast was adequate. I don't eat cooked so it was just packet cereal and toast for me. Not much else on offer except tiny bit of fruit croissants and cheese. My husband had the cooked and said it was very nice.  
All in all a nice ok. Location is key.",4,2015,03,01
104,"Reasonable standard, friendly staff and good location","I really appreciated the friendly staff in the lobby and reception. They were very welcoming and helpful.
The location from coming to a from Heathrow with the Paddington Express is excellent.
The room was looking a little tired in places, stains on carpet, door of wardrobe wouldn't shut properly. Nothing major but could do with a face lift to really say it is 4 star.
Breakfast was ok, but nothing stunning.
I have stayed at their sister hotel Park Grand Paddington and it is just a notch or two better (breakfast and room quality) for similar price and location ie 150 meters away.",3,2015,03,01
104,Good short stay,"I read about this hotel and watched the reviews on the hotels.tv review on YouTube. The hotel was a good stay, good location to Paddington station, and a really comfy bed. The only negatives were the breakfast and the small bathroom. 

The positives as follows: great staff, comfy bed, free wifi, and overall nice place to be. 

This is a great place to stay if planning on a short stay. 

I would recommend this hotel again.",4,2015,02,27
104,Friendly and helpful front desk staffs,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel. Staffs are all friendly and helpful especially the front desk. The room was cleaned and good size as compared to those in Paris, shower pressure and temperature setting were excellent. Weather was cold but room aircon was working well to maintain at set temperature. We like the daily replenishment of coffee(with decaf) and tea bag with some cookies. Only 2 problems we encountered. First - we are given the highest level 7 which need additional flight of stairs after lift reach max 6th floor. This is extremely inconvenient especially with heavy shopping bags and tired feet. Second - there wasn't any bus plying that street and its took about 15min by walk, crossing max 3 traffic lights depending on your route, from Paddington Station. Selected this hotel due to Heathrow Express. Very cosy hotel in a quiet district and very friendly and helpful staffs.
Will come again and request for lift landing room.",4,2015,02,27
104,At last found a good  one.,"We attend  an awards ceremony every February in central London.  We have been in a different hotel event year. But next year we will be back. We had 9 rooms altogether and 2 more in the party that booked direct.  Very helpful staff at check in.  Good experience in the bar. Some rooms were smaller but we had a fair sized room with 2 very comfortable double beds. Nice hot powerful shower and good shower gel etc. There was a good  mirror and dressing table  with a socket to plug in the hair dryer.  Good  Breakfast buffet with a wide choice and selection of tea's. 
Good hotel.",5,2015,02,26
104,Great stay,"Stayed here for 1 night with my parents and 7 year old son and had a great time.  Friendly, warm welcome which continued throughout our stay.  Room clean and fully equipped.

104,Friendly and relaxed.,"We have just spent a wonderful, long weekend in room 306, helped along in no small part by the fantastic staff. Lucien behind the bar, Anthony Loredana and their colleagues taking care if the breakfasts, the wonderful housekeeping staff, and all the welcoming reception staff. Thank you all for making a good stay great. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, which is just around the corner from Paddington tube and rail stations,  making it highly accessable for both business and leisure travellers. üòäüòä",5,2015,02,23
104,excellent hotel,"Very friendly polite staff willing to help and accommodate guest.  Sanya the receptionist she met us friendly welcome warm meeting. The hotel itself is excellent location to the central London and Edgware Road. Few minutes from Paddington station, The room is very clean today, the only problem the from is bit tight but if you use the twin room will be a lot better than double one. The breakfast is excellent and lots of varieties. definite will go back",5,2015,02,21
104,Excellent Paddington location,"Usually stay for work, but brought the family for a days and a great location to go on and explore London. A short walk to musuems and Hyde Park was ideal and close to Undergroung to explore further afield if required.",4,2015,02,20
104,"Brilliant,","Hi,

My girlfriend and I stayed from the 6th to the 9th of February in room 809 for a weekend away and I have nothing but praise for the way the hotel is run and the friendliness of the staff. The hotel rooms are smaller than some ( Queen sized bed was a plus ) in London but we found it completely adequate for our needs, I cant comment on the restaurant as we stayed room only but I couldnt see any issues and the food smelled lovely. I am also in the hotel trade working for Guoman Thistle and checked the standards from check in-room stay-check out, to see if the hotel met the standard of 4* hotel as described, i have absolutely no hesitation in recomending this hotel. its just 5 mins from Lancaster gate tube station, 10 mins walk from Marble Arch and Oxford St and 2 mins from Hyde Park which is lovely for evening walks. 

when i next visit London, I will most definately re-book with you. well done !!!

kind regards

104,No help for error for Bride to be!!,"I booked to stay in this hotel, for a few friends and myself to celebrate my forthcoming wedding.I booked through the website, changed to the dates I required and paid for a room,during the process the dates had defulted back to the date of that night I booked it. So I had now paid for a room at 10:13pm on 29th January to stay that night. I imediately emailed customer servies and Reservations about the error which had occured.As I didnt hear back from them, the next morning I got straight on the phone to explain what had happened, to be told 'well this has never happened before' and basically there is nothing that can be done. So I am currently ¬£96.00 out of pocket with a hotel that is not willing to help me. I then got back on the phone yes I was upset and a little fustrated with the situation, by the end of this call I was offered a 15 % refund which I felt wasn't good enough. I asked for my booking to be changed to the weekend I wanted and I would pay the difference, they wanted an extra ¬£136.00 which seemed alot when if I had booked for the date I wanted originally it would have only cost ¬£102 so not sure where they got their ¬£136.00 from. I e-mailed the manager on Tuesday 29th January and funny enough I am still waiting for a response!",1,2015,02,19
104,Fantastic service and fantastic stay,"My partner and I stayed at this lovely hotel over the Valentines Day weekend 2015. It is situated just 5 minutes (walk) from Paddington Station in a quiet and pleasant area. 

As a starting point, I doubt that I could have found a better room in London for the amount I paid. Especially on Valentines Day. 

We were placed on the 'Basement' floor, in room 001- the room next to the communal kitchen/eating area! Upon arrival, I did express some concern with regard to the noise levels coming from this kitchen as it was particularly loud upon arrival. The staff understandably could not move us to another room but ensured us that they would provide a complimentary upgrade the following day- I was pleasantly surprised.

In any event, the room was splendid with all amenities up to scratch- wide screen tv (with digital), very comfortable double bed, bathroom facilities were all in working order. The main positive was that every aspect of the room was tidy and attended to. 

The next day, and at a reasonable time, reception duly called and asked if we were still considering moving rooms. My partner and I agreed that it was not worth moving as this noise had not persisted. I explained this to the receptionist and she insisted that we still receive some 'club room' facilities to compensate for this noise. We headed to Hyde Park and Oxford Street that afternoon for some fresh air (only 15 minutes walk! ). Upon our return, the cleaners had duly left some upgraded amenities (additional to the standard)- some fruit, two cans of soft drink,  a small bottle of wine, extra bottled toiletries, dressing gowns and slippers. A great touch. 

The rest of the weekend was faultless and was well worth the amount we had paid.

To conclude, the hotel was excellent- an edgy start but full credit to the staff for turning it around and making it a fantastic weekend.",4,2015,02,18
104,Pleasant comfortable stay,"We stayed here for one night and checking in was nice and smooth and the staff were very polite. There is minimal parking outside the front of the hotel but there is a NCP car park at Paddington Station about 300 yards away and costs ¬£10 per day at weekends.
The room was on the 5th floor and had two double beds within and apepared to be recently refurbished. The bathroom was on the small size with a corner shower toilet and sink. There was plenty of complimenatry gels shampoos etc and ample tea and coffee provided along with 4 packets of biscuits. There was a fridge in the room and a reasonably sized LG Tv on the wall.  
The beds were comfortable and the pillows were soft and my head melted into them. The bath towels were a little on the small side but there was plenty of towels provided. The shower didnt have a very strong jet but the water was nice and hot.
As we had a quick turnaround after arriving we asked the hotel to provide us with a taxi which cost us ¬£19 so that was a bit expensive but at least it gort us to where we needed to be on time.
Breakfast was a choice of cold and hot food which was self service. Tea and or coffee was brought to your table. All the staff were very pleasant and checking out was easy to.
Would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,02,16
104,Excellent Hotel,"Location is 5 minute walk to Paddington but in a quiet area. Reception and staff efficient, warm and helpful. My room was neat, clean and of adequate size with a spotless bathroom and a more than adequate buffet breakfast. Absolutely first class and full marks to the manager and staff.",5,2015,02,16
104,Great for the money,"All reviews have to be based upon the money paid so on that basis this has to be a five star review.  I doubt I could have got a better room in London for the money on the night I stayed.  I paid for a single but they gave me an upgrade into a big triple room (must have been a quiet night).  The room was clean and well equipped, the bathroom white, spotless with plenty of fluffy white towels and nice bottled toiletries.  There was a veritable pile of coffee sticks, tea, biscuits and little extras which I thought was really generous.  Now we come to the most important thing of all - the bed. I slept on the double which was deep, comfortable and medium/firm.  Much better than many of the mattresses I have slept in hotels costing three times the price.  The pillows again were substantial and comfortable.  The room was quiet with no discernable traffic, fans or generators in earshot.  The girls on the desk were friendly, helpful and charming.  I must say that Westbourne Terrace is not the nicest of London locations (its a big wide road with huge terraced houses on either side with gardens converted into carparks in front) and there are quite a few lower budget establishments along there.  The Grand though stands out as the best place on the terrace its on and looks nice from outside, the reception area too is fine.  You are five minutes walk from Paddington station and a bit more from Lancaster Gate.  There are a few quite buzzy streets not far away (Craven Street seems to have become fashionable) and plenty of restaurants; particularly Italian.",5,2015,02,15
104,Not bad for a work hotel,"I stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park on Tuesday night as I was attending a training event in London. I travelled on the train from Swansea to Paddington and found the hotel close enough to walk. The hotel doesn't look that impressive from the outside and can be easily confused with a residential property as it sits behind some tall trees off the main road. The receptionist was friendly and efficient and checked me in quickly. My room was 206 on the second floor which overlooked the rear of the hotel which was faced by some resedential flats. This was not a problem as I did not have any expectations and I arrived around 7pm and it was already dark. The room was clean and spacious with exception to the bathroom which was clean but very small. I have to say that the shower redeemed the size issue as it was very powerful. I ate out at a local pub called The Mitre so didn't experience the food.
All in all I would stay again for work but would look for something else if u was on a city break.",3,2015,02,15
104,A Good Overnight Stay,"A nice clean hotel with very pleasent and helpful staff the rooms have recently been refurbished to a nice standard. The taxi company they use are very expensive ¬£16 to Park Lane, it only cost me ¬£8 return in a black cab! Stayed for one night and I would use it again.",4,2015,02,15
104,Nice hotel,"Clean, comfortable rooms. Friendly staff on reception. Staff in restaurant at breakfast not great. More concerned with doing anything other than greeting and helping customers. A pleasant stay probably wouldn't add breakfast next time. ",4,2015,02,15
104,Good price for a London Hotel,"In Paddington, so on the edge of central London, but a great price all the same.  Clean rooms, small, but well fitted.  Comfortable bed.  Very pleasant staff.  I have stayed here 3 or 4 times now and it is always exactly the same, for a business traveller in for a day it is ideal.  5 minutes walk from Paddington station",4,2015,02,12
104,Great value for money,"This hotel is great value for money in central London. I paid around ¬£60 for one night in a single room. It was clean and although the room was very small, it did the job for the night. A big bonus is that its so close to Paddington station.

My only criticisms were that the mattress was really soft and could have done with being replaced, it was quite uncomfortable to sleep on and I was surprised my spine wasn't mashed up by the morning. Also the pipes made some really weird noises throughout the night.

These things aside, it's great quality for money and with its location makes it a bit of a winner.",4,2015,02,11
104,"Convenient location, but very small room","Stayed for a night in the single room. The location is good, you can walk about 7-10 minutes from Paddington train station. Was walking with luggage and it was not a problem. The staff are all nice and friendly and helped to carry my luggage to the second floor up the stairs as there wasn't a lift for my room. The room is extremely small! I had a big luggage and after opening it, had very narrow space to walk from the bed to the bathroom. There is just a very narrow walkway between the desk and the bed which is a single bed (too soft for my comfort). Had problems with the room heater and it was either too hot or too cold for comfort. The window in the room did not have a lock (or I couldn't find it) so was a little worried about safety when I slept since I was on second floor. Overall pleasant stay.",3,2015,02,11
104,Hen Party!,I booked a room at Park Grand for my sisters hen party last Saturday!! We were very pleased with the service the staff provided and the room we stayed in! I will definitely be returning and highly recommend this to anyone reading my review. Many thanks again!!,5,2015,02,09
104,Ideal,"The location of this hotel means that I can walk directly from Paddington train station without the need for quite a long walk, in the wrong direction, to the new location of the taxi rank. I have not used this particular Shaftesbury Hotel before but consider this luxury double room (single occupancy) to be really comfortable, spacious and very good value indeed. My room at the back was quiet. Breakfast, as in all the Shaftesbury hotels, is excellent, and the staff are competent and friendly.",5,2015,02,09
104,Brilliant stay,"Stayed for a birthday getaway in london with my sister. We were greeted by very friendly polite staff and our room was on the ground floor..on the small side but very comfortable, bed extremely comfortable and bathroom modern, bright and clean with a powerful shower. Breakfast was downstairs and was nice but we would have liked hash browns! One thing that stood out was the helpfulness of the staff.. They were happy to provide anything we asked for and were v attentive (eg when asking for a champagne bucket, glasses & ice it was delivered to our room almost immediately).. It was also nice to have a member of staff on the door at weekends, very welcoming. Location wise the hotel is well placed in paddington a few minutes walk from the tube station which we used daily. I am please we decided on this hotel and ",4,2015,02,08
104,Great location. Small room,"I booked myself a holiday for my family for 4 nights.
Check in was very efficient. Staff is very friendly
My room came equipped with a coffee and tea facilities and biscuits every day. I have to mention also that there is a free Wi-Fi.
Breakfast was in the basement and was really good. It was included in the price, since I booked this hotel via its website.
The hotel is small but in great location. It's 2/3-minute walk from Paddington station (Heathrow Express!) and also close to the Paddington tube station, and the Lancaster Gate tube station.
My only qualm is about the size of the room. I booked (and paid) a triple room, however the size of the room wasn‚Äôt appropriate. It was just a double room with a sofa bed. That means that we only had two narrow corridors to walk.
However, due to the good location and the reasonably price, I have to recommend this hotel to anyone and certainly stay again (with a room upgrade!)",4,2015,02,08
104,Jersey boys weekend,"Lovely hotel, tree lined road with fantastic rooms and great breakfast. Stayed in a club room that had two floors really luxurious. Parking out the front ¬£20 for 24 hours. Great place to stay. I would recommend this to my friends",5,2015,02,08
104,amazing stay:),Stayed in this hotel. Check in was very efficient. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Checked in early was not expecting to have room early but staff arranged one for me n upgraded.. Room I stayed was very nice n comfortable. Good price and worth staying will definitely visit again. Close to Paddington n Hyde park. Will recommend all my family n friends..,5,2015,02,07
104,Business Stay in London,"Great location, round the corner from Paddington train and underground so perfect for commuting.

Hotel was very welcoming, upgraded on arrival to a large room on the top floor so nice and quiet.

Breakfast was in the basement and was up to standard and all round a good nights stay at a reasonable price.",4,2015,02,06
104,Hitel for work in Paddington,"Very nice little hotel, most staff very good. Staff responded when I requested an evening service as I had been in bed after work all day. Pay extra for a double room as singles are very small. Could be more detailed in cleaning shower edges a bit of a dirty build up. Will return as good location for Paddington",4,2015,02,04
104,Great stay at grand park,"This was our second stay at this Hotel (we never give a review on only one stay) if anything this was an even better experience than the first. It is only an easy ten minute walk from Paddington Station and easy to locate, it is also only a five minute walk to Hyde Park. Our Receptionist was very efficient and more importantly friendly. We were visiting with friends, both our rooms were very well appointed and spotlessly clean. After a hard day in the City we had an excellent nights sleep on a very comfortable beds. The breakfast was very good in a very pleasant dinning room, there were a lot of food options. The Manager on duty, Patrica was very approachable and a pleasure to talk to. We will certainly use this Hotel for all our future visits to  London.",5,2015,02,02
104,Great hotel,"Very nice hotell very clean and very good service. The only downside was that breakfast was not included. Near paddington tube station, so it was easy to get around London from the hotel. Also the hotell was easy to find for someone who where wisiting London for the first time.",4,2015,02,02
104,Return visit just as good,We stayed here last year on a theatre weekend with friends and were very impressed.  We have just returned with the same friends and again we were all very pleased with the hotel.  No dropping of standards.  The staff were all still genuinely friendly and very helpful. The rooms were lovely and clean and the breakfast excellent. Being only a 5 minute walk from Paddington it is a great base for getting about (recommend you get Oyster cards). It is only a 10 minute stroll to Hyde Park which is great to blow off the cobwebs on a Sunday morning. Well done Patricia and your team.  We shall be returning.,5,2015,02,02
104,"Great location, great price and great staff","We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in January after weighing Tripadvisor reviews.  The location was perfect for us, close to Paddington, the tube, restaurants and a couple of city tours stops.  We had a noise issue with our first room on the first floor but the staff were so wonderful and immediately moved us to another room in the back on the sixth floor.  Our room was very clean and large enough for the two of us considering we did not go to London to hang out in our hotel room.  We loved the view overlooking the rooftops. Breakfast was all you can eat, fresh, hot and tasty.  Price was reasonable, less than we expected to pay for a room in London. We were expecting a good stay but it turned out to be much better than that. We have no complaints, would stay there again and would recommend.  My husband and I would like to note that the staff, from front desk to restaurant employees to the porters, were super friendly, helpful and accommodating.",4,2015,02,01
104,Great hotel and excellent location,"We stayed at the Hotel last year and chose it again, as when looking elsewhere no other Hotel met our criteria.  It is a small hotel and ideally located, 5 minute walk to the tube and Paddington Station.    The staff again were very pleasant and helpful and our room comfortable and clean. We now would not stay anywhere else.",5,2015,02,01
104,"Great hotel, great people","I found this hotel by default ! I'd booked into a sister hotel : 'the shaftsbury premier hotel' (just opposite) and was told I was being transferred to the Park Grand - and not provided with any reason as to why ?! But I was definitely very happy that it happened - the room was super (club double) bags of space, facilities and goodies. It was also beautifully warm. The breakfast was extremely good -like it had been cooked at home vs in an hotel. The hotel is small but very smart and very central And unlike its sister hotel, it looks very new and very clean. I found all the people working there - extremely friendly and accommodating without exception. Reception staff, staff in the restaurant and porterage staff were all amazing. A must to try. And, just 5 mins from Paddington mainline and tube. I'll be back.",5,2015,01,30
104,Great stay,"We wanted to be near Paddington train station for an early train the morning after. Great location very close to the station. Staff were very accommodating and were able to check us in a bit earlier. 
Room was very clean and comfortable and breakfast was good. Normally difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in London but this was just that. Would recommend to others and certainly stay again.",4,2015,01,28
104,Totally reasonable London hotel,"We wanted to be near paddington station for easy access to the city and the airport. This hotel did exactly that for us. Clean, big enough for the two of us, and 5 minutes from paddington. Our room was a bit noisy... but we backed on the elevator, not sure if it was only that room. We'd stay there again.",4,2015,01,26
104,Great,"Usually it's hard to find a reasonably priced London hotel that's good, and I believe I have found it. 

Single room size good, cleanliness good.  Comfy bed.  Breakfast was great.  Will definitely be returning.",5,2015,01,26
104,Brilliant stay,"Only stayed for one night but had a great experience, great room, really pleasant staff & lovely breakfast. Really close to Paddington train station/underground great to travel around London. Fantastic.",5,2015,01,25
104,"Tiny rooms, but well appointed.","We stayed for two nights mid Jan for ¬£140 room only. 

The hotel is within 5 min walk to Paddington train/underground station, and the same to Hyde Park

It is a modern style inside with wood lined walls and minimalistic furniture. 

Be aware the majority of rooms are very small. We were staying for our anniversary and requested a spacious room. We didn't get one. Room 508 (on 3rd floor?) had a street view but it was bearly two feet wider than the double bed. 

If space is a must for you, an upgrade is advised. See the attached floor plan for a guide. I'd suggest rooms in the 20's bracket, presuming all floors are the same layout. 

Two 175ml red wines = ¬£7.70. 

Overall: a nice, clean , friendly hotel that can be got at a half decent price. Rooms are small, but well appointed with excellent fixtures & fittings.",4,2015,01,25
104,Great location - Decent hotel,"Stayed at many hotels in this location - happy to go back to this one. Nice and helpful staff, simple interior but clean. Decent breakfast. Reasonably priced. My room was very hot - after I asked at the reception if they could fix it they have went to check what might be the problem. Seemed it was just location of the room close to some pipes or so - they have changed the room without me asking for it.",4,2015,01,21
104,Stay at Park Grand,"easy to locate from Paddington tube station. check quick efficient and friendly, room, good size and double shower, complimentary water and fruit in room, no great view but that was fine for one night and also as it was at the back of the hotel (2nd floor) nice and quite, apart from the squeaky floorboards :-)

free wi fi is a great bonus.

nice choice of hot and cold breakfasts, might be an idea though to have cold tomato to go with the continental style breakfast,

easy walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants and cafes. would stay again",4,2015,01,20
104,Stolen I Pad,"On the whole the hotel was OK for the price and location, however on leaving I left my IPad in the room I phoned back within minuites to say i was on my way and apparently there was nothing there, on reflection as i had packed my bags prior to having Breakfast i now feel that the room was entered and IPad stolen whilest i was in Breakfast as i cannot think of any other explination as my bags after leaving were locked and in my hand so it catagorically must have been the hotel, reception were at fisrt not helpful or concerned in any way but then I found one member of staff who seemed genuinly concerned and he seemed to do here best. that was this morning i asked them to call the police but to no avail IPad has apparently vanished. from the room. I have had no back up calls or apology compensiation nothing.",1,2015,01,15
104,wonderful hotel and staff services!!!,"The hotel is well located and besides there is a very nice temperature control inside the rooms. The breakfast is nice with a l9t of alternatives with low cost. We stayed during almost a week and we wolud like to be much more, for the country and the nice staf.",5,2015,01,13
104,Wonderful room and great location,I stayed here with my boyfriend for a romantic trip. The room was amazing very large and had an upstairs living space as well. The whole room was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The breakfast was also lovely lots of choice and the staff were happy to Help with any queries etc. Location was also great a very short walk from the nearest station and easy access to many lovely restaurants. Would definitely recommend this hotel! ,5,2015,01,11
104,Its a good backup place to stay for business trips,"My experience is that the staff are all quite young, dont speak english all that well and are slow with check in. And they dont really offer you anything like a cup of tea of ask if you need anything when you check in.

But the rooms are fine and comfortable and the wifi works well. The location is close to paddington station which is great if you need to catch a flight the next morning to LHR. Also not too far from a number of restaurants and close to Lancaster gate to catch the central line.

For a business trip or family stay, I feel its better for business as the staff are not really that attentive and having a family myself I know how at times you just needs things which I think the hotel will struggle with in terms of experience.",3,2015,01,11
104,"Saggy, moldy, tired rooms","I stayed at the Park Grand Hyde Park for one night in transit from Paris to Washington on January 3rd. Booked directly with Park Grand for ¬£78 including breakfast. Check-in was fast thanks to an unfriendly, disinterested host at reception. He gave me Room 402, ""a very nice room"" which turned out to be a poor description. 

Upon exiting the lift, I needed to climb up a short but twisted flight of stairs that made it difficult to get my large suitcase up to the room. As I entered the room, which was quite large by London standards, I was immediately struck by a musty smell. I would later learn that the bathroom, while quite large with a roomy shower, had little if any ventilation. 

The bed - which was not a double/queen but rather two twins pushed together - was saggy and uncomfortable. Carpeting in the room was tattered; furnishings were cheap. Nice set-up for tea/coffee with biscuits, which was a pleasant touch. While the room seemed clean, it's tattered condition made it feel a little gritty. Wifi was good and free.

The bathroom floor had many cracked tiles, some with sharp edges. Water pressure was great, but the temperature of the water would sometimes change, keeping me on my toes! There was an unacceptable amount of the mold in the shower - it was just disgusting and suggested that the cleaning staff were not regularly disinfecting/cleaning the tiles/walls of the shower. 

In the morning, I decided to skip breakfast - I just wanted to get out of this room. The woman at reception was lovely at check-out and wished me a pleasant journey. Was a short walk to Paddington Station, where I grabbed the Heathrow Express to be on my way back to the States. I would not stay at this property again, despite this convenient location - it is in serious need of a facelift and scrubbing.",2,2015,01,08
104,Great stay ,"We did like the hotel stay very much .. Nice people, kind employees.. Cooperative team .. Nice breakfast.. Calm and cool .. Very warm room during very cold weather ... We did like the stay very much... Paddington station is not far from the hotel so it is very good location in London. ",5,2015,01,05
104,Great stay at park grand,"I stayed at park grand in the month of July. I had booked a club room for one night and I was checked in by a handsome gentleman at front desk. I was given room 120 on first floor. It was very neat , spacious and tidy. Breakfast was yummy. Hotel itself was near the paddington station , which is very convenient. All staff are very helpful and willing to help without any fuss. Overall I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2015,01,03
104,good stay,this hotel was clean and functional. The location was good and close enough to the Marble Arch area of the city.  Rooms were clean but nothing fancy but did the job and the price was not expensive so functional for the amount of time we were in them.  Great cafe for breakfast just around the corner. We had a room for four which was on two floors and while the actual beds upstairs it was a small sofa bed downstairs that was not so comfortable.,4,2014,12,29
104,"Good hotel, excellent service","I stayed in Park Grand during one of my visits to London. It was a good stay. The hotel staff provided very good service throughout my stay.I would like to thank Sakar, (who was managing) very professional and friendly. Highly recommend this place.",5,2014,12,25
104,Average Room,"Thanks to Park Grand Hotel Hyde Park for giving us the opportunity to upgrade our room from the deluxe to the club room. It made our experience staying at a Park Grand London Establishment hotel a more memorable one. 

The room is a change from what we received at Park Grand London Paddington, as we are guessing its an older establishment compared to the latter. But overall experience in room was good and we enjoyed ourself especially the availability of a multi-floored bedroom.

As a couple of recommendation points:
1) Feedback card could be placed within the bed room like what is done in Park Grand London Paddington to allow guest to feedback their experience
2) Bedroom could have been layout better to allow more space for walking
3) Upstair living room space area could have benefitted from a small coffee table
4) Air-condition could be better as we had to resort to opening the window to allow for air circulation, as the bedroom air conditioner wasn't working effectively.

OVERALL IT WAS a good trip :) Thanks again. Cant wait to try another hotel within the Park Grand London Establishment this weekend.....",3,2014,12,25
104,Nice place,"This is a typical London hotel.....functional, compact rooms, no frills and probably a little expensive. I was on a business trip and stayed there for a couple of nights.
location is very good. Just a 5 minutes walk from Paddington. 
Rooms were clean and well maintained though I did find a couple of broken tiles in the bathroom. The package included breakfast(standard  english breakfast).They also provided a fruit basket in the room. 
I did not get an opportunity to have any meal other than breakfast at the hotel and hence cannot comment on the bar or the food there.
The staff were very nice and helpful.",4,2014,12,24
104,Nice place.,Good hotel. Nice location near Central London. Good Break-fast provided in the morning. Free Wi-Fi available. Walkable distance to underground stations and over ground. Nice service. Value for the money.,5,2014,12,22
104,lu74,"Wanted a hotel which was convenient for theatres and shopping, a very reasonably priced hotel, room was well worth the money and breakfast was good quality. My daughter and I  enjoyed our stay and would definitely use again.",5,2014,12,21
104,Really good hotel near Hyde park,"Selected this hotel near Lancaster Gate as it has parking (not cheap, but very convenient). The staff were some of the most friendly we have encountered. The room was very clean, had very comfortable beds, and a good well appointed bathroom. Breakfast was very comprehensive and tasty. Easy walking distance of Paddington, Lancaster Gate tube stations and Hyde Park. I'm sure we will return to this hotel again.",4,2014,12,21
104,Hope to return,"I stayed for a weekend in December and I was lucky to have found such a good hotel near a train/underground station. The staff service went above and beyond a 4 star hotel I believe. They were courteous, fast, and was surprised at the helpfulness they provided. I booked a deluxe room for three nights at a very fair price considering the location and period. The room and bathroom were a bit cramped (The only downside), but for one person it's doable. Paddington station is just up the street for a three minute walk, while there is also Lancaster Gate that is about six minutes but it's easier to use I think. The breakfast buffet had a good variety to choose from, and the serving staff was not only exceptional but good to have a laugh with. This was my first time in London, but I hope that I will return many more times to this beautiful city and fantastic hotel!",5,2014,12,19
104,Walking distance to Paddington Station,"We selected this hotel due to location and room variety. Traveling as a couple with one college age child.  Were able to have a room for 3, double twin/king and single twin bed. Room is clean & functional. Small and with 3 people & luggage,  was tight. Bathroom was very small- anyone who is oversized will not be able to use the bathroom (not kidding). My husband is 6'4"" and he barely was able to move around. Breakfast was good and hot. Had choice of cold or hot English breakfast buffet. Walking distance to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express or tube.",3,2014,12,18
104,Good hotel in a very good location.,"After several failed attempts to find a decent hotel with reasonable rates near Paddington I thought I would give this hotel a go.
Check in was friendly,fast and very efficient. Well done to the young lady on the front desk.
My Room was on the ground floor. Enough space for a single traveller, huge TV, lots of tea and coffee stuff and it was spotlessly clean.
 My only problem with my stay is the bathroom. To say it was small is a understatement. It wasn't a problem to me but I can see other people complaining about it.
Overall,this is a very good hotel. Friendly staff,clean and reasonably good rates.

104,Excellent,"Stayed every month I am in London since April, really pleased with everything about this hotel.
Have stayed in other hotels in and around London centre & non compare to the Hyde park
Which is handy for any part of London given that there are three stations within a 5 minute walk",5,2014,12,16
104,Great location,"The best about this hotel is the location, 3 min from Paddington station, easy access to central London. Nice clean rooms, newly refurbished bathrooms, adorable staff.
Only downside if you want to call it is the size of the single room, really small but enough for what it is. Definitely recommend it",4,2014,12,16
104,Reasonable London value,"I stayed for a week at this property in early December. My room was quite small but clearn and comfortable, although it tended to be quite warm--I had to leave the window open at all times. The breakfast was acceptable. I would suggest offering something different from time to time instead of exactly the same buffet offerings each day. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The wifi was quite slow. It is in a good location no more than 10 minutes walk from Paddington Station and two tube stops.

All in all, the Park is a reasonably good value in a city where hotels are very expensive.",3,2014,12,15
104,Broom Cupboard Bathroom!!,"Whilst the staff are friendly and helpful, the room we stayed in for a family of 4 came with 2 big beds, the bathroom was the size of a broom cupboard. The draft coming from around the metal framed window left a lot to be desired. A slim fitting single wardrobe was not really big enough for 4 people even for a one night stay!! breakfast wasn't to bad. So did find it a little expensive for what we had......",3,2014,12,14
104,"Great location, rooms comfortable and with parking what more do you need?","I have stayed at this hotel for business use, whilst the hotel is ideally situated and has all the amenities you could want the only down side is food.  The breakfast is ok but when I ordered room service it was not as described on the menu, a Ham and Cheese Panini turned up as a Plain cheese and ham toastie and the portion of French fries a few crisps.  Apart from the food the hotel has everything you need.",4,2014,12,13
104,Space is precious,"Located in a line of historic buildings built in the early 1900‚Äôs, this hotel lies spot-on in the city center, very close to Paddington train station, yet pleasantly quiet. 

You need to be comfortable with climbing steep narrow staircases to fully appreciate this hotel. The aisles leading to the rooms are wide enough for a single person to pass through, if the luggage is small. The additional swing-doors and steps up or down even within the same floor are a bit surprising and may be an obstacle for people with disabilities.
A single elevator with a capacity of 5 persons serves the six floors of the hotel and is a natural bottleneck in the flow of traffic. Waiting times can be painfully long.
 
In a city in which space is a premium you really shouldn‚Äôt be surprised about the size of the rooms. But admit I was, seeing what the hotel had managed to squeeze into the tiny floorspace of the approx 1x1m sized bathroom. The door can be opened or closed when standing in the shower.
You need not worry about opening the windows over night. The un-isolated single-pane glass and the cracks around the fitting ensure that the room has fresh air and is well-chilled at all times.
Free internet is available in the rooms, although signal was found weak and the network speed very slow ‚Äì but maybe I was just unlucky.
Breakfast is served in the basement, around a few corners and again down some narrow stairs behind the lobby, not very easy to find. Lighting is better in the small glass-roofed veranda, from where you can see a small piece of sky, just past the rainwater drains and other installations in the otherwise less-scenic ventilation shaft behind the building.
The breakfast buffet is English-style, also with a small selection of non-ham-and-egg-related cooked vegetables. I cannot comment on the bread, it was all gone.

For the price of well above 100 GBP you can find a very decent hotel anywhere else in Europe, but London is known to be expensive. The hotel is quite acceptable for a one-night stay. Despite its bold name, for a longer stay I could imagine searching for something offering a bit more convenience.",2,2014,12,10
104,Avoid this hotel - the worst night I've spent in a hotel in years,"The hotel looks nice - and when you arrive you are treated pleasantly, but it went downhill from there. The rooms on the street side are very noisy; there is no double-glaziing and the street is a busy one. The beds are terribly soft and I went to sleep and woke up 4 hours later with a large number of bites that I had an allergic reaction to; when I showed some of them to the attendant downstairs he asked if it could be allergies and suggested I sleep on the other side of the bed! I did finally get given another bed to sleep the rest of the night in though I was woken up twice by some sort of loud alarm. 

The bites were so bad that I had to see the doctor about them and go on a course of medication for several days. At no point did I receive an apology.

The breakfast on offer is a full English breakfast as far as hot food goes; if you want anything else it is cold cuts, cereal and the like.",1,2014,12,10
104,Nice stay,"I stayed here for 4 nights last week. If you view some of my reviews of other London hotels, they have generally been mediocre at best and among the worst in the world. That has typically been on a fairly tight budget, which is not a good thing to stay in a city like London.
I was able to increase my budget for this trip and glad that I did. This hotel was very well located (about a 5-6 minute walk from Paddington Station).
I had an issue in that I did not have luggage for almost 4 days (due to KLM's incompetence) and the staff were very helpful in trying to accommodate me, and I found them to be genuinely sympathetic to the overall trouble it was causing me.
The room is indeed small by North American standards, but by London standards it is fine and it was appointed in a modern way and was comfortable. The bathroom was also well maintained and was certainly not an issue whatsoever.
I would say I could sometimes hear the odd noise coming from outside the room, but this was muted and certainly not anything compared to what I have experienced in the past in other London hotels, and did not impact my sleep or comfort in any way.
Overall I would definitely look to stay here again for a future trip!",4,2014,12,08
104,Perfect for what we wanted!,"We stayed in the Park Grand on Saturday on a 36 hour trip to london. When we arrived we requested a quiet room at the back and this was what we got. The hotel is very central, close to the tube station and while the rooms are small, they are warm with comfortable beds and loads of hot water.  Given that all we did was sleep and have a shower, it fitted our purpose perfectly and I would stay there again!",4,2014,12,08
104,Satisfactory,"I stayed here for 5 nights back in May 2014.  It's a very convenient location within short walking distance of Paddington station.  The room is terribly small, but clean and quiet.  There wasn't an elevator for the section my sister and I stayed in so we had to bring both of our huge bags up a large flight of stairs which was somewhat exhausting after a walk from the station and a long flight.  Breakfast wasn't included in my stay, however, wifi was part of the package.  There are several ""ok"" restaurants nearby as an alternative.  I guess I would stay here again if I got a good deal.  Will probably look elsewhere next time though.",3,2014,12,08
104,A very good hotel,"Ive stayed there for 5 nights, the rooms are clean and excellent its a bit small but who needs a bigger room on london we just needed a place to sleep and its perfect. 
The breakfast is excellent it has everything , bacon , eggs so many kinds of cornflakes , cheese , ham and so many other things and the staff on the breakfast room are so nice and helping.
I thought it would be much nearer to the tube station but its oki about 4-5 min walking .
And finally, the staff, they are really helpful and nice , all of them , what ever i asked about they always helped, i cant remember all of their names but i can say Alexandra is really cute , she helped me a lot with the map and directions. 
I would diffinetly stay there again. ",5,2014,12,07
104,Smallest room ever,"I stayed just one night at this hotel. It is very convenient as it's located 5 min walking from Paddington station (so easy to connect to the railway or airport via Heathrow Express). It's also close to Hyde Park / Kensington gardens.
The room situated at first floor was very, very small...a small bed for one person (but not too tall)...however clean and cosy. The bathroom looked newly refurnished and they have floor heating which was perfect.
Although, they offer some bruits, buscuits and coffee to make, they don't offer a bottle of water. There are no slippers, nor bathrobe.
Breakfast was not included in the rate so we didn't take it. 
The hotel is very small and not well isolated, so I got disturbed by the cleaning service in the morning.",3,2014,12,04
104,A good experience,"After reading previous reviews I was expecting my single room to be extremely small. It wasn't that small, it was compact. Very clean and comfortable with an excellent shower. Being at the back of the hotel it was very quiet although some noise could be heard from the adjacent stairway.
 The staff were very cheerful, helpful and pleasant. The breakfast was good and plentiful. I would not hesitate in staying there again.",4,2014,12,03
104,Nice Hotel !!,"We had spend fews days in London in November, the Hotel is well located, near Hyde park, padington Station.
The personal is quite pleasant and efficient. The room was good but lacked some accessories like racks for servietes . there was a split window, but the general condition was good.",3,2014,12,02
104,Good stay,"I booked here for 5 nights and booked directly with hotel .

Rooms were small but very nice and comfortable .hotel is we'll located near to station and staff is very helpful.

Breakfast is not halal therefore did not eat so cannot comment 

Highly recommend ",5,2014,12,02
104,Very satisfied !,"We spent 4 nights with my family and we left very satisfied from this hotel. The room was comfortable (only the bathroom was small), the  service was excellent, the breakfast too. It was also very clean, with coffee and tea facilities+biscuits  filled daily. Also the bathroom amenities. 
We will be back again for sure. 
The location is excellent. 5 minutes walk to the Paddington tube station.",5,2014,12,01
104,hyde  park london,"we  paid  156 pounds  to  stay here we were  upgraded  on arrival we thought  this  was  great  but  when  we got  to  the  room  the  bathroom  facilities  were terrible   a sink  pushed  next  to a  shower  tray  which  was  not acceptable  when  stated to  front  desk  they  shrugged  it  off  you can't  go to  the  toilet  properly  without  opening  the door  and  4 star far from it
richard",3,2014,11,29
104,Always very good to be back!,"Being a salesman I'm on the roads 30-40% of my time and therefore there's a true importance to the hotels I'm staying at as a good comfortable hotel means a pleasant arrival after a flight and a good start on the following morning.

In that regard the Park Grand is simply amazing, the team is always warm, kind, smiling, welcoming and assisting even in the most crazy hours of the day. My room is always ready for me, even if I book my room on a very last minute notice. The front desk and the restaurant team know what I need even before I do... :) no wonder it's simply feels like home away from home.

Due to the great service, good facilities and perfect location my colleagues and I chose the Park Grand to be our corporate hotel in London.",5,2014,11,25
104,Not abything like a 4 start hotel,"I read the other reviews about this hotel with some surprise.  I travelled here as a single traveller and have to say that I was surprised.  Yes the service is truly excellent - the staff cannot do enough to help but a 4 start it most certainly is not and I am shocked that it is even described this way.  Perhaps if you don't travel as a single person it is a quite different experience?  My room was tiny - and I mean tiny.  So small that the air conditioning unit was mounted directly above the pillow area of the bed - not ideal. The only storage was a single wardrobe which had been shelved to take folded clothing and the safe - because there was no where else for them.  So, don't try hanging a dress or coat because there isn't enough hanging length.  And forget hanging them anywhere else, there are no hooks behind door or in bathroom and anyway the hangers are fixed in the wardrobe (in a 4 star hotel??).  No iron or ironing board as listed in room amenities but one brought very quickly.  However, there was no where to store it but I did have it for my full stay, propped against the mirror which is on the only free bit of wall nowhere near the dressing table..  Instead of a mirror at the small desk/dressing table, the TV is mounted there.  Poor lighting but opening window which was nice.  Room service menu was basically a couple of sandwiches.  Tiny bathroom but well stocked with toiletries etc.  So, in summary, good location, great staff but far from a 4 star and my criticism is based on the fact that they advertise as a four star.  I travel to London every week or so and this is not good value for a single traveller.",3,2014,11,25
104,Great Property in central London!,"I stayed at the hotel overnight while I was attending a meeting. The rooms are extremely spacious and clean and all the required facilities. The hotel staff is courteous and helpful and provide you good suggestions. Being in prime London, most of the areas are easily accessible. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to spend time in central London and get value for money.",4,2014,11,25
104,Such an enjoyable stay,"This hotel was a fantastic find. the room was excellent, immaculately clean and very quiet. We were on the 2nd floor. The breakfast looked limited but this was because the staff kept replenishing everything so much better than a huge buffet were the food has been out for hours.
But the thing that made this one of my most delightful hotel stays for years was the staff.....not just one person but each of them I have not experienced such exceptionally warm, helpful and welcoming service for years. Well done to each and every one we met and thank you.",5,2014,11,24
104,Correct price/value hotel,"Well situated, correct decoration, service was all right, rooms are very tiny but clean and nice, bathroom small but very well finished....the only bad thing that was very unconfortable were mattresses! Really too mushy! I have back ache! Please change them!",3,2014,11,24
104,Excellent Price/Value Combination,"I stayed here for a week long business trip, and very much enjoyed my stay.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of Paddington Station, many nice places to eat, and is in a nice neighborhood.

The rooms are clean, the bed very comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The air conditioner worked perfectly, and the WiFi did as well.  I couldn't have asked for a better hotel experience.

The price/value here is great - many hotels in this price range are terrible around Paddington Station.  This hotel is an outstanding place to stay, and the price is right.

Yes - if you're from the US, the rooms and bathroom are small.  That's just the way it is in this part of London.  However, because the room is so clean and comfortable the smallness was not an issue.",5,2014,11,23
104,I love my stay,"I came to London with my hubby and 2yrs baby. All of us really enjoy our stay in this hotel.  We arrived very early (around 8:00 am), but they let us check in and upgrade the room. We visited London couple of times before, and this was the best hotel we stayed. This is an old and beautiful building near the city centre, but inside is modern and newly renovated. The room was much bigger and cleaner than other hotel at the same price. All staff were friendly and helpful, answered all my questions about my visit. The breakfast was good as well. We will definitely stay in this hotel during our next visit in London and will recommend it to our friend!",5,2014,11,22
104,Nice,"Our stay were nice, but the room was really small, the conditionate air didn't work and the picture of the room in the marketing was bigger than the original room however the hotel was very close to the Paddington Station.",3,2014,11,22
104,Excellent,"Great location, very clean, friendly staff and great access to paddington area and subway. The restaurants we went to in the area were excellent. We wolves the area and accessibility. The hotel is nicely updated...the shuttle trip to the airport was easy to organize and we found the area was also clean and didn't feel scary. :)",5,2014,11,21
104,Fully enjoyed my stay and the fresh fruit,Lovely hotel in a beautiful area of London. I especially enjoyed the fresh fruit and being able to make tea in my room. Very helpful polite staff. About two blocks to Paddington station. Very reasonably priced for the value. ,5,2014,11,20
104,Great location and value for money in London,"I have usually stayed in Euston/Kings Cross when visiting London but took a slightly different approach this time and stayed in Paddington and I was not disappointed. 

Considering the price for a Friday and Saturday night, this was an excellent hotel. Like all of London, very small rooms, but the beds were comfortable, there was air con AND you could open a window, it was quiet, good shower and nice amenities.

Centrally located with only a short walk from Paddington station and near plenty of bars/restaurants etc. 

The lift is a bit old and slow and the reception area isn't very nice, but those things really aren't important.

The wifi is pretty slow so if you're like me and you're a business traveller it's not the best choice for that - but plenty of places nearby with free wifi you can use anyhow.

I will say that the price was very good as I booked through HotelClub.com - which I highly recommend - the hotel can't give you prices as cheap on-site.

Would definitely stay here again",5,2014,11,18
104,Tiny tiny rooms...,"I knew that London hotels had tiny rooms but had seemed to forget how tiny. Park Grand reminded me! 

First the pros: The hotel is centrally located and a short walk from Paddington station. This is quite useful if you are looking for central London connections. The staff were helpful. 

On the other hand.... The hotel itself was quite average at best. The rooms were extremely tiny and the bathrooms even more so. The walls were paper thin and I felt as though I shared my room with the neighbors. 

Overall I feel that there are better options in central London. Personally I will be giving this one a miss the next time around.",3,2014,11,17
104,Consistently a great place to stay whilst in London,"Since my last review, I have stayed in this hotel on several occassions for business trips.
The price (definately worth joining their reward scheme if in London frequently), quality, and service remains consistently good and having stayed in quite a few rooms, I can say that all are well above the average for this part of London. As an aside, the buffet breakfast remains on a par with several more expensive hotels in the area.
However, what makes me return is the staff and the service they provide. To a person, all are extremely personable, helpful, and professional, In particular Sakar at front of house, has a rare quality in London where he genuinely takes time to get to know you and will ensure your stay is as relaxing as possible.
Well done Sakar and team!",4,2014,11,17
104,Thank you Park Staff,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for her birthday, not only is the hotel so close to almost everything in London it also feels so luxurious! The room was great and even if we stayed on the ground floor we felt right at home having almost the entire floor to our selves. I surprised my girlfriend with champagne on the morning of her bday and the staff surprised us with complimentary breakfast and had taken the time to get her a Bday card! We thank you so much and all thumbs up on doing a great job! ",5,2014,11,16
104,Tiny rooms but good service,"Tiny rooms but this is London. Rooms are very clean and service is good. The front desk did everything they could to help me. I enjoyed. Very much this services. At 100GBP it was great value for London. I definitely recommend this small hotel and I will come again. 
My view is that a lot of people who left bad reviews do not know hotel prices in London. ",4,2014,11,13
104,My first trip to London,"Loved the location of this hotel!  Close to the train, tube as Paddington Station is around the corner.  The hotel is small but very charming and the staff are warm and accommodating to our needs.  Very close to Hyde Park and other attractions.  Staying here again on our last night before heading home to Canada.",4,2014,11,12
104,"Perfect stay, perfect staff","Great hotel, very cozy, the staff is on of the bests points of this hotel, the room was big, clean and with all the facilities: wardrove, cofee, tea, cookies..etc. When I come back to London I will choose this hotel again, no doubt.",4,2014,11,10
104,"Funky decent place, great staff, perfect location","Staff was awesome and very friendly. I arrived early, and was accommodated with a stay at the top floor - a real and rare godsend, having traveled on a red eye.
Room and furnishings were funky. Shower was tiny, and you could not sit at the desk since the bed was too close.
Nice assortment of tea and snack in the room, and very substantial breakfast.
Location is very convenient - just 3 blocks from Paddington, and yet still nice and quiet.
Really a perfect stay for a short business trip in the Hyde Park area.",4,2014,11,08
104,Good hotel.  Great location.,"Booked 7 rooms for colleagues and customers whilst attending a business event in Mayfair.

Excellent value for money for central London with less than 10 minutes by cab to our event.

The hotel is clean with very helpful staff and whilst the rooms are maintained to a high standard, one or two rooms within our booking were very much smaller than we would have expected.

Overall, however, very pleased with the hotel and I expect to be booking again in due course for next year's event.",4,2014,11,07
104,Lovely room and location,"Very easy to get to thanks to the tube system- the hotel is beautiful with high ceilings and modern interior decor. The staff were very friendly and willing to help, and the breakfast that we ate was very filling and tasty. My only issue was that our room was a ground floor double on the front of the property and that there was a very bright light( to light up the exterior) which shone straight into our room which seemed to defy the curtain and gave the room a early morning brightness constantly- however by the second day after all the walking that we had done and an early start the day before it was not really a problem. Also the wifi kept failing and the TV kept losing signal! 
Would stop here again but maybe not in the same room.",4,2014,11,03
104,"Good hotel, Friendly staff","It is one of the best hotels I have been to. The location is perfect and very close to Paddington station. All the markets are at a walking distance such as Oxford street, which is 20 mins away on foot. The staff is very helpful, understand customers requirements and deliver them up to the extend that they can.",5,2014,11,03
104,Good Location for Paddington Station,Book based on a cheap price and was shocked at the two level room we were given including a small kitchenette with lounge and an extremely large bed! Receptionist was welcoming on arrival and breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. Only downside was sink of kitchen had a slight smell which was a little off putting. Would definitely look to stay again. ,4,2014,11,02
104,Mr,"Really enjoyed my visit here and Sakar on the front desk was more then helpful and nothing was a problem. When I arrived my booked room was not quite ready, so Sakar upgraded me to a lovely room at no charge. They even let me leave my bags there for the day after checking out while looking around London. A + will stay there again in the future for sure.",5,2014,10,31
104,"Great location, clean, comfortable room & helpful staff","Great location, easy to get to and only a short walk to Paddington station. Convenient parking. Room very clean and beds comfortable. Ample tea, coffee and biscuits in room. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,10,30
104,Nice place,The hotel is very cute. the rooms are small and it is not very convenient. Breakfast is quite meager. The area is quiet.Nearby there are many cafes. Tesco store is located near.The room we had a double. strong muzzle of the windows.from the window the wind blows.,4,2014,10,29
104,Awesome Place to Stay in London,"Upon arrival in the late evening, my colleague and I were served by Sakar, the Front Desk Manager who checked us in quickly and efficiently. He and Jamal then helped move our luggage up to our room. The two single bed room we got was very nice, spacious, and clean and comes with Wi-Fi, tea/coffee making facilities, safe and TV.  The restaurant at the hotel basement serves a simple and hearty breakfast. The hotel is an easy 10-15 minutes walk to Paddington train station and tube.  We could also purchase a myriad of tour tickets from the hotel reception. Would suggest the hotel to prepare some umbrellas for guests to use in case of rain. All in all, this is an awesome place to stay. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in London.",5,2014,10,29
104,Get what you pay for!,"We booked and paid for a deluxe double and was given the smallest, darkest room i have ever come across but reception did phone within 5 min. to see if we were happy with our room. My huband's reply was my garage is bigger than this room and we were immediately moved to a bigger room which was twice the size of the 1st room.  Our breakfast was included it was good with cold or hot and the normal cereal, juices, yoghurt, fresh fruit, tea or coffee. The hotel is close to station and walking distance of quite a few very good restaurants and no traffic noise which is a bonus.",3,2014,10,29
104,Great value for my money,"I stayed at the Park Grand for two nights on my recent trip to London. The hotel gets a thumbs up for early check in. I pre-paid everything from Canada (via Expedia) so there were no charges over there.. The rooms were extremely small (which is typical for Europe), and the beds were also tiny.. I'm about 6ft 2, and my ankles were def hanging off the bed.. The hotel's in a very quiet area, and close to Paddington Station. The free wifi was very slow (to the point where it stopped working).. Would I stay there again? Yeah I would.. I got a really good bang for my buck, found this property quite affordable, comparing to other London hotels.",3,2014,10,27
104,Fantatsic Front Desk Manager,"Having booked this hotel for an emergency stay as our flat nearby was not ready after refurbishment, my wife and I arrived feeling very low. 
Sakar, the front desk manager picked up on this, he was fantastic, helped raise our moods, showed us a couple of rooms, and arranged to get us the best room.
As a nice gesture, he also arranged for a fruit basked to be delivered to the room.
Single handed, Sakar turned a what a very negative situation into one where our faith in humanity was being questioned and restored it by Sakar going over and above the call of duty.
He is a star!",5,2014,10,27
104,Fine for a weekend break,"Like other reviews, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful, however the hotel does need some TLC, and additional facilities to merit a higher rating. Breakfast being the only meal I had at the hotel, and served in the ""restaurant"" was ok, standard fare.

Room was fine, if a bit cosy, and did have a draughty, single pane window at the front of the hotel, which did allow noise from the street to come in. AC in the room was good at keeping the room cool.

Location was good for access to Hyde Park, and if you are not afraid of a walk, myself and my companion managed to take in Buckingham Palace, Albert Memorial, Big Ben, Whitehall and other London landmarks all in an afternoon.",3,2014,10,27
104,Does not deserve 4 stars,"I stayed for one night at the Park Grand on the 22nd Oct 2014. On arrival my first impressions were that the place needed a serious makeover and clean. The dirty fish tank in reception was a stong indication of this and gave a poor initial impression of the hotel. The staff were friendly and I could not fault them for their welcome and they even gave me a free upgrade to a larger room so my hopes were raised. The room however was more reflective of the exterior of the hotel and reception area. The qaulity of the finishing in the room and bathroom was appaling. A professional tradesman would have been ashamed of the quality of work. The bathroom had ill fitting tiles, door, and was cramped. The room had been poorly decorated. I would have been ashamed if I had done such a poor decorating job and I am an IT consultant, not a decorator. The window did not close properley so there was a lot of noise from the busy road outside.
This hotel cannot be classed as a 4 star and needs serious, and professional, refit.",2,2014,10,25
104,Great Hotel and friendly staffs,"One of my friend suggested to stay in Park Grand London hyde Park, but i am impressed with the friendly staffs especially Sakar, who guided me  the places to visit in London. His response is very fast. i really appreciate his work.",5,2014,10,24
104,No meals and noisy,"Stopped in a single room for a couple of nights while working on business. Disappointingly, the restaurant is just a bar selling a few sandwiches and Paninis.
The room had a single glazed window and the walls between the rooms are not well insulated; you can hear the guests in the adjacent rooms easily.",3,2014,10,23
104,Good hotel and staff,"Had a good experience with the staff person SAKAR, we approached him to make some adjustment to room type and he helped us out to get a good room for 2 person. Good variety of breakfast. Location of hotel is very near to the paddington hotel.",4,2014,10,22
104,Excellent hotel with good sized rooms,"We stayed two nights.  Had room 501 on 5 th floor - there is an elevator.  Had kingside bed.  Staff was great as was the breakfast.  An excellent find in a wonderful location.  Everything on the doorstep.  Everyone complains about small rooms in London, but not this place.",5,2014,10,21
104,Miss ,"My boyfriend and I stayed her for one night. The staff were very helpful. I requested the best room possible for our booking and they a upgraded us for no extra cost on arrival. 
The room was really nice and the hotel is in a great location just 5 minutes walk from paddington. 
I would recommend it and stay there again.",5,2014,10,20
104,no way this is 4 star treatment,"I booked another hotel but they relocated me to this one because of maintenance work.
For the inconvenience they promised free breakfast included, to which I commented that my reservation already had breakfast incl; they didn't make up for it in any other way.
On top of that they gave me a double room the size of a single, absolutely no space, bathroom size was ridiculous.
But there's more, evidently everything was gonna go wrong.
I took a shower, later sat at the table using my laptop and after some time I see a cockroach walking about. After killing it, telling reception (they saw it) they apologized saying this was not normal. They moved me to another room.
This time the room is quite right in size. But it's next to the service elevator, in which staff continues to go up and down.
The elevator's engine must be close to my room (last floor) so that every single time I hear a roaring noise when it runs.
Having trouble sleeping, I put out the ""do not disturb sign"" which is respected by the staff. That is until they rang my phone at 12.00 to ask if I wanted the room to be cleaned that day.

Other ""amenities"": no sign of a pen or a piece of paper in the room; the main door has almost 2cm gap to the floor, talk about noise‚Ä¶

Wi-Fi depending on the moments of the day: sometimes perfect, sometimes cannot even open a single bloody page without retrying for 2-3 minutes. Unbelievable.
4 stars should cater to business as well, if I were in this situation and had to work it'd have been a disaster.

I stayed in a 3 star hotel, certainly less pretencious, for a slightly lower price but the quality was actually better.",2,2014,10,16
104,Very Good Value,"The Park Grand is reasonably centrally located and just a few minutes walk form both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations. Our room (128) was a decent size with a large, comfortable bed and a good TV. There was tea, coffee and biscuits and enough storage space. The bathroom was quite small but it was not really a problem. There was a good shower and plenty of shampoo, gel and soap.

The hotel was very clean and all the staff we came into contact with were very helpful and pleasant.

We would definately stay here again. At just over ¬£150 per night it was very good value particularly given it's location",5,2014,10,16
104,Convenient but not pristine...,"Stayed at this hotel with friends for a short break. The staff were pleasant and the hotel itself is really well located for Paddington station, Hyde Park, Oxford Street etc but its not the sort of place you would stay more than once. The beds were comfortable but things were a little tired‚Ä¶damaged wallpaper, tatty lamp shades, stained carpet, grubby chair etc. I could go on but there is little point, as hotels like this are a bit of the norm in the capital city for anyone trying to arrange an overnight stay at a reasonable cost. It has the potential to be so much more but it's probably too easy to make a profit without any further significant investment. It is not bad value but sorry to say, it is not the sort of place that I would choose for a special weekend away.",3,2014,10,13
104,Lovely hotel for a weekend treat,"Ideal location, just a 5 minute walk from Paddington, lovely setting, building from the outside looked very grand, rooms very spacious and, beds very comfortable, bathroom very small, tea, coffee and biscuits when we arrived. We would stay here again as it was so lovely.",5,2014,10,13
104,"Comfortable, Nice, Clean","We were very happy with our 3-night stay here. The room and the bathroom were very small, but nice, and since we spent most of our time sightseeing, this was not a problem. A very nice hot breakfast was included in our stay, with lots of choices and better quality food than is often found in a complimentary buffet. Staff was friendly and courteous. Our room was on the main level right off of the lobby, and it was a bit noisy at times, but not enough to be annoying. An electric tea kettle and tea bags were provided in the room, and after coming in from a chilly afternoon, it was very nice to be able to make a quick cup of hot tea to go with the cookies that were left for us each day. Very satisfied with the hotel overall, and its location was great -- about a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station, so access to the Underground and to the Heathrow Express was very convenient.",4,2014,10,12
104,"Weel presented, clean and comfortable.","Happy with our stay at this hotel. We had a quadruple room which is 2 queen size beds. There was an alcove  to one side in which we could store luggage for 4 of us which made the room very workable. Tea, coffee and biscuits and a small fridge for our use was appreciated. The bathroom is compact but clean with a good shower. The beds were comfortable. The windows open for fresh air, we didn't need any heating or cooling so can't comment on that.
We originally didn't plan on buying breakfast as for four people it was a lot of Australian dollars at that point. However they did have a special offer for us when we checked in which made it much more appealing so we had breakfast after all. Glad we did as it was a well catered hot and cold buffet with lots of options in a pleasant breakfast room.
The staff were friendly and courteous and called up to make sure we were happy with our room.
There was a bit of noise transmission from the next room which could have been a problem if it had gone on all night ( high spirited girls having fun that's all) but fortunately they quietened down at a reasonable hour and all was well.
Location is good, off the main street but close enough to walk there in a couple of minutes( where there in an abundance of eateries), and also close to Paddington station for the tube or trains to Heathrow and elsewhere.
Overall we found this to be a good choice of hotel.",4,2014,10,12
104,Double Room - Very comfortable and enjoyable stay,"Our Double Room was certainly small by Australian standards, and we would most likely select a larger/superior room next time., but never the less we had a very comfortable and enjoyable 10 day stay.
The promotion photos for the hotel are real world photos, and are complimented by very friendly, helpful and courteous staff. The breakfast restaurant provides an outstanding selection whatever your requirements are, and the staff are outstanding.
The one and only minor issue we had was a cracked floor tile in the bathroom, which is something you should not expect in a Hotel of this quality.
With Paddington station only 500 mtrs away, and a large choice of restaurants to choose from, this is certainly the place we will be staying at on our next London visit.",5,2014,10,03
104,Single Room Means Single. Enjoyed the Short Stay,The single room I booked was certainly single. Comfortable though with all amenities. Very handy for Paddington and the tube the Hotel is a good place for a short stay. My room was nice and quiet on the ground floor at the back which is what I always hope for in a Hotel. Comfortable bed and quiet. Will return to the Hotel i am sure.,4,2014,10,03
104,"Park Grand, Hyde Park","Rooms were small, But the Staff and facilities were well worth the sacrifice. Very conveniently located to Paddington station. Able to get any where in London very quickly. Loved it. Direct train from Heathrow, w as great. Walked from Station. Approx 500 metres.",4,2014,10,02
104,Local to Paddington train station & Hyde Park,"My wife booked us a suite as part of our treat to attend the Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park culminating in ELO performing.
The staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful but when we returned to the hotel after the gig and dining out we were disappointed to find a pubic hair between the pillows, the bulb gone in one bedside light and the other bedside light coming away from it's fixing. Also the balcony was adorned with cigarette butts.",3,2014,09,26
104,Good hotel,I stayed at this hotel together with my family. We had a superior quad room. The size of the room was sufficient but the bathroom is too small. Even the corridors are extremely narrow. Room was very clean and quite and beds highly comfortable. Staff very helpful. I would not rate it 4 star though as 4 * hotels in my country are of a very higher standard. I even think it is a little over priced. I still recommend this hotel especially for its location and the service offered. ,3,2014,09,23
104,Become a Premier Club member and book into Club Room,"I have stayed here 3 times. No two rooms are the same in this hotel .. but Patricia and the front desk team go beyond the call of duty to keep Premier Club members happy with a very nice room. I will stay here again and will again pay the small extra charge for the extra enhancements, in room facilities, and larger size rooms. Even my wife was happy with our two level suite and she is very hard to please. 
If you only pay for the lowest price room .. you will get only a small room ... you can not blame the hotel for giving you what you paid for.  
I always buy a Premier Room deal that includes breakfast. Anthony, Monica and the other girls in the dining room are always friendly and eager to please.... thank you for my 2 fresh fried eggs every morning :-) 
This is a home away from home .. full service cheap laundry only one block behind the hotel, Paddington Station only a short three blocks away with two supermarkets in it.  
If you need to save money , buy a frozen dinner at the supermarket and heat it up in the microwave oven in your Premier Club room.  It balances out in the end as I find that dining out in London is far far overpriced for what you get. .",4,2014,09,21
104,Third visit to Shaftesbury hotel group,"This was our first visit to Park Grand but we have previously stayed at two other hotels in the Shaftesbury group. In every case we have found very welcoming reception staff, particularly Patricia and May, also very good food and I have to mention Anthony and Monica who always had a smile despite being under considerable pressure at times. Last but not least, very comfortable beds. A very pleasant weekend.

David Whitney",4,2014,09,17
104,Disappointed,We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and we we're quite disappointed as we expected more comfort from a supposedly 4 star hotel. The beds were very uncomfortable and after only 2 hours sleep we had to call & complain & see if another room was available. Staff tried to be helpful but as they were full we did not have too many options. We had a restless nights sleep and then had to make time in the morning to discuss other arrangements. The problem was the mattress was too soft and they claimed that all their mattresses were the same. We were then offered another room that had a firmer type of mattress but to our dismay that night we were kept awake by noise which seemed to becoming from above or the side of us. We could not work out what this could be until we discovered that we were next to a service lift which was operating at all hours of the night and day. As it was a short stay we did not complain again and tolerated it. Definitely not a 4 star hotel and would not choose to stay here again although location was convenient.,2,2014,09,17
104,"Nice, convenient hotel.","booked this hotel through a secret room deal for my girlfriend and I for two nights and overall had a fantastic stay. the staff were welcoming and friendly, always happy to help. the location is ideal as its only a short walk from either paddington station or hyde park.

the only gripe i had (and its a minor one) is that the room was a little small, however this did not bother either of us much at all, probably down to the fact that we were just happy to see each other and have a nice comfortable place to stay for the weekend in the city.

we had a cracking weekend which was enhanced by the fact that we were staying in a friendly, pleasant hotel. we shall certainly add this to our list of approved hotels in London! 

Thanks to the Park Grand team for a very pleasant stay.",5,2014,09,14
104,"Great location, ok staff","We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in May 2014. We had difficulty finding the hotel because they completely changed the name of the hotel without notifying their guests. We are extremely tech-savy travelers and were able to look this up, but it would have been nice to have been notified that the name of the hotel changed. We had called ahead and emailed multiple times requesting an early check-in as our flight was getting in to London very early. We were told they would likely be able to accommodate us. Even after being a few hours later then we mentioned, when we got there the front desk reception told us it would be an hour or two. They offered no suggestions of a place to eat lunch, WE had to ask if they could hold our bags and they were just overall not very welcoming and not very helpful. Looked at us like we had 3 heads...we were very tired and just wanted to freshen up or nap...couldn't do either. Overall the room was fine, albeit small, we expected that in London and knew that one of us would literally have to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. Not a big deal for younger people, but something to consider. The location was great, easy walking distance to the tube and other locations. Overall it was a nice stay and relatively well priced considering our other options. Hotel was very clean and convenient.",3,2014,09,11
104,Good location and clean rooms,Rooms are a bit small but clean and comfortable. Have all necessary amenities. Hotel is located at just 5 minutes walk to the Paddington station and neighborhood is quiet. Will not hesitate to stay there again.,4,2014,09,09
104,Everything is great except the room size,"I am unsure if the choice of room was my mistake - I asked for a quiet room. But I was amazed at how small a room could be and how cramped the toilet can be. 

Apart from that the place is very clean, well maintained and has a good location. The staff are courteous. The breakfast was good. 

I would visit again to see what kind of room I get. 

Natraj",3,2014,09,08
104,convenient location,"We took the express train from Heathrow and just had to walk about four blocks to the hotel.  It's on a quiet residential type road but only about a block off a major street with places to eat.  The train station is just across the street from the tube so it was handy to be able to get around.  Our room was quiet but we could feel the floor flexing when people walked down the hall, which is to be expected in older construction.  I appreciated that they had electrical outlet adapters for our USA needs.  You could have them with a credit hold on your room account.",4,2014,09,05
104,Tiniest room ever,We stayed here recently for a few nights and were mightily disappointed by the size of the room. At first we were consigned to a basement room but reception was happy to relocate us as I have a morbid fear of staying below street level. The new room was better but soooo small that it was impossible to walk around the bed. I had to physically climb over my partner to get out of bed. Clean enough and location good but would not stay here again. Better to spend a few more dollars for a little more space.,3,2014,09,01
104,2 Stays at this hotel,"I stayed here at the beginning and end of my trip in London, and I had two different experiences, despite booking the same room types. The first stay was lovely--I had a suite with a balcony and an upstairs lounge. The hotel let me check in very early with no problems, I found the bed to be very comfortable and the afternoon tea and cookies was much appreciated. The breakfast is expensive for what it is....I wouldn't pay for it by itself. I found a package on the Shaftesbury website that included breakfast at a discounted rate. For the second stay, the room was smaller and with no balcony. I did have to wait for quite a while to get into my room, but as I was asking for early check-in, I can't fault the hotel for that. I will say that my experiences with the front desk was very different the second time around though--not as friendly, definitely not as accomodating. The one exception was the bellman--he was so friendly and helpful during both stays. 
My first stay was very good, and I'd rate my second stay as just below average, so I weighted it in the middle to come to an average rating.",3,2014,08,31
104,Stay in London Hotel,Great location and very friendly staff . We did ask to be moved to another room as original room bit small and very hot . Room overlooked road so leaving window open was not an option . This was no problem at all I was shown other room to approve first . This room cooler and backed onto residential area not as picturesque but suited us better . Rooms all very clean and breakfast excellent.Choice available very good with nice friendly staff .,5,2014,08,30
104,Travel and leisure,"Hotel in a great location, .excellent mattress, shame about the bathroom are not working ventoline intake and since there are no windows  :-(  Unfortunately the exhaust coming out of the bathroom sink small inferior to the millimeter, seemed mites, they gave us a spray disinfectant, but continued to out, we hope not to be caught anything ..excellent mattress.
Council disinfect all discharges, to better clean the carpet, even better take it away, to bring Italian breakfast at a lower cost.",3,2014,08,26
104,My short stay at London,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The room, although not big, was adequate, clean, has a large TV and a most comfortable bed, a desk and tea/coffee facilities.  The staff were very accommodating and friendly. The English breakfast was SUPERB ! It was quiet and the type of people frequenting the hotel decent and respectful, for what I could see and experience.",4,2014,08,26
104,Never again,The room I had was tiny and felt like a broom cupboard. The bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on in my life!!! For nearly ¬£100 I expected alot more! I will never stay at this hotel again and would recommend my friends not to stay there as it's not worth the price!,2,2014,08,26
104,Notting hill carnival,"Greatest hotel in paddington to stay. Rooms are big. And treatment is like 5 star hotel.

we booked 6 club room for carnival party and we were amazed with hotel hospitality.

Well done alll related to make our stag enjoyable ",5,2014,08,26
104,FABULOUS /GOOD SERVICE,"Good service. Purchased a deluxe double and was upgraded to a club deluxe room with an upstairs.  Very rewarding this was for us. The room was in the first floor just abkve reception. The room was spacious , the bed was extremely comfy.  The breakfast was better than expected.  The only downside was the internet Wifi connectiin this was free but very poor.  Other than that I would book again. 

Armeen was a great member of staff. Very helpful.",5,2014,08,25
104,traffic noise,"We booked The Park Grand Paddington around the corner, a quieter hotel, but only to be told they had no rooms left because of ""maintenance work"". We was told we would have to stay at The Park Grand Hyde Park, we was reluctant to go there, but had no option. The hotel is on a busy main road. The room we was given had a mezzanine floor with a squeaking staircase. Bad nights sleep, due to traffic noise & room above, banging about at 6.30 on a Sunday morning !! Thanks Grand Park Paddington & Hyde Park for making our WEDDING ANNIVERSARY A GREAT STAY !!!!!!!! Been treated better at a Travelodge !!!!",3,2014,08,25
104,Good services.good location,"Good location good services and cleanliness . I like it 

I will be visiting hotel again for below reasons:-

1.perfect location
2. Good rooms
3. Helpful staff
4.parking facility

I think all above mentioned made our stay enjoyable 

Me and mrs wang Wenting ",5,2014,08,25
104,Disappointed for my third stay,"this is my third stay in Park Grand but I felt disappointed about the room and service this time -
(1) no enough lights in the room - there is no light / desk lamp on the working table, I made the request but no response
(2) I used the spoon in the room but no one cleaned that after",3,2014,08,24
104,A Superior London Hotel Experience,"I had very average expectations for the Park Grand.  I was shopping price, and the hotel seemed like a good deal, and because of that I figured there would be some disappointments in service or features.  I was wrong.  The hotel is immaculate, and the rooms are modern, if somewhat small (this is London after all, and not Las Vegas).  What really exceeded my expectations was the professional and friendly service.  Every person who I came in contact that worked in the hotel was helpful, friendly, and personable.  It was overall a great experience and I'm looking forward to returning.",5,2014,08,23
104,Feel like home,"Park grand is located 5 minute walk from paddington and central line station.

park grand is my second home  as i am visitng london every  month from cambridge. 

We booked 4 rooms every week for my family visit and we are satisfy with hotel service.",5,2014,08,23
104,Quiet,"We were moved here from another hotel due to maintenance issues. The room we got was as small as possible, so we had to upgrade for forty pounds a night. The new room was spacey and clean. The surrounding areas were pretty quiet, but the hotel walls are pretty thin. If you're taking the bus, use the Westbourne Terrace stop instead of the one at Paddington for a better chance at a good seat.",3,2014,08,22
104,Highly Recommended Hotel,"The hotel is in a very good location with easy access to transport links (paddington Station just a couple of minutes walk away). We had a duplex room which was very comfortable and big enough for a family of 3. The staff were very friendly and helpful, they booked us a shuttle back to Heathrow while we went out and carried on our holiday. I would definitely recommend staying here and upon any further trips to London I would book to stay here again.",5,2014,08,22
104,small but nice,"we booked two rooms to accommodate my husband and me and our three children (9, 11 & 13).  The room for the three of them was pretty spacious with a king size bed as well as a twin in a loft area one step up from the main room. Their bathroom was also a good size, well equipped with anything you may have forgotten. Our room for two on the other hand was quite tiny. Our bed was a full and fairly comfortable. The bathroom was very small as well but again, well equipped.  Both the rooms and the bathrooms were updated and clean. The building itself was very clean also but not nearly as spacious as the pictures portray.  It does, however have an interesting history and is beautifully decorated. There was a good variety of breakfast offerings in a grand dining room.  It was wonderful to enjoy a full English breakfast on our first morning there.  Of course the location was wonderful - very close to a tube station and the beautiful park.  The service was very good also.  They arranged a great car service to pick us up at the airport, as we arrived at almost midnight.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful too.  Sadly, we only spend the first night of our trip there while our apartment was being readied for the remainder of our stay, but that is a whole other story!   Overall, good service, good location, good food and an enjoyable stay.",4,2014,08,20
104,birthday celebration visit,"The hotel was in an excellent location ,with easy access to transport links for thatres.Close to shopping.museums and parks 
Very friendly staff ,comfortable,quite rooms ,good breakfast ,
would stay there again",5,2014,08,20
104,Suitable for family,"I booked this hotel for family of 5 and we were not comfortable with duplex room .after complaining at reception they moved us to 2 Quine size bed rooms.

Room was big enough for us and very neat and clean.hotel location is perfect and stone throw distance from paddington and other underground stations.

Breakfast staff was excellent and we will book again.",5,2014,08,20
104,Another great stay at the Park Grand,"After staying there a few months ago, i didn't hesitate to book a room at the Park Grand again.
Even though i came to check in very early, the girl at reception told me the room will be put on priority so i can go to the room earlier, which was just perfect as i was feeling exhausted from the long flight, and had to prepare a presentation for the late afternoon.
The room i had was a lovely single room on the second floor. It was immaculate, and had free coffee and tea facilities as well a bottle of water and fruit basket, which i will now get as a member of their loyalty reward programme. I was pleasantly surprised to see the TV in the single room is just as big as the one in the higher category room, and not a tiny excuse for a TV some hotels put in their single rooms.
After returning to the hotel in the evening, i asked the concierge to recommend a place to eat, and i was spoiled by the choice around the hotel! Queensway, Marylebone, Edgware Rd. all within 10-15m walk from the hotel, all offering top quality food!
I had a very good sleep, thanks to the AC in the room which kept the warm humid air at bay.
Breakfast was brilliant and since i pre-booked it, it cost me 5 pounds less which was a bargain considering it's a buffet, all you can eat breakfast.
Upon checkout, i stored my luggage, and had a pint of draught beer in their bar while i waited for the taxi to come.
Overall i am highly satisfied with the hotel, brilliant staff, good room, and perfect location!
Will stay again whenever i come to London!",5,2014,08,18
104,"Good hotel, kindly staff","Nice hotel, good location, in five minutes you're at the underground of Paddington station.
The beds are good. A pitty that the elevator didn't reached the 7th floor. 
The bathroom is on the small side. We liked the caffee and tea facility on the room.
Very good breakfast.
The receptionist was very helpfull. We had troubles with the Airport Transfer Taxi, and the receptionist helped us with the phone calls. 
By departure we have forget our backpack, but the hotel have send it back at our request.
We are very thankful for this.",4,2014,08,16
104,"Nice hotel, good location","I've first booked another hotel of Shaftesbury Hotels, but due to an overbooking I was transferred to Park Grand London Hyde Park. 

From the first moment we arrived the staff was very kind and helpful. 
The rooms are small, but fine and very clean and there is free Wi-Fi available.

Because of the overbooking we were also offered a free breakfast and I think that's a good service of Shaftesbury Hotels and we really enjoyed the good breakfast they have at Park Hotel London Hyde Park. 

The location is also very good. It's a 5 minute walk to Paddington Station and a 10 minute walk to Lancaster Gate. Using the London underground you're in central London in no time.

The only thing that was less fine, was that the fire alarm went off for about 2 minutes, so we did not get much sleep the first night. It didn't happen the second night so I think it's already solved.",4,2014,08,15
104,Sounds good but only just.,"Didnt get a good feeling on arrival when I was allocated a basement room. no wifi, no phone signal. Back to reception who almost without asking let me have a 2nd floor room.....why not in the first place.

Breakfast was OK but didnt eat in the evening so no comments on that.

Room was comfortable and clean.",3,2014,08,15
104,Good hotel,"Great  recptionist , helpful employees ,  clean modern rooms good furnished,clean bathrooms and good location ,it's near the underground and bus stops... but their towels is not so good but its good all over",4,2014,08,14
104,Decent rooms but a poor nights sleep,"I believe this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, however I wouldn't give it more than 2-3. When I first arrived no one shown at the reception desk for a few minutes however when they did they were extremely friendly and helpful - can not fault the staff at all.

The rooms are quite small but well designed and clean. Tea making facilities are there as well as some biscuits, always a nice touch.

Unfortunately I can only base my review on my nights sleep, and I know this doesn't happen all the time, but I did not get a good nights sleep. The fire alarm went off 2-3 times for short intervals. Hopefully this has been resolved...

If I am nearby Paddington again I would stay this hotel. Reasonably priced and the breakfast is good too.",3,2014,08,13
104,Fabulous Location--Near Paddington Station,"Great location, only about a block and a half from Paddington Station which offers the speed train to the airport.  Staff were very accommodating when we requested a room change.  Rooms are clean, neat and airy.",4,2014,08,11
104,Will go back to this Hotel,Nice Hotel Central in London. Close to Paddington station- walking distance also with a suitcase. Polite staff and clean. Everything you need. We had a familyroom with minikitchen. New bathroom with shampoo etc.,4,2014,08,10
104,Really average,"Not bad, however not very good for the price. Most empleyees are very kind, but not everyone..

The single room is confortable, but VERY small and we have lack of space... The bathroom is small as well and bad planned.

Had problems with the air conditioned and had to change my room. The same problem in the other and had to change again....

Nice breakfast and location",3,2014,08,10
104,Adequate Hotel - good location !,"The Park Grand is typical of many hotels in the Paddington area, relatively low priced, reasonable if fairly basic accommodation, good location with easy access to Lancaster Gate or Paddington tube -.short walk to Queensway area with lots of restaurants. Couldn't connect to wifi in my room !",3,2014,08,10
104,Decent place to stay in London,"This hotel was a decent property in a good location.  Just a couple blocks walk from Paddington Station, access to public transportation was very good.  If you are looking for a location closer to the Central London tourist sites (walking distance) this is not your place.  Room was very clean and breakfast was a good way to start the day.  I recommend booking directly through the hotel as the rates tends to include the breakfast whereas those booked through on-line entities are not (considerable saving).  

Rooms are small but in line with price and overall what is availble in London.",4,2014,08,08
104,"""""Very friendly staff and great hotel """"","This hotel was very close to paddington and Lancaster gate station . Actually it took me only 5 minutes from paddington underground station .

If I travel to London again , I would definitely stay at park grand London Hyde park . It's been a great experience staying at this hotel .  ",5,2014,08,08
104,Would go again,Nice gaff. Shame about noisy  doors on corridor. ..bang..bang. .bang shhhh sleeping !!!! Good location and area. Comfy room tv channels are a bit pants everything you need . Me and  girlfriend stopen for 3 nights. The Devonshire Arms pub down the road is a good place for a sup! ,4,2014,08,06
104,A good place to stay,"We stayed 5 nights at the hotel. A few aspects how we experienced it.
+ our room was excellently cleaned 
+ fresh towels every day
+ modern bath and shower, large enough
+ friendly and helpful personell at the reception desk
+ quiet central, 7 min to tube station Lancaster Gate

- we stayed on the 6th floor, windows facing the street - loud
- the windows could not be opened except one was open a small gap, therefore it was hot in the    
  room though a climate control helped a bit
- fridge did not really work
- beds definitely too soft

All in all under London aspects a nice place to stay!",4,2014,08,06
104,"Short stay last August, great experience","I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and I'll probably return there. My room was very big (a triple room) and clean. The bathroom was large enough for 3 people. The breakfast was various and fine. You can find boht english and continental breakfast. The receptionists were very kind. 
The nearest underground station is just 7/8 minutes walking. The  neighbourhood is very quiet at night and Queensway (a nearby street) is full of nice Reastaurants such as Italian and take away ones. 

Siamo stati in questo hotel per 3 notti e probabilmente ci torneremo. La nostra camera era grande ( una tripla) e pulita. Il bagno era abbastanza grande per 3 persone. La colazione era varia e buona. C'era sia quella inglese che quella italiana. Alla reception erano molto educati ( Non parlano Italiano). La stazione metro √® a soli 7/8 minuti a piedi. La zona √® tranquilla di notte e Queensway (una strada vicina) √® piena di ristoranti come quello italiano e i classici fast food.",4,2014,08,06
104,Great place to stayover for a night,"we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel and we got a cheaper deal on booking.com.
Room has everything you could want,a soft bed,toiletries and powerful shower.wifi service was slow but we never mind as we were not there for business trip.
staff is very helpful.breakfast option were great.
superb hotel!!!",5,2014,08,06
104,Hotel Rating is accurate,"The Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel is a four star hotel whose rating is accurate.  I have always found their room rates to be very competitive and the club rooms are nice.  My only issue is that after having stayed at the hotel three times, I still have trouble getting use to the very small bathrooms.  The hotel is a short walk north of Hyde Park, near Paddington Station and the Tube stop.  The breakfast buffet offered on the lower level is good with a decent selection.  The hotel has no other dining facilities.  It's not in the most central part of London but the Tube stop is close by and I have always been able to readily find a taxicab when desired.",4,2014,08,05
104,Great experience,"It was an absolute excellent experience.  The prices were very reasonable and the rooms were a very good size. Another great thing was they had a wide selection of tv channels.  Plenty to accomadate an american. I stayed 4 places here and this was clearly the best. The only one that had air conditioning as well. The staff went out of their way for any need I had. In particular sakar , adriana, and gurdeep. They went above and beyond what anyone could expect. I highly recommend a stay at the hotel.
",5,2014,08,05
104,Great Stay,"Nice hotel.   Great location.   Rooms were well furnished and above my expectations.    Neighborhood was great.   Hotel was definately in a residential area but was close enough to resturants.  Easy walk to Paddington, easy access to Heathrow.   Enjoyed my morning run around Kensington Park.",5,2014,08,05
104,Good location.,"This is a quiet hotel and reasonably priced, great for us as we were travelling by train and so arriving and departing from Paddington so the hotel is only about 6/7 minutes walk from the station. Bathroom on the small side with little space for putting things but the room a reasonable size, not the largest but certainly not the smallest I have had in four star hotel.  We were a bit taken aback on check in being asked for ID (which was copied), no explanation given until we actually asked and as I travel to London frequently and have never had to provide this before.  Travelling in the UK we were lucky to have anything with us.  I think we were a little unlucky with the receptionist as she didn't seem to know why this was required when asked.  I am always quite careful with giving out personal details, so again, being asked for a date of birth I was not particularly happy about.  This should be made clearer too when booking although we did use a booking agency.  Anyway, I don't want to make this into a rant as all the other staff were very friendly and we had a perfectly nice stay.  Best thing about it was that the room was really quiet, at the back of the hotel so barely any traffic noise and a window that opened!!!  Free wifi too!",4,2014,08,05
104,Small Room but comfortable,"Wow what can you pack into such a small hotel room.   I was amazed on how small the room was, but that aside it was a comfortable hotel.   The area around the hotel felt safe and it was a pleasant walk to the Marble Arch.   The hotel room had Air Conditioning which made our stay in London during a heat wave pleasant.  The staff were friendly and helpful.",3,2014,08,04
104,Value for Money,"If you want a modern clean 4star hotel, but not the huge daily rate you would normally expect to pay. Then this is the hotel for you, free Internet and very easy to get to Central London in less than 15 minutes as Osterley Tube Station is almost opposite
The Duty manager was very helpful and The Curry on the menu is very good.",4,2014,08,01
104,"Good breakfast, okay location - noisy pipes.","This hotel is fine for a London crash pad but to be honest, was a bit weird. I've never stayed in a hotel room when a single room actually is a single bed, it was like being back in halls of residence as the room was tiny. The bathroom was equally small but modern. During the night I realised that the room must have been near pipes as every so often, well to be honest, constantly throughout the night, I could hear water running and toilets flushing as well as doors slamming. It was a bit strange too how my room number started with an 8 but was on the ground floor? Breakfast was good and it was pretty close to the station.",2,2014,07,31
104,More good than very good but definitely better than average.,"Unfortunately on Trip Advisor there is not a good option, and good would describe the Park Grand London Hyde Park, not quite very good. First the excellent, the position of the hotel is great, just over a 10 minute walk to Kensington Gardens and just over 5 to Paddington Tube! And a lovely quiet area. Then the very good, a car park belonging to the hotel (although they charge ¬£20 a day - still cheaper than the car parks in the area though), all of the staff were friendly and efficient, lobby and bar area pleasant, front of hotel was lovely. The good, breakfast was not the best buffet offer with limited fruits and yoghurt from tubs, limited cereals, a choice of just apple or orange juice, however the hot buffet offer was okay and of good quality. The average and below, room size was small, just room to walk around the bed, but the room was comfortable (and given the current 27 degree heat - the air con although noisy - worked and was useful) however the decor was very tired (see photo). There was a musty smell through areas of the hotel - although this may have just been cleaning with equipment that just needed cleaning. Overall, considering everything, our two night stay was comfortable and the staff were great. We would recommend this hotel, although you could possibly do better - you may do worse.
We paid ¬£500 for 2 rooms for 2 nights which we thought would be good value if it included breakfast and car parking, however both those things cost us ¬£120 so at ¬£620 we found this expensive for what we actually got - and for all of these reasons would say it's good, but not very good. You could possibly do better - but overall you wouldn't be disappointed if you wanted a base for a couple of nights or so to see the sights.",4,2014,07,31
104,Would not stay again,"First off, the good: rooms are clean, location is very convenient (just a short walk from Paddington station).

The bad: the hotel wifi is SUPER slow.  The kind of slow that makes you wish for the days of 28k dial-up.  It was impossible to do any real work there.  The walls are very thin - I felt like I could hear everything that was happening in every room in my hall.  The rooms are TINY, even by London standards.  It was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in.  

Overall not a good experience.",2,2014,07,30
104,Happy Guest,"Booked a room in this hotel and was really happy that I made the right choice. Excellent service from all staff ,starting from the front desk , restaurant & housekeeping . Very nice location near to Paddington & Lancaster Gate tube stations , Hyde Park , Central  London :)) .   
Keep up the good work",5,2014,07,30
104,Excellent Stay,"Me & my husband booked 4 days for our first anniversary at park grand Hyde park hotel. 

When we went in the hotel reception guys accept us very cordially & friendly. They also help us all kind of information & London tour guide.

Specially reception boy Sakar is great he did very great job for us & he knows wht is excellent costumer service. Thanks Sakar. 

And also restaurant team are also friendly & they did excellent service but the problem is every morning same breakfast items no change. 

Room size good enough & also very clean & well decorated.
In addition hotel is very close to Hyde park & Paddington station. So it's make our stay enjoyable. 

Guys see you next year again. 
 ",5,2014,07,30
104,Great stay in London,"Our family of 4 stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park in July and had a great time.  Check in was easy and painless after a 10 1/2 hour flight.  The room was actually bigger than I imagined and had pretty much everything we needed.  

The breakfast buffet was outstanding.  We ate so much I thought they might throw us out.  The breakfast staff was very pleasant to deal with...very nice people!

It's only a 5 minute walk to Paddington and there are quite a few places to eat around there.  

I feel this place was a very good value for the price when you compare it to other properties in London.  Plus when you factor how much we ate at breakfast it gets even better.

If / when we get the chance to visit London again we would definitely stay here.",5,2014,07,28
104,Good stay,"Good location, nice room, good service.

Convenient location for our summer sale shopping.newly renovated room with very bright wallpaper. well worth every penny spent .

All staff were very friendly and very accommodating.

A very big thank you to all at the PARK GRAND HYDE PARK.
",5,2014,07,25
104,Excellent Accommodations,"My wife, two children, and I stayed at the Park Grand for five nights and loved it.  Nicely renovated property with extremely helpful staff. Very clean.  Location was great as well, and easy walk to Paddington Station and two Tube stops. Best of all, the price was reasonable for pricey London.",5,2014,07,25
104,Go elsewhere,"Booked this hotel for my first visit to London and was expecting a lot more from this hotel!! Booked an extra night stay 2 months prior to arriving. Second day of staying staff thought we were checking out and no one knew about extra night booked!  Had to pay ¬£20 deposit on arriving however nothing of this is mentioned when booking. Breakfast is an extra ¬£10 everyday you choose to stay. We stayed in room 805 on the ground floor, very noisy as windows are paper thin, you could hear trades people arguing outside and party goers at 3am. Went asking staff about this they seemed oblivious to this and didn't offer to help in any way. Sheets were dirty and stained with what looked like blood.",1,2014,07,24
104,"Older Hotel, Prompt Service","We stayed four nights and chose this hotel as it was within a few minutes walk from the Paddington or Lancaster Gate Underground Station. The room is small and clean, but when our electronic key did not work they quickly moved us to a slightly bigger room. Staff was friendly in explaining use of the hop-on, hop-off buses. Bed is soft but ok for tired bodies. Free wi-fi is good, as is the English breakfast at a discounted price.",4,2014,07,22
104,Would certainly recommend!,"Myself and 7 friends stayed here recently for my sisters hen weekend in London. The staff at the reception were welcoming & friendly & very helpful.
The entire lobby area looked spotless.

Rooms were lovely & clean although rather cramped. I booked two quadruple rooms but was given two duplex (?) suites which has an upstairs area with a massive bed and a downstairs area with a very small sofa bed, kitchen area and shower room. It's not really suitable for four unless you want to get 3 in the big bed upstairs. The bathroom is tiny!! You can barely move in there, no exaggeration. However it was fully stocked with towels & toiletries and sparkling clean. The rooms at night are lovely & quiet we didn't hear a peep from anyone else in the hotel.

Location is excellent, 3 minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube st where you can pick up lines to all the London hotspots in minutes. 

Full English breakfast was delicious, loads of choice. The buffet is kept hot, fresh & topped up frequently. The people working were very friendly too and efficient with bringing tea/coffee over.

Will certainly return if I am in the area again! ",4,2014,07,21
104,Excellent Value,"Excellent service and friendly staff, small but very comfortable rooms, are always clean and tidy.  I was accommodated and everything was to my liking

Excellent service and friendly staff, small but very comfortable rooms, are always clean and tidy.  I was accommodated and everything was to my liking",5,2014,07,21
104,Comfortable and cosy stay,"We recently stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park, and had an extremely pleasant experience.  Our room was spacious enough, given we had an extra bed for our 11-year old.  Apart from the excellent location (which allows you to access the tube easily, stroll over to Kensington Gardens, and come back during the day to rest or drop off shopping...), I want to highlight the delicious and generous breakfast that is offered, and overall comfort of the hotel.  We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2014,07,20
104,Another excellent stay.,We have stayed here several times this year and have had another great stay. The staff are all very friendly and the room are always clean and tidy. The breakfasts are always excellent too and probably the deal clincher for us. Looking forward to our next stay soon.,5,2014,07,20
104,Excellent service,"Excellent service and friendly staff, very comfortable rooms, large enough, very extensive delicious breakfast. 

I would like to make a special mention to Sakar who went above and beyond to ensure I was accommodated and everything was to my liking! ",5,2014,07,20
104,I stayed 15 nights,"I stayed 15 nights here while I worked nearby.
The room was pretty small with a single bed (107), but was ok and it did take a couple of days to get use to the pillow.
The reception staff where welcoming and the breakfast staff cheerful and friendly, I did not need to ask for my 2 fried eggs and coffee in the end as the waitress remembered.
The hotel is clean and I would recommend this for it's good location, however I only have 1 complaint, and that was that there was no mattress protector on the bed for the first 8 days. I did complain about this after the first night as it was to hot in the room and I must have tossed and turned all night and found I was sleeping on a bare mattress in the morning, I dread to think who else's body fluids I was sleeping on. 
I slept much better once the mattress protector was out on as it also helped keep the sheets in place. ",5,2014,07,19
104,Excellent staff,"I was fortunate to stay at the Park Grand Hyde Park . The room was excellent,  spacious,  very mordern snd plus........
The room amenities was delicous .
staff were very hospitable,  helpful and eager to go extra mile for guest. 
The location was excellent for catching the tube station . Paddington underground is 5 mins away and Lancaster gate is about 10 mins . Anywhere to central London is 20 minutes away . Even though Hyde Park is few minutes walk , but didn't had enough time . Will be back & also look  forward  seeing hyde park . 
",5,2014,07,18
104,Perfect hotel!,"Hotel is situated in a food area.
Perfect place for russia tourist and we booked with camelot tours.
Staff was very helpful and breakfast was very nice.

Paddington station is nearby and serve many major locations.

We will come back soon",5,2014,07,18
104,"Clean, large enough, nicely finished, helpful staff, reasonable price, convenient location","Title says it all. I'd happily stay here again. It's really close to Paddington train station which accesses anywhere you'd want. Few shops/pubs/restaurants. 

Clean, large enough, nicely finished, helpful staff, reasonable price, convenient location",5,2014,07,17
104,Business trip for one day,"The hotel was booked two weeks in advance but the only rooms that were available upon our arrival were on the basement level. Extremely small room, with very small window with the view to the wall...
The shower is very uncomfortable. 
4 stars ....it have to be a mistake!!!",2,2014,07,16
104,Pretty good...,"Stayed here for four days in late April. The hotel's location is quite central, its close to Paddington and Hyde Park.

The staff are helpful. The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable, all the basics are covered. I had a room on the top floor, and one strange/odd issue was the noise from what I assume is the water pump. Each time I ran the water, it would cause a pretty loud and irritating noise. Another detail, there were no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels or clothes.

They offer free breakfast in the basement dining room, good choice of hot and cold items, definitely a plus point.

One last point to note, about six weeks after my stay, I got a text alert for a charge on my card from the hotel, even though I'd paid my bill at checkout. I immediately called my card company and then the hotel - the hotel said they did not place any charge. Good thing was that the charge did not post, but it was strange regardless, never happened to me before.

Overall, a pretty good place.",4,2014,07,16
104,Great hospitality,"Park grand Hyde park is a beautiful hotel . The service is top notch and the location is terrific for getting around London . Plus the concierge staff were wonderful at helpful us figure out where we ne
eded to go and even finding us tickets for the theatre our last night in town . The breakfast is very .
I recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.",5,2014,07,15
104,"Nice, clean hotel with great location","Stayed one night at the Park Grand London Hyde Park.  While the room was a tad small, it was clean and updated; perfect for a solo traveler.  The location of the hotel is very convenient!  Close to Paddington Station and within a short walk to Hyde Park and the Central Line.",4,2014,07,11
104,"Nice hotel, small room, good rate","Park Grand Hyde Park is situated right between Paddington Station & Hyde Park, which was perfect with me. I liked the hotel, although my single standard room was really small.
This hotel is right for you if you like your room clean and the staff friendly and if you don't need that much space :)",4,2014,07,08
104,"Quality, easily affordable and well located","We only spent one night and needed a clean, affordable yet high quality accommodation within walking distance to Hyde Park. The Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel was perfect for this. Yes, according to others the stairs can be a tad windy - but this is an authentic Victorian building and so the original design reflects this. In addition, we found the lift worked for all floors and (yes) the breakfast was delicious - cooked scramble eggs; not undercooked as preferred in Europe. My only gripe would be to replace the 'concentrated' orange juice for fresh - well worth the investment. We booked the superior triple room (#120) which provided a double sofa bed on the 'ground floor' whilst my husband I had the twin room on the 'upper floor'. A miniature balcony and open stairs separated us - lovely!! The room was well decorated with self-catering facilities. Althought this was not needed, I'd consider this quite useful if staying longer. As far as the staff are concerned - they were extremely helpful and well informed of the ""congestion charge"" associated wth inner London. Be warned!! If you are unfamiliar with London - they charge ¬£11 (Mon - Fri) if you drive to the inner zone. If not paid - the fine inceases to ¬£130. Please check your journey before leaving! (https://congestioncharging.tfl.gov.uk/b/pb/provideVRM.faces). Again, as with others before, I found very little to fault with our experience there. Highly recommended. Thank you for your assistance - I shall definitely return to one of your hotels if I/we need to stay in London :)",5,2014,07,05
104,Clean with good location,"We booked a quad room for 4 nights. The room was clean, bed soft and comfy and the wifi was good. The folks at the front desk were very helpful. 
Typically English breakfast each morning and you can order a bowl of porridge. ",4,2014,07,05
104,Not enough room to swing a cat...,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights early July. The staff were all pleasant and were accomodating but I was expecting more from our room which was effectively a cupboard. The bathroom was barely enough size for 1 person to stand in, and the bed was shoe-horned into the room. Our iron was faulty which meant a repair man replacing the unit and the inclusive breakfast was ok...Staff were all very helpful, but the rooms are pretty tired. Our door wouldn't shut properly, the lift was the slowest I've ever experienced, and the restaurant only does breakfast, options for dinner are the local take-away...

I was expecting more for what we paid, which by London standards was fairly cheap, but by any other standards was very expensive!",2,2014,07,04
104,Disappointment,"I went to London with my daughter, and I booked a duplex suite. This is the most expensive room at the hotel, so I thought we were in for a real treat. We were extremely disappointed upon arrival. The duplex suite was nothing like what we expected. The bathroom was absolutely tiny, I would go as far as to call it claustrophobic! The only positive thing in the bathroom was the size of the shower, too bad it took up more than half the room! The fridge in our suite did not work, and we let the reception staff know upon arrival. They promised that the fridge would be fixed the next morning, but this never happened, and we had to do without a fridge for the duration of our stay. The decor in the suite was quite dated, I would at lest suggest a replacement of the carpets! The room was quite noisy as well, the hotel is next to quite a busy road. The breakfast was included in the prize of the room, thank goodness for that! Had I paid extra for this breakfast, I would have been really annoyed! The cooked breakfast was bland and cold, and we chose to buy breakfast at a local restaurant for the rest of our stay. I don't think I will stay at this hotel again. I have been to London 10 times, and this hotel was one of the biggest disappointments I have had so far. The one positive thing I would like to mention, is that the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Regretfully this was not enough to make our stay worth my money!",3,2014,07,03
104,Atmospheric Terrace Close to Kensington Gardens,"The location of the Park Grand just around the corner from Paddington Station and within a short walk of the Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park complex is an important feature of this hotel. The hotel itself lies within a classic west-end terrace building and offers more of a small boutique hotel experience. The rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. My only gripe is that the sound-proofing between my room and the one next door was not quite what it should have been and the rather enthusiastic nocturnal activities of the room's occupants interrupted what should have been a sound night's sleep. Breakfast in the 'terrace' room was very pleasant.",4,2014,07,01
104,Ok,"The rooms are small but this is to be expected for London. Clean and quiet. A great place to put your head down at night if that's all you expect from a hotel. 

Fair warning though, the first floor has no lift and the stairs are very narrow. A nightmare if you have luggage

The staff seem very dis interested in actually helping you with anything. They insisted we reserved three rooms when there were only two of us and two reservations. They also stated that breakfast wasn't included and we found out it was included when we went down for breakfast the next morning 

Overall, if you don't expect much from the staff but want a good nights sleep, it's not a bad place ",3,2014,06,30
104,A wonderful stay at a reasonable price!,"My wife and I stayed here last weekend 21/22 June 2014. The hotel is just a short walk from Lancaster Gate tube on the Central line and is situated on Westbourne Terrace which is a beautiful tree lined road very close to the heart of London (Hyde Park / Paddington area) so offers easy access to the City whilst giving you a peaceful place to rest!

The hotel is a beautiful building and the reception area is nice and bright and welcoming. The staff are very friendly and professional and answered all of our questions.

We had an upgrade to a double duplex room which was lovely with the bathroom / shower and lounge on the ground floor with terrace and microwave facilities and the bedroom was upstairs.

We had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this hotel.

104,Great Stay,"We loved our stay in the hotel, which was in an elegant English house. Great service by the front desk, who has been patient with us. We booked a triple room, but were prepared to get a very small room as we saw feedback that London hotel rooms are generally small. How wrong we were. We were given the room #801 (we were told it's the largest triple room in the hotel) and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. The room and the bathroom were kept cleanly throughout our stay. We also loved the location of the hotel, near to the Paddington station, yet on a quiet road with shades along the way. Perhaps the only thing to improve was the breakfast, which was the same for the 4 days stay we had. Overall, it's a very enjoyable stay.",4,2014,06,25
104,Excellent Stay in first class hotel.,"The check in was very impressive on arrival. We had ensured that our rooms were allocated next to each other. 

The front desk staff was very helpful and we were given our rooms much earlier than the check in time.

Our rooms were allocated on second level next to each other. Rooms were very clean also our bathrooms were spotless. Room had all amenities with a tea/coffee making facilities.

We highly recommend this hotel for families looking for a holiday in London. .

We will definitely return for our next family outings.",5,2014,06,24
104,best staffs!!! and great experience.....,"My family stayed for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment. All the staffs were friendly and helpful. The apartment was very spacious and  very clean and the breakfast also nice. Paddington tube station is an easy 5 minute walk away. The neighborhood is very quiet  as well.
M&s simply food and sainsbury nearby; couple of pubs and restaurants within 5-10 min walk; tour pickups were also nearby. On the whole could not fault the location and the apartment above but this was a very minor irritation and to be expected given the age of the building. 

The best aspect of this great hotel is the staff. Concierge are knowledgeable and super friendly. All staff seemed to love being a part of making this the premier hotels in London. Can't wait to return....

Would recommend to anyone......:)",5,2014,06,24
104,The staff make the difference,"I picked the place because it was a short walk to my office in Paddington. The duplex room I initially picked was inconvenient. Steep stairs with all storage upstairs. Not convenient if you have packed for a 10 day stay. I asked for a change and was given one next day - which was fine. I got a room on the 6th floor - #602 - looking over the top of houses out back (away from the traffic noise from Westbourne Terrace as well) and with views across over Little Venice / Maida Vale. Rather pleasant. The staff were universally helpful and understanding. Room service is non existent; but you don't really need it given the options around the Paddington station. Breakfast is big and English. Even 10 days later I didn't tire of the fare - again, the cheerful ladies helped. The room i finally got  was roomy enough for me - with a couple it would be tight though it did have a little storage room for the bags, which was good.  Housekeeping is efficient. I had initially booked for 14 nights, but had to cut back to 11 - which again was done seamlessly. In some places they can be sticky with that sort of stuff. Laundry - the other potential pitfall during such stays - was easily handled. They even ran an express dry-cleaning run with my suit for me... Got it done through a laundry service round the corner (on Chilworth Street, if that helps). But I was happy to pay for the service. All very agreeable. ",4,2014,06,21
104,Great hotel in a great location,"This is a very elegant property, well located just 5 minute walking distance from paddington and lancaster gate tube station.

104,"Always again, but in a larger room.","We, 2 plus 1 small child, spent four nights in a double room.

The hotel is 20 walking minutes from Baker Street (Bus stop from the airport) or 5 from Paddington Station away.
10 to 15 min to Hyde Park NE where the sightseeing bus tours start.

Clean room and hotel, friendly staff and a relatively good breakfast (included) also for non-british taste. Means not only beans, ham and eggs but also a choice of cereals, toast, marmalade, ...

In case we plan another trip to London, we would very likely choose this hotel again, but would book a larger room; our double room was quite small (incl. a full bathroom).",4,2014,06,19

104,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I are very pleased with this hotel because of a few main reasons : 
1.the service staff are excellent! They are extremely polite and always smiling and making you feel welcome at any time of the day. They are genuine in their hospitality!
2. Everything is in extremely good repair lost brand new, furniture, shower faucets etc! 
3. The coffee and tea and biscuits supply are always very prompt and generous

104,Perect for an business over-night stop,"I stay in London at least once a week and this was my first time at Park Grand. The hotel was well located, the staff were very polite and welcoming. The hotel is reasonably priced and I would happily stay again.",4,2014,06,16
104,"Close to Paddington, Great Staff","I picked this hotel because it was close to Paddington Station and it was affordable. My visit was a quick in and out visit so I knew I wouldn't be spending too much time in the hotel. But, I was very impressed with the staff. My plans changed last minute and I would up getting to the hotel around 9:00 AM the day of check-in, the staff was great and found me a room, they even let me go grab breakfast.  That gave me a chance to shower, shave, and take a quick nap before my meetings that afternoon.  

The room was good sized, but the bathroom was small and tight to move around in. That is a minor quibble, compared to the rest of my experience.",4,2014,06,16
104,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND COUNTING,"I'm writing this review in the midst of a 4 night stay and I really cant imagine how my remaining two nights can get any worse.
1) I paid for two rooms(at the same rate), and my brother's comes with a fridge while mine does not. When quizzed, the staff simply said its the default room configuration and they couldn't do anything for me, short of giving me the option to leave food at the restaurant fridge.
2) The Internet connection is very, very poor. 
3) The hotel is way over-priced. Look up Tripadvisor, I have stayed in another nearby hotel with the same amenities for 20% of the prize. 
4) Could not even take a dump in peace! The toilet bowl is with one side touching the wall, and you have to angle yourself in a weird position to be able to do your business.
5) Halfway through a shower, I was interrupted by a member of the staff rather urgently. Seems like water from my shower was dripping into a room below me(for whatever reasons) and I was told to ""go easy"" on my shower. 
6) I have stayed in many hotels and this is definitely not a four-star hotel, even though it has been awarded with it. For example, the hotel doesn't provide toothbrushes!

Lastly, I must add that I booked the room through orbitz.com(which TA pointed me to). Though it stated that the prize was 4218 on TA, orbitz charged me $261 when the booking went through. Be careful hoof your bookings!",1,2014,06,15
104,Leisure in London,"It is the 1st hotel I have stayed in for ages in London that was reasonably priced and clean! It is set in a lovely street and its facilities are very good. My bathroom was very modern and clean.There is also a lovely dining area where people can enjoy a freshly cooked breakfast and where staff are around to help, should you need it.  It is ideal for anyone not wanting hussle and bussle of bigger hotels and its within five minutes walk, of some good restaurants.  Highly recommend the hotel and will stay there again on next visit.",5,2014,06,15
104,Good week end in London,"I stay at this h√≥tel With my family for Week .
It was Amazing. 
Reception team are very hospitable.
The room was good, comfortable and spacious, staff are extremely helpful and overall its been a good experience
I recommend this hotel",3,2014,06,14
104,Tiny room for price,"I booked at the last minute because I had been let down by previous place I'd booked so it was Hobson's choice.  ¬£785 for 6 nights far more than I would normally pay but accepted this because it was 4* rated.  My room was very small, in the basement and I found out that the advertised ""free breakfast"" didn't apply to this booking.  There was an over powering smell of air freshener in the room, corridors and lifts, so much so that it made me physically unwell.  The staff were very helpful when I asked for a change of room and provided one on 6th floor, even smaller, but the smell still persisted causing me to dry retch and have burning sensation in eyes and chest.  This room so small that I banged my my leg against bedside cabinet when going to toilet during the night and the bathroom also so small that the sink unit protruded across the shower entrance giving me another whack as I got out the shower.
Because of the air freshener smell I was offered a room in one of their sister hotels across the road but there was the same trouble as soon as I entered the foyer.  A very nice young man, Stan, checked around and ascertained all their hotels used the same contractor who used the same air fresheners so I cancelled the rest of my stay as it was becoming very difficult to breath in the environment.
The rooms advertised on Park Grand's website are the doubles and suites which look very nice and spacious but certainly are not representative of the narrow strips of single rooms.  I would not rate these 4*
The hotel is well situated, just five minutes from Paddington station and several bus routes and in a quiet area.  So a very mixed experience.",3,2014,06,14
104,Insatisfactory,"Roomservice simply forgotten. No new towels. Stressy, unfriendly receptionists. 98% Indian crew. Requested quiet room: result opposite breakfast room: kitchen noise and smells. Will not return nor recommend.",2,2014,06,13
104,A wonderful base in heart of london with high standard,"I really enjoyed staying here during my recent visit to london.

104,Birthday surpise.,I booked a room at the Park Grand as a surprise for my wife on her 60th birthday.We found the location of the hotel was excellent.The staff were friendly and very helpful.The club room we booked was spacious and extremely comfortable.We had a great weekend and would certainly use this hotel again.,5,2014,06,09
104,"Would only rate this a 3-star hotel, not 4.","My son and I stayed here in April and were somewhat disappointed with this place.  While the location is very convenient to Paddington Station, the room was extremely small and poorly maintained.  The windows looked like they had about 20 coats of paint on them, were difficult to open and the curtains were falling off the track.  We couldn't get the air conditioning to work and had to call maintenance.  Luckily they were able to get it started and it worked for the balance of our stay.  The towel ring in the bathroom was broken and unusable.  The calking in the bathroom was sloppy.  The vessel sink had been broken and patched.  I would have expected a 4-star hotel to replace a broken sink, not just patch it.  Despite the small room, I think with a little TLC this place could live up to its 4-star rating.  The staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel is walking distance to Paddington Station and several restaurants, the building is nice and the beds comfortable.  If a little more attention was paid to the details, it would go a long way.",3,2014,06,07
104,Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel, close to Paddington but in a quieter part of the area. Rooms are small (as is usual for London) and are air conditioned - essential at this time of the year.  I would definitely stay here again without hesitation.",4,2014,06,07
104,Close to Paddington,"Hotel is small but very good. It is very close to Paddington station where you will get direct express train to Heathrow. From Heathrow airport it to hotel it took me only 25 mins to reach. 

Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. I have reached hotel by 9:30 a.m and made a request for early check-in as I was travelling with my infant kid and they gave us a better room than what we have booked. They helped us in finding near by Indian restaurants and so.. 

There are 2 Indian restaurants near by and they serve food only from 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon. 

In each floor, after getting down from lift you have to climb 2 or 3 steps. so be prepared to pull your bags from the steps. 

Overall the room is very nice and comfortable. Heaters are provided even inside bathroom and even for bathroom floors.",4,2014,06,03
104,Nice place but needs more room,"I rented two rooms here one for my in laws and one for my wife and I. First I will say the place is clean and the staff were friendly. The location of the hotel was pretty nice as well. It's only 2.5 blocks from the tube and Paddington station. So it's convenient to get to other places. The biggest problem I had with the hotel was the room I got. I think they converted their attic space into rooms and it should not be built to accommodate two adults, perhaps one adult MAX. There simply wasn't room for me to pull out the chair from the consul table nor was there enough room for us to open the closet all the way without hitting the door arm. (see pictures). It was ridiculously small up there, not to mention the heat all the way up in the attic area. So if you get a 7th floor room change it immediately! I did not know only the rooms up there were that small. My in laws go a room on the 5th floor and it was much roomier. Had i known earlier i would've requested a change in room but since i already settled in i didn't feel like changing. Keep in mind if you do get the 7th floor the elevator DOES NOT take you up there. The elevator only takes you up to the 6th floor and you have to drag your luggage up the flight of stairs up to the 7th floor through very narrow steps. Lastly about the room on the 7th floor because it's so small the AC unit on the wall literally blows the air right into your face all night as you sleep. If you turn off the AC it gets way too hot up there and it was just a uncomfortable battle.",3,2014,06,02
104,overnight stay,"I have no experience of London hotels so the size of the room for the cost surprised me however it was close to Paddington Station, my number 1 requirement, quiet, clean, good facilities in the room despite the size. Staff were all pleasant.",4,2014,06,02
104,Nice place,"The location and outside appearance was beautiful.  The staff were fairly helpful but the room itself was ridiculously small for 3 people.  There was not enough room for 2 people to walk by each other with the layout that was given. We could not get into the desk drawers without moving furniture (so to use the hairdryer) or to make a cup of tea.  The picture online when booking the triple room was completely different from the reality of it all.  The guests next to us must have been a group of younger  lads- they were extremely loud and we had to call the front office to complain of the noise- which didn't make a difference.
Otherwise- the location was beautiful and the staff were nice.  Breakfast was very good.",3,2014,06,02
104,Thank You Park Grand London for a Wonderful Stay!,"This was our first trip to London, so we knew nothing about the city other than what we'd read.  We arrived at Park Grand to a friendly reception staff,and were given room 806 on the first floor! I was delighted to find that my"" deluxe double"" was actually a King size bed.  No, there was not a lot of room in the room after the bed, but the bed was comfortable and large, with a flat screen TV in front of the bed. The bathroom was modern and clean with an excellent shower and plenty of hot water. Our room was quiet, and the window opened to allow in fresh air. 
We also had the breakfast buffet daily.The selections were fresh and plentiful, and friendly servers supplied coffee and or tea. Being within walking distance of Paddington Station made it easy to get around London. There are also a lot of restaurants in the area the from Greek to a steak house.
The hotel staff was helpful with directions and getting around the city. They also loaned us a British converter to use during our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone needing a convenient and clean place to stay while visiting London.",5,2014,06,01
104,"Ideal location with attentive staff, friendly front desk team, comfortable rooms, and value for money - job done!","This was an ideal hotel for my short business trip. Working at Paddington business hub and having somewhere affordable is great, and not having to take the tube is a real bonus.
Front desk team are friendly and attentive, as was the team at the buffet breakfast; itself included in the price and of good quality.
Room was comfortable and quiet which as a regular traveller, is a 'must have' that some rather more expensive London hotels struggle to achieve.
I'd recommend the hotel and its staff to all you weary business folk!",4,2014,05,28
104,Easy place to reach.,"Lovey hotel near to the underground, we were lucky to park right in the car park with cost ¬£20 for the stay which is cheap for London, 10 min walk to the underground.
Stall at the hotel were friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean the only thing you could hear guests walking about in the room above, but we were so tired out from walking around London soon fell asleep!!!!!!!   Would stay here again.",4,2014,05,28
104,Staff make it happen,This is a hotel close to a main railway station and underground. It has character and excellent rooms. What males the hotel extra special is how the staff go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Have tried other hotels but they don't match this. Have now opened an account with the hotel.,5,2014,05,27
104,"Great location, great staff and very clean and comfortable.","I've been staying here on and off for around 6 months and only have good things to say about it.

I'm a business traveller and find this hotel perfect for my needs. The staff are friendly, attentive, efficient and always happy to help. I'd like to give special praise to Sakar, he alway has a warm welcome, calls to check I'm happy with the room and always asks if there's anything I need.

I find the hotel excellent value and quiet on a night which is important as my visit is for business so a good nights sleep is important. The free wifi is a real bonus, as is the excellent breakfast in the very clean restaurant.",4,2014,05,27
104,Good value for location,"We chose this hotel as it was central and gave us easy access to tube stations and was reasonably priced.  The location was excellent with helpful staff, a very comfortable bed and excellent breakfasts.  The only complaints we had was the lack of cupboard space and the very small bathrooms with nowhere to put toiletry bags. This wouldn't be a problem for people only staying a night or two.  We were however on an extended 8 week holiday, so had two very large suitcases.

104,Good value London hotel,"I chose this hotel because I needed one close to Paddington Station that was reasonably priced and gave the opportunity to travel to other areas of London.  The location was spot-on - in a small street running parallel to a busy road, but I was at the back so heard no road noise.  Loads of pubs and restaurants within 5 minutes walk.
Don't expect a big grand hotel - it is quite small with tiny little corridors weaving their way between the rooms.  My room was a good size but oddly shaped, but still had room for a double bed, desk, sofa and a large toilet/shower room.  Furnishings not the newest but adequate and very clean.
The WiFi was a bit problematically with frequent drop-outs, but since this was free I find it hard to complain and may have just been due to the location of my room.  Breakfast was good buffet stuff with cooked and continental to choose from.
On the whole, a pleasant experience and recommended if you want a reasonably priced hotel in London.",4,2014,05,23
104,Good Location - with helpful staff,"The location is very close to Paddington, which in London is always useful but if you want a breath of fresh air, Hyde Park is only a small walk away!

And for those with a need to clear their minds, there is a very pleasant easy walk to Kensington High st, etc and when we are working so hard we need to find these little moments!

The staff were very helpful and always courteous, a very pleasant place to stay and good value for money.",4,2014,05,23
104,Good choice,We were lucky and had a room upgrade so more space than I expected. Very good size for a London Hotel. Very good breakfast and all members of staff were friendly and helpful. I wish I had come across this hotel before!,5,2014,05,22
104,Great Value!,"Very happy with the price, standard of room and service generally was very friendly. Sakar on the front desk was very accommodating when we decided to stay another 3 nights and was able to carry the booking across with no fuss. We actually cancelled future pre-booked accommodation due to our satisfaction at this hotel over the first few nights and decided to stay on. Room was a good size especially for London and breakfast was great with individual plunger coffee a nice touch too. Will definitely stay again on our next trip to London.",5,2014,05,22
104,Good value hotel,"A good hotel in a good location. very near paddington station.
service was excellent.
Rooms are a bit small but for a business trip its fine
many restaurants within the
 area.
suggest to have at least bottled water in the rooms. ",5,2014,05,21
104,Great Staff!,Our flight came in early but they were able to check us in early as well allowing us to rest after a long trip!

104,Good value in the Centre of London,"We got a last minute deal, for a birthday weekend. The room was lovely clean and spacious. The shower was amazing. The bed was massive and comfy.

104,Lovely Hotel in a great Location,"The hotel is located 5 minute walk from Paddington station and is easy to find. We arrived around midday and they had a room ready for us so we had an early check in, usually expect to wait until 2pm, they also upgraded us to a quad room as I had requested which was great.
Staff are very friendly and helpful. the rooms are lovely and clean.",5,2014,05,19
104,A real bargain for London,Room was clean and bed was very  comfortable staff at reception very customer service oriented . very conveniant location 10 minute walk to paddington station where you can get the Heathrow express to airports as well as connections to all parts of London on underground. Several Restaurants and pubs in walking distance near paddington station.,4,2014,05,16
104,Good in parts,"My daughter booked this hotel for us as we were meeting in London to celebrate what was for me a special birthday.
I was apprehensive as it was not somewhere I would have chosen, that said first impressions were favourable with a pleasant reception at check in. Our room was beautifully clean but very very small,it did however have everything one needed (except bathrobes but these were given on request) I had asked for a quiet room and it was OK until the room above became occupied with what sounded like a heard of elephants, it was particularly annoying when they returned in the early hours of the morning waking us up. Soundproofing is inadequate and things could be done to improve this. Breakfast is served in a pleasant room and the staff were all friendly and attentive, The location is convenient with buses and tubes nearby. 
Usual breakfast fare but all OK.",3,2014,05,13
104,Basement Room 019,Albeit the room was very clean and above average for London Hotels my sleep was disturbed by the fact that I had the rainwater pipe was in a riser within the wall next to the bed and when it rained you could hear the water flowing and dripping and it was extremely annoying. This was the only criticism and If the pipe was lagged it would cure the problem,4,2014,05,10
104,We'll be back!,"Nice and clean outside. Nice location close to metro/bus stations. Close to Hyde Park.
Room slightly to narrow. Bathroom too. By 2 feet.
You cab hear late guests in the corridors, closing their doors, walking in their rooms.
Very good beds, convenient bathroom.
Generous brekfast. A treat.
Sight from the window (facing other windows) was not a concern: we were out all day long.
Price could be 10-20% cheaper.",4,2014,05,08
104,Great location,The Park Grand was the perfect location for our 2 day stay in London. Very easy walk from Paddington Station. A walk through close by Hyde or Kensington Park takes you to some of London's iconic tourist locations. Tried a couple of the local pubs for dinner - good meals at reasonable prices. Room was small but not too bad for the price.,4,2014,05,06
104,birthday treat from husband!,"Had a lovely time here at the park grand, ideally located for Hyde park, and easy to reach via tube. Arrived early evening, was upgraded to a room on two floor, so to speak, chocs on pillow, fruit and soft drinks in room. Husband also pre-ordered wine, which was there on arrival.Staff were very helpful and pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble. would stay again, only downside would be to have larger area for bar, but we only there one night, and we went to a pleasant Italian restaurant round the corner, nice food. Also breakfast in morning was more than ample.",4,2014,05,06
104,Very good location and attention,"Hotel has a very good location, but the soundproofing must be improved. Hotel is very clean. The rooms are something small. Staff attention is also very good. Breakfast can be improved. Wifi avalaible in rooms is a success",4,2014,05,05

104,Recommend to stay here. Great location! ,"Great location - 5 minute walk from Paddington tube station. Very welcoming, porter at main entrance who helped with luggage and delivered to room. Friendly and helpful staff. Very clean room. Quite spacious. Bathroom a little cramped but had a bath/shower. Free shower gels, shampoo etc. We stayed for 2 nights and sheets and towels were still changed. Tea and coffee facilities. Big flat screen TV in room. Some pubs and eateries near by by tube station. Would stay here again. Good price for central London. Would recommend! ",5,2014,05,01
104,Good business hotel,"Great location (literally a five minute walk from Paddington), reasonably priced, generally very clean, but cramped single rooms. Fine for business. Not too hot on the restaurant but there are plenty of eating choices nearby.",4,2014,04,30
104,Pretty good,Staff were very helpful. Our family room included a sofa bed for our young children with tv & kitchenette. Our mezzanine room upstairs was modern & the superking bed very comfortable. Modern bathroom clean & simply decorated. Had everything we needed for our 1 night stay. Only thing I didn't like was there was a mild smell of damp when we first went into the room. Good stay overall.,4,2014,04,30
104,Brilliant ,"Me and a few work colleagues stayed here for one night (Saturday 26th April) as a central base for our business visit to the Great British Care Awards. 

The welcome has warm, the check in was swift. 

Staff made our life so easy. Booking taxis and carrying luggage for the female guests. 

Room was compact and had everything we needed. Definitely will use for all London based company events and a special mention to the bar man Stan who took time out of his day to chat to us. 

Lovely place. Great people. ",5,2014,04,28
104,hard to be enthusiastic,"Daniel on checkout was great. But that couldn't make up for the rundown room. Needed new mattress and chair was very stained. However, room was very quiet despite being next to lift.  Would only recommend to the budget concious.",3,2014,04,27
104,Great hotel but rooms with very thin walls!,"I was travelling on a business trip and wanted a budget friendly hotel near by Paddington Station.
The location was really good, 5 minutes walking. The hotel was very clean with modern decorations, with a great price!
I booked a single room, but upon arrival i was upgraded to a larger room, which was very much appreciated as i have seen how small the single rooms are.
I didn't try the breakfast, so can't comment on that.
The only comment that i have here, is that i could hear every step in the corridor as well as the nearby rooms! The rooms have very thin walls, passing all kind of sounds!",4,2014,04,25
104,"Fantastic stay, wonderful staff!","Travelled here with family and stayed for 2 nights. The rooms are small but perfectly equipped with toiletries, hair dryer, tea and coffee and heating/air conditioning. The staff could not do enough to ensure our stay was perfect.
The location of the hotel is also good- Paddington station is a 5 minute walk alongside restaurants, fast food restaurants and convenience stores.
Really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend!",5,2014,04,23
104,a stay not to forget!,"Sakar at the reception was the best I got! Could help me out with anything I asked. Incredible, upon my arrival he could even print  out my invoices I lost since my last stay in this wonderful hotel. 
Super, Sakar, ""thataboy!""
Without me asking he gave me a wonderful room I enjoyed at first when I came in.
All is fine, Am staying for a couple of days and truly ... I'm excited> Just that good warm welcome makes it all.
Good work Sakar. Keep up this kind of spirit
Note: I'm on business trip!",5,2014,04,22
104,2 night stay,"Stayed here for two nights in April with my mum. 

Overall, the stay was good, the hotel is in a great location, 5 minute walk from Paddington Station, so very easy to get about London.  Round about the station there is a good selection of restaurants and bars.  

The room was clean although small, but for what we were looking for (somewhere to sleep) it done us fine. There was a bit of outside noise from the traffic but as it is on a main road that is to be expected and didn't bother us although we did need to close the window at night. 

I had read on here before my stay that people were having problems with the WIFI in the hotel, that it didn't work or had a poor signal. I used the WIFI while I was there and experienced no problems with it. 

The only issue I had was that I booked directly through the hotels website as it was stated that if you done that you got the breakfast free of charge. This was not the case as when I arrived they stated that I hadn't booked breakfast.  I advised that it was on there website that it was complimentary. It turns out as I had booked one of their sale items it was not actually included but definitely feel that is should have been more clearer on their website. This was disappointing as I could have booked other hotels cheaper, and also I could have booked this hotel through Late Rooms cheaper at the time of booking had I known this, but didn't because of this. We paid the extra ¬£40 for breakfast for the two days but this was a lot of money to be paying out when you were visiting London on an already tight budget!! It definitely needs to be clearer on their website!

The staff in general were polite and helpful (especially the breakfast staff who were very cheery for the time of morning!!) and the hotel can also keep your cases after checkout which was very handy as our flight home was not until 9pm so you don't need to wheel your suitcase about London all day!",4,2014,04,21
104,Not what we paid for...,"We booked a Superior Triple room that was supposed to have a Double bed and a single bed or 3 single beds in early November 2013 for our stay in mid April 2014.

I got an e-mail just two days before our arrival that they had problem with my credit card and that I had to provide them with my information again to keep my reservation. I have had no problem with my cc-card anywhere else. They wanted me to provide my information via a regular e-mail. First of all, that‚Äôs not a secure way to handle your cc-information! So I called them and everything was ok. I also told them that we would check in late, after 19:00, so that they would give our room away. It was not a problem I was promised.

Upon arrival everything was ok, even if the receptionist was a bit rude and did not inform us where we could have our included breakfast or when it was served. We hade to ask‚Ä¶

When we got up to our assigned room (#603) it was a Double room! We got back down and pointed out that it must have been a mistake. The quick reply was just that we had booked a double room and that was what we had got. I pointed out that we had booked a triple room. The receptionist started arguing that we had booked a double room. I had to show her my confirmation that said clearly a triple room. 

Then we got a lot of different explanations, from something with maintenance to that they had a water leak in the triple room that we should have gotten.  It was no manager on duty and they could not give us the room that we had booked and already paid for (as they charge you in full as soon as you check in!!!).

The sofa bed wasn‚Äôt mad up and we had no towels for the third person in our party. They sent someone of up to make the sofa bed. The first girl didn‚Äôt want to finish the conversation and sent the other guy working that night to work things out. New explanations and the room we got was in fact a triple room he said. I argued back that it was not the description on their own webpage etc.

Not a happy start on our vacation and we gave up and got up for a nights sleep. In the next morning we talked to the manager and was promised to change room to a room with two beeds (#130).  We got out for the day and the room was made up when we got back at night. It was ok, but one of the floor tiles in the bathroom was cracked and should be replaced. The small double bed is very firm and you can smell when they start preparing for breakfast, as you are just right above the breakfast area. Are you sensitive to odors this might not be the room for you.

The breakfast is in the basement and it‚Äôs ok, but nothing more. But they could change the table cloths a bit more.  Somebody spilled juice or something like that and therefore the table cloth was wet when we sat down. The next morning, the same table cloth was still there, but with a lots of dried stains on it, including the spilled juice for yesterday. It was also silverware that had a lot of stains on them and some dried food that had not been washed away by the dishwasher.. 

Upon check out we asked for what compensation we would be given as we had problems with our room the first night. It was nothing singed in on our file and the receptions could not give us anything, as he had not checked us in and there was no manager there at the moment when we checked out.  I had asked for compensation the night we checked in and also the next day when we changed our room.

I‚Äôd say that this is not a 4-star hotel! If it is important to you that all in your party gets a proper bed and not a sofa bed I‚Äôd recommend you to stay elsewhere.",2,2014,04,21
104,Would not recommend,"I stayed here for 3 days and nights with my mother, teenager daughter and her friend. We stayed in a duplex 'suite' which cost a small fortune! The downstairs part of the 'suite' had a pull-out bed which I think is hideous considering what I paid for the room while the upstairs part had a proper double bed. We only had one extremely small wardrobe between the four of us to store our clothing. The bathroom is the smallest hotel bathroom that I ever seen in my life, You literally couldn't swing a cat in the room! In saying that, the room was immaculately clean and serviced daily. What frustrated me the most about my stay was what I would call an error in payment. When I arrived I paid the full amount there and then - ‚Ç¨980! However, the hotel also froze the same amount of money from my back account, which, almost a week later, I still have not received back. As a result, it put my balance into a negative amount and also prevented some of my direct debits from happening which, aside from the embarrassment of this, I will have to incur some penalties. I am absolutely fuming about this as I have no access to MY money thanks to the hotel. When I told the staff about this they tried to blame my bank but my bank assured me that this was an error on the hotel's part. Also, on checking out, they tried to charge us for some drinks we had at the bar which we had already paid for in cash!!!! Yet another embarrassing moment. I definitely would not stay here again.",2,2014,04,21
104,Good place to tour london from,"We had stayed there for 5 days. The staff was helpful. There was initially only a basement room available and they gave us a bigger room as soon as it was available the next day. The place is abt a 5 minute walk from the paddington tube station. Wifi was available. And the breakfast , while not complimentary, was delicious and I definitely recommend it. The heathrow express train also ends in paddington station which is nearby. All in all it's a pretty good place to stay whether the occasion be business or pleasure.    ",5,2014,04,19
104,What a rude reception!,"I stayed here on business for one night.  Upon arrival I went to the desk to check in and was asked for my passport, I explained I was British and didn't have it with me.  I was told that it was the law to be carrying a passport, naturally I disagreed and argued otherwise....  After 5 minutes I suggested that he should ask the police or the manager which he did - no apology was received but he did he say I wouldn't need it!  
That aside, the hotel was in a good location, the bed and room were of a good standard and the shower room was clean.
I hope this was helpful.",3,2014,04,18
104,Beware Bait and Switch,"Just returned from my first trip to London. Had looked for boutique hotel in the Hyde Park area. Thought I had found it with this hotel, so made reservations for 5 nights. Unfortunately, the hotel contacted me via email while I was enroute to London from the USA to inform me they were having some refurbishing done and would be transferring me to a different hotel. I did not receive this notice until I landed in London and found my way to their hotel. Oddly, many guests were being checked in while my reservation had been transferred. I did not realize this hotel is part of the Shaftesbury chain, which owns several hotels and apparently routinely transfers guests to other hotels. Yes, the other hotel they transferred me to was in the area, but it was further away from Paddington Station and I do not believe was as nice. The woman at the desk at this hotel was less than cordial and acted as if I was receiving a benefit when she informed me they would give me free breakfast at the hotel to which they had transferred my reservations although that was part of my reservation terms at this hotel. Should I return to London, this hotel and the entire Shaftesbury chain will be off my list. It was unsettling at best to land in London to find my reservations had been transferred. I find it unrealistic they only realized they would have to transfer my reservations after it was too late for me to cancel them. Two big thumbs down. I will be contacting this chain directly to let them know of my grievances as well.",1,2014,04,17
104,First stay in London.,"We booked this hotel for two nights whilst Visiting London. On arrival 2.15pm, We were told that our room was not ready and We would have to wait.... 3.10pm arrived and we finally received our key! We had travelled for 4 hours that morning and being told our room wasn't ready AFTER their 2pm check-in policy was even more exhausting! 

The room was very small but clean. There was a very overpowering smell of perfumed air fresher which took your breath away, luckily the window could open and I had my inhaler to hand. Walls are quiet thin, we could hear the gentleman next door talking away until gone 11.30pm. 

Arrived back at the hotel that evening to find our door key would not work - back to reception we went. 

After the first day/night, the stay was pleasant and in a good, quiet location, not far from some fantastic sites. ",3,2014,04,17
104,Great hotel fantastic staff,"I initially booked a double room via bookings dot com . I but my room was changed from one hotel to another , I wasn't very happy . But the guy at reception mr sakar was very helpful , checking in was very fast but again I wasn't happy with my room and asked for a better room , mr demelo the manager gave me a room just the way I like it . Staff are brilliant here , rooms are superbly clean , location is great and both staff mr sakar and demelo is outstanding . 
Thank you very much guys , my stay in London been superb choosing this hotel and served by these fantastic staff . 
Thank you .",5,2014,04,16
104,Very good location,"This hotel is very convenient, very good location in london, close to Padington station and to the central line, in a very nice area, you can go walking to Nothing hill

Nice rooms but a little noisy

Very good breakfast with a special price if we book in advance",5,2014,04,15
104,"Location, location, location.","Our stay at the Park Grand London Hyde Park was pretty much what we expected. While I find the price outrageous, that is London. We have gone for slightly cheaper hotels in London and felt like we were staying in Hostels, so this was an upgrade. The staff was friendly and efficient. The breakfast was fine, the room clean and comfortable. My concern would be if there is no AC in the summer months, while the room would get rather warm on the 4th floor. The best part of the hotel was it's convenience and location. I would stay there again.",4,2014,04,13
104,Storage my baggage,"i visited the hotel a week ago, the room was clean and nice . the issue that upset me , was the storage time the reception guy approved me.
the day i checked out my flight schedule for 1155pm.
i asked the reception to leave my luggage till 10pm, and he said he can make it only till 8pm.
any logic with that schedule?????",3,2014,04,13
104,The Duplex Room !!! go for it !!!,"We had stayed earlier in their Park Grand Paddington Hotel and were delighted with our stay. This time we chose the Park Grand Hyde Park and had booked the Duplex Room. Because of some unfavorable comments changed our room to Triple. Though ok, it was on the back side. We requested the Duty Manager Mr.Ignatius to give us a better room, and we found a gem. It's very comfortable and spacious. Superb. The bathroom is a bit small, that's ok. After all it's London.One negative is the confusion about their breakfast policy. The company has many websites and it does get a bit confusing. Here again Mr.Ignatius came to our rescue.The breakfast too is hot and enough. We would stay here again. And thank you Park Grand Hyde Park & Mr.Ignatius.",5,2014,04,13
104,Totally average hotel advertised as more.,"Although the hotel is fine enough for a one night temporary stay, I will say that in the event I had to stay longer, I would have been very disappointed. The rooms are tiny and loud, additionally they seem to have an old musty smell to them that makes the room seem dirty.  There is no hair dryer, refrigerator, and the bed linens had hair on them.  Also, I was charged for the room AND my card run prior to arrival to insure my stay - though I am assured the latter charge will be removed, it's still showing at this time. The air conditioning that is advertised doesn't seem to work that I can tell. Overall, though the price is OK for London, the location decent, and the staff fairly accommodating - I don't believe I would recommend this room and shall not stay here again if I return. ",3,2014,04,08
104,Very surprised at how great my stay was!,"Booked this hotel for a short stay as it was convenient to where I was due to be. 

The hotel is nicely decorated and modern. Wifi is free. I did not avail of breakfast. 

Not sure if the hotel gave me an upgrade but my room was amazing. It was over 2 floors with the bathroom and kitchenette/living room downstairs and the bedroom upstairs. The 2 floors weren't completely separated as such which gave the room the feel of being very large. 

Room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. The in room facilities were great and tastefully decorated. 

Staff were accommodating of my early arrival and were helpful. 

Recommended!",5,2014,04,06
104,Excellent Business Hotel at Paddington,"The hotel is at close proximity to Paddington station quite useful if you are using the Heathrow Express. The highlight of the hotel is its super friendly and responsive restaurant staff who are constantly available all around to cater to your needs and are very quick in their service. The Duplex suite is a big motivation and a delight to stay and I want to sincerely thank the Front Office staff, Ms. Patricia, for introducing me to such a mood lifting accommodation. Typically in London, rooms are quite compact and the Duplex suite just made my stay so memorable. 

Patricia at the front office made the hotel experience so very nice. 

Rates booked on internet are very compelling.",5,2014,04,05
104,Park Grand is an absolute quality gem of a hotel at a reasonable price.,"My recent stay at the Park Grand Hotel proved to be a wonderful experience. Quite frankly, being accustomed to good value and infrastructure in the USA, I had anticipated less from this botique Hotel that I had sourced on line, but was unexpectedly surprised. This accommodation was well located, had first class staff, a very clean and appointed room, complimentary tea, coffee and shortbread within the abode together with free wifi and a breakfast option. Full marks on all fronts. Pleasant is an understatement. ",5,2014,04,04
104,Surprisingly good,My booking was cancelled when I did not know. But the guy in the hotel called Sakar still get me a room. It was a better room with same price. This really saved my life since most hotels were fully booked! Best service! Thank you Sakar! ; D,4,2014,04,02
104,Great hotel in great location for paddington station.,"Really good stay in this hotel only downside was a fire alarm at 7am and the again at 8am!!

Good breakfast, good location and great value for money.

Will definitely stay again when in London on business or with the family.",4,2014,04,01
104,Family stay in London,"Nice hotell near Paddington station. We had a quiet 4-bed room to the back. Suite small room and bathroom, but good standard and cleaning. Choose not to have breakfast at the hotell. Lots to choose from at the station.",4,2014,04,01
104,"Convenient location,  great staff but not very clean!","Stayed here for 2 nights in March 2014. The location is great, staff very helpful & cheerful and breakfast adequate. The room wasn't very clean though and in the need of some urgent maintenance  (old toothpaste marks on the bedside table, cracked tiles and decayed wood in the bathroom). Also we only found out at the check in that the room we have booked was not available for us and instead of a duplex suite we were accommodated in a quad room with 2 double beds - which was not a big problem for us as we only stayed for 2 nights - but can feel a bit crowded if staying longer as both the room & bathrooms are quite small for 4 people. Overall experience was ok. This is not a hotel to avoid - perhaps just more attention to details and safety (cracked tile) should be paid.",3,2014,03,31
104,Definitely not a 4 star,"Got a piece of luggage that you checked in on your flight? Planning on staying in a single...guess what - you don't fit. This place is a shoebox. It's extremely tiny. 

Pros: it's location is near a station, it's staff is friendly; they have instant coffee in the room for you and the bed (though small - I'm 5'7"") is comfortable. The best thing about this hotel is the price...but make sure you're just coming in with a Carry-on and nothing more. 

Cons: it's not a 4-star hotel, the room is very small; the bathroom is even smaller - if you're an american that weighs more than 180 pounds - good luck; it's very noisy especially in the morning. All the doors shut automatically and the setting that they have it at slams within an inch of clothing so if you're planning on sleeping in past 7:30 - good luck. Lastly, and why I don't call it a 4-star, no ice AND no water. You want water - pay for it at the ""bar"" downstairs. A/C doesn't really cool and the windows in the basement don't really lock. Yup...you read that right. ",2,2014,03,30
104,Tidy and efficient,"As a solo traveller on my last three nights of a 3 week journey, I was ever so happy with the extra comfortable beds, the quick check in and the ease of which you can easily stroll to a multitude of travelling options and cuisines.  

Vintage pubs, lots of shopping options, a ten minute walk to Hyde park, and efficient front desk service that was helpful with an array of questions I'd had, completed my satisfaction with this tidy little property.   

It was a last second booking, but I'm ever so happy I took a gamble and chose this property.   
",4,2014,03,27
104,Duplex Suite,"I had the deplux suite where four people can be located, the bed downstairs was good, so we took terms in changing each day, i most say the bed upstaris is proberly the worst bed i have ever slept on, the room was very small. the breakfast was decent with alot to choose from. great location. service decent, please note that the hotel upon arrival locks 170¬£ from your bank account for one month, or in my case they did.",2,2014,03,26
104,Very nice hotel in a great location,"We stayed seven nights here and were quite pleased with the room, the friendly staff and the location near Paddington Station (both for the Heathrow Express and the Underground).  The room was as big, if not bigger, than any other hotel where we have stayed on other trips to London and quite clean and comfortable.  We always plan on using the room for sleeping when we visit, therefore, the size was more than adequate, especially considering the price, staff and cleanliness.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,03,23
104,Wonderful Stay,"The staff was warm and inviting. The hotel was the perfect location for our stay; minutes from the Paddington tube stop. Requests were met with complete satisfaction. The bed was comfortable and the complimentary tea, coffee and cookies were welcomed. We would certainly book again.",4,2014,03,23
104,"Great hotel, friendly staff!",Hotel location was great. We were within walking distance to Paddington Station and the tube stations. The room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The only negative was the tiny bathroom.,5,2014,03,21
104,This is a good hotel,"This hotel did what many others in the same price bracket in the same area claim to do on their websites and fail to do, usually on several counts.....and you don't find out until you stay. Here my expectations were exceeded. The staff at every point were obliging, efficient and very friendly. The bedroom and ensuite shower room were spacious, spotlessly clean, in a perfect state of repair, and generously equipped with everything from biscuits to shampoo. Breakfast was good value and iof a quality far higher than in many larger and more expensive places.",4,2014,03,21
104,Very nice and comfortable,"Got a free upgrade to the top floor. Very nice room with a pretty good view. Good breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Good location near to paddington station which is very handy for Heathrow airport and basically anywhere in the city centre via tube. Would certainly be willing to book again. Also a reasonable price, especially when comparing to other local hotels.  ",5,2014,03,20
104,Great hotel for families,"Great location, suite is awesome for family and very resonable compared to other hotel in area.

Front desk staff was very helpful and always willing to help.

Breakfast was not included in our package therefore we cannot comment about it.room was big and very spacious.
",5,2014,03,19
104,Good apart from one point,"The duration of stay was very good, in regards to all aspect. Romm cleanness,services, location. The only thing that I consider very negative was the interrupted internet services. As if disconnect after one minute of disuse and you need to log in again after one minute of disuse. This makes it impossible to recieve calls on  Viber or Tange",4,2014,03,18
104,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here in a duplex room for 4 people (all girls) very easy to find our way to/from underground. Room was very clean and modern. All staff very friendly and helpful especially reception desk. Breakfast is great , do not miss the breakfast
Hopefully going back next month for my husbands birthday? As long as we can get a good rate again?
Fabulous!!!!! :-)",5,2014,03,16
104,Very Good Location and Comfortable,"I like the location which is near Paddington.  Staff were friendly, and really helpful and thoughtful.  Room is a bit small, but clean, bed is very comfortable, which is important.  Generally well-equipped for travellers, though you got to bring your full set of toiletries.  FOC wireless is great.  Will stay there again if I need to be there.

Negatives: Checking of malfunctioning lights and fridge should be more proactive, rather than wait for room guest to call for service.  Lift is narrow, staircase and corridors quite narrow and small.  Doors are not sound-proof, which affected customer experience when some inconsiderate guests chatted at length at the corridor during evening times.",4,2014,03,10
104,Excellent location and price,"Stayed in the Park Grand London Hyde park for one night, very good location, 5 minutes from Paddington and very good price for that location.
Clean and comfortable bed, with free wifi and very friendly stuff.
Recommend it for a short business or pleasure stay in London",4,2014,03,09
104,Noise,"Do not stay in room 705, the lift shaft is in the very small bathroom/shower/toilet.

Also as this room is on the seventh floor every time you turn on the water taps a noisy pump kicks in-as the pressure is needed to supply water so Hugh up.

Comfortable bed breakfast too expensive at ¬£15.00!!!!",3,2014,03,06
104,Park Grand,"Great people, staff were awesome, internet slow and unreliable for anything but email but rooms nice and food excellent. Rooms not huge but more than adequate and very comfy.

Fabulous location, 5 mins to Paddington Station and the underground, Little Venice round the corner, would definitely visit again for both business and leisure.

Staff very friendly and helpful, they seem to smile all the time which is nice to see, even if some of them are Arsenal fans lol.  Nothing they wont do for you.",5,2014,03,06
104,very good stay but don't work from the hotel using Internet!,"The room was a good size and very clean .Lots of staff very helpful and friendly.Especially reception and breakfast 
 Very handy as only 5 mins walk from Paddington station so you can get around everywhere on the tube.But I worked from the hotel as one of my meeting was cancelled. The internet speed (Wi-fi or Ethernet , they have both ) was shockingly slow. Inpossible to work in the these conditions, A shame as the rest is perfectly fine Good value for money, despite my first impression. would stay again , but not for business unless they fixe their slow internet issue.",4,2014,03,05
104,"Fine accomodations, courteous staff, convenient location",Stayed two nights in a single room. Room was clean yet small. Decent standard for the price/location. Good breakfast (you pay extra.) Very conveniently located near Paddington Station. Many restaurant choices nearby.,4,2014,03,04
104,Very nice stay,"The rooms are a good size and very clean and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Very handy as only 5 mins walk from Paddington station so you can get around everywhere on the tube. Good value for money, despite my first impression. would stay again.",4,2014,03,04
104,"wonderful stay, staff very attentive, we're in good hands","this is our second stay in the last five weeks to stay at a park grand hotel collection and I do not have second thoughts in booking or staying at Park Grand Hyde Park where we stayed this time nor at Park Grand London Paddington where we stayed last month.  The staff are friendly, courteous, and very attentive.  I always feel very pampered.  The rooms are clean, very functional, (great for business and leisure travellers). The beds are so comfortable. Great hot and cold breakfast selection   Park Grand Hyde Park's location is excellent, 5 mins to Paddington station and about 15-20 min to Oxford Street. I know that I'm always in good hands when I stay at this hotel or the other Park Grand.",5,2014,03,02
104,Great Stay,"Our 2nd visit to the Hotel.  Excellent accommodation once more clean and very comfortable we even had an 'upstairs"" area with another TV and small kitchen area ideal for 3 adults. Breakfast plenty of choice and plenty of it.  Staff efficient and friendly,  Left luggage facility an added bonus. Excellent value,",5,2014,02,28
104,"Despite our first impression, it was a good stay","The night we arrived, we got a very small room in the basement, with a door to the backyard that let the cold air in. It was very late, so we slept there. 

The next morning we complained about the poor state the room was in, and asked for a change. They gave us the key to a room in the upper floor, bigger than the first one, and much better maintained. The room we had paid for. It was very clean and comfortable, with enaugh space to leave our luggage around and even a little couch.

The staff was always very attentive and nice, with special mention to Ishanti.

The location is very good, with several Tube stations around and close to the city centre.",4,2014,02,28
104,Great stay - However small rooms and thin walls.,"We came to the park grand possibly a little over optimistic. Now don't get me wrong, if youre planning on staying in London for a couple of nights, with the right price this place would be excellent. However don't get to excited by the ""grand"" name.

I had a lovely couple of nights in the hotel, although the paper thin walls meant that you could literally hear people walking up the stairs, or next door getting up in the night for water. Also the size of the room was a little disappointing personally however I can imagine to the right person it would be considered endearing. 

The staff were lovely and helped out when they could, and the cleaners did a great job.

All in all, very lovely place, however you may need a little luck with the right room neighbors during your stay.",3,2014,02,27
104,We wish to say a very BIG THANK YOU to everyone involved with our recent stay at Park Grand London Hyde Park,"We wish to say a very BIG THANK YOU to everyone involved with our recent stay at Park Grand London Hyde Park

We are amazed.  It is so fantastic, at last, to discover that our faith has been restored by a Company and Hotel who have put CARING, PROFESSIONALISM and a CUSTOMER COMES FIRST policy, Back into Hotel Stays in UK.

Please see my honest complaint on LATEROOMS.COM for MERCURE SPA BRISTOL, for CHRISTMAS just gone. 

From our first call to Shaftesbury Hotels to enquire for our Anniversary Break to Leaving Park Grand London Hyde Park yesterday, we were treated with 100% respect and received the best care, food and made to feel relaxed by every member of staff.

Yes, the Continental and Full English breakfast may have consisted of the same selection as most UK hotels, but the difference is that the food has Flavour, Quality and the care and expertise taken in preparation and cooking was so obvious. The Freshly Brewed Coffee is just delicious.

Oops A simple oversight of taking the first of 2 day's very nice soap supply was naughty, but on returning to our room later on day 2, everything had been restored to its full compliment.

Here we are 2 months later of my complaint to Bristol Mercure and Spa, and not even a reply from the General Manager or Head Office.

This matters not as we are HAPPY and feel very relaxed after our stay Park Grand London Hyde Park

Many thanks again to Shaftesbury Hotel Group and all staff at the Grand.

Marina and Derek Shenton.",5,2014,02,27
104,New and clean,"The hotel is new and clean and its location it is very good: close to the London Tube and other important streets to visit.

The room is very comfortable and the bed is one of the best I've found to sleep. The bathroom is clean and new as the rest of the room. 

The service is very attentive and kind and always oriented to satisfy the needs of the guests.",4,2014,02,27
104,Refreshing Stay,"We were pleasantly surprised with the accommodations.  With our stay hitting the summer heat-wave in London, an air conditioned room was a bonus.  The room was clean, and pleasantly furnished and the staff were great.  We will definitely be visiting again.",5,2014,02,24
104,Great hotel,"I had booked this hotel for my 5th anniversary to surprise my wife. As p≈Çanned everything went good. The staff were very helpful and friendly.Rooms were just amazing.It was decorated exactly for a newly wed couple. My wife was surpised. I should talk about the food , food was amazing.We had a champaign bottle and a flower bouque given to my wife by the staff . We really had a winderful time. I recommend this hotel to all other guests to visit it once.",5,2014,02,24
104,Nice and clean.,"Nice stay on a nice hotel, verry clean rom and fine people working there. Hotel to recomend. Short walk to underground, train station and bus stop. Nice restaurants with good food in 5 min. area. All in all verry good place to stay.",4,2014,02,24
104,"Tiny, cold and paper thin walls!!","My husband and I stayed for one night as we were celebrating his birthday. We were looking for a hotel at a reasonable price and not too far away from Hyde Park... Well... The room was meant to be a deluxe double room! It was tiny, the duvet didn't quite fit the bed so I was cold especially as there was a gap in the window.. Which rattled all night! We had no view, only the side wall of the building behind and the air con systems below our window. The bed was small and far too soft and barely big enough for 2! There was only one bedside table and no space to move around the bed! Being 8 months pregnant this was not ideal! I had to side step around the bed each time I wanted to get up - ensuring I didn't hit my head on the over sized tv attached to the wall!! 
We could hear every word from the rooms above and next to us and were extremely upset when 'house keeping' came knocking at 9am despite the 'do not disturb' sign and the fact we did not have to check out until midday! We did not stay for breakfast! The shower was really nice though, although the towels provided did not cover either of us.. Oh and the sink was blocked!
The nearest station is Paddington! I'de advice tube as not many taxis seemed to travel down past the hotel! 
Overall-I would not stay here again! ",3,2014,02,24
104,Not a business hotel,"Although we were very lucky to get a duplex room with fridge and microwave when booking for a club, I have to say that it was pretty quirky. If you expect peace and quiet, this hotel is probably not for you. As the building is fairly old (obviously), the floor boards and stairs (in the duplex and on the left side of hotel) creak loudly under every step. Forget sleeping in as the maids (and guests) will be running up and down those all morning long. Instead of a double bed we had two twin beds pushed together and although it's pretty typical for Europe, this particular bed in room 308 had one mattress firm and rather new and the other one soft and bumpy/springy, so let's just say that my husband and I had to take turn to sleep well. Positive side: Great shower with strong pressure, wide enough even if bathroom was small (but fonctional) with heated floors! 
The staff was extremely nice, polite and efficient. The breakfast was comparable to any 4 star hotels such as Hilton/Mercure around this area. (Eggs, bacon, sausage, veggies, pastries, fruits and yogurts etc...) The small loung/bar area was quaint, and snacks and drinks were a plus in the evening. But it has a fantastic location too with plenty of fabuous world class or casual restaurants around. Hyde Park is a 7-10min walk max which is great and Paddington 4-5min.
My title is not a business hotel because even if it says free high speed broadband, it's actually a very slow wifi that barely lets you send emails. We thought it was because everybody was using it in the evening but as we were jetlagged, we tried it in the middle of the night, and it was not any better. It was like being back to dial up times if that... I asked about the ethernet connexion and they brought me a cable and said I might get better bandwidth but I got none. Only poor wifi. We had to shorten our stay and go to the Hilton nearby because of it. I guess you get what you pay for. So for families is cheap, decent and very well located but otherwise it's just not for business travelers.",3,2014,02,23
104,Fix the windows please!,"As a regular at the Shaftesbury group of hotels I was upgraded to a duplex room on arrival. My initial delight was soon tempered when i realised that the bay windows didn't fit properly and i could hear people talking outside as well as the considerable road noise from Westbourne Terrace. Luckily it wasn't too cold as a nice breeze was coming through the same route. All these points were raised with reception to no avail. Offers of wine etc never materialised. Okay i got a very good price last minute, but the poor sleep quality changed my mind on a second night booking, that together with the price tag. ¬£120 for poorly fitting single glazed windows. Not for me with this particular Shaftesbury hotel. Breakfast is decent enough, but the smallish room could get very busy!",3,2014,02,23
104,""" lots of joy on my anniversary""","I booked this hotel few weeks ago with my wife on our first anniversary on their romance package . I was surprised with the room service , amenities,  size of my room and the way they made my room . Just brillaint and price is reasonable too being at the westend . Hotel is great , staff are very helpful , my wife loved the shower and soft bath towel . Breakfast was yummy too . So I will recommend this hotel to my friends . Its been great stay .",5,2014,02,21
104,Great all around!,The staff was very helpful and breakfast was excellent. I recommend staying here. Rooms are a bit small but for London they are average size +. Location was great. Only a short walk to the paddington tube and a couple blocks from some greT restaurants and English pubs. ,4,2014,02,21
104,Cracking hotel with an excellent service,"We recently spent a couple of nights at park grand Hyde park was very pressed with the hotel and service . Accommodation was very good , our room was perfectly acceptable size , spotless clean and very modern . The hotel does have a boutique feel and staff were outstanding .we had a breakfast in the morning and it was high quality . The location is excellent exploring 5 mins away from paddington station .

the hotel is very well presented,stylish and spotlessly clean.we reserved a double room and we were upgraded to room with sofa bed .

we arrived well before check in time but staff was able to do early check in for us.we felt very welcoming .breakfast was yummy and plenty of option to eat.

overall it is being a pleasant stay and will be back again.",5,2014,02,17
104,Comfortable and clean,"Booked double room .  Room was comfortable and very clean. Very convenient location for us.  Free breakfast very enjoyable - full English buffet with toast and coffee served by very friendly staff.  Tea, coffee, biscuits, water and fruit in rooms.  Excellent value.  If there is a negative it would be that a king size bed would have been preferable to a standard double and a view rather than a brick wall.  All in all, great hotel.",4,2014,02,14
104,2 night stay with romance package,"We stayed her for our anniversary .what a wonderful day/night stay we had.staff upgraded us to one of two level room and a balcony that looked out the front of the hotel and beautiful terrace.

104,Recommended,"Stayed for a business trip, needed to be close to Paddington.  Staff very helpful, room spacious and good facilities.  Tea and coffee supplies great and there were biscuits too!  Graet choice at breakfast and again staff very attentive.
It was really windy and cold outside but room lovely and warm.",5,2014,02,13
104,Nice breakfast,"Duplex room booked, one large comfy bed upstairs and roll-out bed donwstairs.  Good enough for 2 adults + 1 teenage or 2 adults + 2 kids.  Washroom is a bit small, but clean and tidy. 

Restaurant serves English breakfast but in buffet style, even limited variety, but taste good. Love there serve hot and have fresh fruits (whole one, not the cut/diced fruits).

Recommend front desk staff should wear a bit more smile on their face.",4,2014,02,13
104,Stay at Park Grand London Hyde Park,"Our stay was great. The service provided at the Park Grand London Hyde park was excellent, and we were given help at request. The rooms were tidy and neat. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. The staff was helpful and were able to give us hints and tips for visiting the city.",5,2014,02,13

104,Excellent job,We enjoyed our staying in London. The staff was very kind and very helpfull.food was fantastic. I wish I can go there again soon.this hotel was pretty good. We had a lovely room. All other parts of the hotel are lovely with a brilliant location. I will recommend this hotel to any one who would likes to go for holiday in London. The hotel is very clean and  tidy and also the out side. You are having a great staff and a reception. They are very helpful and polite. Love to be there again and again. ,4,2014,02,10
104,Perfect place to stay for weekend break,"My husband and I stayed at the park grand because they were close to paddington and we were travelling from the West Country ,we also wanted to visit portobello market  which the was an easy 20 minute walk along Hyde park from the hotel, we were welcomed by friendly staff and were able to leave our bags at the hotel even though we arrived at 9 am. We also left our bag on the last morning and picked it up 20 minutes before our train.The room was pleasant and the bed very comfortable . breakfast was tasty and the staff attentive. Over all a great place to stay for the weekend break we will be staying again and recommending it to family and friends.",5,2014,02,10
104,Four very contented guests,"This is the first time I have written a hotel review, but we all agreed that this visit was deserving of some feedback.  I travelled to London with my wife and two friends for the weekend.  We chose this hotel for its reasonable price and location, after checking reviews on Trip Advisor, We always take reviews as a guide, never expecting them to be entirely accurate, because we all have different standards and expectations.  What a gem it turned out to be.  Just 5 minutes walk from Paddington station the welcome we received was professional and friendly.  Every member of staff we met had a genuine, friendly smile.  Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was excellent and again the staff very helpful and friendly.  We shall be staying again when we next visit London.",5,2014,02,10
104,Satisfied stay in London,"The hotel occupies a beautiful building right at the paddington. It is well connected to the transport network by tube station in few minutes walk. The area is walking distance to attraction of Central London, also there are varieties restaurant for a quick bites or a decent meal. Rooms are very spacious, clean and modern, staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a very high quAlity too. And price is very reasonable and we'll worth it. It's been a great stay.",5,2014,02,08
104,Good location,"Great hotel for short business stays. Very comfy bed , rooms on the small side but ok for a couple of nights without too much luggage. Would stay again. Breakfast good but not as good as sister hotel along the road. Helpful friendly staff. ",4,2014,02,07
104,One night stay,"One off business trip to London, booked 2 single rooms which were upgraded to doubles for some reason. Very helpful, polite staff nothing too much trouble, will definitely stay again. Breakfast was very good too.",5,2014,02,07
104,Taste of paradise,"stayed here for four nights and have to say that stay was memorable.the reception staff made me feel so welcome and restaurant staff was very attentive. 

location was perfect and it was walking distance from major underground station.room was small in size but well decorated.

A very good option to chose when you are in Paddington area.",5,2014,02,05
104,Not Impressed,"Having been transferred at the last minute from a different hotel within this group of hotels I thought we might be looked after but instead we were put in a very small room whereby you couldn't actually walk around the bed.  The bed was also extremely low in the middle making it difficult for us to get comfortable.  We were also asked for an additional deposit following payment which I thought was unnecessary given the circumstances.  That said, the breakfast staff were very efficient and for a buffet style breakfast the food wasn't bad.",3,2014,02,04
104,WEEKEND WITH DAUGHER FOR 18TH BIRTHDAY,"Stayed at the hotel on 25th January and had the celebration package for my daughters 18th birthday.  We had the duplex room and the staff made an extra effort and laid the double bed with fresh heart shapes rose petals and towels in the shape of elephants.  My daughter loved the sentiment.  The room, staff and breakfast was excellent.  Would highly recommend this hotel.  It would have been nice to have been able to eat an evening meal at the hotel, which was not available.",5,2014,02,03
104,Very good location for overnight Business trip,"Very good stay

Excellent location - only 10 minutes walk from Paddington station (hence LHR through Heathrow Express) and also within walking distance from Imperial College. Very good neighbourhood.

Rooms was very clean, functional (good Wifi) and comfortable. Good night sleep (quiet despite facing the road).

Breakfast also of very good quality, though maybe a little pricey (though probably not for London). Only suggested improvement: could you start serving breakfast before 7:00am - this is a little late for business customers.

Very good value for money. Overall, recommended.",5,2014,02,02
104,""" lovely weekend ""","I stayed at this hotel last weekend of december and i enjoyed the stay very much . All the staff - reception , breakfast room and housekeeping were very friendly and helpful . 
Initially i booked a double room at park grand paddington but due to a system glitch they were over booked and transfered to hydepark . I wasnt  happy at first because i was tired but they offered me a taxi and complimentary breakfast . we were offered a large club room , it was lovely , bright , clean and everything working of a high quality . I particularly valued the excellent lighting , adaptable and bright enough for reading . 
The shower was powerful and towels were very soft . The location was also good ,  walkable distance to paddington and lancastergate . 
Over all its been a great experience .",5,2014,01,31
104,"Not very good location, misleading name, poor service","We had reserved a quadruple room and my parents arrived first and they didn't want to give my parents the room. They had a pay on arrival policy, which no one informed us of. I had to make 5 phone calls just to convince them not to leave my parents on the street until my husband and me arrived. The room they gave us was also so small, not what you expect from a 4 star hotel. We switched rooms for a slightly bigger one but was not at all as the room in the pictures we saw. Also the name suggests its close to Hyde Park, and in fact its close to Paddington station which is in a different part of the city. Overall, would not recommend it for that money.",3,2014,01,27
104,Very comfortable rooms and perfect location,My boyfriend and i stayed here and we booked for romance package.we were upgraded to duplex and bed was very comfortable.We were surprised to see swan on our bed and it was nice surprise.staff were very helpful .i will recommend this place to my friends.,5,2014,01,27
104,Good things come in small packages,"Lovely hotel, however rooms are extremely small for the price, as well as this walls are very thin, so you really can here everything going on in the surrounding rooms. 

Sadly we happened to have loud neighbours, however if we hadn't, we would have had a lovely relaxing stay in a nice room which was tidied nicely each morning. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful and we found them a compliment to the hotel.

",4,2014,01,25
104,Superb hotel with good connectivity,"Hotel is situated walking distance from paddington or Lancaster gate station.since check in till check out ,staff was very helpful and they were going extra miles to help me out with information about the area and attraction.room was very very but small though.does not matter to me as I was single traveller.all in all best place to stay in paddington area.",5,2014,01,25
104,Memorable stay!!,I stayed here with my friends for get together... The hotel is really nice and quite. Room and bathroom are a bit small but clean and good. Location is excellent as it is in the mid of two main stations which are linked to central London. Staff is friendly and professional. We will come back definitely...,5,2014,01,24
104,Excellent comfortable hotel,"Great hotel for a city break,near to London attraction,clean rooms and friendly staff.Great hotel for every age with perfect location each destination. Very clean hotel and very polite staff.Hotel in a good location. The center with shops and bars is within walking distance. Anytime very gladly again!",5,2014,01,23
104,"Good hotel, good location, but only at the price","I was originally booked to stay one night at the Park Grand London Paddington. However, after receiving my confirmation they emailed me to tell me that a ""system glitch"" meant they were overbooked and I was being moved to their sister hotel, the Park Grand London Hyde Park. This seems to be a fairly regular occurrence, judging by the comments, but the location was good for me, and they offered a complimentary breakfast. The charge was a total of ¬£90 for one night, though you should note that the prices quoted on the web site exclude VAT. 

Service was very good, with lots of pleasant staff, and the buffet breakfast was hot and tasty. The room I was assigned was supposed to be an upgrade, and it was big enough but contained two double beds, which made it feel cramped. The shower room was very small, with just enough room for the toilet and a sink but, again, it was clean enough and quite modern. The safe was not screwed down, and was relatively easy to lift; I wouldn't want to run anywhere with it, but I'm not sure it genuinely protects anything really valuable. 

The problem in rating this property is judging value. They are described as a boutique four-star hotel, but they really don't do anything to justify the boutique description. I'd also argue that they are a good three-star, not four star. Taking this all into account, paying ¬£90 for bed and breakfast is good value, and very fair for the area. I'd drop the rating if the price was significantly higher.",4,2014,01,22
104,"Tiny rooms, good location, friendly staff","Courteous staff and a good breakfast more than make up for the tiny size of the rooms. 
Can't call them Double Rooms, for sure. 
The location is really nice, at a walking distance from Paddington Main station which has connections to most parts of London and also very near to the city center. 
The hotel offers complimentary breakfast and are more than willing to add vegetarian sandwiches to the menu for people like me who have dietary restrictions. 

Full marks to the staff for their courtesy.",5,2014,01,22
104,Fully recommend this hotel,"We stayed here during Christmas, it was fantastic,rooms are very clean and big,breakfast was cooked fresh and well displayed,location is central and the staff is very helpful and friendly,I highly recommend this hotel and we will be back soon.",5,2014,01,21
104,Definitely will come again,"I've stayed in park grand during a family trip. This hotel is lovely! Reception was spotless, staff was courteous and professional, the room was warm and cozy and breakfast offered a wide choice of food! Looking forward to visit this hotel again!",5,2014,01,21
104,A Few Inconviences...,"Two friends and I stayed here for four nights over the weekend. The hotel's location is close to Paddington station and fairly easy to find. When we arrived check in was a little painful - the man was obviously new and didn't seem to understand much English.

We were given a room with two floors - the first floor was beautiful with a queen bed however the ground floor was underwhelming and had a sofa bed. We had booked a ""Deluxe Quadruple Room with Two Queen Beds"" so we weren't impressed. I went straight down to reception for a room change.  We were given a new room that had two double beds however it looked just like the photo on Expedia of the room I booked so I accepted it.

I knew the en suite would only have a shower (not a bath) when I booked however I didn't expect the en suite to be the size of a box. There was also rust inside the shower. Needless to say, these aren't features expected of a four star hotel. However the beds were really comfortable, the rooms were really warm with controllable temperature, we had lovely hot showers and we enjoyed the TV and in-room tea.

Their general service was helpful. The batteries in the remote control were dead, these were replaced by the time we got back on the first day. My room key stopped working on the second day and they fixed this right away. One thing I would say is that their staff need to be a bit more knowledgeable. For example, one night we came back at 4am and asked the reception for room service. The guy wrote down our orders then another guy came along and told us that room service wasn't 24 hours - surely the first guy should have known this.

Overall, despite the inconveniences, it was a nice hotel.",3,2014,01,21
104,"Clean and comfortable, stunning breakfast, but check-in was very unorganised","After an extremely long and delayed journey our stay got off to a very bad start when we arrived and faced a 25 minute wait to check-in. We were asked to wait in the bar area due to the que - they were clearly having problems with a large group of people checking-in before us. Although I understand the problem the staff had, I thought it would have been sensible for one staff member to deal with the group and therefore free the other receptionists up to deal with other guests.

Despite the long trek to the room (the lift which only went up to floor 6 was a bit old and dodgy), we were actually pleased to be more 'out the way'. The rooms itself was stunning. The beds were comfortable and the room was spacious enough with an excellent view over London (we were on the 7th floor). The bathroom was a bit of a squeeze but was extremely nice and clean with a good shower. Sleep was pretty undisturbed apart from the odd bit of banging at around 7am.

The breakfast was absolutely stunning and the staff were brilliant. There was a good choice of continental with bread, ham, cheese, salami, fruit, muffins, croissants, toast, jams, cereals and an impressive full English buffet with fresh coffee and juices. I actually think the quality of the breakfast swayed my thinking that the stay was worth the money that I had paid!",4,2014,01,20
104,Good value business hotel,"Another business hotel in London that provides small rooms and a fair service at a reasonable price. The breakfast is poor, but there plenty of small eateries around in a lively neighbourhood the corner with superb taste and quality. Those with difficulties to walk or heavy luggage might have to take a cab or prepare to walk around 15 mins. from the next subway.",4,2014,01,17
104,Not For Cat Swingers,"It was messed up from the start, I paid an exorbitant amount for parking which upon the arrival of my colleague was assumed to be breakfast for 2 and only one double room.  Naturally, my colleague was outraged, I'm not exactly handsome and she was married to somebody else! The room was really small but nothing compared to the bathroom.  Tibbles the cat was extremely happy as there wasn't enough room to swing him.  The bar was also closed very early much to the relief of my liver.  Overall not very good, but a great deal better than the majority on London hotels which are quite frankly disgusting",3,2014,01,14
104,How can this hotel have 4 stars??,"First of all, we supposed to stay at Park Grand Paddington, but due to the online booking system, the hotel was overbooked, so we had to transfer to Park Grand Hyde Park.
No problem here, they took us with car to the other hotel. 
The problem was the room. First of all my room's window was next to an airco or power unit that was buzzed the whole night. 
Second of all there were finger nail cut on the floor, near the bed!!!!
I changed the room. On that replacement room, the shower did not have a shower door, so I flooded the bathroom every time I showered. At this point I really did not care. 
I've been to hostels that were more comfortable and cleaner than this supposedly 4 star hotel!
To say something good: The hotel is at a good location and has breakfast buffet.",2,2014,01,13
104,Nice room and breakfast,"The hotel is well located close to Paddington station. The staff is very supportive and attentive. Breakfast with discount during the check in was a good cost x benefit choice. Room is nice and clean, but the bed wasn't good - too soft.",4,2014,01,13
104,A slight disappointment,"I arrived and was told that that I had received an upgrade to a double room but was then disappointed when the room was smaller than the previous single rooms that I had, had at two other Shaftesbury Hotels in Paddington.  There was no bedside cabinet, no comfortable chair to watch the television from as you couldn't view it from the bed at the right angle and the toilet was very tight to the shower cubicle. The breakfast also wasn't the quality of the other two Shaftesbury Hotels either as the fresh fruit salad was just two types of melon and tinned apricots and there was no fresh fruit e.g. banana, apple.  That said the room was clean, the service good and attentive.  This hotel might have been rated higher if I hadn't been to the other hotels recently but I will be going to another Shaftesbury hotel in Paddington in February as well.  It will be interesting to see how this is against the others.",3,2014,01,07
104,Great hotel at a great price,Just stayed at this hotel and was very surprised at the price and standard of accommodation.  We chose this hotel out of all the Shaftesbury's as they offered parking on a first come first serve basis and charged us ¬£20 which was fantastic value for London.  The rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast was superb.  The breakfast staff were super friendly and very helpful.  Also the reception and concierge were also very helpful and friendly.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again or one of the others in the group.  The only downsize was that it was a little way from the nearest tube station but we didn't mind the walk and in summer the walk through Hyde Park about 7 minutes away would be great.  I great hidden gem in London,5,2014,01,06
104,Friendly staff and great breakfast,"Stayed here on new years eve with a group of friends and had a lovely time. I booked 3 deluxe rooms and only one had a sofa and fridge so not convinced they were deluxe.
Rooms were small but very clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable. Plenty of toiletries etc.my friends had complimentary fruit and bottled water but ours had nothing.
The staff on reception were lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was great and the staff serving tea and coffee were very efficient.
Overall i would recommend this hotel and will return. Thankyou.",4,2014,01,02
104,Another great stay,"We stayed at the Hotel in November for the third time, there was initally an issue with the booking and double booking of rooms and then the price, however Mr G Singh kindly sorted it out for us and made sure we were in reciept of the full english breakfast as part of our booking, (which is great).
When we returned wearily from the show late at night, (after a great day shopping too) the guy on reception happily served us a delicious wine at the bar and sorted out extra fresh skimmed milk for us. All in all another wonderful stay, the rooms are lovely and location near to the tube station is very convenient.",5,2014,01,01
104,"Excellent service, great hotel, needs fine tuning","My wife and me stayed there for 5 nights during the Christmas 2013 period. The window in the renovated room was broken (by the way, what's the deal with all the old windows in England?), the maintenance guy came immediately and we were given another room immediately. Staff was friendly, professional and very friendly. We had a problem with the safe and it was sorted out immediately. If i can be super picky, I would like a bigger cover for the double bed as I am quite tall and it wasn't enough to completely cover 2 people. All in all though, a great hotel at a good location (the Heathrow express starts from Paddington which is a 5 min walk) and very helpful staff. Highly recommended",4,2013,12,31
104,Brilliant,Staff were super friendly and helpful which was much appreciated. The room was very clean and there were no problems. I liked the free wifi service- bonus was that it was fast. Good location as well- right near Paddington Station. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back. ,5,2013,12,30
104,this was an alternative hotel provided,"we were transferred  to this hotel as their sister hotel was fully booked internet error.
we were on the seventh floor but lift only went to six which meant we had to carrry heavy bags up two flights of stairs  . room was lovely though . It was just the inconvenience of having  to go to another hotel and we werent told to we got there we were very tired after travelling all day . I think we should have got a reduction in our rates or at least a freestay next time",3,2013,12,30
104,I won't class this as 4 star!!,"I won't class this as 4 star!! It's on the same par as Holiday Inn.
I had booked the ""Superior Triple"" and it certainly wasn‚Äôt. I had paid extra to get the ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù room. The room was far too small for 3 people. We were two adults and a child and when booking I asked for a double bed and single. When we were checking in, again, I had asked if we got a double bed and single, the girl at reception said yes. When we got to the room it was two single beds and a sofa bed. We ended up joining the two single beds together but every time the room was cleaned they were separated. I would hate to see was a deluxe room will be like!!! Something to note, most hotels give the room size dimensions, this one doesn‚Äôt, you have to ask why!
Issues while we were there:
The windows would not close properly, they have the old single glazed windows from when the building was built. They let a lot of noise in, the road is very busy in the morning. Windows need upgrading to double glazing.
The bathroom has a small shelf for your toiletries, it‚Äôs too small for three people. We ended up having to use the floor and table in the room.
The corridors are very narrow, if anyone is coming the opposite way with a large suitcase, you have to stop and lean against the wall.
One small wardrobe in the room, would be fine for one person. But certainly not three people.
It‚Äôs all negative above but I feel cheated because it‚Äôs not worth the ¬£170 per night I had paid. Strange thing was, I had to pay when checking in and my money was taken, but they could only give me an invoice when I was leaving. I do feel this is so if you complain there is nothing you can do because money is already taken. The only good thing about the hotel was the breakfast. 
There is a Hilton round the corner, a little more expensive but I‚Äôm sure certainly better quality. 

I definitely won‚Äôt be staying at this hotel again, unless the prices are reduced by 35%.",2,2013,12,30
104,A great weekend,"This is the first time we have stayed here and it was very enjoyable. The Staff were very polite and helpful.The food was very good and the room was very clean.
The only slight negative was the hotel was very hot but this is a minor point.",4,2013,12,23
104,Another excellent stay.,"This is the second time we have stayed here whilst in London and this visit was every bit as enjoyable as the first one. The staff were all professional, courteous and very friendly. The breakfast has to be one of the best going with a great selection to choose from. Out complementary room upgrade and bottle of wine helped things along nicely as well. The room was clean and well presented and justices quirky as the last one we had. We are just looking for am excuse to go back again. ",5,2013,12,18
104,HOTEL STAY,"The hotel was excellent very clean and the staff were fantastic we had a wonderful stay.
 You should be very pleaded with your staff they did you proud . we will be telling our friends and family about your hotel and we will come again.",5,2013,12,15
104,Terrible stay ever,"Experienced a terrible stay in this hotel ever. Staff not helpful and I cant believe that there is no elevator provided for single bed room. Also, the interior design is awful and be mindful that there are many hidden steps which may fall you down... Do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2013,12,13
104,"Comfortable stay; welcoming, helpful staff",Stayed 2 nights. Single room was small but comfortable. Staff were attentive and friendly. Access to sink in bathroom was a bit tight and it was a shame that breakfast on both mornings was only lukewarm and not hot.,4,2013,12,12
104,Lovely experience and helpful staff,"I had an excellent stay at park grand london hyde park.i was given upgrade to duplex and it was free of charge.Room was spot clean and very big with two large screen tv .bathroom was small in size but very clean.

I will highly recommend this place.",5,2013,12,12
104,Comfortable 2 night stay,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Park Grand with my mum. I booked a twin room and chose the Park Grand as it received some good reviews and the location looked perfect for us as we wanted to go to Hyde Park and do a bit of shopping. The room was fine, small but cosy and I didn't expect any bigger in London. The room was clean, heated and the bathroom was great. Big tv, biscuits, fruit and water a bonus too. Although the beds were comfy we both did wake up a few times during the night but still slept fine and such a central location you can't expect silence! Staff were helpful and we were able to leave our bags the day we were flying home so we didn't have to cart them around. The wifi was very slow and we chose not to use it, so possibly that may need to be looked at. Breakfast was a fine selection, enough for us, although maybe a bit more fruit, grapefruit? Overall, the hotel was perfect for what we were looking for and I would definitely recommend and will hopefully stay again.",4,2013,12,11
104,"Comfortable room, quiet location (back of hotel), helpful staff","This was my first stay at this hotel. I stayed for one night. Check in staff were helpful, despite one being a trainee. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The room and en suite were spotless. The only (minor) problem was that the water temperature in the shower fluctuated, but, on enquiry at reception, this may have been caused by a boiler issue.
Biscuits, fruit and bottled water supplied in the room in addition to tea and coffee. 
I would stay here again.",4,2013,12,11
104,Comfortable with dedicated staff,"This was an OK hotel centrally located and a short walk to Paddington station. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The staff did their absolute best to make you feel welcome. The rooms were a generous side, the bedding comfortable and the heating first class with individual controls in the room. A bonus was the heated bathroom floors which were very cosy in the morning. The only problem was the WiFi which was so slow it was unusable. They had people look at it a number of times, but you couldn't even complete an on-line check in with your airline. Certainly, a greta place to stay if you are looking at exploring London as there are several liens that converge on Paddington station. If you need internet, forget it.",3,2013,12,09
104,Certainly not a 4 Star in my book !!,"Just back from a 3 night stay at the Park Grand, and have to say I was quite disappointed with the 4 star rating. We booked what was classed as a Deluxe Double, and I think that my idea of Deluxe differs quite a lot from what the owners class as Deluxe. The room was quite small and didn't really have a lot of room and storage space. I wouldn't want to think I was staying there any longer than 3 nights. The bathroom was very small with only a shower (which was quite nice, although leaked). Breakfast was where I have the biggest gripe in that on 2 out of the 3 mornings we turned up for breakfast only to be told that there were no tables available ( a good job we weren't in a rush). For a 4 Star hotel I would have expected them to have enough tables to cope with a full hotel. Overall the location is quite good, but not a 4 Star or Deluxe rooms IMO. Not really worth the money.",3,2013,12,09
104,Great location except sofa bed in room 120,"I spent 4 nights with my family at the hotel which is very conveniently located to reach the center of London by bus or tube. The room and bathroom were clean and the breakfast was excellent. The only inconvenience we faced was receiving one double bed and a sofa bed, rather than 2 double beds as indicated on the website and confirmed by the hotel last July. The sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable to accommodate 2 adults and in a bad state. It was reported to the reception desk, however, we were informed that it was the only room available! I highly recommend to replace the sofa bed in room 120.",4,2013,12,09
104,Very nice location to Paddington Station - A littel to small rom for me,"The hotel was very well located for Paddington Station. Friendly staff and a clean and well kept hotel. My room was a Deluxe Single room, and was of hve I would call very little. Wondering how a normal single room would have eventually. Would probably have come back, but had also checked whether there were other hotels in the area that maybe had a little more room. The room was well equipped with new bathrooms. A little dull that you can not provide Internet line with better capacity than 0.5 MB download 0.01 Upload speed when you expect to sit to work in the afternoon evening.",3,2013,12,09
104,"A bit disappointed, not a four star.","I booked in to the hotel on a Lastminute Secret Hotel deal. I felt that this may have affected the welcome. Check in was hurried and lacked any warmth. 

The location is good as the hotel is a brief walk from Paddington. Not sure how this can be called Park Grand Hyde Park when it is nowhere near really. I am guessing that this is because there is already a Park Grand Paddington and it would have been too confusing to have two.

The room I was given had two double beds for little old me. What it meant was that the room was really a bit full, which left you shuffling around the room. Clearly the owners had made some effort to tidy up the rooms with a new bathroom, however this had been done badly. The door to the bathroom had not been properly painted, there was no loo roll holder etc. The windows in the room were old and needed a good clean and possibly replacing. 

I must say I did sleep well. I do think this hotel is probably more lower three star than 4. If I had paid full price I might have been gutted as after seeing the hotel website expected a far superior product.",3,2013,12,08
104,Excellent hotel!!!!,I throughly enjoyed my stay at park grand.hotel had been gone through major refurbishment and everything was modern.staff was very helpful and intelligent with local area.                       Rooms were smaller in size but worthy for London hotels. definitely  a good choice .,5,2013,12,07
104,Enjoyable stay,"We booked a stay for two nights. Location is excellent, just a short walk from Paddington, Hyde Park and Bayswater. This is very good for us as the hotel was walking distance to our favorite hangouts and restaurants. 

We had a room facing the rear of the building, and there was no noise from the street at all. The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Staff were friendly and welcoming. 

Would definitely return and recommend to anyone needing to stay in this area.",4,2013,12,06
104,A very pleasant suprise,"A great hotel, next to all local amenities. We stayed for a 2 day get away and could not be happier. All the staff were extremely welcoming and knowledgeable about the area.
We were pleasantly surprised with our room. We booked a deluxe double for a very reasonable price and it was definitely worth it.a nice spacious bed and we even had a little living room area upstairs. 
For the price and comfort.. i will definitely stay here again.",4,2013,12,06
104,Good Choice,"Spent 1st & 2nd December here without any problems.
Very smart, clean modern refurb of older building.
Helpful smart staff and good breakfast from 7 to 10am.
Would liked a 5 foot wide bed though, but not a problem for 2 nights.
Very well positioned for Paddington Station.",4,2013,12,06
104,Overnight leisure trip,"Park grand is the best option to go for.
Well situated in the paddington location and near to hyde park

Room are small in size but staff was very helpful and always willing to help

We will recommend this hotel to everyone",5,2013,12,04
104,Weekend sightseeing,"We had booked a deluxe twin but were shown to a very small double, however we were moved to a better room, comfortable but rather a lot of street noise from early in the morning. Very helpful staff with good knowledge of local transport. On the whole, very enjoyable stay, on the downside, the name of the hotel is misleading, Hyde Park was a walk and a bus ride away",3,2013,12,02
104,Comfortable and clean,I stayed in this hotel for a fortnight for business and my stay was really good. The rooms were clean even though small. Bed was comfortable and the staff friendly. I stayed in a few others in the area before that and this was by far the best experience.,4,2013,12,02
104,Girl's shopping trip,"I stayed with my 2 sisters for 3 nights ,we had a room with 3 single beds, the room was clean and well serviced each day bathroom may have been small but was functional. We did report that the extractor fan in the bathroom was not working the staff apologised and ensured us that the problem would be fixed for the next people using the room.
The breakfast was excellent and a great start for the day spent shopping
We would certainly stay again. 
Co Down Northern Ireland",5,2013,12,01
104,Overnight Stop,"Stayed here for one night while on business in London. Hotel was clean and staff friendly and efficient. Booked a single room but got upgraded which was a nice touch. Bathroom small but functional. Breakfast was good value and free Wi-Fi essential and good speed. Within easy walking distance of Paddington Station and the tube, ideal if travelling from the west. Would stay there again.",4,2013,11,30
104,Excellent,"We returned home yesterday and could not be more happy with our stay with you. We picked this hotel because of the good reviews here, as comfort is quite high on our list of requirements. We were not disappointed either.
The staff were friendly, we recieved an upgrade to a lovely room, clean, tidy all we could have expected, and the breakfast was more than adequate. we will be booking to stay here again on our return to London. Thank you all for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2013,11,28
104,A budget hotel with personality,"Generally if we stay overnight in London for an event and we'll hardly be in the room we stay at a no frills chain hotel.  This hotel was around 20 or 30 pounds cheaper than, for example, the Premier Inn at County Hall.  In this case we required a location near Paddington and the hotel was pleasant and not completely devoid of soul.

The bathroom was bijou but stylish and functional with a good shower pressure (no bath), the linen was fresh and the room was spotless. There was complimentary water, biscuits, tea and coffee and a couple of apples in the room.  

Another bonus differing from the budget chain approach is that breakfast was included. It was a decent buffet with hot choices, cereals, lovely pastries, fruits, cheese and yoghurt.

All in all a good crash pad with a few designer touches.

‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜIt doesn't get a 5 star rating as the hotel was roasting hot which other guests mentioned and the bed was so soft my husband ended up sleeping on the floor - although obviously that is personal preference.",4,2013,11,28
104,At last!...A London Hotel which is value for money!!,"As a regular visitor to London Hotels I did not have a great deal of confidence that this new one on my list was going to be any different from my previous experiences of London Hotels which in the main has consisted of being grossly over priced, terrible customer service from staff with limited abilities in the English language and small dingy bedrooms. 
Well what a pleasant surprise I was in for! 
The Park Grand is a breath of fresh air! A couple of minutes walk from Paddington station it is ideally located just off Westbourne street. The welcome at Reception was efficient and professional and the hotel had clearly undergone some extensive refurbishment which left it feeling clean, fresh and welcoming. The bedroom was spacious enough, bright, airy and all had new furniture and the shower was a joy, (just one gripe here, no remote control for the TV) Having run out of time I did not have the time to experience breakfast but at long last I think I may have found a regular home from home for myself on my future trips to London. I just hope as more and more sample the delights of this hotel that it doesn't change! It is good value for money and the Management seems to have hit on a winning formula. Well done.",4,2013,11,28
104,lovely room,"stayed for a night and the room was fantastic we had a club double and it was lovely special liked the glass walled bathroom if privacy was required there is a blind, the staff all gave great service and the room was cleaned to a very high standard.",5,2013,11,27
104,got moved around but staff but good,"Booked at sister hotel, but got moved to this one. Was told by original hotel would get a double room. Sadly none available when arrived. Staff apologetic and helpful. Got moved to a very nice room the following night and commentary drinks as an apology. I stay in London every week and am going to stay here again next week.",4,2013,11,27
104,"Great Location, Comfy Bed","Stayed here for a quick overnight meeting with client. It as very quick five min walk to Paddington and good location. I will def stay here again the next time I need to stay in London.

very clean and quiet as well.",4,2013,11,27
104,Lovely staff and service...great location close to transportation,"especially liked the staff who were knowledgeable and always willing to help. Beds were were more comfortable than any other hotel I have stayed in. Breakfast was a delight, all that one could possibly want. Servers were attentive. Coffee was excellent. Kept me going all day long. Staff cheerfully  helped with our luggage which was heavy. Good value overall. Now if you could only make the U.S. Dollar stronger!",5,2013,11,27
104,Nice stay.,"We have just had a very nice stay at the Park Grand. Room was ready early, 10am. Staff all pleasant and welcoming. Room was large with a upstairs lounge, mini kitchen and TV. Drinks were supplied and the bed turned back in the evening. Breakfast was well cooked, with a good choice of hot and cold items. We enjoyed our stay, and will go back again. Location was ideal, just 3 minutes from Paddington station, and a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park. We walked to Oxford Street in about 25 minutes.  Plenty of taxis and buses as well. Room was clean and modern. Well done Park Grand, another satisfied guest!",5,2013,11,26
104,Grand Hotel,Have stayed at this hotel before and it was so good I had to use it again. Good location. Good facilities and even better very helpful and friendly staff. All rooms are clean and user friendly. The free wi fi was a bonus as some London hotels see it as an extra charge. Can't wait for my next stay.,5,2013,11,26
104,Lift doesn't work,The lift didn't work and we were made to walk 5 flights of stairs. Then we asked to use the service lift as had heavy bags but they said we were not allowed and that only 1 person could fit even though 2 guests had just walked out of it in front of us!,2,2013,11,26
104,2 days stay-excellent,"Great hotel. Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel and everything was good-rooms clean and ok in space tough with 2 or more luggage may be a bit cramped,clean bathroom and shower,air cond,wifi and coffee making facilities. Hotel staffs are very helpful in giving directions around the area and which tube line to use to get around.

Con-the bed and pillow a little worn down and sunken in the middle but i still managed to sleep through..perhaps hotel can consider an upgrade.

A 5-8 minutes walk from Paddington Station so was good for me as i used Heathrow Express to travel from airport into London. Just be careful when existing the station to ensure correct direction towards hotel as there is another Park Grand Paddington Hotel located one street behind this hotel.

Do state your requirements upfront as there are basements rooms and ask for rooms at the back of the hotel if you want less noise. However this hotel is located in a less busy street so it was not noisy for me when i walked back from the paddington underground past midnight 2 days in a row. Another plus point-quite a safe surrounding to walk in at midnight....

I will definitely be staying here in my next visit...",5,2013,11,25
104,Great Hotel,"This is a superp hotel set just in the right place for some sight seeing 
the staff are great and its sooo clean.

if you want a good value hotel that gives you a luxuary feel then this is the one to pick",5,2013,11,25
104,Amazing,"Stayed for 2 nights in November and the hotel was fabulous and convenient for lots of shopping and sight seeing ..the rooms are spacious , clean and comfortable  with huge windows letting in lots of light..the staff are very helpful and friendly ...",5,2013,11,24
104,Good place to stay,"I stay at the hotel for eight nights. The location is great , close to the padding station and the underground. Lots of restaurant nearby which appeal to all kinds of flavor. The rooms are clean  and comfortable . Some rooms are actually in the basement but have big windows which can let light in. I certainly will visit this hotel next time.",4,2013,11,23
104,Short stay,"It is a nice Hotel very close to Paddington Station.
The room at the first floor was very nice. The crew were gentle and solved quckly a little problem in the room.
The beackfast was cheap and plentiful.",4,2013,11,22
104,Lovely hotel in convenient location,"I stayed here last weekend for 3 nights and it was a v.enjoyable stay, the room was ready on arrival ,  room was modern and clean, service from staff was v.good and the food at breakfast was Lovely, it was in a great location, less than 5mins walk from paddington station ,  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone",5,2013,11,22

I would love to come here again

M impressed by the hospitality offered by you

Services  are very fast nd accurate

What else should I say I am in love with the stay

It made my trip to london joyous nd value for money

",5,2013,11,21
104,Excellent stay,"Me & my wife booked at park grand hotel for 3 nights.

When we checkin reception team accept us with warm welcome, friendly & cordially. They help us also with the luggage's. Specially when we asked any thing from the reception they always help us very friendly with short time. Like as restaurant, theatre, shopping & others.

Room  size is fair enough but it's very clean & well decorated.
Breakfast staff is very friendly with nice smile. 
More over hotel is walking distance from Paddington station.

Definitely we will come back again.

 ",5,2013,11,21
104,Very convenient and comfortable.,"I'm a business traveller and spend 1-2 nights per week in London and have stayed in dozens of hotels. For my requirements, this was one of the bester hotels I've used for business.

Pros:
Location, fast check in, quiet, 2x desks to work on, large comfortable rooms, large bed, aircon (mine had 2 floors!), small kitchenette, 2x TV's and free WiFi.

Cons:
No iron and ironing board in the room, no room service/food options (although you do have a kitchen to reheat/prepare food).",4,2013,11,21
104,lovely hotel,"very nice hotel, spacious room, and in a location that suits for getting around London, I have stayed here before and when I come to London always check availability here 1st, the restaurant staff were great and very accommodating and the food was lovely a great start to the day.",4,2013,11,20
104,Decent hotel but not for business,"First the good things. Met at the door by a porter who took my bag and followed through to the room which did require two flights of stairs. The breakfast is very good. well prepared and presented. The location is good within walking distance of Paddington Station with a lot of interesting local restaurants etc. .
Traveling for business, I stayed here because they advertised internet connections in the rooms which I require to conduct meetings when traveling. In fact the room internet is non existent in that it cuts off every five to ten minutes and must have a screening aspect as numerous business sites would not come up. Since my ipad, computer and iphone work in all other parts of London I really believe this is a ParK Grande problem.
For non business travel the price is right as is th location.",3,2013,11,19
104,This hotel deserves a great review.,"First of all, consider the cost of real estate in London. Then leave your North American expectations behind and judge the hotel based upon European realities. Yes, the rooms are modest and the bathrooms small - but that is to be expected unless you are willing to lay out big bucks for a lot more room. If what you need is a decent place to stay with adequate accommodations, helpful staff, within walking distance of Paddington Station and many restaurants then you cannot go wrong staying in the Park Grand hotel. 

We were able to show up early because our flight arrived in the morning. The staff were very accommodating in storing our luggage and even suggested that they could get the room ready earlier (which we didn't need because we were sightseeing anyway). We stayed two nights and, upon checking out, made arrangements to spend another night on our way back. The booking was handled professionally and with no problems. 

We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.",5,2013,11,19
104,;must be the best hotel in London,"Three friends out for a weekend in London, train to Paddington 300yds walk and we were in our room within 15 minutes, very helpful staff and you can leave your luggage at the hotel on your leaving day and go shopping until you catch your train. Really good service. We will certainly use this hotel again.",5,2013,11,18
104,Brilliant hotel,"Great hotel for a break in London about 7 minutes walk from Paddington underground station. We have been lucky enough to stay in many hotels and the attention to detail in this hotel was wonderful. We had 2 bottles of water, 2 cans fizzy drink, plate of fruit and biscuits with our tea and coffee in room. There were loads of extras in bathroom including sewing kit, toothbrush and razor, plus usual shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. What really impressed us was we had coffee before we went out for evening and used up all the milk, when we arrived back later, our dirty cups had been replaced with clean ones, we were given extra milk, our bed had been turned down and a card saying 'goodnight' was placed on bed - AND best of all a small chocolate on each pillow - you don't often get that even on cruise ships these days. Excellent breakfast. would definately stay here again and recommend.",5,2013,11,18
104,What a smashing hotel !!,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Park Grand, the staff were very helpful and friendly and our room 409 was lovely and bright with a VERY comfortable bed and pillows, huge TV and very quiet, no disturbance from traffic at all. The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice and again, the staff were very helpful and friendly indeed. The only comment I would make that in the bathroom of 409 the towels were put on such a high rack that even standing on the toilet I could not reach them - I am just under 5' tall which didn't help !! However, apart from that everything else was just perfect - and we will DEFINITELY stay again next time we are in London. Close to the Tube and the West End, just perfect. Thank you. Jennifer Gill from West Devon, UK",5,2013,11,17
104,comfortable for a short stay,"This is the second Shaftesbury hotel I've stayed in.  Stayed here one night for business. I had a single, which was very tiny, but comfortable enough for one night.  I appreciated the in-room kettle and ironing board, though I'm not confident there was enough room to fold out the ironing board. 

One of the better features of the hotel is its location -- just a short walk from Paddington station (including the Heathrow Express train) and many food choices nearby. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to check into my room within an hour of my arrival in the morning.  I'd stay here again, though probably only for short stays.",4,2013,11,17
104,Great location,"Found this hotel online close to Paddington station and very well priced .
Visited with my grown up daughter and booked a triple room, excellent choice apart from the rather small shower room/ toilet too small for grown ups but did not spoil our stay. Excellent breakfast, very friendly staff where nothing was too much trouble. Will stay here again",4,2013,11,17
104,Smallest room ever seen in my life,"We stayed here the week of the 1st November 20013 in a room on the first floor and it was so small the chair could not fit under the desk as other furniture was in the way. The location is FANTASTIC thou, Paddington station only 2min walk and a bunch of English breakfast cafes close.",3,2013,11,15
104,Excellent value. Good location.,"This was my third visit to a Shaftesbury Hotel and it definitely will not be the last. Very good value for the price paid. Staff friendly and helpful. Arrived to the Hotel prior to the normal check and was pleased to hear that not only was our room ready early but we had been upgraded to a larger room. Was visiting my son for the weekend. I am 1.92m and he is 1.96m so the upgrade to a quad room was very much appreciated.
The room itself was clean. View from our room was straight into somebody else's room but we were in London as tourists and not to look out of hotel windows. Shower a little cramped but perfectly functional. 
Breakfast choice was good ranging from cooked breakfast to fruit and cereals.
Hotel located approx 4 minute walk from Paddington station. Good central location.
Would recommend and will stay again.",4,2013,11,08
104,Great Value Place to Stay!,"I booked this hotel for a party of 16 ladies. We arrived at 11 in the morning and went to drop off our luggage at the hotel - we were delighted to be able to check into some of our rooms - this was totally unexpected. We had a mixture of double and triple rooms - several rooms were upgraded. A couple were a little on the small side - but we were only staying one night. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, the breakfast was excellent - incuded in the room price. Location - perfect for Paddington Station. I would not hesitate to use this hotel again or to recommend it to others.",5,2013,11,04
104,Not that great,There were four of us staying here in two rooms. Our rooms were in the basement and were very small with no view. I am 6' tall & my feet were hanging out of the bed. The wardrobe was very small and not big enough for two peoples clothes. However the room was clean and the breakfast was good but I have had better in other hotels. I would think twice before staying here again.,3,2013,11,04
104,A nice hotel to stay if your touring London.,The location was perfekt and the hotel was clean and very welcoming. The rooms was very good and the breakfast was delicious and the personal were very friendly and helpful. The location only five minutes walk from Paddington Station.,4,2013,11,03
104,Perfect Stay!,"I can honestly say this was a brilliant hotel to stay in. The location was perfect and the hotel itself was clean, cosy and very welcoming.  The breakfast was delicious and the tariff was very reasonable.  We would definitely return and can't wait to do so!",5,2013,11,02
104,Great location,"Stayed in hotel for 5 days with my family.  Hotel only 5 minutes walk from Paddington station.  Family room had a double bed and twin beds. Good size room, shower room small but spotless.  Fresh fruit in room on arrival with usual tea/coffee, biscuits, milk, kettle, etc.  There was no toiletries in the shower room when we arrived but a member of staff delivered them to our room immediately.  Breakfast was good and all staff were very helpful and pleasant.  We all enjoyed our stay and will be back again.",4,2013,11,01
104,A nice hotel to stay if your touring london,"A group of us stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel was clean and staff were very friendly, and helpful. My room was great, massive bed, flat screen TV, large bathroom with shower and bath. The breakfasts were also very nice. The hotel was very busy but not  noisy, it is in a good location if you don't want the hustle and bustle but easy to get the tube into the  the centre of London.
Over all a pleasant stay, my only negative comment would be the heating in the hotel was in to high.",4,2013,11,01
104,Fair Enough!!,"The room was a superior double comprising a lower reception area with kitchenette and shower room with a loft style sleeping area which require the negotiation of a narrow staircase. It was clean, but a little tired here and there.
The bathromm was adequate albeit small for a big fella. A number of down lighter lamps didnt work. minor things that split the difference between good and average. The staff were helpfull and courteous even after arriving for breakfast after the official 10.00 am finish. They allowed me to take from the remains of the hot buffet and where very quick to bring juice and coffee. It is well located for a short walk towards Paddington Station where there are numerous restaurants available for diner.
The bar area was fine, if a little austere, once you located a barman!!. Overall reasonable for London at the price.",3,2013,10,29
104,"Good location, good value,","I needed a hotel for a business trip but wasn't prepared to pay the over inflated prices requested by the normal chains. I also wanted a hotel close to the Heathrow Express. I found the Park Grand on the internet and booked a luxury single at a very reasonable rate. The Hotel was easy to find and in a great location. The reception staff were extremely friendly and very happy to advise me with shopping locations and tube directions when I arrived. My room was on the first floor, the bathroom although small, was spotless and fitted with quality fittings. Please be aware though that single means small. I'm only 5'5"" and average build but I found it hard to get between the desk and the bedside cabinet to get into bed ! anyone who was bigger than me would really struggle. I'd stay here again, but I'd book a double next time.",4,2013,10,29
104,worth money!!,The room is very clean and nice. The hotel location is good because it is not far away from paddington station and in the area are closed to many restaurants and convenient stores. The service is also good. The staff are friendly and willing to help.,4,2013,10,27
104,Never again,"Top tier price for a room so small i can touch both walls with my arms outstretched. A room that doesn't even have pen and paper, let alone a fridge or an open window, or a bath, or...u get the picture. Actually no, you don't, i've just realised there isn't a single framed picture on the walls. 
Typing this in the room, i have just asked reception for a notepad, and the answer was ""no, i don't think so"".
The cupboard has three hangers, and a safe that doesn't work. The bathroom has only one towel, and the sink is wedged behind the angle of the door.
The room is in the basement, next to the bins, on the high street. The window rattles every time a car goes past. So much for sleep.
This is literally the worst hotel, with one of the highest prices i have ever paid.
Never using the Shaftesbury group again. With names like Park Grand and Premier, they're like some third-world city chain hotel, using posh-sounding names to cover up extortion.",1,2013,10,26
104,Great Location,"We stayed here for 4 days, from Oct. 7-10. It is walking distance from Paddington station. It is also a few blocks away from our Big bus HOHO stop, close proximity to restaurant and to Barclays which is the recommended bank by BOA. It doesn't have a microwave and fridge but it does have a coffee maker. We paid for our breakfast which is buffet style with servers who attend to other needs. The staff were very helpful in giving us directions.",3,2013,10,26
104,Misrepresentation,"I found this hotel via the internet and was pleased with the deal offered. However, when we arrived  we were offered a room on 6th floor. On entering it had an overwhelming smell of damp. Something that could not be dealt with quickly. We requested another room. The next room was again on 6th floor and this time it was a single room with a double bed. Tiny bathroom, wardrobe for one. Very poor. 
Our overnight stay was comfortable and then we went down for breakfast. This was extremely chaotic. Staff were overwhelmed and we were told there are six couples ahead of us waiting for a table and to go back up and wait in the lobby. After only 20 minutes a table was arranged and we had a pleasant breakfast.
I am very disappointed with this hotel. The first room offered should not be used and the second room was definitely not a 'superior double'. It was neither superior or double. Reading the reviews I thought it would be excellent, but clearly others expectations are different.
I will never stay in this hotel again and will not consider any other Shaftsbury hotel as a result.",1,2013,10,25
104,Excellent location and more,"I've been with their other hotels as well but I find the one in Hyde Park very handy. The price we paid for here is a little bit high but worth doing it as it's so close to the train station, bus stop and easy access to banks, supermarket and restaurants.  It is also walking distance to Oxford so if you don't mind walking, it is not that far. 

The double room at the 3rd floor is spacious, clean and modern.  As we booked here in the past and if you are one of the regular guests, you will be provided with free water bottle on your first day and some fruits which is also nice; free Wi-Fi and coffee facilities in the room (tea, coffee and some biscuits).  The room has a 2-seater sofa, table and chair where you can work; ironing board is also provided and toiletries.  Breakfast is also included in our booking served with fruits, yoghurt, juice, bread, sausages, eggs and pastries.  You can either choose to have a English Breakfast or Continental Breakfast but I think it is better to have your breakfast included in the reservation instead of paying as it cost more. 

All staff were friendly, attentive, and very courteous. There is a lift which you could not find in all hotels in London and the staff is always helpful to carry your luggage up to your room and down (the guy in the lobby is so friendly and helpful with our heavy luggage during our entire stay). You can also store your luggage for the day so it's very handy if your flight is late at night.",4,2013,10,22
104,Good,"I stayed 4 nights in this hotel.
The room needs to be more clean. The service in the lobby mmm not so good. The lady in the reception was not kind. The size of the room and the location  of the hotel was great. ",4,2013,10,18
104,let down by size of DUPLEX room and Condition of sofa bed,"I have now stayed at three of the Shaftsbury chain in and around Paddington and as I was taking my teenage grandkids thought a Duplex room would offer the best comfort for 4 adults, WRONG on arrival we were told the room was not ready (approx. 2pm) so we went and had a long lunch and arrived back at 3.30pm or so only to be told room still not ready, we were then allocated to another room, The duplex we were given was Miniscule in size so glad I left the cat at home as if swung around the room the poor animal would have hit its head on every wall??. NO room for the suitcases nor for that matter any space to pack clothes into so living out of the suitcase for the duration. the positives were a good breakfast and location of the hotel. the lower bed was comfortable for myself and wife BUT the sofa bed on the upper floor was not at all comfortable for the teenagers and my granddaughter ended up with a stiff neck due to this. never again in a duplex room for us though I would stay again but ONLY in a bigger room for two persons.",3,2013,10,16
104,excellent,"We stayed here for 7 nights and from begining untill end it was just fabulous,staff were wonderful- very helpful.location was also great,couple of minutes to paddington station,breakfast was good,rooms are bit small but comfortable and ovarall-truly exceptional-I will surely return.",5,2013,10,14
104,Average Hotel,"We stay at Park Grand for a week in Sept. No expectation and so no disappointment. Everything is just average. You pay what you get. I stay at the Club Room and is very spacious. Also, they do provide us the free wifi which is a plus. If you just want a quiet place to stay and close to the subway station, Park Grand is a good choice.",3,2013,10,14
104,Nice and confortable place where stay to visit London,"me and my family booked this hotel to visit london during a long week end. Honestly I can say that all my expectations was confirmed during my trip . Room even if it was for 4 persons was good enough and clean . Breakfast was ok and support for our kid who has some intollerance was perfect and precise .location is perfect to reach underground by walking 5 minutes and hotel is also close to Hyde park area . around the hotel there are a lot of restaurant and pubs , location is quite and safe also during the night.",4,2013,10,11
104,What am utter mess!!,"No wifi, bad mannered staff ""well! You are the first person to complain!"" 
I am wiring this on an iPhone in the street, I don't want to sit in the room. Windows are BLACK!, net curtain is black with cigarette burns in it, carpet is torn. NON PAT tested kettle, AC smells of mould (unclean filter), glasses have white scum in the bottom, Television has ""something"" stuck on it, Walls are damaged, blood or red fluid running down radiator, 7th floor = no wifi and also lift only goes to 6th floor. I wish I could post pictures!!",1,2013,10,08
104,Great Hotel to stay in.,"We stayed in the Park Grand London Hyde Park for 4 nights in September. We found this the best hotel we have stayed in, in London for many years. We were upgraded which made a big difference giving us more  room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The dining room accomodated guests easily with a lovely selection of food for breakfast.
The beds were very comfortable and I must say it was the best sleep I have had in a hotel bed. I would definately use this hotel again and would recommend it to others.",5,2013,10,08
104,"Comfortable stay, apart from the staff.","We have stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, just last week. We had a triple room with 3 single beds (two put into a double bed). The hotel itself is at a little confusing location in the neighbourhood due to the fact that ALL buildings in the area look identically the same and the hotel sign is hard to find, but after the second night we got used to it. The room we had was big enough, quiet, very nicely equipped, the beds were very comfortable, bathroom was very new, VERY CLEAN and not too small at all. Breakfast was lovely, nothing really missing from it and they had enough room for all the hotels guests. The only two bad things i can say about the hotel, is that the staff were rather rude and impatient and the elevator was SLOW and irritating. Being on the 4th floor we had to wait for the elevator for ages before it finally came around as it stops for every single floor at the hotel, and moves rather slowly at that. The staff were not helpful and were not locals which made it hard for them to tell us where the nearby shops and stations were and how to get there. Also we were always offered to buy things off the hotel which was a bit irritating. The staff were really the only major bad side of the hotel. Other than that, the hotel was lovely, location was great as well due to the fact that it is very close to Paddington station which literally connects you to anywhere you would need and/or want to go in London. Overall we had a great stay and would come back and recommend!",4,2013,10,06
104,Comfortable stay,"Recently stayed at the hotel.
The staff was very friendly and was present to solve any problems we had.
The first night at the hotel was a bit tough due to bad wifi network and phone network as we were accommodated in the basement rooms. The problems were resolved as soon as we moved to the 5th floor of the hotel the very next day.
Avoid rooms in the basement at all costs.
Overall a great stay with good breakfast!",4,2013,10,03
104,"good location, tiny room, lots of stairs, no drinking water","Walkable from Paddington but make sure you get a room accessable by lift - a major haul for my baggage up narrow winding stairs - no porters available.  No umberellas, friendly staff, no fridge in room.  No airconditioning.",3,2013,10,03
104,best hotel i have stayed in in london,"I have been going to london once a year for the past 7/8 years and this is the best so far. The staff are friendly, helpful always smiling. The breakfast was excellent - hot food was hot and good choice. Plus good choice of continental items as well. Location is perfect for Paddington also.Room was different, entered into a sitting room, with mini kitchenand  sofa which converted to double bed and staircase up to main bedroom. Really comfortable. Bedside table lamp at sofa bed would be very useful. Overall very impressed and will look forward to a return visit.",5,2013,10,03
104,Review,"This has become my London hotel of choice for 3-4 London visits annually. The staff has been most helpful and friendly and I was amazed that one of the restaurant servers (sorry, I wish I knew her name) actually remembered me from a visit almost 4 months ago. Last visit the in-room fire alarm went off briefly 3 times - the staff was most apologetic, apparently something wafting up from the kitchens.",4,2013,10,01
104,Really quite lovely,"First, this is a great boutique hotel, not your typical chain. Its very unique and attractive. Pricing was reasonable and the staff was excellent.  Yes rooms are small but they are small in every hotel in London. We loved Trvestan and Jamal. They made everything so great and easy.  Location is okay, but central to everything including the subway, trains etc, but the area of Paddington itself is not impressive, but in 15 minutes you are at everything you could possibly want to see in London from there. Definetly would stay again and give a 4 star hotel rating for sure.",5,2013,10,01
104,Nice hotel,"We stayed nine nights at the Park Grand.  The staff were efficient, prompt, and polite.  (Thank you, Mr. Tushar, for going out of your way to insure that we were comfortable.)  Our stay was very pleasant.  The hotel is located just a few blocks from Paddington Station.  Armed with our Oyster Card, we visited all the major sights in London and then some.

104,"Great place, clean room, pleasant service, awesome location!","Great place, clean room, pleasant service, awesome location!
On the expensive side, but that seems to be London overall...
Within walking distance of restaurants; shopping and the hop on hop off bus! All you need for a short whirlwind London vacay!
Would recomend this hotel.",4,2013,09,30
104,EXCELLENT,"Stayed here for one night booked through secret hotel on lastminute.com and was well impressed. Very clean,tidy everything in your room you could want and helpful staff. Only two mins walk to underground and plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Never tried the hotel restaurant so cannot comment on their food
Would have no hesitation in staying here again",4,2013,09,30
104,Celebration Package,"Enjoyed our one night  stay at this hotel. The staff were very efficient, friendly and helpful. The room was clean and nicely decorated my only complaint would be that (even in September) it was quite warm and stuffy in the room. Perhaps it was because we were on the 6th floor but the 6th floor and up is better than the 3rd and below as the view from the rear of the building would be quite depressing down there. Fortunately the 6th floor provides a nice view of the Paddington rooftops. 
The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Paddington station and just round the corner from Hyde Park so really conveniently located. 
The cooked breakfast (we arrived at around 9am) was only warm and a little disconcerting, I overheard other guests were not entitled to the cooked breakfast here and I'm guessing pay a little less in room rates. However, if I were to stay at this hotel for more than 2 nights I'd probably prefer to get breakfast elsewhere and choose the cheaper room rate. There are plenty of place to eat around Paddington and a good full English can't be far away: I guarantee it would be hot!
Would I stay here again: Yes. Would I stay here for a week: yes, but if I could save money by getting breakfast elsewhere, I would.",4,2013,09,29
104,Great location,"Stayed for short break in London with my husband and could not fault the hotel which was nicely furnished and was in a great location. The shower was fantastic - the best in any hotel we have stayed in round the world!  Had English breakfast at hotel and although we are vegetarian there was plenty of choice.  The Park Grand is in a nice residential area of London which felt very safe, even after dark.  It is a 5 minute walk to Paddington Tube Station on Praed Street which also has lots of pubs and restaurants for evening meals.  A 10 minute walk from the hotel takes you to the beautiful Italian Garden in Kensington Gardens with a pleasant stroll onwards through Hyde Park, Green Park towards St James's Park and Buckingham Palace.  From there you can easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and the London Eye so no need for costly tube fares!  All in all a great few days in a good hotel - would definitely stay there again or one of the other Shaftesbury Hotels in London.",5,2013,09,28
104,Ideal location and welcoming,"Stayed here for a recent function in London, very welcoming from start to finish, even had an unexpected upgrade on arrival. Rooms clean, breakfast good, good value for money, didnt spend much time at the hotel but was perfect for what I wanted.",4,2013,09,28
104,No negatives..only positives...,"Stayed here for our 5th wedding anniversary , nice hotel,very helpful staff and breakfast was great,We stayed in  room 501,very big room with bath,room was very clean,wi-fi free and would highly recommend to everyone..",5,2013,09,27
104,"Good value, close to public transportation. Would definitely say here again","First off the room was small, but for European accommodations, I think the room was a reasonable size.  We were only at the hotel to sleep, so it served its purpose. The bathroom was clean!!!! This plays a major role in my choice of hotels and places to stay. Apart from the small room, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We did not hear any of our neighbors and the staff always greeted us with a hello and a smile as we entered the hotel.  ",3,2013,09,27
104,really a great find!,"Let me state first that this is boutique hotel, not a typical chain hotel yet that's what makes it so special and unique.  Centrally located to just about anywhere in london you want to go visit. For less that 200 pounds per night fora quadruple room =meaning  4 people can sleep in that room) it is a steal. Across the street is the Hilton facing McDonald's and burger king and for that hotel was 400 pounds a night. So, if you want a cute, very English boutique hotel with great staff, this is a great place. Be mindful, all hotels and bathrooms in london are small, so be prepared. Big shout out to Trvstan and jamal at the hotel. By far, they are the friendliest and most knowledgeable staff we have come across yet.  Off to Ireland today and will post about the Ashley hotel once we leave.",5,2013,09,26
104,Happy campers in London,"We stayed for 2 nights and had a nice and clean room, the breakfast was ok - but could have been better. The staff is nice and helpfull.

This hotel location is near Paddington station/underground - just a 5-7 min walk. Perfect! 

We recommend this and are considering staying here the next time we go to London.",4,2013,09,25
104,Pleasantly surprised,"Stop by London before moving on to Kent for a meeting, checked in early at 9am and the reception gladly checked us in (thumbs up!) and even more surprising as the normal room is not available yet, reception upgraded me to a duplex suite room.

The rooms is comfortable with average amenities but gives good value for the price paid!",4,2013,09,24
104,perfect,"we stayed here for thee night and it was perfect.

stafg was very helpful and very efficient.breakfast was available in basement restaurant and it was delicious.

our room was very big and spot clean.

i will recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2013,09,24
104,"Perfect Location, Perfect for Budget-Conscious",Just a five minute walk from Paddington Station (easily wheeled overstuffed luggage there and on to Heathrow) this pleasant hotel was surprisingly pleasant for the price (we were expecting shoebox rooms but that wasn't the case). And the room rate includes a decent breakfast. Our room was clean and comfy and very helpful staff. I will definitely stay here again. It made my London trip so much more enjoyable and stress-free.,4,2013,09,24
104,Stop over in London,"Got in earlier than check in but the front desk organised my room for me. Friendly and warm people, They are very helpful. They also recognized i was a frequent guest and i was happy about that. I will certainly come back again.",5,2013,09,23
104,Great stay and amazing breakfast......,"My husband and I stayed here in mid August and we had an amazing experience. The reception staff was welcoming, and polite. They explained us in brief about the hotel, it's wifi the breakfast timings and all. The luggage porter took us to the room. The room was clean and tidy. Everything was perfect, we also had a fruit platter n a small bottle of wine n some soft drinks. We had enough space in the room for us to walk around the bed and for keeping our luggage as well.
Breakfast was included in our package and it was amazing, the restaurant manager and his staff managed the breakfast so professionally, ensuring all the guest are happy. Hot and cold food both were yummy. 
Our overall stay was amazing, we would surely be back again.
",5,2013,09,22
104,Hidden exchange rates.,"Me and my family stayed here in mid July timeframe. It was a very pleasant stay. Great service by the staff, very cordial and helpful.
Only surprise was later when I checked my credit card. Since I am from US, I had expected them to charge me in pounds and then in turn the credit card company would charge me based on the exchange rate with the typical 3% finance charge (this is the best options for travellers). I was surprised to find that the hotel had charged me in US dollars with a absurd exchange rate. Hence watch out for this, unsure if this is a general practice.",3,2013,09,21
104,Good Stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights on a bed and breakfast basis. The hotel is well situated and the staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good and again all of the staff in this area extended a warm welcome.
My only niggle is the room-we booked a superior room and were given 007 in the basement-the room was well presented and very clean and was well serviced during our stay but it was not a superior room-my suspicion is that all the rooms are called superior rooms-I did ask the question but the only other room available was another basement room. It did not spoil our stay as we were out each day but it did feel a little as if we had been promised one thing and been given another.
But overall an enjoyable hotel and nice staff-we would come again.",4,2013,09,17
104,A really good hotel in Paddington,"I have stayed at this hotel 2 times and will probably continue to do it. I love this hotel! Very nice hotel rooms. Close to subway, trains and buses (Paddington). The staff was very nice and good! And there is free wifi!",5,2013,09,16
104,TERRIBLE STAY,"I would nor recommend this hotel to anyone 
The website is deceiving it is in my opinion only good for a 2 star the rooms are smaller than a dog kennel shabby d√©cor for example toilet tissues stiffed into door hadles to stiffen them up etc 
breakfast a joke ran out of sausages etc everyone complaining large hols in the frontage watch your car no bar we had to drink outside  
everything that a hotel should not be trust me",1,2013,09,16
104,A great hotel in a quiet yet central location,"A very pleasant stay in a clean and comfortable hotel. Staff were very helpful & friendly even letting us check in at 8.30 am as our room was available when we arrived to drop our bag off before heading off to the triathlon championships in Hyde park. There was a problem with the fire alarm which people may complain about as it went off at 5.30 am, however it was shut down within seconds and these things happen. Best not to sweat the small stuff. My only minor issue was the mattress was starting to get a roll on it & I only weigh 8 stone! Other than that all excellent & we would return.",5,2013,09,15
104,"Great location, affordable accommodation and a king of a breakfast","My husband and I stayed here as a base for exploring London and surrounding areas. We arrived very early (6.30am)  and the hotel happily stored our bags to enable to kick off a day of exploring and to stave off jet lag. It is closely located to Hyde and Kensington Parks - which are lovely for a walk and Paddington Station is only 5 minutes walking distance away and is access to Kings Cross for major European trains.

 We were also able to easily mix our days with walking and jumping on a Hop On, Hop Off bus, which had bus stops very close by. The rooms were very clean and modern (although a small bar fridge would be handy to have) with a nice shower - perfect as it was simply a base for sleeping. A very nice breakfast was included in the price - which was great value and we tended to eat a good breakfast and only snack during the day while exploring.",4,2013,09,08
104,Fantastic value and well located.,"The staff were friendly. The location was excellent being centrally located and just off the main routes, meaning that it was quiet. The breakfast was also excellent.
Thankfully the glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom had a screen. There was a fridge, a safe, tea and coffee making facilities and ironing facilities in the room adding to convenience and comfort. The room was also spotlessly clean. Great value for money.
Why stay anywhere else?",5,2013,09,08
104,"Good place, excellent staff","Enjoyed my single room not huge but comfortable. 

Well placed only 5 minutes from Paddington train st and about 10 minutes from the restaurants of Queensway.

Free wifi is a bonus but the best thing about the place was welcoming friendly staff.",4,2013,09,04
104,Excellent hotel in central London,"The Park Grand hotel is ""my"" hotel in London because it is simply prefect for my business needs as it combining all 3 key elements: great hotel & service, great location and reasonable pricing. 
‚Ä¢	Hotel & service, the grand park rooms are very spacious, clean, well decorated and quiet. The team is very friendly and is always taking the extra mile to make guests happy and the breakfast is rich and vegis like me also enjoy it.
‚Ä¢	The hotel is located 5 minutes from London Paddington station which means it's only few minutes from the Heathrow express and it is very convenient especially when arriving late and yet distant enough from the station noise. The hotel is located 2 minutes from the Paddington tube and 8 minutes by foot from the central line which means less than 30 min from my room door to the city.
All the above is for very reasonable pricing and the best thing is to book online at the hotel website.",5,2013,09,02
104,Space among cramped spaces,"I was not expecting the hotel to be spacious, considering earlier experience of similarity priced hotels, the location is amazing, staff good over all great value for money, 
The best part being location and size of rooms",4,2013,08,31
104,Very rude and unprofessional hotel staff. Unpleasant stay and more staff training is required.,"This was the far most unpleasant service I have ever experienced, especially in London. 
In terms of location and room quality, it is accessible and reasonably tidy. However, the attitude of the hotel staff was terrible, making the entire stay very stressful.

I changed my travel itinerary so I gave them a call 2 days in advanced to check if they have room and the staff said yes and I could check-in earlier with the same booking room rate. When I arrived, they said there were no rooms available and they didn't see any updates on my booking. 25 mins later, they managed to get me a room but they have to charge as at a walkin price, which is completely different from what I have agreed with the hotel staff before on the phone. The staff refused to investigate and explain. What they did was simply there is no early check-in on the reservation system and requested me to pay all my room nights upfront before entering the room as a guarantee/deposit. As a frequent traveller, I understand that what hotels do is to block that amount of money in your credit card and charge upon checkout.  Prior to this trip, I have double checked the term too. In addition, ""paying room nights upfront"", ""guarantee"" and ""deposit"" are 3 very different terms when it comes to payment. 

I was confused and I thought there was something I overlooked so I politely and patiently asked the staff if he could explain and investigate further. I was the only person at the check-in desk and I am very certain that the staff can accommodate my request. The staff started getting very annoyed and start saying this is due with ""the hotel policy"", ""the UK Law"" (for paying all room nights upfront) and ""this is the normal practise for all hotels"". They challenged me by asking whether I have travelled abroad before and ""why 'you people' are so difficult?!"". He followed this conversation by saying ""I have no patient anymore and I don't want to talk to you so please go and goodbye!"" I felt extremely disrespected and humiliated. I felt like a criminal rather than a guest. If I was the person who is being impolite and rude in the first place, I can see why a hotel staff can act like this. But I wasn't even yelling to anyone throughout the discussion. All I want to know is to understand what I am paying for before I pay (btw, the hotel will not issue an official receipt until you check out so apart from having the bank receipt of how much in total you are paying for, you don't really know the breakdown). 

The length humiliation went one for an hour and since it was already too late to book a room elsewhere, I have no choice but to pay. Overall, the experience reflects insufficient training of staff and knowing that this is part of a hotel chain company, I am absolutely disappointed to their service.",1,2013,08,31
104,"Good location, very clean","We stayed for 3 nights in Aug 13 and had a really enjoyable stay. Our room was very clean and had everything we needed, the aircon was great as it was very hot outside, the room was very quiet too! The staff was very helpful with room service and when we wanted to book an extra night.
The location was one if the best things for us, we drive there and used the car park no problem. Padding station is only a few minutes walk away which is handy to get to anywhere by tube! 
We will be returning for our next visit to London!! ",4,2013,08,30
104,Very good hotel near Paddington Station,"We had a Quad superior room for 2 adults and 2 kids.

The room was spacious enough for all of us, the bathroom a bit small but decent.

In the room is not much space for clothes, only a very small closet, not scaled for 4 people.

The room was cleaned very well, and the staff was very friendly and helpfull.

Breakfast was very good with enough choice. At some tables, it was to cold because of the airco

One minor thing, during our stay (6nights) we had at least 5 times fire alarm in the room, one time in the middle of the night. This is not convenient

On the location, Lancaster gate and Paddington station are in walking distance, which gives you a lot of possibilities to use several metro-lines. In the neighbourhood of Paddington station you have a broad choice of restaurants, we did several with very decent food. The vila Rosa was for us the best Italian, Bizarro's also good Italian, Kolossi Greek very good, and the Garfunkels was very expensive with not so good quality and service.

Overal we had a good stay in this hotel",4,2013,08,30
104,"Nice, comfortable, reasonable price.","Stayed in here for whilst on business in July, 

Upon arrival, got upgraded to a better room, clean, comfortable and quiet. Service was polite and courteous. 

I had stayed in another branch of this hotel (across the road) so knew what to expect. 

Ideal location, close to many bars, restaurants and tube station. 

Didnt have the breakfast as it wasnt included in the room and didnt want to pay the inflated price for it !

Would definitely stay here again, hard to find an alternative for the quality, price and location.",4,2013,08,30
104,location price quality- great value,"was there with a friend for 3 nights in june 2013. we were often in london before and so we were able to appreciate all the gexcellent  things of this hotel, location, internet, breakfast, staff, comfort, clean, fresh.
I can only recommend it and hope to have a room there for my next trip.",5,2013,08,30
104,Great location and friendly,"Just stayed one night. I explained when I booked that as I was traveling with my 2 sons that 3 single beds would be ideal, but I was prepared to end up with a double and a sofa bed. However reservations rang me before we arrived and said they had sorted it, and they had. Although the room was small we had 3 very comfortable beds in a row which was great. Our room was high, I think 6th floor, but there was a lift, and it was at the back of the hotel so very quiet. So with the air con we had a very good nights sleep. Bathroom was small but adequate. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included in our price. It was ok but I've had better, but I'm not comparing London hotels so maybe it's good for London, staff again were very nice. Useful bits of info - Bath room had shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. There was a kettle with tea, coffee and bics. We used this when we arrived and could have done with it being restocked. Wished I had taken some herb tea bags. Was able to leave our bag to collect later. Had a nice meal by the canal, just a 5 Minute walk away, where there was a choice of bars and restaurants. If you're tired and want somewhere close it was great. So close to Paddington station.",4,2013,08,29
104,Good hotel for price,"Stayed there at August for 13 days with 13-year daughter. The hotel is very clean, has a good location in a nice neighbourhood. Room is not big, like usually in most of hotels in London but enough comfortable. Unfortunatelly did not take breakfast (cost is enough high in 15 GBP) and could not say anything about it. Staff is friendly. Very good transport infrastructure near (bus, tube, train station).",4,2013,08,28
104,Excellent value for money,"I chose this hotel given its proximity to Paddington station and the services provided.  I was very happy with my stay overnight and would recommend it to other travellers.  The staff were very helpful and kind, the room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable.  The internet access worked really well and the desk allowed for plenty of working space.",4,2013,08,28
104,Loved it!,"This was the second stay at a Shaftesbury hotel in London, and I will definitive stay with them the next time. The staff are friendly, the hotel has a good location in a safe and quiet neighbourhood, the hotel is vey clean and rooms are comfortable, good bath rooms and beds. Our shower was broken and they fixed it in 5 minutes. Close to subway, the park and Paddington Station.",5,2013,08,27
104,Pleasant Visit,"We were originally booked at the Park Grand Paddington, but due to an undisclosed ""mechanical problem"" with our room, we were shuffled off to the Hyde Park upon arrival. It was a little disorienting, but the staff were all apologies and paid for our cab. We were also given complimentary breakfasts for our trouble, which was a nice gesture. (There was a bit of a dispute about this upon checkout, since we had an extra breakfast guest one day. The restaurant hostess told us the charge for him would be free, but the fellow at reception wanted to charge us. Ultimately, we were given the breakfast, but it ended our stay on a sour note, especially given our previous troubles!)

Our room at the Hyde Park was pretty nice, though it we didn't have a lot of space to move around. (The single bed seemed to be in a different room than the double bed, but there was no door separating the two; it was a little odd!) The beds were comfortable and the bathroom, though small, was very clean. It was a nuisance only having one elevator in the hotel, especially when leaving with our luggage, but it was only a minor inconvenience in the end.

By far, I think the best thing about this hotel is the location. It's set back from the road a bit, so there's little noise. And it's just two blocks away from Paddington, which puts it a bit closer than our original hotel! There are a number of restaurants and pubs nearby, but it's far enough away from the hustle and bustle of London to provide a more relaxing atmosphere.

While I think we might have enjoyed our stay in the Park Grand Paddington a bit more, especially given the price we paid, we found the Park Grand Hyde Park to be adequate for our needs.",4,2013,08,23
104,Like being at home,"I ended up in this hotel as the original hotel I booked had a flood! The staff were outstanding. They were helpful, polite, cheery, professional and genuinely cared about making sure I enjoyed my stay. The rooms are cozy but extremely comfortable. Cooked breakfast was mmmmmmmüòò. Location is great to do or see anything in London. I 100% would select this hotel and the hotel group again. Has to be said though all the hotel staff deserve 10/10. ",5,2013,08,22
104,good hotel,"We stayed here(self , wife and 16 year old) for one of the Hyde Park concerts and would certainly stay here again if in the area.
The hotel was having some refurbishments done to it but they did not impact on our stay at all.
Our room was a good size with a very nice bathroom. No complaints about this. We all enjoyed the breakfast though probably better to get there a little earlier as can get quite busy.

Overall happy with our stay and no complaints over any aspect of our stay.",4,2013,08,21
104,Nice and clean,"We booked a room for three persons and it was nice and clean, also spacious enough. We were in London during a hot period and were happy to have air condition. Close to Paddington station with several tube lines as well as the Heathrow express.",4,2013,08,16
104,"Nice Location , Poor hotel.","We checked in and were happy to find out that we were upgraded to a deluxe suite or a room. The room which we were in was small and poorly designed, very small , so small that it made me wonder about the normal room if we were not upgraded. The room was so small that you can't even move around if another person is standing in the room. No space to keep luggage and its so tight to walk in the room that you keep on banging yourself to the furniture.Its a four star hotel, I wonder on what basis they've got it. Restaurant is in the basement which actually doesn't gives the feel of a restaurant.No drinking water was kept in the room not even a bottle, we had to ask for it and were charged for it. Now I am not complaining here that I had to pay for it but forget a mini bar but atleast I would expect a bottle of drinking water on the arrival in the room if I am checking into a four star hotel room which is situated in the heart of london.Not really satisfied with the hotel & would look for another options definitely  when we visit next time.",2,2013,08,15
104,Very enjoyable stay,Very enjoyable stay in a lovely hotel. Staff were all a pleasure nothing was too much trouble. Would recommend this hotel and would stay again. Location was good once we got to grips with the underground system and although out of the city centre was accessible for all attractions.,4,2013,08,13
104,a weekend spoiled,"We had booked a 2 night stay at the Park Grand London Hyde Park but were told, not asked, that we were being moved to this hotel. On arrival the reception staff were surly and offered no apology. We were in room 224 which we struglled to find! No instructions were given to find the room or indeed any information about breakfast!
The room was so small we just looked at each other in amazement! The bed looked like a single. The shower was so poor that I struggled to rinse my hair properly. The side light shade was hanging off! 
That night we slept so badly we toyed with the idea of one of us sleeping on ther floor!
Some of ther staff were lovely especially in the dining room and on the door. The room was clean but far too small.",1,2013,08,12
104,Nice hotel close to Paddington Underground,"A nice and comfortable hotel, close to Paddington tube station.
Comfortable beds and quiet. 
Breakfast was perfect and staff very helpful and service minded.
The area was also nice and it's a walkng distance to Hyde Park.",4,2013,08,12
104,Well situated for Paddington,Room tiny and this let the hotel down. We had booked for a discount but expected more space especially as we had booked a superior twin room. Good choice at breakfast and waiting staff were friendly and efficient.,3,2013,08,11
104,Highly recommended,"We only spent one night in this Hotel but was shown the same courtesy we would have expected for a fortnight stay. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room very clean although bathroom would be a little small for some. However,rather this than a cramped room. Lovely building - made a change from staying in the usual sterile 'all rooms exactly the same' Inns and Lodges so many of us tend to use these days. Good value for money. Close to tube and rail.Would stay again and recommend to friends.",5,2013,08,11
104,Recommend,"Lovely hotel very close to Paddington Station.  Room very comfortable and clean.  Bathroom clean and tidy, shower good size.  Although room is not large, was set up to use space well. Air conditioning worked well and breakfast was quite nice with a good selection of items.   Did I say clean?  That is my #1 priority when travelling and this place met my expectations. Staff very helpful with getting us taxi and airport transportation.  The only downside for us was that there were no decent restaurants nearby....sometimes you need a quick bite and don't want to go far.",4,2013,08,08
104,Nice hotel in a convenient location,"We booked this hotel because of the proximity to Paddington Station.  It's about a ten minute walk but if you have a lot of luggage, be aware that the sidewalks can be crowded and manuevering difficult.  That being said, we had no real problem and taxis are available.  When we arrived at the hotel (at about 9:30AM), we were greeted warmly and told our room would be ready in about an hour. They stored our luggage while we went sightseeing.  When we returned, we were given a room on the third floor.  It was a large room with a sitting area, bathroom, and kitchenette on the main floor with a sleeping loft upstairs.  The room was very comfortable and immaculate.  The bathroom was very small but stylish and spotless.  Even though the room overlooked the street, it was quiet.  We never could get the air conditioning to work but it was fine because the room was reasonably cool so we didn't bother to ask for help.
Other reviewers have mentioned tiny, single rooms so I would suggest reserving one of the larger, two story rooms if possible. We didn't have breakfast so I can't comment on that.
Overall, this is a nice, boutique hotel on a lovely tree lined street in a convenient location.  I highly recommend it and would definitely stay there in the future.",4,2013,08,08
104,Location,"This hotel is ideally situated a two min walk from Paddington tube station. Very central and would def stay here again for this reason. The hotel is clean,staff friendly and breakfast is good. The twin room was quite small but was practical for what we needed,good air con and comfortable beds. The bar is been renovated at the moment which to our annoyance we didn't know about till we arrived, one night we asked for room service (paninis and minerals) which is on the guest information book, but were told it was not possible but they could organise pizzas. They dropped a chipper menu up to us, we got two pizzas and two cokes ¬£25 complete rip off. We were also asked to pay a ¬£30 deposit when we arrived which didn't make sense either as my card was already guaranteed for the booking. The fire alarms went off one morning at 6:15am for a few seconds and again one night at 11:30pm for a few seconds. Also staff were having were having a very personal explicit conversation behind the counter,which really should have been kept for behind closed doors and not in front of customers.",5,2013,08,01
104,liked,"Really liked my stay there. Location's perfect for my needs, next to Paddington station. Room's tidy, staff's friendly, price's reasonable. It's an excellent choice, if not expecting too much of a 4 star hotel in London",5,2013,07,31
104,Highly recommended!,"Booked a Superior Double room - Inc. English Breakfast for 2 nights.
Driving into London was no problem, arrived at the hotel and could park in front of the hotel for a small charge (20 Pounds/day).
The staff is very nice, rooms are very clean, including bath/shower, tv and airco, which was very welcome as it was very warm. Bed is very comfortable and had a really good night rest. Breakfast very good, good choice and staff again is very nice and helpful.
Paddington Station/Underground is nearly around the corner. 
We did have an amazing time and we will go soon again!",4,2013,07,30
104,could be better,"booked 2 x double rooms for sat 27/07/13 when arrived at reception were told rooms not available at this hotel problem with boiler ? was sent to sister hotel further down the road maybe the name put us off "" Grand"" because there was nothing grand about the hotel we were sent to.
Acknowledge problems can cause issues so accepting change of hotel was ok. we did expect given the location something a bit higher standard. The room we were sent to on the 4th floor was a mess with laundry all over the floor, found a cleaner who did get somebody to clear the room. It was ok but the very small bathroom was ridiculous, I am not the largest of guys but having a shower was a work of art , the bathroom was also a bit smelly with a cracked floor tile missing indices on shower valves and whoever chose the two wall lights has never tried to have a shave and a wash in the basin because of the excessive heat being given off the lights. One good point breakfast was spot on good choice of foods , very clean and tidy and service was fine.
I know the room was only ¬£121.63 per room and given the location not too bad value however it could be better.",3,2013,07,30
104,Not quite as expected!!,"We were booked in to this hotel through Expedia. On arrival we were told they had ""boiler problems"" and the rooms had no hot water. They arranged for a car to take us round the corner to the Hyde Park Premier Paddington where we were offered 2 rooms in the basement - one with no window!!! It was 27 degrees in London that day! We declined and were offered 2 more rooms on the top floor - very musty smell. Again we declined and asked for an alternative. Another short walk around the corner and we were finally located in the Best Western Shaftesbury Paddington Court Hotel - which was in a different league! Rooms small but clean and comfortable and proper air conditioning which was wonderful! And they threw in free breakfast which went a long way to cheer us up after the initial hassle!! A bad start turned out all right in the end but be assertive and don't let them give you sub-standard accommodation!",3,2013,07,29
104,Superbly comfortable,"There have been very mixed reviews of this hotel so I really wasnt sure what to expect.  I booked a twin room for myself and my 14 year old niece.  The reception staff were very friendly and I expect the nice lady took a shine to my niece as we were upgraded to a duplex.  The sofa bed in room 125 was downstairs and looked rather uncomfortable but my young companion slept like a log.  I had the big bed upstairs and had the best night's sleep I've ever had in London.  Despite the AC not working the room wasn't overly hot.  The shower room is admittedly tiny, but the shower itself is fantastic.  We didn't have the cooked breakfast but enjoyed a continental breakfast.  The hotel is 5 mins walk from Pad station and 8 mins from Lancaster Gate tube, we were there for the Anniversary Games at the Olympic Stadium so the location was perfect.  My niece visits London fairly regularly and said she'd definitely stay there again, as would I.   The staff were fantastic - friendly, quiet and professional.  Thank you to all who made our stay so memorable and enjoyable.",4,2013,07,29
104,Very Helpful & Professional staff,"Despite mix-ups on payment by our travel agent, the management and staff made us feel welcome and comfortable.  Our room was upgraded and very pleasant, especially the fruit, tea and coffee service.  The location was within walking distance to parks and busses and made getting around very convenient for our first time visit to London.  We look forward to our next stay and will book on line.",5,2013,07,27
104,Well priced close to Paddington station,"We chose this hotel due to its proximity to Paddington Station which is about 5 minutes walk, and not wanting to pay Hilton prices. We were upgraded and had an adequately sized room with a mezzanine ""sitting room"". The bathroom was serviceable with a reasonably sized shower cubicle. All in all, quite comfortable. Service was good and friendly, and the breakfast was quite sufficient and very efficient. Don't bother with the bar service. Would probably stay there again, given the same single night need, but probably not for an extended stay. Better than ""average"" but not quite ""very good"".",4,2013,07,27
104,Strictly Average,"Not quite the luxury 4* as advertised. Room was good size with good facilities although furniture and furnishings are tired and could really do with an overhaul - (bedroom had a weird smell! Maybe the air con??)
Limited selection of cooked food for breakfast, and barely warm - stick with cereal and toast!
Staff friendly and helpful, and hotel is in a good location for Paddington station.
I would rate this hotel as 3* but no more.",3,2013,07,26
104,"Great Place,wonderful staff","My wife and I stayed  at the hotel  for five days. The hotel was well located in Paddington with easy access to the London Underground and buses, all within walking distance.

The staff-- both at the reception desk and in the restaurant were  obliging,  friendly. helpful,dignified and behaved very professionally. 

The breakfast room was clean and smartly laid out with ample spacing between customers.

The breakfast itself was of good quality, matching the AA four star rating given to the hotel.

The ladies who cleaned our room wee exceptional. The rooms were kept spick and span and most of all were vacuumed regularly,

The hotel has been refurbished recently and remains well maintained. Hot and cold water were plentiful and instantaneous. The lift worked well, WiFi was free and that was a bonus,

The one negative point was that the security safe in our room was not bolted to the shelf making it easy for a thief to walk out with the safe and its contents --, irrespective of the security cameras on the premises This should be rectified.

We enjoyed our stay thoroughly and  will be happy to recommend the hotel to hour friends.
We will return next year.

104,Excellent stay,"Room was very clean and everything we needed for our stay, staff were helpful and friendly. Excellent breakfast included in the price. I would recommend this hotel. 
Very well located close to Paddington and Hyde Park.",5,2013,07,25
104,Great place,"Great place to stay. Very close to Paddington Station. Hotel staff were welcoming and friendly and very helpful especially Tusher the Manager, who moved me to another room on request. Breakfast was good. Will stay again.",4,2013,07,25
104,Excellent service,"My friend and I stayed for two nights and had excellent service from a friendly and helpful staff who went above and beyond to serve us. Our room, though not what we initially booked, was beautiful. The breakfast was delicious, and the hotel location couldn't have been more convenient. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,07,24
104,Not what I was expecting,"Well after seeing the hotel online I had high hopes. I booked the top grade room and I'm very disappointed. First of all it took 20minutes to check in as they only had 1 member of staff on reception, then the lift wasn't working properly, I checked into my room 123 which was one of the smallest yet the most expensive!? The bedroom was tiny, bathroom smaller than my downstairs toilet at home - no exaggeration, and I was really disappointed that I couldn't unlock the doors for the balcony- apparently it was safe years ago but not anymore! Their excuse was ""health and safety"" - its a balcony with lovely iron fencing- what's unsafe!? No card to leave on door to order breakfast and so spoke to reception who said breakfast is served 7:30am! I was really shocked because it didn't mention that on booking and i would have expected many people having to be up before that especially in London. My train is at 7am, he offered cereals and orange juice - no croissants though as they are delivered frozen a s they aren't allowed to heat anything without a chef! Hmmm not 4* at all and certainly not worth the expense! A premier inn is better.",3,2013,07,22
104,Great place to stay when visiting London,Stayed here for one night as going for the concert.hotel is  walking distance to cafes in paddington and the underground.Reception staff was welcoming on arrival and gave us room on high floor and near to elevator as we requested.Room had plenty of hanging and drawer space.tea/coffee facilities with iron /ironing board and hairdryer were all appreciated.After a long tiring day the bed was very comfortable.we loved the fact we can enter gates to hyde park after walking few minutes.best thing for me was being so close to everything but far enough away from london busy streets to enjoy the park area.On leaving the reception staff asked if we wanted to store any luggage and were very pleasant and helpful.this hotel will be our first choice when visiting london in future.,5,2013,07,22
104,"Great Location, Great Hotel","Lovely room, already re-booked for November 15th for 2 nights for a girls Christmas shopping trip.  Good location where you can leave your luggage, making the last day of your trip free to do what you want, without having to drag cases around with you.",5,2013,07,22
104,"Wonderful service,fabulous location","The hotel is perfectly located with minutes walk to Paddington ; easy access to Hyde park .The beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean and the breakfast is well served .All the staff are very friendly and courteous. They did exceptional good service in resolving payment issue with the travel agent and ensuring to put my mind at ease . A great hotel to stay while visiting London.",5,2013,07,21
104,Considered leaving for another hotel mid-stay,"Generally poor experience starting from the time I walked into the (first) room.

Poor:
* Air conditioning was not working in the room - two or three of the hotel staff then spend an hour being unhelpful (""just open the window"" / ""it'll work in 5 or 10 minutes, just wait"") or fobbing me off (""it's really busy at Reception at the moment, someone will come up in 5 or 10 minutes"" - after waiting another 20 minutes I go down to find Reception is deserted), before I finally get a new room

* Laundry form explains that clothes are returned 7pm the same day, they pick it up from your room and laundry bags are stocked in the room. However, no laundry bags are ever stocked in the room, on one day they didn't even pick up my laundry, and one staff member helpfully explained that the laundry never arrives until 9 or 9.30pm - it's the traffic, you see.

* One morning, instead of just picking up my laundry, the person at Reception mis-heard me and sent someone up who took my suitcase (but not my clothes, toiletries or day-bag...?). It's the sort of horror scenario you imagine - middle of a trip and your suitcase just disappears. Luckily it was just a mistake, but a scary one.

* Website says there's a business centre but it was under renovation during my stay, so the business centre was a tiny desk with a computer sitting right next to a doorway in a thoroughfare.

I gave the hotel manager some feedback mid-stay and he called me in my room. He wanted to alleviate the situation, offering wine and fruit - which I declined, but suggested that they just provide the service they promise. The manager promised they would. Two days after that, was when my laundry didn't get collected. At least the manager ended up waiving my laundry costs for the trip, which I thought was fair enough.

Good:
* There was a trainee who helped me check-in and was genuinely helpful. When my laundry hadn't come back at 9pm she asked me what time I would be up in the morning and they'd send my clothes up first thing. She treated my problem as her problem and then solved it. Thank you.

* Breakfast - food was good, staff were friendly, tea was hot. By the fifth morning I didn't have to give my room number any more.

* Rates - well, it wasn't expensive.",2,2013,07,20
104,great hotel,"We stayed here and were happy with our room,location and excellent service which was given to us.we will recommend this hotel to my friend and family.there are plenty of option for breakfast and only problem was non availability of night food.bulmer Chris",5,2013,07,19
104,Not what it says on the net,"Looks lovely from the outside and is only a few minutes round the corner from paddington tube station. I ended up paying twice as the hotel took a payment when I booked (even though it states on the website that no payment is taken until check in). Room is a lot smaller than it looks it on the website, also the massive beds are merely two single beds put together and were very uncomfortable. The free broadband is pretty crap. All the staff I dealt with were polite and friendly and were helpful adding and removing a cot for my daughter. the free breakfast is good and offers a wide selection. The house keeping staff seem to do the basic task of making the bed and changing towels.",2,2013,07,18
104,"Good accomodation, patchy staff service, excellent location.","I stayed here for 5 nights in late June, joined by my partner and dad for 2 of those nights.
My visit didn't start very well.  I had booked a ""Club"" room for the extra space (we had a lot of luggage) but upon arriving in the room I discovered that most of the floor area was located up 16 (narrow) stairs on a mezanine floor!
Heading back to reception to request a different room I was told that they were fully booked for the evening.  I agreed to accept the room for the evening and move rooms the following day but had to insist that when my (quite fit but 87 yr old) dad arrived a day later, he would need a room without stairs.  The reception staff seemed to think this was a little unreasonable and asked if I'd specifically requested rooms without stairs?
Hello?  Seriously, when was the last time you stayed in a hotel room with 16 steps in it???
I replied that I had checked the hotel had a lift and Dad would be happy to traverse a few steps (it's a UK hotel after all) but 16?
However, by the following morning things had taken a turn for the better as the receptionist I spoke with knew about my room move, had checked that Dad's room was basically on one level and was very pleasant.
The buffet breakfast supplied (and the breakfast room itself) was very enjoyable every morning.  The staff there were also very helpful and friendly and the morning's papers were an added bonus.
You can't fault the location.  In leafy Westbourne Tce it's a short, pleasant walk to Paddington Station and from there, just a tube ride to anywhere in London and beyond.
I would stay here again, I'd just check the exact room layout first.  :-)",4,2013,07,18
104,Nice hotel with wonderful staff,"What a wonderful hotel. Beautiful,well cared for,terrific service and a fabulous breakfast buffet. The hotel room was very clean and spacious.Staff had been wonderful, very helpful with giving all information 
Will come back on next trip to London",5,2013,07,18
104,What an awful experience,"Stayed for 2 nights for our anniversary as it appeared to be quite a good deal, however this was a deal for Wembley stadium which is not the easiest to get to from here using public transport and cost ¬£40 in a cab each way. As for the hotel, well you get what you pay for I suppose. on the first evening on returning to our room we had no nights which continued for nearly 24 hours. No apology or offer to change our room. Eventually sorted but no offer off a reduction at check out and actually denied any knowledge of there being an issue, staff pretty rude for the most-part and when I requested some form of reimbursement no eye contact was made and the receptionist just thrust a piece of paper in my hand with the managers email address on. Once we had returned home I emailed the manager and got the offer of a free night's accommodation which I declined and then a 20% off my stay offer which I consider an insult as this would only cover 30% of the room cost for 1 night that we had no lighting. 
Better staying at a Premier in for a fraction of the cost and the VERY basic amenities..",1,2013,07,16
104,"Great Value, We will be back!","We're just back from London after going to the Rolling Stones gig at Hyde Park last night. I rarely write reviews on hotels but I have to rate this one. Considering the price we paid, I cannot recommend this hotel enough. We paid a little extra for a deluxe room but still a great price for a hotel in London at the weekend during the summer.

All the staff were excellent, very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning but they stored our luggage free of charge and gave us helpful information on near by tube stops and even a map.

Our room was a good size for a london hotel and exceptionally clean. We were even given fruit and bottled water when we got into our room. The location was perfect for Hyde Park and Paddington tube stop is within walking distance.

We had a bit of a wait on the Sunday morning for breakfast as the restaurant was full but totally acceptable for 10am on a weekend morning! The breakfast was excellent, lots of fresh fruit, continental options and cooked options too.

All in all, a very good hotel and great value for money. Thank you, we will be back!!",5,2013,07,14
104,"Great, just need bigger rooms","Stayed for a single night

Pros:
Great location close to Paddington station
Short distance to Oxford Street & Hyde Park
Excellent service
Clean, modern rooms
Good breakfast
Good value for a London room

Cons:
Tiny rooms
Corridor smell a bit stuffy, tight and its too many doors don't help you when dragging your luggage. 

If it weren't for the room size it would be a 5* review.
If you don't mind the room size, then I recommend.",4,2013,07,14

104,Excellent,"We stayed here after a gig in Hyde Park. There is about 10 parking spaces outside and luckily we got one. The room was 3 singles for 3 men and was great value for a Saturday night. Complimentary wine, fruit and soft drinks in the room was a nice touch and lots of TV channels. The breakfast was great and the staff so helpful. Apart from maybe not getting a parking space I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2013,07,09
104,Great Hotel,"The Hotel itself was superb for the relatively good price.  The rooms, and especially the bathroom were extremely small.  But for a 2 or 3 night stay this is not a problem.  The rooms were clean, the air con didn't work in one of the rooms (not usually a problem in London but we had the hottest weekend of the year so far!).  The annoying thing was that the Key Card kept not working and reception had to keep resetting it.  The breakfasts were super and filling.",4,2013,07,09
104,Very Disappointing,"I booked this hotel back in February. A couple of weeks ago I received an email from them to advise me that there had been a problem authorising the card I had used when booking.  I called them and quoted the card number again and they told me everything was now OK and my booking was confirmed.  I asked them if they could email me confirmation, but was told they didn't need to as everything was fine.  When we arrived at the hotel, there seemed an awful lot of commotion going on and we soon realised that the people in front of us had also received the same email as us. We were all advised that our rooms had been double booked and there was no where for us to stay. Some guests walked out in tears. We stood our ground and eventually they found us a room in a sister hotel around the corner. It all seemed strange that the very next day I heard exactly the same thing going on in the hotel we had been moved to - The Park Grand London Paddington.  The staff didn't seem fazed by all the booking mishaps - seems to me, it's the norm!!!! The room we were moved to was next door to the storage cupboard so we were awake early with all the banging around and the fire alarm went off by mistake and we had to change our door key as ours was faulty......I don't normally moan this much, but just felt that this needed to be aired......",1,2013,07,09
104,"Like others, moved to another hotel.","After a long day of traveling, arrived at this hotel to be told, like others, that a ""boiler"" was down so some rooms did not have hot water and we had to be moved to another of their hotels. Quite disappointing but what could we do. They paid for a car to take us to the other hotel and gave us complimentary breakfast for he 3 days we were there. We were placed at the Hyde Park Premier London Paddington. Luckily this hotel was good.",3,2013,07,08
104,Really dissapointing...,"We were really looking forward to our stay as the reviews had been so good, what a disappointment.
Okay so the good points - location is excellent, 10min walk from paddington station and hyde park. Perfect for us. The rate was reasonable and the room was clean.
But...the room was absolutely tiny. We read it would be quite small, but it was actually like a corridor...see attached pics. We werent too upset with that though, it was only a room to sleep in.
However the air conditioning in the heat wave of the weekend we were down, started leaking through the night - but as the room was so tiny it was right above the bed waking me up as the bed was soaked...so bed pulled out and towels on the floor til the morning.
We complained and they moved us to another room - presumably an upgrade as it was a half decent size. But low and behold...the air con unit did exactly the same thing about an hour after we were in bed....thankfully it wasnt above the bed this time, but the constant dripping was irritating but we figured why complain that night as its obviously the air con units they use so every room will be the same.
Anoher issue was breakfast in the morning. The first morning was a disaster, it's far too small for that many guests - they should really be asking guests to book for breakfast as that would be preferable if the service as better. The poor waitresses were running about, barely enough time to clear tables hence we were seated at a filthy table with coffee stains and old cereal on it, werent offered and hot drinks and most of the juices etc had run out. Lots of complaining guests that morning as a result.
Finally on check out we waited for the question ""how was your stay?"" but it never came...silly us, as we'd paid in advance so we got the feeling they didnt care. When we complained again about the AC the receptionist was vaguley interested and said she'd let management know...and that was it.
So be wary....going in summer? Dont expect the AC not to leak. Want a decent size room? Upgrade. Want an enjoyable breakfast? Eat out!",2,2013,07,08
104,Fantastic,We stayed here for my daughter's 21 st birthday and went to see Robbie Williams. We were upgraded to a stunning 2 story room. The staff were so helpful and pleasant. We had a delicious breakfast. It's near Paddington station. All in all brilliant ,5,2013,07,07
104,"Lovely hotel, shame about the issue with the bedding","This was a really beautiful hotel with lovely check in staff and the bar was great with music. Unfortunately when I turned back the bed there were several hairs in the bed. It was too late to complain but when i checked out I told the person on reception who did not seem to be that interested and, as I had to rush off for a meeting, I did not have time to ask to talk to the manager. Such a shame as it was a really really lovely hotel otherwise

104,It should be higher in tripadvisor rankings...,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Later I stayed in another hotel at London for one night & regretted it. This is an awesome place with great location. Close ot Paddington so transiting to Heathrow is super easy. Hyde Park is close by for morning run. Oxford Street is 10 minutes away for shopping and eating.Free & fast wifi 24 by 7. Good staff mostly asians and I quite liked the brekky as well. If you stay 3 nights or more then good rate as well. Room size is smallish but trust me that you wont find bigger rooms in London at this price point. I especially liked the breakfast in the small patch of open sky in the basement of the hotel. 
Minor glitches in front desk in terms of trip booking but still a great choice to stay here.",5,2013,07,03
104,Brillant location & Exceptional Hospitality,"We are just back after staying at this property for 2 weeks. The experience was very good on two counts, location & hospitality. 
The hotel is 5 min from Paddinton station & 6 minutes from Lancaster gate station. 
Hyde Park is a 6-7 min easy walk away.
15 min walk gets you to Oxford street for major shopping action, on to Bond street, Regent street, Liester square & Covent gardens. 
Large no. of Pubs & eating joints(English, Indian, Lebanese, Chinese) are within 10 min. of the hotel. M&S food outlet at Paddinton & Tesco nearby give you all the options. 
Our family of four including our two young daughters explored central London on foot because everything was just a short walk away. 
Even Notting hill & Portebello Market is a 25 min walk from this property. 
Also a full English breakfast with welcome Indian additions by the F& B team headed by Omkar Potdar gave us the impetus to walk off the calories. 
Truly outstanding job by the breakfast team. No request was ever declined & every effort made to accommodate our requests for Indian dishes.  
Also deserving a mention are the House manager's Mr Gurdeep & later Mr Tushar who were very helpful & gracious. Even the front desk person Ms Ashanti was always very supportive with directions & guide maps to every location. 
We were actually surprised with the warm welcoming & helpful staff, especially in London.
The excellent weather also added to the charm making this a very enjoyable holiday.
Two counts where the hotel could do with some improvements, a) mattress are too soft &
 b) They need to add more T.V channels(Even Wimbeldon was unavailable)  

Still we would suggest this property to all, including friends & family who wish to explore London without wasting too much time, effort & money on commuting. The Hotel is full value for money & they are ready to listen to you, which at the end of the day is what every guest desires.",5,2013,07,03
104,Fantastic hotel to stay in,"Stayed in London from 14 June 2013 to 23 June 2013.

My family and I (a total of 4 adults) booked a quad room for 9 nights a month before we left for London. When we reached the hotel, a friendly porter quickly helped me with the luggage I was pulling from outside the hotel, up some stairs and into the lobby. We got our quad room quite fast actually. Just showed the receptionist a printed copy of the confirmation slip, paid and we got our room. Since we didn't book from the hotel website, no breakfast was included for the room type. They did ask if we wanted breakfast but we declined. Our room was at the third floor (Room 301). We had to go up a small secret staircase (hard to get up with big, heavy luggages) and into a narrow corridor. But that's alright. The room is quite big since it has to accommodate 2 double beds. There are 2 one-seater couches, 1 chair, table, dressing table and closet. The room even has an iron and ironing board, kettle and cups all that. And also small dressing tables beside the beds. The scenery outside is not that flattering though since you could see the roofs of the other buildings beside it. But to make up for it, at least it is closer to the skies. 

The toilet, on the other hand, is small, even to my standard. The door lock of the toilet, unfortunately, was broken but did not really affect us. At least the door can be closed. The shower place is small, I have to admit. (I am 5 feet tall. I could shuffle around but couldn't stretch out my arms to full length.) No bath tub. When showering, we had to close the transparent door since water can splash out. Note to those claustrophobic. The space is really small. One solution if you want to book a room in this hotel. Leave the shower door open so you don't feel suffocated. Luckily, I'm not claustrophobic. Actually, the shower place is one of my favorite place in the room. It gave me the feeling that I'm going to the Hunger Games arena. (Reference to the movie scene where the tributes have to ""board"" this tube-like thing in order to go up to the arena.) Really cool. Furthermore, it would be great if the hotel can install a water spray beside the toilet bowl.

Another one of my favorite place in the room is actually the bed. It was so comfy!! And the pillow was so squishy!! I actually fell asleep really fast.

At night, it was quiet since we are at the back of the hotel, aside from people passing by outside the room since ours was located near a fire escape door which was used to go to other rooms but it didn't really bother us since we kind of sleep really early. Fire alarm did went out twice, the first time I was jolted awake but I quickly fell back asleep. 

Room service was fine. During our stay, we didn't allow the housekeepers to step into the room. (We made our own beds.) We did asked for a change in towels, some tea and sugar, and a trash bag a couple of times. The housekeepers were friendly and ask whether we like anything else. A big shoutout to the first housekeeper who tended to us. We didn't know your name but thank you for being so kind and extra friendly. 

Overall, the stay was pleasant. The room has a great ambience. The people were nice. The wifi connection was strong. The location of the hotel was great since it was walking distance from Paddington station, 2 halal Malaysian restaurants and many other shops. Yup. A great experience for us, first time visitors to London. We will book this hotel in the future if we ever visit London again.",5,2013,07,02
104,"Great value, great location","I stayed here for 3 nights for a conference in London. Overall impressions: 
1. Super easy to get to; I took the Heathrow Express to Paddington and it was a 10 minute walk from there to the hotel. I am directionally challenged but managed to find it without a problem.
2. Yes, the rooms are small but its not a surprise if you read this site. Definitely a good value for the price; and who will spend much time in their hotel room when in London anyway?
3. Close to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, both of which were great for a morning run. Staff pointed me there when I asked for a good route.
4. If you don't book via the hotel's website breakfast is an extra charge. I ended up not purchasing it and eating elsewhere, as I wasn't that hungry in the mornings due to jet lag.
5. I modified my reservation when I checked in, and the staff handled it without a problem.
6. I never did figure out the air conditioning system, but just opened the window instead.",4,2013,06,30
104,Lovely night away,Stayed here for 1 night to celebrate out silver anniversary good location for us hotel staff very good we had a superior deluxe room it was very nice with the complimentary wine fruit and soft drinks only draw back was the tiny bathroom and the breakfast wasn't very hot having said that we would stay here again ,4,2013,06,28
104,"Amazing staff, great breakfast, rooms for 4","This was one of the few hotels in London close to the city which allowed 4 in one room at a reasonable price. Breakfast was great. Amazingly friendly staff, though they do need to read up on London so they can help out-of towners navigate the city better. Comfortable rooms and beds with Free WiFi",5,2013,06,27
104,Perfect place!,"We took a quick two day trip to London. Having never been there before, we wanted a nice hotel close to Paddington Staion to ease the tranfer from Heathrow to City Center. The Park Grand Hyde Park was perfect for us! Excellent breakfast, comfortable beds, updated room, WIFI that works, beautiful area, close to Hyde Park and Paddington Station, reasonable rates...what more could anyone want?",5,2013,06,27
104,A theatre break,"I stayed at this hotel once again with my sister, when we were in London to go to the theatre.
The check in was easy and we were allowed to drop our bags in our rooms early as they were already ready for us.
The staff are all very helpful and polite and the rooms, although small, are very clean and modern and plenty big enough for our needs.
The wifi seemed to work just fine, I have noted some people have an issue with it.
We had breakfast this time. There was a huge selection of both hot and cold food which all looked good and the dining room staff were also very helpful.
We shall definitely stay again.",4,2013,06,26
104,Much improved!,"I have stayed at the hotel on several occasions, last in Fall 2012.  Their has either been a change of management or major customer relations training.  On prior stays, most of the front desk staff was surly, to the point of being rude (and I'll not go into the maintenance man's tirade about the toilet that wouldn't work).  This trip everyone was pleasant, helpful and smiling - made me feel like my custom was appreciated rather than just tolerated.  Whatever was done - congratulations and keep it up!",4,2013,06,23
104,"Clarke K ""Very pleasant stay""","Stayed at Park Grand Hyde Park hotel 10 days ago & initially chose the hotel for its location,within easy walking distance of Paddington station. Found the hotel very clean & well maintained. Very impressed with buffet breakfast, excellent selection & good quality food & staff were excellent & extremely polite. I often stay in London & research hotels carefully before booking & certainly have no hesitation in recommending the Park Grand Hyde Park to anyone. In fact have booked another stay there in next few weeks.",5,2013,06,23
104,a pleasant stay,"Stayed at Park Grand Hyde Park London for 4 nites a week ago.  It was a pleasant experience.  The hotel is about 5-7mins walk from busy Paddington Station (please use the exit to Praed Street), and yet has a quiet surrounding. 
The room is clean, well equipped, albeit small per most rooms in London.  The staff are generally helpful.  They have a luggage storage room which is very helpful as we arrived early and left in late afternoon for our evening flight.  This allowed us to do some activities before check-in/out without worrying about our luggages. 
Will surely recommend to friends who need accommodation when in London.",4,2013,06,21
104,Business visit .... pleasant stay,"Stayed at the Park Grand for the second time and this is now my hotel of choice for future visits. The staff are exceptionally helpful and polite , hotel is very well maintained, breakfast good, the location is great and the Paddington train station is just a few minutes walk providing great connectivity.

Offers great value for money !",4,2013,06,19
104,Another enjoyable visit,My group of eight spent another great four day visit to this Hotel after missing out last summer due to the Olympics. As on our past several visits we found the staff extremely polite and efficient. The premises are kept spotlessly clean and well maintained. The breakfast was of top quality and nothing was too much trouble to the staff who ensured a good start to the day. We would not hesitate to book this Hotel for our next visit to London. It's location is just right for transport links and pleasant walks.,5,2013,06,18
104,Business stop over in London,"Excellent, service and infrastructure has improved. The staff are also very helpful and friendly. I got an upgrade as a premier card holder plus a 10% discount. I will certainly lodge there again. Also great value for the price and location.",5,2013,06,17
104,"Very central, clean and friendly hotel","I booked six single rooms in this hotel for 2 nights because of its central location. The guests were all professional musicians involved in a performance in a central London venue. The rooms are very small but very clean and the beds are comfortable. The area is very quiet so sleeping with the window open was a welcome option. Breakfast was excellent, with fresh fruit, pineapple, water melon etc. and good hot choices also. The staff at both reception and in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. The free Wi-Fi was quite weak in the rooms but was ok in the lounge area. Not exactly a luxury hotel but very adequate for a business trip.",4,2013,06,17
104,"Handy Location, friendly service, pity about the...",Easy access from Heathrow Express train. Breakfast staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The room was clean but rather tiny which I think is the norm for London.  Only complaint being the fire alarm going off at all hours.  Apparently when one person smokes in their room the alarm goes off in every room!  Crazy. Tedious. ,3,2013,06,16
104,Value for Money & Close to Halal Restaurants,"We stayed here for 5 nights on 2 separate weeks (went to Rome and Paris in between) and booked 4 rooms.

1.  Value for Money - Joined their Reward Programs (free) and got 10% off their room rates.  We also got 3 rooms upgraded from 1 double bed room to 2 double beds room.  For a family of 5 (2 kids + 1 baby), the 2 double beds room is comfortable for us.

2.  Close to Halal Restaurants - Malaysian-owned restaurant Tuk Din, Indochina restaurant Banana Tree and Indian restaurant Khan's are less than 15 minutes walking distance.

3.  Groceries shops and Laundries are also close by.

4.  Paddington station is about 300m from the hotel.

5.  HSBC ATM also located near the Paddington station.

6.  Hotel rate is inclusive of breakfast.  

There are basement rooms and rooms accessible via staircase, so if you travel with stroller/wheelchair, do inform them.",4,2013,06,15
104,Oh dear. Not quite as advertised.,"For our first wedding anniversary my wife and I decided that a romantic 3 night stay in our wonderful capital city would fit the bill. We decided a Travelodge would not suit so sought out a more romantic, luxurious stay, as befitting an important anniversary. Google threw up the Park Grand at a price that suited so I did some homework and promptly booked it. My mistake. My fault. Silly. One might say a little naive. Good Lord, am I  really that stupid? Even though the Park Grand is in Paddington it turns out it isn't. It's the Park Grand Hyde Park. Although it's not in Hyde Park. It's in Paddington. But it's not the Grand Park Paddington because, get this, that's a DIFFERENT hotel. (Same group though). Trades Description anyone? I only realised my mistake when, on asking where the bar was, we were taken to the basement and shown a fridge. I could have sworn the website showed a bar? I checked. It did. But not in the Park Grand Hyde Park (in Paddington). No. The bar was in the Park Grand Paddington. We didn't have a bar. Or a view. But we did have a fire escape. Attached to the building right out side our window. But that was useful because at 3.30 a.m on our first night the fire alarm went off. Still, it amused the people upstairs who carried on laughing and joking about it till 5 a.m. We know this because we heard them. Not that they were shouting. They didn't need to. The walls and ceilings were so thin you could hear a mouse sneeze. On our last day some guests arrived at 5 a.m. To the room next door. It's a good job we Brits aren't allowed to carry firearms. It took an hour for my wife to disarm me of her electric toothbrush. I had some fanciful idea of inserting it in someone, but my wife sweetly pointed out that perhaps I should use my own?
   Still you have to laugh. But you don't have to stay here. There are better hotels. Or bridges. I've since discovered that there's a Travelodge in Covent Garden. At the same price. With a bar and restaurants and stuff. And a view. Allegedly. And it will save you a fortune in underground tickets. 
   I suppose the only reason you may want to stay at the Park Grand Hyde Park (in Paddington, not Hyde Park, but not the Park Grand Paddington) is that you work in London and you wish to get to know your secretary better. They do have large, comfortable beds.",2,2013,06,13
104,Affordable and convenient hotel next to Paddington,"I chose this hotel because it offered the best value for my money and was located in the vicinity of Paddington, which meant I could take the train from Heathrow directly to the hotel.  There is in fact a 5-10 minute walk which can be a bit annoying when it rains.  Tube access is easy with Paddington (H&C, Circle, Bakerloo) and Lancaster Gate (Central) stations within a 5-10 min radius.

I stayed in a single, located in the basement, which was not a big deal, except that there wasn't much of a view.  The hotel corridors are pretty narrow and windy, which some have complained looks like a maze and this can take a bit to get used to, but is not a huge issue.  In any case, there is an elevator.  

The single room was clean, but as mentioned by other reviewers, very small.  Many of the single rooms are located in the hotel basement, which does not offer This made packing/unpacking a bit challenging because the only place large enough to open my suitcase was by the room doorway, next to the bathroom door, so it was not possible to go in and out of the bathroom with the suitcase unpacked.  This was a minor nuisance that I'd be willing to live with.  But amenities did include a hair dryer, in-room safe, flat-panel TV, business center; some of these are less common in budget hotels, and were nice to have. 

WiFi signal was weak, and I could not use Skype to make calls from my room as I have done in previous hotels.  It was usually good enough for email/web, but having 3G on my phone was sometimes helpful (there's a Vodafone store in Paddington Station, for those with unlocked phones).

Breakfast buffet was rich and traditional bacon-and-eggs, cheese platters, cereals, toasts, freshly-baked pastries were all available at 12 GBP daily when prebooked (even with breakfast included, this hotel was less expensive than many neighbors).  

My only discomfort was that the bed was initially laid out with only a blanket and no lighter sheets.  It got pretty hot at night, and I had to ask for sheets at the lobby. Not a big deal, but something I'd expect to have.

Overall, the location and hospitality is very good and I'd definitely come back here again.",4,2013,06,13
104,Good for a short stay...,"Having stayed for 2-nights last weekend, I think this was adequate for our requirements. Not quite a double bed for what we were led to believe was a deluxe room, and quite small, and our high floor room request had been ignored. Even more surprised that our breakfast had been downgraded to continental only (with a ¬£5 each upgrade to full). We were the only couple limited by this that morning from what we observed. That said, the location is quiet and semi residential and the staff are polite and pleasing :) Read the hotel info book...they have penalties for certain behaviours! Obviously have have bad guests on occasion...",4,2013,06,13
104,Nice stay at club double room.,"Affordable stay and my daughter loved it as it was duplex with a little lounge upstairs.  The bed was comfy but the walkway in the room was too narrow. After putting 3 luggages in, there was hardly anybspace to walk.

However,  that's not worth to defer anyone from staying there.  Tube and shops just a little walk away.

Will stay again should we visit london again.",4,2013,06,13
104,"Nice hotel, good location","We stayed for 1 night in 2 twin rooms. To be honest the room we had was quite small but it was well decorated and clean. Good shower room and everything we needed. Is fine if you only want to sleep there. Didnt try the breakfast at the hotel but a good cafe round the corner. Location great, 5 mins from Paddington. Fairly quiet area, gave a good nights sleep. Would def return.",4,2013,06,11
104,Fantastic location and great price,"I would highly recommend this hotel.  Its the first time we've stayed here and I would certainly come back next time I'm in London.  We only stayed one night in a twin and the size was fine.  Hotel was clean and we had a lovely breakfast.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Location was perfect for us as we were going to a concert at the Shepherd's Bush O2, the hotel was only a 10 minute walk to Lancaster Gate Tube station and a few stops on the Central Line to Shepherds Bush.  Also about the same distance from Paddington Station, giving mainline train and other Tube options.  We had a room at the rear of the hotel and it was very quiet, also there was no noise from other guests.",5,2013,06,11
104,Pleasant stay,"First time in the Paddington area. Hotel located very close to Paddington station and the ride with Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express was a breeze. We found Park Grand to be a very pleasant Hotel with excellent location. Roms small but very adequat (we had 2 double beds, Family consisting of 4). Friendly and very helpful staff. For us breakfast was included and fine. Park Grand can be recommended.",4,2013,06,11
104,Just right!,"I stayed here for 3 days in a double room and was very happy with my choice. I was on my own but there was plenty of room for two. The price for the location and value in London was just right. When I chose a hotel in Europe I look for cleanliness and location, size of the room is not that important. The nicely done rooms are compact (think Ikea) but very functional. I liked the bathroom with shower/tub, closet to hang clothes, large tv screen, comfortable bedding. The English breakfast was good, buffet style in a light area downstairs. Not much space for suitcases, no view out of window but that wasn't important to me. The hotel is a 6-8 minute walk to either the train or tube, no fun lugging a suitcase but manageable enough. Very clean, good location, nice staff, I would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,06,10
104,"Excellent hotel, central location, very good price","I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will use this again.  Booked the hotel as was going to see Barbara Streisand at the O2.  Special offer price when booked back in March.  When we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite at next extra cost.  Clean, well looked after rooms. If you require a little more room, then it was slightly squashed around the bed, but for staying in and sleeping didn't bother my mum and me.  Only 15 minutes walk to Hyde Park and only 10 minutes from Paddington tube station.  Breakfast choice was brilliant, full English, continental etc.  

Hope to use the hotel chain again when come back to London.",5,2013,06,10
104,Lovely stay!,"My friends and I stayed in a room with 3 single beds. It took us awhile to find a place with triple occupancy but we hit the jackpot with Park Grand Hotel. Space was limited but I imagine most accomodations in London would be the same. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean! Breakfast was good and the restaurant staff were very polite & efficient. After a whole day of sight seeing, it was nice to come back to our tastefully furnished hotel room.¬†

Very close to Paddington station which is a huge plus!¬†",4,2013,06,09
104,Great Place to Stay!,"We stayed here for 4 nights this past April and were very happy with the hotel.  The room we had was VERY small but to be honest, we did not spend a lot of time in the room,  It was clean and tastefully decorated.  With two large suitcases, there was not a lot of space, or anyplace to really put them.  If you were on the side of the bed closest to the wall, you'd have to duck your head to get past the TV (on the wall) if you wanted to go to the bathroom.  The bed was comfortable and we certainly got a good night's sleep.  Our room was at the back of the hotel so we didn't find noise to be a problem.

We thought the location of the hotel was excellent...close to Paddington.  There were lots of restaurants and pubs within walking distance.  We did not use the restaurant in the hotel so I can't comment on that.",4,2013,06,08
104,Great place to stay,"I was pleasantly surprised when shown my ""club one"" room, very spacious with a mezzanine level bedroom.  The staff were very friendly and attentiive and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending to my family and friends.  It was conveniently located to Paddington, Kensington & Hyde Parks.
The only draw back was my room was opposite the lift and ""door opening"" / ""door closing"" could be heard throughout the night - it would be better to have this turned down during the night if possible.",4,2013,06,06
104,Nice Hotel pity about the reception staff,"We arrived at the hotel quite late 11.15pm but had phoned through to let them know.  There where 3 men not wishing to sound discriminatory I will say  (not white british) on reception who ignored us for about 5 minutes, another party waiting told us there was a problem with the computer system. Eventually we were told to sit down and wait over there not a please or thank you was uttered.  45 mins later and we were still sat there by now there were 4 parties waiting, lots of irrate telephone coversations were going on, by the reception staff.. My husband asked if we could get a drink but we were told the bar had closed. Eventally we were called forward, not by ou names but pointed at, and told you can come up now. No apology,  given our room cards and that was that not a very good start.  Things got better though The room was pleasant and very clean.  When we rang down for room service the young man was very helpful. (he was not in the team on reception )The next day breakfast was very good and thank goodness a change of reception staff.  the young lady was very helpful.  The hotel is very convenient.  I would stay again but I reaaly think that the team on reception that night do need some cstomer service training urgently!!!!",4,2013,06,05
104,"Not the best of hotels in the Shaftesbury ""family""....","Average in most terms, regarding the food and the rooms. Cleaning very good and swift, the staff at the desk not very polite, the men who worked there (probably from India?) were not the kind of staff that should work in a hotel - they were in a bad mood at not very keen to help. The female parts were better, one from the east (China/Japan) was very nice and smiling and giving good service. The personell in the dining room very good, top service and nice though commond average food with no variaty from day to day, Sounds from rooms close was disturbing specially in the bathroom, and the traffic outside where large - but overcoming.",3,2013,06,04
104,Perfectly placed!,"My Husband, myself and our Teenage Daughter recently stayed here for three nights.  We had a disappointing first night after being disturbed by noise from the next room.  After ringing reception, the issue was dealt with without any drama and we were moved to another lovely room for the duration of the stay - the way the hotel staff responded was refreshingly professional and courteous!  The breakfast was a lovely buffet style offering lots of choice with very attentive staff on hand.  Paddington train and underground stations are literally around the corner, with Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens a 5 minute walk and we can also recommend a Greek restaurant in Paddington called Fantasia - excellent value for money.  We would certainly stay here again.",4,2013,06,02
104,1,"My husband took me here as a surprise stay away - I couldn't have asked for anything better. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and our room was ready. The room was clean and made excellent use of space with a mezzanine level for the sleeping area. Great black out curtains and a very comfortable bed ensured a great night sleep. We would definitely come back.",4,2013,06,01
104,Good Location,"After reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor my family and I decided to stay .at the Park Grand.We stayed at this hotel for six nights and I must say the hotel is very conveniently located,being only a 10 minute walk from the Paddington Station.We had booked a quad room and it was very comfortable for the four of us.The room was located on the first floor and it was spacious,clean and well stocked with tea,coffee and cookies.The breakfast served was well prepared with a good collection of hot and cold dishes,I must praise Mr Omkar and his kitchen staff for excellent service during breakfast.They were well trained and attentive to the diners.Mr Omkar is obviously someone who takes a lot of pride in his work.I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,06,01
104,great service,"this was our first london trip for our girls' getaway & we were booked for 5 days in this hotel( since it waa hard to find a room for more than 2 people with a good value). so we were hoping & praying that this should be a good one or we'll be miserable for the next 5 days. i find the hotel charming & very clean. the rooms were tight but twas expected from london hotel reviews that ive read. the space was manageable since we were petite. the buffet breakfast was great. they dont change the menu but it was such a good english breakfast that i look forward to it and it makes my day. service in the breakfast room was excellent. they were polite, efficient and very attentive. we left for 2 days and spent our last night in this hotel again... this time the room was more spacious but since we were right by the street, it was a bit noisy. location-wise, it was close to small shops and restaurants and paddington train station. i would give this hotel excellent for their service and would definitely recommend it.",4,2013,05,31
104,Very pleasant stay,"Based on the positive Trip Advisor reviews, I stayed one night at this property in May 2013.  I was very impressed with the hotel.  Although it is a short walk to busy Paddington station, it is located in a quiet area.  The front desk staff was amazing, and very helpful.  I arrived around 4:00 p.m. and was directed to my room (the hotel is a bit of a maze).  I had a single room which was tiny, but very clean.  The bathroom was compact, but had everything I needed.  My only complaint (and it's minor) was that the bed was a bit too soft for my liking.  Breakfast was a lovely surprise - although located in the basement, the breakfast room still manages to be sunny and airy.  The staff is very friendly, and I was impressed with the breakfast selections.  Everything was well prepared and the buffet area was spotless.  It was a short walk to Hyde Park and I enjoyed a morning stroll before I checked out.  I think this property is an excellent value and I would not hesitate to return.",4,2013,05,31
104,Harassed and Bribed,"A few months ago I left a truthful review of my partner and I's most recent stay, mentioning a few unsatisfactory issues (I will re-write this review a few paragraphs down), almost immediately after it was published, my phone rang and it was the manager of the hotel asking me to remove the review of the hotel and he would refund us some of the money and and give us a free upgrade if we stayed again. 4 phone calls from the hotel later, I reluctantly agreed, part because a refund would be nice but more to stop them calling.

 I tried to book another stay recently as my partner and I will be in London again shortly. We were given a price higher than the one displayed on their own website and when I asked about this I was told to provide screenshots and then fobbed off with the excuse that we were paying for a better room than the one advertised. Seems a 'free' upgrade now costs around ¬£30.
I declined the offer explaining these facts and within 10 minutes got another call from the hotel on a phone number that they shouldn't still have or be allowed to call.

I hope that if this has happened to anyone else that you also report it on here as I think this is a disgusting way to treat people, to harass and bribe them to make their hotel seem better, and more people should know about it.

The original review:
Stayed here once before through laterooms and everything was great but this time things were awful.
I emailed the hotel a week beforehand to find out check--in times as we were visiting the theatre for a matinee performance. We got no reply and had to try and cram our bags under our seats which was a huge inconvenience.
At reception I was charged a higher price than my booking and had to wait around while this was sorted out, though at least it was sorted in the end.
We were told we were in room 001 and to enter the lift and 'press B for breakfast'. I thought B meant basement but I guess you learn something new everyday.
The bed was very comfortable. The room had no phone or internet signal whatsoever so we were effectively cut off from everyone else.
The room was right next to the breakfast room and were woken at 7 with guests waking early and going for breakfast so between the hours of 7 and 10 we got to listen to everyone else's conversations.

We gave in trying to sleep and went for breakfast though it was greasy and unappetizing.
We then headed back to the room for a shower only to find all the shower gels etc. were around 3 years past the best before date on the bottom and were all congealed inside the bottle. Not pleasant. 
We left wishing we hadn't bothered with this hotel as the standards had slipped so much since our last stay.",1,2013,05,29
104,Good location.,"I stayed here for a weekend with a friend of mine who lives in London.  I arrived from USA around 10AM, but I had to wait a few hours before there was a room available.  The front desk woman on staff was very friendly and attentive, and offered me coffee and made sure to check up on me and update me consistently.  Our first room was in the basement and Foursquare reviews warned against this, and I wasn't sure why.  The room was small but the floors in the bathroom were heated which was nice.  We found out why in the morning.  It was near the breakfast room!

It was extremely loud and we were unable to sleep.  We told this to the front desk and they offered to show us two rooms and give us a choice for which one we wanted.  Very helpful!  We were able to choose a room on a higher floor with more room (no heated floors, though), and were able to get some sleep.  However, the higher up you go the worse the WiFi is.  I had a great connection in the basement room though!

One negative is the difficulty of getting to the rooms.  It literally reminded me of the Titanic.  So many different narrow twists and turns!  If you need assistance getting to your room, they will send someone with you.  There is also a hold on your credit card which took two weeks to come off mine, but the staff was very understanding and helpful with removing this charge.  The tube station was also a very short walk and very convenient (although a little sketchy at night).

Overall this was a pleasant stay.  The staff made this hotel a good one!",3,2013,05,25
104,Stuart B.,"The accommodation was ""compact"" but adequate for our stay of two nights. The staff were helpful and friendly, and to be honest I would rate their attention as excellent. I had a minor medical condition that needed attended to, and I had to attend A&E. The staff on duty were attentive, and very quickly organised a taxi, and instructions where to go. The next morning a different member of staff on duty enquired as to how I was, and had everything worked out ok....I was impressed. The breakfast was very good, and the staff very attentive to our needs...it's the best tea I've had in a hotel for quite some time! If we stayed again, I'd like a bigger room and ensuite...we had booked a deluxe double, but because we arrived early, we were changed to another room at our own request. I don't think we were in a deluxe!",4,2013,05,24
104,A pleasant surprise,"We had booked to stay for two nights as we wanted to explore the Paddington area. On arrival, our request to store our bags was readily actioned. At check-in later that afternoon, the staff were very helpful, and took us to our room. The room was smaller than expected, but okay by London standards. Getting around the bed without knocking the flat screen TV off the wall caused some anxiety. However, the room was nice, the bathroom was clean and had good, new fittings, and we appreciated the free Wifi. The bowl of fruit and the tea/coffee/biscuits were nice to have.
As in some other hotels, we found the duvet too warm and ended up sleeping under the duvet cover only. We didn't follow this up, so it could be that there would have been a light blanket available if we had requested one. The staff were very helpful.
The breakfast (included in the room rate) is one of the best we have had in a London hotel. 
We would very happily book into this hotel again.
Another plus is that the hotel is barely ten minutes walk from the lovely area around Little Venice and Regent's Canal.",4,2013,05,22
104,"Friendly staff, excellent location","The room was a good size and perfectly clean, the staff were friendly and attentive. 
The purpose of my trip was to visit friends and do some shopping, from the hotel I was able to walk to Oxford street in around 40 minutes.

Buffet breakfast was as one would expect. 

The cost of the hotel was very reasonable, I would definitely return.",4,2013,05,22
104,Exceeded My Expectations,"This hotel is an excellent example of the four star standard. The bedroom I booked is well furnished with two excellent king sized beds with medium to firm mattresses. The linen is spotless and there are plenty of pillows to rest a weary head. There is a complete absence of tobacco smells in the room and there is a charge for room 'fumigation' if anyone chooses to smoke. There is ample work space with a number of chairs should any guest need to do paperwork, use a laptop or similar. The shower room and toilet in my room (401) is small but well equipped. It has the latest style in 'new looking' sanitary ware and a thermostatically controlled shower regulator. There are plenty of good quality towels and toiletries; hardly any need to bring your own, unless you are a fan of a particular brand of shampoo or shower gel. A large flat screen TV and fully functioning remote control permits access to a full range of programmes. There are biscuits, tea and coffee making facilities. I took breakfast in the downstairs restaurant at a charge of ¬£12:00. The food is very appetizing and includes a full range of fruit, juices, cereals and continental style and cooked breakfast items with a range of beverages to suit every conceivable taste. The employees are exceptionally helpful and polite and made sure that I enjoyed my stay to the fullest. I strongly recommend this hotel to even the most discerning guest. I was fortunate in that I booked using lastminute.com and so managed to obtain an excellent room tariff. Rates do vary and it is worth noting this. The hotel is approximately 5 minutes walk from Paddington underground station. If you are traveling with hand luggage only it is hardly necessary to book a taxi.",5,2013,05,21
104,Nice hotel..... If I got past reception....,"We booked the Park Grand hotel just over a month ago and were really looking forward to having an enjoyable stay in 4 star accommodation.
Unfortunately this was not tha case as upon arrival at the hotel we were informed that there were maintenance works going on in the rooms and we would have to be transferred to a sister hotel immediately.
 We never got an email pre warning us or a phone call despite them claiming that they tried to contact us. We were then told to go to the Shaftesbury premier hotel across the road where we were given what can only be described as ""student accommodation"" sized bedroom which was actually smaller than our own bedroom at home. Also we booked a superior room for what we considered a 4 star price  only to get what we considered a 3 star.

However, on a good note we received a complimentary bottle of wine as compensation in the other hotel and the bed  was very comfortable...just a really small bedroom! Website is slightly misleading so check before you book!",1,2013,05,19
104,Could not have been more accomodating,We arrived very early to the hotel and were warmly welcomed by staff and management. Jet lagged and sleepy we were just inquiring as to when we could access our room (we were 4 hours early!). The staff apologized profusely that it would be a 20 min wait. The room was spacious and comfortable and met our every need as did the staff and management.  It was an outstanding experience.,5,2013,05,18
104,"Not bad, but not brilliant","I tried the Park Grand as an alternative to the Mercure Paddington, where I usually stay, and which is still my favourite (also reviewed). I booked a deluxe double room for two nights to use as a single. As a single it was fine. It was in no way a deluxe double. The double bed just barely fit into the room. The mattress was of one piece, soft and lumpy. Two people would not have been able to sleep comfortably on it without being disturbed by the other‚Äôs movements. There was a nightstand on one side of the bed only. There were about 6 inches between the end of the bed and the wall, but since the wall contained an enormous TV screen, it was only possible to get around the bed by bending over and inching through sideways. There was no room for suitcases and no suitcase rack. The room contained a desk and one chair. Even in London, I would call this a standard double or deluxe single.
The walls (or partitions, as one should rightly call them) are so thin, that when the occupant of the next room closed (not slammed) his or her room door, the windows in my room rattled. That was the downside.
Everything was very clean. The bathroom was fine. Towels are a bit small and thin, but ok. There was a hairdryer and electric kettle. Biscuits/cookies and tea were definitely down market, however, particularly in comparison to the Mercure. The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast, which is really very good. Plenty of fresh fruit and good selection of everything. Personnel were all very friendly and helpful.
Altogether it is a well-run, very average London hotel.
The location is about 3 blocks or 5 minutes from Paddington, a bit more now with construction on Eastbourne Terrace and the west entrance to the station being closed, so you have to walk all around to the other side to access. I would only stay there again if the price were really substantially lower than the Mercure, which in this case it wasn‚Äôt.",3,2013,05,16
104,Highly recommend!!,I travel on business and can honestly say this hotel is on the top of the list in so many ways.I arrived early and they quickly offered to store my luggage with no fuss and could not of been any more helpful.On check in which was at 3 am the receptionist was pleasant and efficient.My room was a double deluxe room and was a large room with a sofa good quality plasma tv and the bed comfy.Most importantly the hotel was very clean and tidy.This hotel will now be where i stay in London in future.,5,2013,05,15
104,Warm staff and excellent accomodation,"We had a one night stopover and will book again in the future when visiting London again in the future. Very clean not just with the room, but the whole property in general.
 
Good location and very close to the tube. I recommend this hotel very highly, especially for the prices and the food is cooked to perfection if you are eating in.",5,2013,05,13
104,2 Night Stay,"Stayed 2 nights to visit London eye and other sites. Excellent location near restaurants and shops, and friendly helpful staff. Very clean. Lift was a little annoying with its constant announcements but a small detail. Would recommend.",5,2013,05,12
104,"Pleasant stay, very good price, rather ***","We stayed here for 4 nights with my family. The hotel was rated ****, which is not really accurate, I would say rather ***. The hotel and the room were clean. The room and the bathroom were rather small (we had a quadruple room), which was not really a problem, since we spent just a little time in the hotel. Breakfast was great. Location is very good. In general the hotel is nice, but seems a little old. However it is a good value for money as it is not easy to find not over-priced hotel in London.    

Our only unpleasant experience was upon the arrival. They didn't know about our reservation and didn't have room for us. So for the first night we were sent to another hotel. The substitute hotel was a luxurious ***** hotel, which was great. What wasn't that great were the transfers back and forth, the time lost due to that and the fact that I was asked to pay the whole amount for the accommodation upon arrival, without seeing our hotel and the substitute hotel. I disagreed and wanted to see at least one room, but as we arrived late, they refused because the rooms were full. I disliked very much the fact that I was forced to pay without knowing what I was actually buying, but since it was 2 am and we were all extremely tired after the journey, we risked it. The risk paid off, but I didn't like it at all and I don't think that this is a good way how to treat clients.",3,2013,05,11
104,Wembley weekend,"We found this hotel on line while researching the prices etc of a major hotel chain. What a gem we unearthed. The room was a one bedroom studio flat. Very clean and tidy, with a small kitchen area,a large king size bed,two plasma screen Tv's and a huge walk 
The location of a five minute walk from Paddington station is great for us travelling by train from South Wales.
We will definitely be back.",5,2013,05,08
104,Birthday Celebration,"We stayed overnight to go to the theatre on Friday night and visit Hyde Park and environs to celebrate my husband's birthday. The hotel was a short walk from the tube station. Staff were extremely friendly & helpful and the hotel gave us a free upgrade from double room to club suite which was really kind of them. Even though the rooms are small due to the traditional London apartment building, they are furnished to a high standard with very comfortable furnishings. The buffet style breakfast was plentiful with good food and attentive service. After checkout, we were able to leave our luggage until the evening so that we could enjoy a day touring. A very pleasant stay all round.",5,2013,05,07
104,friendly reception staff,"Although the room could of been bigger...we didn't plan on staying in the room more than we had to as there is so much to see in London 
Breakfast was plentyful,again staff were friendly and helpful.
Hotel was clean and good location.",5,2013,05,07
104,"Ok hotel, not the greatest value for size and location","We stayed here this weekend for my wife's birthday. The hotel was clean and on the whole, with some exceptions the staff where polite. The room was very small and although our friends had paid the same amount for the same standard of room their room in every way was smaller by some considerable portion. When this was mention the answer given was "" that's just how it is not every room is the same"". That being the case the price should reflect this difference, not a particularly great answer nor very professional. Also, and this my area of expertise (I earn my wage in this industry) our friends had a ironing board with a built in iron which had electrical wires exposed and was broken which plastic covers that made up the iron and concealed the irons electrical parts, this would be considered to be a code 2 failure of safety and should not be used at all or left in the room as there is a high potential that anyone using this piece of electrical equipment could receive an electrical shock our friends obviously did not used it . When this was reported in a polite way it was meet with a disconcerting almost non believing response that our friend was over reacting and this could not be the case, only when pictures where shown that the member of staff backed down but with no apology! This could be reported to the relevant safety organisation which I am sure would love to here of dangerous equipment left in rooms for guests to use...!!!! I am sure not really the sort of thing that they would like to have. To sum up the hotel is in an ok location, is clean, the breakfast was ok apart from the cold eggs and some sausages (it is a help yourself buffet) which staff again said they believed to be acceptable, be honest is over priced for a room.",3,2013,05,05
104,Typical But Convenient,"We selected this hotel because of its proximty to Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express. It's only two blocks away. Other than that, it's pretty typical of this area and style of hotel. Clean, fairly well decorated rooms with updated ensuites with shower, large TV and free WiFi. But, as with all similar hotels, the standard rooms are very small ... room for the bed, your suitcases, a pathway to the toilet ... and that's about it. Breakfast was typical buffet style, including Full English. Generally during our two week stay in the UK, the beds have been slightly on the firm side and very comfortable. The mattress in our room this time was getting a little tired and was too soft to be considered comfortable. Don't expect a view, especially from the lower floors. At least the window could be opened in our room for fresh air. So ... very convenient, but just a place to sleep, with no real complaints.",3,2013,05,04
104,Clean but TINY!,"We had the smallest room on our floor (according to the fire escape plan) and boy did it ever feel that way. Even though it was super clean, it's just about the smallest room I've ever been in (excluding hostels). Of course London is a pricey town and this is a good option in that sense, but I don't feel we got our money's worth. The room has about zero extras, no hair dryer, no fridge (but a place where they ripped the fridge out) and zero space. The TV's mounted sideways on the wall with no way to turn it so you had no convenient way to see the tv (as the bed was facing the other direction). The bed was really soft and strange, I usually like soft beds but this one has given me back pain in the mornings and I felt like I was going to roll out the entire night. Very clean but I can't wait to get out of here and I wouldn't return.",2,2013,05,04
104,Tiny room and uncomfortable bed,"Fortunately today is my last day in this hotel. I stayed there for 6 nights and every morning I woke with a aching back. I complained two times because of the bed and the second time they did something, but the bed is still one of the worst I ever slept in. 
The room itself is very tiny, but clean. This is the reason for the second rating point. Otherwise it would be only one.",2,2013,05,03
104,Better than expected,"A very nice hotel, quiet and good breakfast. close to paddington station, would definitely go there again. Staff were extremely friendly and we were allowed to leave our suitcases in safekeeping as we arrived early. Look on their own website for cheaper deals.",4,2013,05,03
104,"Great location, excellent breakfast, super room","I've been in london many times and everytime looking for an hotel to stay that is acceptable without spending millions of pounds is really difficult. The Park Grand London hyde park is a great choice! rooms are quite and very clean, bed is comfortable and bathroom is quite big and clean! Staff is super friendly and breakfast is great!!
On top of this it's absolutely well located, just a couple of minutes walk from Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate, plus you have a bus stop close to the hotel with buses going everywhere around london. I definitely reccoment this hotel!!",5,2013,05,02
104,Daunting,"We were a little confused at first with this hotel, The signage is poor enough, We were brought into one building to pay? and then walked around the corner to the place we stayed. we found this a little strange.
Ideal location though around the corner from paddington train and tube stations.
The corridors and lifts are a bit on the small side however our room (clubroom) was a nice size. The beds were very comfortable and found the staff helpful.
The breakfast was buffet style no frills but no complaints either.
We also availed of the luggage room facility which was handy for keeping your possessions secure whilst you wander the city!
Only real downside of this hotel was the bar facilty was poor, closed at 10 only 5/6 stools too small and would give you the impression that it was an afterthought.

Overall this hotel is in an ideal location for paddington and has comfortable clean bedrooms",4,2013,05,02
104,Excellent!,"Excellent in all aspects: the staff is very helpful and kind,the rooms are super clean and with every comforts,the hotel is very near the Paddington station,and it is in a quite place.
Super! Highly recommended!",5,2013,05,01
104,Great Hotel & location,"We had a great time at the Park Grand London Hyde Park. We arrived early in London but could go straight into our room. We had a beautiful room with a good bathroom that was clean and comfortable. The service at the hotel was also very good. The location of the hotel was perfect as you walk in 3 minutes from Paddington Station where you directly can take the train to the airport. The city was very closeby, with 2 to 3 stops you were in the center. We would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,05,01
104,Great Hotel - very friendly staff,"What a lovely stay we had!  The two-storey room was clean, modern and well-equipped for all our needs.  It was the little touches which made this truly wonderful - the magazines in the room, the fresh flowers, the biscuits... What made the stay special, however, was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff.   Even though we only stayed for a few days, they made us feel like old friends.  As we left, they all said they looked forward to seeing us again - well, they were right.  We'll be back!",5,2013,04,30
104,Great Weekend Away,"We had a fabulous trip to London and stayed at this hotel, it was clean and tidy throughout and the staff were great too. All the staff we encountered were very helpful, vigilant and attentive especially at breakfast which is always a good sign,the large bed we had was really comfortable and all the facilities in the room were fine, it was quiet at night so getting your head down after a long day was also welcomed, it is very close to Paddington station which made our journeys into town a lot easier. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again.",4,2013,04,30
104,"Nice room, good service, reasonable price, very near to Paddingon tube station","They have a nice, clean, and modern room. The bed is so comfortable and soft.
The staffs are really friendly, they welcomed us and making sure that we have a nice stay during our stay.
They have the best scrambled egg *according to me* for breakfast. And all the restaurant crew are so friendly.
The best part of this hotel is it's very close from Paddington tube station. It's just 5 minutes walk from station. And also it's close to Leicester Square tube station, around 10 minutes walk.
There are couples of restaurants and shops around the hotel.",4,2013,04,29
104,Very friendly staff,"Excellent stay. Very comfortable room for 3 adults, good size bathroom which is very important for 3 ladies sharing. Welcomed at the main door on arrival by the concierge to take our luggage, also took luggage to our room.
breakfast was excellent, great choice. staff very attentive with a friendly smile & welcome.
Will definitely stay again.",4,2013,04,28
104,3 star hotel but with 5 star service,"Booked this hotel as a treat for my husband and I.  Looking forward to 4 star luxury.  Little bit disappointed, room was clean and well appointed. Fruit a lovely bonus.  We had a two storey room, with a small kitchenette.  The bed was huge but was a zip and link (single zipped into a double). Because of this it dipped in the middle where the zip is. We had a front room, it was very noisy because of the traffic. ( Not the hotels fault but I did request a quiet room)
Breakfast was lovely, very hot, lots of choice.  The hotel did not have that 'stuffy' 4 star feeling which is a plus when you have been trailing round London in jeans.

Although to me it felt more like a very good three star, the staff gave it 5 star service.  They were all polite and very helpful.

Lovely hotel, good location with 5 star staff.  Huge well done to them.",3,2013,04,26
104,"Lovely hotel, staff very friendly and helpfull","Booked 3 nights, the bedroom and service was excellent. Breakfast was hot and plenty to choose from. In all would stay again which will be next year fro my husbands birthday. Staff offered to keep our luggage on departure.",5,2013,04,26
104,Great value and Great location,"Arrived at Kings Cross and straight down the tube to Paddington followed by a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Very welcoming on arrival and in our room in minute's, found room a little warm but air con unit sorted that. Room well laid out with a good clothes hanging area, neat bathroom with great shower and a very comfy bed. Breakfast was fantastic and the staff were very helpful and polite. We would recommend the Park Grand to anyone as it made our stay in London very memorable, many thanks to you all.",4,2013,04,26
104,Good for our trip,"The main purpose of our trip is to apply for the schengen visa. So we choose this hotel because it's not far away from the battleship building. And the fact proved that was true. The rooms are clean and new, but the bathroom is a bit too small. And if you are looking for some place in the middle of the city, this might not be a good fit for your need.",4,2013,04,25
104,Met our needs.,"3 night stay for leisure. Surprisingly pleased by proximity to Paddington Station since we used Heathrow Express, was initially nervous about walking with a weeks worth of luggage. The room/bathrooms were bigger than I expected for Europe. Deluxe double on 6th floor, facing street. Enough room for one suitcase on luggage rack and another on small love seat.  Bed very soft, linens clean. Towels a bit worn, but we got a fresh set everyday. Wall furnace seemed to stay on but we used the room a/c unit to drop the room temp.
The final night there was a miscommunication with the front desk staff/room service order. It never arrived, it was very late and finally arrangements were made for pizza to be delivered since ingredients were not available to make our sandwich order-one hour later.
Had the free breakfast once, sufficient options. Did not use free coffee/tea set up in room. Fresh fruit a nice touch.
Our favorite pub across the street, Pride of Paddington, was a great lively place for a night cap. Ask for Daniel!",4,2013,04,24
104,Average at best,"I live just outside London but needed to stay over in London for an event. I found this hotel average at best. My single room was very very small, the radiator was stuck on very hot and they came to try and fix it with pliers as the knob was missing but could not fix it. The window only opening a small way so I was very hot in the night. The shower door leaked very badly so the bathroom floor got very wet. It also fell off its hinges when I used it so felt like a cheap fixture.
Room was clean and linen was fresh. Towels were old and bed was very soft. I guess you get what you pay for and in central London near paddington you don't get a lot of ¬£100 nowadays. On laterooms it said the hotel room was ¬£260 reduced to ¬£99 but there is no way rack rate can be this high my expectation was set that I was getting an expensive hotel room, misleading. ",2,2013,04,23
104,"Sadly, dissapointed!!","Unfortunately, upon arriving, I was told that my reservation had been cancelled!! This was a shock, as I had booked it so, I was then informed that the booking had been duplicated. I naturally asked, if, it had been duplicated, there must be at least one booking still live :) NO, there was nothing booked for me :( So, The man at reception booked me into THE SMALLEST ROOM I think I have ever stayed in, and I do mean small :(
Overall, the hotel appeared to be good, the breakfast was good, as are most of the Shaftsbury hotels however, I am not quite as confident with the central reservations concept and I tend to stay in these hotels each week!!!",3,2013,04,23
104,Nice & Helpful,"I stayed 6 nights in this hotel. I and my friend stayed in twin room, it was clean. At first window difficult to close but they fixed it very quickly. So hotel was nice and comfortable, it near paddington station. If you want to visit oxford circus just use Lancastergate, walked in 5 minutes. Mr Dennis and friends at front-desk so kind and helpful.",5,2013,04,22
104,Standard Small hotel,"I stayed here last week with work,  it's in a great location if you want to be near Paddington and Hyde Park is only a few blocks walk away.  The price is ok for this hotel,  hotel is very clean and modern enough... I only used  my room when I was there,  My room was very small,  there was little to no wardrobe space,  they were embedded in panels in the wall and could only hold 5 pieces per panel, not good for work clothes.  They had a pop down desk from another wall panel which was handy.  The bathroom had no bath but was modern, the bedding too was modern and comfortable. There were stains from hot mugs on the furniture so that def needs upgrading.
The small rooms are ok for one person,  2 and you'll be in trouble,  there is no space for your suitcase and with 2 you'll be tripping over each other...  Good for business people,  or if you're going to be out a lot, no shopping though you'll have no where to put the clothes bags..   I suggest you ask for a larger room if you are going there,  for the price it's good ..  One big issue I had my key card did not work ever time I came back to the hotel... very annoying.. Staff are very helpfull there.  A good few eatery near by the hotel.. a nice few italians though and a good new coffee place with Illy coffee.",3,2013,04,21
104,"N Giumaa, Great hotel in great location","I stayed 5 nights in the hotel.The hotel was very nice and all the staff were lovely. I stayed in a single room  on the 4th fllor which was enough size and very clean. The bathroom was tiny but also immaculately clean. There was plenty of towels, toiletries, coffee, tea and a daily supply of biscuits (which is always appreciated). The staff were very helpful and any requests were dealt with immediately. The breakfast was good quality and tasty with a lot of choice and there was an abundance of good food to choose from. I was greeted with big smiles from the staff at breakfast every day and they were all very helpful. The breakfast manager was particularly good, making sure everything was fine and that we were all happy with the food and service. The location is also good, just a short walk from the high street and canal side (shops/restaurants) and the tube/train station. There is a nice canal side walk to Camden Town (approx 40 mins) The hotel is also only a short walk from Hyde Park, the largest green area in london which is very much a bonus if you want to escape the hectic pace of the city for a while. I had a room at the back of the hotel so it was very quiet. I would definately recommend this hotel and would personally stay there again when visiting london.  If you book this hotel for a stay in london, you will not be disappointed and you will be close to many amenities",4,2013,04,21
104,Great hotel in great location,"Me and my daughter stayed four nights at this great hotel.We stayed in a clubroom with the bedroom ""upstairs"" and a ""sittingroom"" downstairs with refrigerator ,microwave oven and coffee and tea facilities.It¬¥s the best hotel so far we stayed at in London! We are looking forward to the next trip to London,when we will be staying at this hotel again. The location is also a good reason to stay here, only a few minutes walk to Paddington Station.
The only complaint we have is that the beds were a bit too hard.",4,2013,04,19
104,Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel last week, for 5 days. The hotel was very nice and all the staff were lovely. We stayed in the quadruple room which was a decent size and very clean.

104,Great location,"Great location, great breakfast, great service. Rooms are ok. Would recommend anyone wanting a fair priced hotel in a good location to book here! An easy stroll from Paddington station this hotel ticks all the boxes.",4,2013,04,18
104,Great hotel in a great location,"We stayed here over the Easter weekend and found it to be a great option -- by far the best hotel I've stayed in during three trips to London over the past decade. We'll definitely consider it again in future.

The room (a double) was a reasonable size compared to typical London accommodations, and the bedding was up-to-date. No wonky mattress or such. In general, the interior of the building was much fresher and pleasanter than you often find in this neighborhood. The breakfast buffet was particularly good, with a decent selection.

The location is a big selling point. It's a 10-minute or less walk to Paddington from the Heathrow Express/Connect, and also the Bakerloo/District/Circle Underground lines, and at the same distance from Lancaster Gate on the Central line. As a result, every spot on our sightseeing itinerary was a simple Tube ride with no connections. Walking off the jet lag through Hyde Park was also pleasant.

Only two quibbles: Some parts of the bathroom could have been cleaner, particularly the hose to the shower head, which seemed to have some mildew developing. 

Also, the one time we asked the staff a local-knowledge question, they muffed it. We wanted to take a bus from near the hotel to Trafalgar Square. When we asked, the front-desk staff told us there wasn't a bus line for that journey. But we found out later that the 23 from Paddington fits the bill perfectly. It might be good for staff to brush up on some info about local transport options when this kind of question pops up in future.",5,2013,04,18
104,Recent Stay,"We were originally booked in at the Metropolis but due to boiler failure we were transferred to The park grand, the staff were very welcoming, helpful and pleasant.  The breakfast was very good plenty of choice. We would certainly stay here again and would recommend this hotel to other people. Regards Sue and ken",5,2013,04,17
104,Great hotel!,"Had a two night stay with my daughter in a Club room.  We were very impressed by the room with it's bedroom upstairs on a mezzanine level.  Fresh fruit, water and wine was provided for us as well as a plentifule supply of clean towels and toiletries.  Room was immaculately clean.  The staff were really helpful on reception and at breakfast.  Would definately  stay here again.  Literally a 5 minutes walk to Paddington station was a bonus.",5,2013,04,15
104,Great Location,"I stayed here March 26-30. As a result I stayed again on April 10th before my return to Canada. Location was great, handy to Paddington Station, the Tube, and the Heathrow Express. Also close to Hyde Park. I walked all over London from this location. I had a single room which was very small by my standards but it served the purpose and as I stated earlier, I came back and stayed the second time. I did not have the breakfast there but there are plenty of restaurants in close proximity. The front desk staff were very helpful.",4,2013,04,14
104,"Great value, good location, friendly staff","We had a great stay here last night. The staff were very friendly, our room was upgraded which was a nice treat, and the room was really clean. There was even fresh fruit waiting for us in our room! The breakfast was delicious, lots of different options and different flavours of tea to choose from too. Plus it is very close to Hyde Park and Paddington station. There were only a couple of small issues: the shower was not quite as hot as we would have liked (after arriving in the rain), and we also had some noisy neighbours, but these might have just been issues with our room. Would definitely stay again!",4,2013,04,14
104,Great stay,"We stayed in this lovely hotel for two nights and couldn't fault the experience, 5 out of 5. We were looking for a hotel close to Paddington station and we were so glad we chose the London Hyde Park hotel. The room we stayed in had everything we needed, very clean, tea, coffee, milk and biscuits every day. Modern clean bathroom, towels, soap, shampoo, shower gel all new every day. What a breakfast, everything you could want fruit juice, cereals, fruit, yogurt, continental and full English all help yourself!! as much tea and coffee you need. All the staff were very polite and helpful, couldn't do enough for you. Look forward to staying again later on in the year. Many thanks for making it a great stay in London.",5,2013,04,14
104,"Great price, clean rooms, but noisy.","I would give this property 5 rating IF we had not had such noisy neighbors sooo .... that's really not the managements fault, but bad luck on our part.  Our across the hall neighbors were talking LOUDLY in the hall at 1:30 a.m. so bum luck for us.  If you stay here just request a room on a higher floor (our above neighbors were noisy too) and possibly away from others. The rooms are SO nice - the bathroom tiled floors are heated which was totally cool!!!   I thought the rooms were furnished nicely and they were super clean! Like other hotels in London no fridge or microwave, but we didn't care b/c of how nice the facilities were.  Most of the hotel staff were super friendly and helpful.  Only one front desk guy was a know it all, but he couldn't taint the friendliness of everyone else.  It's a great location near Paddington Station. We would stay here again, but would make sure to request a room on a higher floor away from people (if possible).  I must say though - if we couldn't get a more secluded room I would not stay here.  The walls are very thin (simply by design since it's an older building) so you HAVE to be careful when making your reservation.  They also offer a free FULL breakfast that was delicious - bacon, eggs, fruit, yogurt, juices, etc. You really can't beat the value of this hotel. The rooms are somewhat small, but that's Europe for ya - even so, the extras made up for that!",4,2013,04,13
104,Loved it!,"I'd like to give this a 4.8, the -0.2 being the faulty heat, but the heated bathroom floor did make up for that!! What I loved about my little room were the amenities - daily fresh towels; coffee, tea, and biscuits; soap and shampoo; clean glass and tea cup every day made me feel very cared for. The breakfast was superb, whether full-on english or yoghurt and muesli, with charming jars of preserves and packets of Nutella a bonus. I liked the large breakfast teacups and of course the smiling charming waitresses who bring the tea. I also liked the elegant atmosphere of the breakfast room and fresh flowers, I felt like I was staying in a more expensive hotel. As a designer, I think modern decor is a good choice for the over-all smaller scale of budget hotels in London, the clean lines make the most of smaller spaces. Really its quite good design to comfortably fit a full size desk, television, and wardrobe into such a small room. It did not feel cramped at all and I needed the desk to work at. The amenities, price, and excellent location mean I will definitely stay here again my next trip to London!",5,2013,04,12
104,Outstanding Customer Service,"Fantastic experience from an outstanding Hotel. This was a trip for the first time to London to see the sights with my wife and 10 year old Son and 6 year old daughter, the Hotel were so Children friendly it was lovely making a fuss and could not be more helpful, I had one problem/issue that was NOTHING to do wth the hotel however the Hotel Manager took ownership of the problem and sorted it which amazed me and was outstanding customer service. All in all staff were outstanding, breakfast 5* with fussy children so important, room spotless and would highly recommend anybody for the experince with Park Grand London Hyde Park.
Many Thanks to all the staff.

Mark Wright and Family",5,2013,04,12
104,OK location,"First we had a room in the basement. Room was very small, you had no view outside because of a wall in front of the window and you couldn't even close the window properly. After complaining they gave us a room on the 6th floor which was better and accetable. Still I think for the price you pay and the 4 stars they claim to have doesn't really fit but that's my opinion. Room was clean but still a bit small, staff was mostly nice and our heating wasn't working. Location is good, tube station isn't that far away and neighbourhood seemed to be pretty quiet. Breakfast was included and always good and you had good selection. I wouldn't stay at this hotel anymore. For this price I'm sure I can find something better.",3,2013,04,12
104,Great Stay,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and will be going back again.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating.  The first time I stayed with my young baby and the restaurant staff, especially the manager Omkar was very helpful.  He even remembered my family and me from our stay two months prior.  The hotel has a great location being just a few minutes walk to Hyde Park and Paddington station and only 15 minutes on the express train from Heathrow.  I would recommend this hotel for both tourist and business travelers.",5,2013,04,12
104,excellent stay,"It was our second stay at this hotel.  We throughly enjoyed our stay, staffs were very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much.  The hotel is in a good location.  Our Quad room was very clean.  There was plenty to eat for breakfast . We will be staying here again on our next trip to london.",5,2013,04,10
104,Good location,"Great location, nice heated bathroom floors, small but comfortable accomodations, nice coffee/tea and biscuit selection.  The ""free breakfast"" claim was very misleading because it turns out you don't get free breakfast if you book through a third party like Orbitz, but this wasn't a huge deal.  The service was also pretty spotty--some staff members were very welcoming and helpful, while others were not particularly communicative or hospitable.  But all-in-all, we had a good stay.",3,2013,04,09
104,Very nice stay,"Nice staff, very clean and good hotel.

I really enjoyed my stay there as it was cheap and big enough for only sleeping there.
I didn't have breakfast there, as it was just too expensive but the overall impression was very good. The staff was committed and reacted on requests (for a safe) very quickly. I stayed in a room with 3 friends of mine. The bathroom was fairly small, especially too small for 4 people, but everything was very clean and hence good enough. the towels were changed daily even when we left the room after 1 p.m.",4,2013,04,09
104,Fantastic quality hotel,"5 minuits from padington station on foot. Great rooms and breakfast . Fantastic service from all the staff nothing was to much trouble. The restaurant team worked hard to serve the customers at the hotel the free breakfast which is on offer. This consisted of quality bacon and sausages scrambled or boiled eggs, mushrooms, saute potatoes grilled tomatoes and beans. Great selection of yogurts and juices and a good selection of cereals and patisserie. Better than some 5 star hotels I have stayed in.",5,2013,04,08
104,Good staff and functional nice room,"We vent to London for visiting our daughter and arrived in the afternoon. We had a warm welcoming and the room was to our liking, maybe one more wardrobe. The bathroom was perfect with floor heating and high quality water taps. A short walk to the  Underground and lots of restaurants nearby. It really is a perfect hotel to stay in for whatever the reason of visiting London.",4,2013,04,08
104,If that beer company did Hotels...,All I can say about this hotel is it's PERFECT! I can not find anything slightly bad to say it was perfect on every level. All the staff should be proud to make an hotel stay feel this special. PERFECCT! PERFECT! PERFECT!,5,2013,04,07
104,Fabulous Hotel All Round,"My daughter and I chanced a booking at this hotel, having arrived in London to find our original week's accommodation at another hotel was no longer available, and we had nowhere to stay.  Someone was definitely looking after us!  We booked online from an internet cafe around the corner and turned up at this hotel to the most welcoming staff I have ever encountered.  Nothing was a problem, from the initial booking in to booking out a week later.  Our bags were carried to and from our room, tours booked and local and sightseeing information given with knowledge and interest, and assistance readily given with internet access.  The location of this hotel is great, being a 2 minute walk from Paddington train station and underground, which gives easy access to Heathrow and all the sights of London.  Restaurant and shopping facilities are all within a short walking distance. It is a 5 minute walk to Hyde Park, which can extend to a 20 minute walk to Oxford Street if you are so inclined.  Our room was plenty big enough, and the bathroom, although compact was good, with plenty of hot water.  The room was cleaned and the complimentary tea, coffee etc replenished every day.  Breakfast was included and there was a huge choice of food from cereal to fruit to traditional english breakfast, and included the availability of gluten free foods, an essential for us. Like the reception staff, the dining room staff were professional and friendly and all requests were handled promptly and with a smile. As part of our holiday, we had left 4 days free before coming home to do the things we may have missed in London first time round.  We had no hesitation in re-booking at the Park Grand London Hyde Park, and it would be our first choice of accommodation if/when we come back to the UK.  Thankyou everyone for helping to make our holiday such a memorable one.",5,2013,04,05
104,"Great value, nice clean rooms, very satisfied","Exceeded expectations and rooms were very impressive for the price we paid. Our standard double room was beautifully furnished with outlets and light switches near each bed. There was a large LG plasma TV, complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits, and a hot water boiler. Bathroom had a nice shower head and heated floors. Plenty of closet space and a safe for laptops. The room had heating and central air and the hotel offered free luggage storage if you arrive before checkin time (3pm). Staff and receptionists were all very professional, friendly, and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast buffet was quite extensive and there was even waiter service! Hotel is in a prime location close to Paddington station and there are many restaurants, post offices, souvenir shops, etc conveniently nearby. My only complaint is for the slow WiFi, and that the shower ran out of hot water during peak usage times. But overall, a very pleasant and comfortable stay-I would highly recommend Park Grand London Hyde Park.",5,2013,04,04
104,Very Quite and Nice Sorrounding,"When we arrived in the hotel, we instantly love the area where the hotel located.It is only 10 minutes away from Padington train station and we could find anything we need in that train station area. Even the room is too small typical European hotel for 4 star hotel but we love the interior and also the view from our window. Since I am big girl, it's little beat hard to use the bathroom closet due to very small space this hotel has. The staffs are very helpful to us and they are very informative about which places we should go near the hotel.

Since the hotel located very close to one of the biggest train station in UK, you could use trains or underground easily from this station.",4,2013,04,02
104,Very Nice Stay,"I just returned from four nights at the Park Grand London Hyde Park.  I booked a single room and the other reviews are correct, the singles are tiny.  But it was very clean and neat.  I really appreciated the heated floor in the bathroom.  There are no lifts that I'm aware of, and getting to my room required going through a series of fire doors, down several corridors and up a windy bit of stairs, but an employee was nice enough to bring my bag up to the my room for me.  When I got in I was a little confused on how the lights worked.  I called the front desk and someone came up within a minute to help.  All the employees are friendly and helpful, and the room was always very clean when I returned in the afternoon.  The hotel is nicely located near Paddington Station.  It's in a quiet neighboorhood and I didn't hear any traffic or other noises at night.  I would stay here again.",4,2013,04,01
104,Top Hotel,Great place stayed for 2 days with family kids love it had the quad family room cant complain at all very good prices  and the breakfast was first class had a great stay in london and was a great hotel to come back to at night   will stay again,5,2013,04,01
104,Lovely and comfortable stay,Some past reviews of this hotel were not very good but I found the price to be reasonable and in a good location so I took a risk and booked it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was nice and clean and comfortable.  I ordered room service due to my late evening arrival.  Room service food was nothing special but hit the spot in regards to something pretty simple (it was either pizza or a sandwich).  Breakfast was included with my room which was great and they had lots of food options to choose from.  Wifi was included as well which is a must have for me.  I did have a hard time in the rain and snow and dark finding the hotel but it is near Paddington station.  I would stay here again.,4,2013,03,28
104,TERRIBLE HOTEL GROUP,"I booked this hotel on business at the end of January. However when I arrived at the hotel I was told I would be moved to a sister hotel in Hounslow (No prior warning at all to give me a chance to book into another hotel!) (Also Hounslow is a bad area, not a safe part of London). This area was NOT convenient location wise and when I explained this but I was told they could not offer anything else at any other hotel. I had to make a 40 minute journey all the way to Hounslow, and get up even earlier in the morning to attend the business event. Do not bother booking with this hotel as they will just shove you somewhere else. Abysmal service and RUDE staff. DO NOT BOOK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",1,2013,03,27
104,Great value and location,Stayed for one night whilst on a Theatre trip to London. We were offered single rooms instead of the twin we booked on the ground floor. These rooms were clean and modern and had everything we needed to be comfortable. We were early for check in but as our rooms were ready we were given our keys when we arrived and were able to leave our bags and get off into town. The staff we met were all really helpful. Will definately use the hotel again.,5,2013,03,25
104,Pleasantly Surprised!,"After reading some of the reviews I was quite concerned that our weekend away would be a disaster! But, all things considered, we would definitely return to this Hotel. It's location is excellent, the staff are all very helpful and friendly.  We were upgraded to a Club Room on arrival, which was a nice surprise. It had a strange configuration but when we got used to going upstairs for a cup of tea, it was fine. The bathroom was the only disappointment, being incredibly small but all things considered this wouldn't deter us from returning. The thing that some people have complained about was the breakfast. I can honestly say we have not had better and we have travelled all over the world in a variety of different quality accomodations. There was a wonderful array of items to choose from, from cereals, to continental, full english (the best sausages I've had in any hotel we been at!) and to be honest, anything you wanted. The staff were helpful, fast to action all requests and constantly restocking the breakfast selections.  Well done! I really shouldn't have worried so much!",4,2013,03,25
104,Very nice and lovely hotel,"We stayed in Park Grand London Hyde Park for 5 nights. We arrived at late night and left at the early morning. The checking in and out went quite okay, except paying by cash (which was easier for us because of sharing the cost of the room) made it a bit tricky and slow, especially when we were leaving. 

We stayed at the deluxe twin room and it was very nice and clean. I have no idea why people here write that the rooms are very small at the Park Grand Hyde Park, our room was a good size, we had a big telly and huge comfy beds. The location of the hotel was also perfect!

The reviews I read from the internet of the hotel were very different from each other and I didn't know what to believe. Anyway the hotel was a very nice surprise, it was lovely and i recommend it with all my heart. We will definitely be back!",5,2013,03,21
104,Excellent service and perfecr locational,"This hotel gives you the true value for money..less than 5 minutes walk from paddington station which connects you to almost all places in london including the tourist attractions. ..very nice and helpful staff..especially Mr Dennis and Mr Swaroop..clean room..flat screen tv with multiple channels...everything about this hotel is great..will definitely stay in this hotel everytime I travel to london

104,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here 19 marches one night for my wife‚Äôs birthday, from arriving early and them sorting room giving us tea coffee as we waited to the room, the staff breakfast had a truly fantastic time. 
The staff were outstanding best service I have had, and the room was superb had duplex club room was hot and radiator downstairs had no shut off but bed was lovely fruit wine and soft drinks complimentary. 
In the morning full English brekkie was great also did continental. 
For once had nothing to complain about the check in staff the guy on the desk at night all and the restaurant staff nothing was too much trouble
went to see lion king great show for once i actaully made her day on her birthday so many thanks to all at the hotel.",5,2013,03,20
104,"Central, Heathrow express to Paddington, Paddington station underground","This hotel are a few 100 m from Paddington station. If your travelling to Heathrow and use the Heathrow express your there in 25min. 
Around Paddington there are a lot of diners(Italian).
In the hotel you have free WI-fi and and free PC to use in the lobby. 
Nice welcoming staff. And a fast elevator.
The rooms are as most hotels in London. Small compeered to the size you may reckon from other country's. But in London style this hotel is clean and welcoming. 

Good value for your money.",4,2013,03,18
104,Another generally good stay at a Shaftesbury Hotel,"Once again, I have enjoyed a good stay at a Shaftesbury Hotel, this time the Park Grand Hyde Park.  This time, I arranged for my parents also to stay and they were very happy with the hotel, the room and the service.

We only had two minor complaints.

Both of our rooms became extremely warm and we had to have the windows open all night. 

The other small complaint was that the iron in my room was pretty useless although did the job eventually. I was in a hurry so did not have time to change it.

Other than these two issues, I would recommend the hotel and will continue to use this chain. The staff are very helpful, the rooms are clean, well appointed and comfortable. Prices were extremely reasonable.",4,2013,03,17
104,Stayed here loved and it and would come again!,Booked this for a birthday treat weekend away so was a little worried when reading a few negative feedbacks. On arrival was advised that I was complimentary upgraded to a club room so was instantly impressed! The rooms are clean and modern and all you need for a comfortable weekend away is to hand. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Great location to paddington station and will definitely come back again. ,4,2013,03,17
104,"Excellent for a business traveler, good location",It has friendly and helpful staff. It also has a warm and friendly atmosphere. The rooms are standard for a central London hotel. I got upgraded because i am a premier card holder. I have visited many times and i will visit again,5,2013,03,17
104,First class,"Stayed in this hotel from the 6th March to the 10th March . From the moment that I arrived was made very welcome by all the staff . Hotel spotless I had a room at the top of the hotel at the back, I was traveling on my own and I had no problems with this room at , nice shower bathroom ect and comfy and clean single bed nice quite room . Breakfast was very good plenty of choice ,from the restaurant manager to all the staff at breakfast they just looked after your every need and could not do enough to help you . Also the restaurant was spotless and they have a  nice conservatory just at the back of the restaurant which also has a few tables ,so you can sit and enjoy your breakfast . Small bar for residents and prices I found were very good , it a nice place to finish of a night with 1 or 2 drinks . The whole experience was first class .
Close to Hyde Park and also a few very nice bars within walking distance and also just a 10 minutes from Paddington Station .
Lovely area and yes I will return to this hotel and I have already told my friends and family , can't recommend this hotel enough .
Thanks against to all the staff and that's all the staff for making me very welcome and and enjoying my say at you Hotel .",5,2013,03,15
104,Back to London park grand Hyde park,"Once again back to this hotel within the fortnight every thing excellent from the time you check in to the time you check out.Very helpful staff ,courteous to the core thank you all looking to next times.",5,2013,03,14
104,Very good value for luxury club room stay.,"Great  hotel,  and  really  enjoyable  stay  in  the  2-floor  club  room.  It has a nice clean bathroom with all the toiletries and accessories needed. A kitchen/lounge area with a t.v upstairs and downstairs. Everything clean and satisfactory. Very  helpful  and  polite  staff.  No  problems  over  a  5  night  stay.  I  will  definitely  consider  staying  here  again.",4,2013,03,10
104,Great stay,Room a bit small but overall state of room and staffbattitudevwas exceptional definitely will be back.  Two downsides would be noise from occupants from room above who where noisy and size of room.  Location was perfect for a great stay in London and breakfast was average. Staff were fve star from time of checking in and checking out,4,2013,03,09
104,Park Grand Hotel Review - Feb 2013,"I recently booked a 1 night stay in Paddington as I was flying back to Sydney the next morning.  I chose the Park Grand Hotel initially because of it's proximity to Paddington Station (where I could catch the Heathrow Express) and also cost - it was very reasonable.  My expectations were exceeded when I checked in as I was put in a lovely room with 2 big beds (not that I needed them) and it was spotless and comfortable.  The staff were really friendly, helpful and just lovely...always smiling.  This was a far superior experience to other ones where I have been put in a dungeon room...2 floors below ground and right above the tube.  I would happily arrange to stay at this property again when I'm in London",4,2013,03,05
104,"Clean, quite, great value for money but small rooms","Upon booking the room we were unsure what to expect. Upon arrival, first impressions were good, hotel was very clean, staff very helpful and friendly, although a little disappointed with the size of the room but we were expecting this from reading previous reviews. Breakfast was very good, lots of different choices and self serve so you could help yourself to as much as required.We found it in a great location with lots of access from train, tube and buses.
We would definetly stay here again and reccommend this hotel",4,2013,03,03
104,comfortable stay,My husband & I stayed in the deluxe double & were very pleasantly surprised.  It was a very spacious room & very tastefully decorated.  Cleanliness of hotel & dining room were very good. Breakfast was plentiful & very nice. This was our second stay & we will definitely come back again.,4,2013,02,28
104,David and Helen,Comfortable Hotel close to two underground stations. Attentive staff particularly at breakfast where the service was first class. For easy access to London we would recommend this Hotel and we will be staying on our next visit.,4,2013,02,27
104,Very comfortable stay & Gourav & staff are excellent,"Stayed 24th feb 2013 & was made very welcome by the Hotel manager & staff, who even arranged my collection from euston station which was helpful & inexpensive .
My room was quite compact but very comfortable & the TV was excellent. Just a ten min walk from paddington & lots of shops & restraunts.
Will be using again as very good value for money, but best of All excellent welcoming staff
Thank you.",5,2013,02,26
104,Great stay at a central hotel,"My boyfriend and I stay three nights at the hotel for a break away in London. The room was really nice even though we were a little surprised that we were going to stay in the basement, but the room was very neat and combed. The breakfast was very good and highly recommended. All in all a really good stay, and we would like to book the same hotel again. Excellent service!",4,2013,02,24
104,Great Stay!  Amazing Staff,"Our family of 4 (2 young children) stayed here back in October (sorry for such a late review).  The hotel is in a perfect location for accessing the tube and very comfortable/clean.
The staff went above and beyond in all ways, especially Javal.  His helpfulness and kindness made the stay amazing.  Our youngest still talks about her friend Javal to this day.",5,2013,02,23
104,Friendly central hotel,"I booked one night for my husbands 60th birthday as a surprise and had ordered, on line when booking, a bottle of wine for the room.  Was a little disappointed when we first arrived as although we had been upgraded to a club room it was not quite what we expected.  We couldn't find the bed at first and then discovered that it was upstairs!! There was confusion over the ordered bottle of wine and the complementary wine, fruit etc in the room and the bottle of wine was sent up after I had made the staff aware that it had been ordered.  We were not made aware of the items being complementary  until we asked the following day.  We will know next time. Maybe there could be a note left for the guests to inform them of the complementary items.  Breakfast was very good and the staff throughout the hotel we friendly  and helpful.  Would definitely use this hotel again.",4,2013,02,21
104,Great city break hotel,"My partner and I booked last minute for a 3 night break away in London. We were not disappointed.  Just a few minutes walk from Paddington station, we found the check in very easy and were pleased with our room. We were on the top floor so had to climb a flight of stairs after the lift, but as we are fit and able it was no problem for us. The room was a nice size despite being up in the Gods! and was also very clean.  I had seen some previous reviews that said the bathrooms were on the small size. Its true that the toilet is closely set to the shower, however I could only ever see this being a problem if you are of large stature, so no issue for us.  
I have no particular negatives to say about this hotel, but if I had to, I would say that on the last day we were only supplied with one bath towel, not two, although I am quite sure that I had spoken to reception, we would have been supplied with another.
Although we did not use the bar/restaurant facilities so can't give a 'full' review, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay again.",4,2013,02,21
104,My Stay," The room was very nice and comfortable. The bed was okay but  please provide extra bed lining  because the duvet coving was too small for me . Excellent services from staff member,good location and easy transport link within london.
      ",4,2013,02,21
104,Little Gem,"Stayed at the Park Grand for 2 nights whilst doing the usual sort of sightseeing stuff in London.  We had a slight hiccup at reception as the hotel only had our booking down for one night.  However, the matter was swiftly resolved and the manager immediately upgraded us to a club suite, which was a really nice gesture.  Although the rooms had a slightly dated feel due to the age of the hotel, the facilities were anything but.  The bathroom, shower and sink were very modern, as was the lighting, and I have to say - absolutely immaculate and clean.  The hostess tray in the lounge was generously stocked and again, so clean and well presented.  Upstairs the kings size bed was sumptuous and we had a really good night's sleep. The hotel was only 5 mins walk from major bus routes, and Paddington station and tube, and we made full use of both!.  We paid a very reasonable price for our stay, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Well done to the housekeeping staff who obviously work very hard to keep the amenities spotless, I can't praise them enough, and hope the hotel manages maintain the standards.",5,2013,02,19
104,Good,"Stayed here over valentines day and had a lovely time. 
Location was very good only a short walk to the train and tube station.
We stayed in room 115 which was a comfortable size. a selection of coffee, tea, biscuits, shower gel etc was left for us to use. Big tv, floor heating in bathroom, iron, hair dryer and air con. Mirrors were in awkward places and there was a rip in our bedding. On one occasion the people cleaning the rooms left no towels but a quick phone call to reception and some were bought up right away with no trouble. 
One slight annoyance was that the fire alarms went off twice and then stopped once at 10pm and again 2days later at 3pm, no explanation was given. 
Breakfast was nice a big range to choose from. Cereals, fruit, yoghurt, bread, English breakfast, pastries, juice etc. the  friendly staff were attentive, taking plates away as you were done and bringing over tea and coffee. 
 
Would stay again due to location and price considering location. Just a few little moans but nothing major!
",4,2013,02,17
104,Absolutely Fabulous,"I stayed here for 28 days. The experience was absolutely awesome. I always felt at-home, with courteous behavior of the hotel stuffs. The room was very comfortable, though a bit small. Location is prime. Staffs were courteous. Upholstery was clean and decorative. Housekeeping was prompt and perfect. One can never imagine such a great hotel experience at this rate, in such a prime location

Most importantly, the in-house restaurant was amazing - food was very hygienic, tasty and wholesome. Above all, the restaurant staff were very prompt and courteous. Especially, I would personally appreciate the hospitality provided by Mr. Omkar and last but not the least, of Patricia - she always served with a very sweet smile. She even remembered by choice of tea from 2nd day itself. It is absolute perfection of serving guests, to remember their food-choice, among so many visitors

I wish all the best to this fabulous hotel and good luck to the staff. Please continue to serve the guests in such a wonderful fashion

Regards,
Ayan",5,2013,02,16
104,"nice hotel, great location, very good staff","This was a very good choice for us. it was a clean, well managed hotel at a great location nearby to Paddington station for trains and underground. I can only say complementary things about the staff.  They were involved and eager to resolve any requests you made.",4,2013,02,15
104,Excellent stay,"We just had a three night stay. Excellent location with a good choice of underground and buses & very close to Paddington station. 
A very nice room on the sixth floor with bath & shower; shower gel, shampoo and plenty of towels. Fresh  flowers in the room, tea, coffee and biscuits. Very comfortable bed and a good flat screen television. The air con worked well and was quite enough not to disturb.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would highly recommend this hotel and will be back.",5,2013,02,15
104,Great Value in London,"We had actually booked to stay at another Shaftesbury group hotel , but were transferred in the hotels limo to this very similar hotel nearby,due to an overbooking.
 The staff were superb in handling this problem and included a superb complimentary breakfast
to compensate for the change.
These hotels were a delight , staff were among the best we have experienced at hotels costing twice as much.
The premises were spotless, and with the exceotion of the very small size bathroom could not have been better,the very small bathroom was acceptable for a short stay but would have been tiresome if we had stayed longer, but the superb staff and other aspects of the hotel made up for this.
The breakfast with both hot and cold buffet was among the best we have enjoyed anywhere.
All in all a very nice experience which we hope to repeat in the near future..",5,2013,02,15
104,Clean and nice hotel,"Nice and clean hotel. Did not try the hotel breakfast as a 5 minutes walk to Paddington St. provides several OK breakfast and dining places. Our room 409 was big enough for two with space around each side of a quite narrow double-bed with a single, wide quilt. 

The bathrooms was quite tiny and a WC constricted between the wall and the shower. The shower, however was nice, with a good water pressure. As in most hotels, shelves or other storage amenties was missing, probably to make it easier to clean.",4,2013,02,13
104,Handy Location!,"I have to stay in London often, for 2 days.  I like staying at this hotel because it is right next to Paddington Station (for Heathrow Express access). Besides Paddington, there are other Underground stations near by.  It is a nice area to take walks, and is right next to two tremendous parks.  I also would plan on using this hotel for pleasure, at some point, when I'm able to visit London with my wife.  The free internet is also good.",4,2013,02,12
104,Much improved,"I've been staying at this hotel regularly for a good couple of years, and booked it for the location primarily, along with a knowledge that it wasn't going to be amazing, but clean and reliable.

Very impressed with the room I was allocated this time, significantly above the box rooms I've previously experienced.  There are some absolutlely tiny rooms in the basement and lower levels, some reasonable sized further up, and the significantly larger club rooms.  If you can - I'd thoroughly recommend the club room for space.  
Service is always friendly, although historically I have had issues with the booking not being found, they always seem to resolve, though occasionally by placing in a sister hotel about half a mile away.

I'd recommend this for shorter trips, travelling alone or as a couple. Some of the rooms would be a little small for a family, but overall great pricing for a decent hotel in a very central location.  Well worth it, and significantly better than most others in its price bracket.",5,2013,02,12
104,An overall satisfying experience,I have stayed here for a week in October 12and two weeks in jan13.the hotel is very conveniently located in central London next to padding ton station.The front desk manned by rhinia and gaurav a very pleasant experience the dining hall and the early morning breakfast being managed under onkar looking after each guest individually is an amazing experience.Whenever I am in London I would like to stay at park grand Hyde park and nowhere else.thank you everyone looking forward to next times.,5,2013,02,12
104,Wonderful Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights while on London for a Business trip.  Very good price for the location - just minutes walk from lancaster gate tube station and Paddington station.   We were very close to Hyde Park and took advantage of this great space. The hotel itself was clean and bright.  The rooms were a little on the small side but very clean, and well decorated.  Bathrooms were very small but adequate.   The little touches like fresh flowers in lobby area and rooms were lovely and also we had free newspapers left for guests.
The staff are very dedicated and professional - definately a great asset. The breakfast was very good, again great service staff.    Will definately stay here again, and would definately recommend to travellers for location, cleanliness, and staff.   Well done Park Grand London Hyde park Hotel.",5,2013,02,11
104,Perfect for an overnight stay,"We were looking for a one-night stay near Paddington to break up a long journey, with a 9am train to catch the next day. We needed somewhere close to the station but quiet enough for a good night's sleep, with warm running water for the morning shower and preferably with somewhere to get a decent breakfast. Full marks for all of the above, added to which the staff were very pleasant and the beds very comfortable.

The bedroom was a good size (we booked 'best available double', and got a room with two double beds!), there was a flatscreen TV with a decent range of channels, free Wifi and an ironing board. The bathroom looked newly furnished, and the shower had fantastic temperature control. It was on the cramped side, with the shower door practically opening onto the toilet, but this wasn't a major issue. 

We had paid for breakfast to be included and went down for it at 8.10 am, a bit anxious about getting to the train on time. We needn't have worried; a full buffet (English breakfast plus Continental) was ready and waiting, and tea was served to our table as we loaded our plates. Everything tasted fresh and we were done by 8.30am. Check-out was very efficient and it was a five-minute walk to the station. 

We didn't stay long enough to try out the leisure facilities or the bar, so I'm not sure how it fares for an extended stay, but this will definitely be our go-to place for overnighting in London in the future.",5,2013,02,09
104,Fantastic hotel in perfect location to a perfect price,"Stayed here two times in a two week period, fantastic hotel with nice and clean rooms, definately recommend a stay here, very close to paddington station where you can go to every place in London easily. 

Definitely coming back!",5,2013,02,08
104,Wonderful Hotel with rooms for improvement...,"Let me start with the pros :-
Location, Location, Location ... Public transport was highly available and accessible anytime . You have the Train Station, the tube, the bus station and the cabs all around there. Rooms were very comfortable and quite spacious. I loved huge variety of TV channels was offered and when travelling for work, having an Ironing Board in the room is a ""HUGE"" bonus for me. Staff were extremely helpful and willingness to help me anytime. And really appreciate the FREE wifi to keep in touch with Family and Work. 

Unfortunately the cons:-
Heated floor in the toilet isn't enough to regulate the temperature of the toilet. It was too cold after taking a shower and I had to immediately run to the room where it's warmer. And the passageway was quite narrow for huge luggage but the hotel staff were friendly to have someone to assist me with the baggage . 

If i travel to London again, I would stay here again",4,2013,02,07
104,Cerca de la Estaci√≥n de Trenes y Tube Paddington,"The people are very helpful, is close to Paddington Station, a taxi to Euston, charges you 18 pounds at 4 AM, The breakfast is not that varied, but there is very rich and fresh.

Cleanliness and order you enter you see from the hotel.
Thanks Park Grand London, will soon return.",4,2013,02,05
104,Perfect for a one night stay in London,We were in London for only one night and was reccommended the Shaftsbury Collection from a friend. The staff were very welcoming and our room was well above our expectations. The kingsize bed was heaven and the roon was very clean throughout. Although we werent there for long it was definately value for money and in a great location. We would stay again and reccommend to anyone,5,2013,02,05
104,Cath,"We stayed for one night and booked one double and one triple room. When we arrived we were told that in order to put us all on the same floor, the double had been upgraded to a club room, which was very nice! Both rooms were lovely, clean, tastefully decorated and with comfortable beds. Bathrooms as well were spotlessly clean. Breakfast was very good, with a plentiful buffet with a selection to satisfy different tastes. We were really pleased with the hotel and would definitely book again.",5,2013,02,03
104,2nd excellent stay,"This is the second time we have stayed at Park Grand London, on both occasions the service and staff have been excellent. The rooms are of a very good standard , with refereshment facilities, toiletries and biscuits provided. The  breakfast is very comprehensive, excellent choice and regulalry replenished by the pleasant staff, who promptly cleared away any used dishes etc. 
Excellent value for money. The directions given to the hotel are clear and accurate with a short walk to the Paddington tube station.",5,2013,02,03
104,Laterooms did well.,"Room was huge with two double beds in, decent facilities for a 4* hotel, window was broken and kept slamming during the night which made me worry about security if we were gonna be robbed by robins outside. Power shower was nice for London water though the freebie shower gels went out of date in 2010. Naughty. Tastefully decorated but more like a top class premier inn than 4* hotel. Would be using laterooms again but not necessarily this chain of hoteliers. ",4,2013,02,03
104,SCAM,"We booked a room via lastminute and at no point it was indicated the room is actually in a ""sister hotel"". They didn't even say the Park Grand was full. This is a Shaftesbury chain hotel, the Paddington one. On top of that they only said our rooms are on the other side of the road. We tried to find the place for 15 minutes during which we called twice to Park Grand, but they still didn't give us clear enough information, so we walked back to Park Grand. 

The person at reception came outside and said she would show us where the hotel is. After 5 minutes she admitted she didn't know either! In freezing cold and with some blisters this was not my idea of great weekend  

Now we are in a freezing cold tiny hotel room (I don't mind the size so much, this is London after all) that cannot possibly be 4*. After reading all the good reviews from here, I am very disappointed. ",1,2013,02,02
104,Like being woken up at 6 am every morning?,"Me and my partner stayed a couple of night at the Park Grand London. It was located very well, just near Paddington Station which is good to get around on the tube. However for the price we paid ($100AUD per night) I think this place was a little bit over rated. 

Check in was easy and the staff were very happy to help us bring our bags up to the room. However, when we arrived into the room, (room 310) we found it to be very small with a HUGE bed that left no space to open your suitcases. it had a HUGE television (about 45inch) on the wall opposite the bed which made it very harsh on the eyes to watch.
The bathroom was clean and cute with some small rust marks in the corners.

On the first morning we were woken up at 6am to a piercing and ridiculously loud alarm sound which we thought was a fire alarm. After putting shoes on the calling room service to see what the alarm actually was, I couldn't ever understand what I was told but just heard ""sorry sir, sorry for the inconvenience"" 
That night we ordered a bottle of water through room service which took 3 room service calls and an hour and a half to be brought up, followed by a call an hour later (while we were asleep) to ensure we received the 4 pound bottle of water.
The next morning we were again woken up by the piercing alarm sound to just receive a ""sorry, it wont happen again""

I would say our overall experience was fairly average if not poor for the price of this hotel which was willing to charge up 18pounds each extra if we wanted a breakfast. Thin walls so you can hear EVERYTHING from next door and above. Probably wouldn't stay here again. There seems to be nicer hotels around for less.",3,2013,02,02
104,For the price you cant beat this place,"This hotel is great. Clean with friendly and attentive staff. We were greeted, checked in swiftly and taken to our room. The rooms are small but for the price you cant complain. Full breakfast in the morning sets you up for the day out. The location couldnt be better walking distance of kennsingron park. Lots of resturants ro choose form. Would go again. ",5,2013,02,01
104,Good value and convenient,"Pleasant staff. Well equipped although very small room.
Clean modern if a bit lacking in character
Very handy both for station and getting into central London.
Restaurant choice nearby a bit limited
Given price really, can't complain",4,2013,02,01
104,Don't Bother,Don't bother booking as they will have a maintenance problem which appears to be a continuous thing according to previous reviews. You will be moved to a hotel that is completely inconvenient regarding location (also a rough area) and not be informed of this 'maintenance problem' until check in.,1,2013,01,31
104,Excellent two night stay,"I could not fault the facilities or the staff. The room was a very good four star standard and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.
I arrive at lunch time on my first day and check in was no problem as I was given a room immediately.
There were plenty of staff who who all very eager to offer help and assistance. The room was quiet, clean and a very good standard.
The full English breakfast included in my deal was good quality and well presented and on both mornings the staff were again pleasant and helpful.
All in all a very refreshing change from some London hotels I have used.",5,2013,01,29
104,"Great hotel, value for money","I stayed for 4 nights. The standard was high, the facilities great. I was particularly impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and it was dealt with promptly. I would definitely recommend it.",5,2013,01,26
104,"Nice, Clean, but small","The hotel was very convenient to the Underground train.  The rooms were small and very clean.  The breakfast was very good with a continential and a hot bar.  Free wi-fi.  We were booked into another hotel but when we got there, there were no rooms for us, thank goodness.  They moved us to the park grand which was a step up.  The bathroom had ample room to bath and get dressed.  The bedroom had a queen bed a desk, chair and closet.  Iron, ironing board and hair dryer were furnished.  No clock in the room.  Good lighting.",5,2013,01,26
104,Value for money?,"Finding value-for-money hotel in London is not an easy task; London hotels are expensive, often very busy and suffer from generally low standards. This hotel, like others in the Shaftsbury group of hotels, has its faults and your experience will depend on the room allocated and the staff on-the-day. This was my first stay at this particular hotel but I have stayed in at least 6 others in London from the same group and have a silver-level membership as a result; this may positively colour the service I received on this occasion, and others (I hope so!). The main attraction of this and its sister hotels (all share essentially the same room-size (small), decor, furnishings, service-levels etc though a few are a bit more deluxe than the rest. I would return to this and other Shaftsbury hotels because they are recently converted (less than 2+ years?) and therefore fresher, cleaner and more modern than many equivalents at the same price. Rack rates are ridiculous and this hotel is only value-for-money for me when its available below ¬£100 per night.",4,2013,01,25
104,Lovely Stay -Ideal Location,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights in January and I would recommend it to anyone! It is beautifully clean, shower pressure is good, bed is comfy and is equppied with all amenties. I had injured my foot prior to my stay and the receptionist very helpfully made sure I had a ground floor room. The staff were extremley polite and nothing was too much trouble for them. The location is ideal as I had a number of meetings around the Paddington area and taxis are easily available outside the hotel. I have no reservations whatsoever about recommending this hotel and they have some amazing deals on at the moment. Thank you to all for a lovely stay.",4,2013,01,24
104,Lovely hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for one night - overall experience with the hotel was very good, Staff were helpful although they werent really needed too much. The room was small but very clean. 2 concerns with the room were - the windows had a draft blowing through it which was making the room quite chilly and as it was snowing and minus temperatures outside was a bit of a pain. The other one was it was next to the lift which was noisy and a big gap under the door. Not a major problem though. 

Free parking at the hotel which as a major bonus, we parked directly outside the main door. This was ideal as most places in London either charge silly amounts for parking or have to park in a public car park away from the hotel

The hotel is well within walking distance from Paddington Tube station which gives us access to all of the city.

Well recommended and the price of ¬£59 for the night was a steal.",4,2013,01,24
104,Ideal for Paddington station and Heathrow Express connections,"I stayed here in mid-January for a near unbelievable rate of ¬£60 per night. The hotel is located 5 mins from Paddington and also has lots of bus connections. Very modern room with a good desk, huge flatscreen TV, compact bathroom, spotlessly clean and free WiFi throughout. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent. Will definitely stay here again - the January rate was almost unbelievable value.",5,2013,01,23
104,A well recommended stay !!!!!,"i would happily recommend this hotel as me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and i actually plan on staying in the near future. the staff were warming, polite and friendly and even more so the location of the hotel was convenient as during our stay we visited winter wonderland and visited westfields for a days shopping.",4,2013,01,19
104,Very convenient and affordable hotel :),"If you have been reading all of the other reviews you might have mixed feelings about this venue because some reviews are good and some of them not so good. However, if you do your homework the right way I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your experience at this venue. The location was very central and very convenient for transportation to any location in London and the suburbs. The neighborhood seems very safe and close by you can find restaurants, souvenir shops, etc.
The staff was attentive, polite and helpful. I stayed for one night on a room with two double beds queen size and then a week later in a room with one double bed queen size. Even though you might think the size of the room is small, this is the normal size for London. The room was very clean and organized. I didn't get a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant.
Some of the comments in other reviews was about being moved to another hotel due to overbooking or hotel repairs. Even though the reservation said you didn't have to contact them before arrival, I did call the hotel to ensure they had my reservation and didn't have any problems at all. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family planning to visit the hotel.",5,2013,01,16
104,I Always Stay Here if in the Area,"After trying a few other hotels in the Paddington Area and having some bad experience, I can really recommend this hotel.

- The hotel is nice, clean, the staff are very helpful, big flat screen tv in each room, WiFi is free and easy to connect to.

- A few other reviews have critised the room size but at the end of the day you get what you pay for; the single rooms are cheapest and smallest, standard double room has enough space to get around the bed and a seperate bathroom, premier double is much bigger and the club rooms are huge.

- If you are a member you get a free upgrade(if available), free fruit and water. 

- Breakfast has everything you would want and the coffee is fresh.

- My only minor critism is the website can be quite difficult as all the hotels have similar names and the names don't always match up to what they are actually called.",5,2013,01,14
104,Exceptionally helpful staff,Good value for ¬£62 in central London. Staff in reception and restaurant very friendly and helpful. Problems sorted out with no fuss. Superior single rooms a little small but very nice bathrooms. Everything very clean. Breakfast very good in nice surroundings. Fruit and water in the room a nice touch.,4,2013,01,13
104,treat yourself better.do not go to this hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for four nights first of january .it is not easy to say which part was the worst . We did not get the room that we booked.the rooms are too small it was not enough space to move around the bed.we had space only for 1 luggage .staff were not proffessional .but: 
The worst part was security most of the times there was no one in lobby and they were not at the desk.but the most weird thing happend to us was when we arrived back to our room afterwholeday we found our rooms door open!!  They have hadcleaned the room and  left
he lock oen so thedoor wasn't closed we even didn't feel secureto enter our 4starhotel room.and:  we were asked to check if something is lost cause they wexre not even sure from when it has been left open and they told us maybe the maintenence guy has entered the room and forgot to close thedoor what a reasonable answer!!if you care about your security don't go tothis hotel.",1,2013,01,11
104,Wonderful little gem of a hotel!,"I recently spent a night at the Park Grand after looking for a last-minute room close to Paddington Station. It's only about a 5-10 minute walk and reasonably easy to navigate to from the station. From the outside the hotel looks very smart and when I first walked in I felt wildly out of place with my trainers and rucksack, but the desk clerk made me feel very welcome. The lobby was wonderfully light and spacious with fresh fruit and newspapers on the counter. After checking in I went up to my room on the 6th floor (hard to believe from the outside that the place has a 6th floor) and although not overly large, our room was very neat and clean with fresh linens and plenty of towels. 

I must say the bathroom was one of the smallest I've ever seen and it was impossible not to hit your elbows on the shower cubical when using the toilet, but in the end we found it more a source of hilarity than inconvenience. 

The reasonable room-price included breakfast, however because of an early train we were unable to take advantage. The hotel felt very safe with staff in the lobby even late at night and there were plenty of nice touches, such as free newspapers dotted around the hallways. I will definitely consider staying here again in future and have already recommended to friends.",4,2013,01,11
104,"Consistently good experience, things improving","Park Grand is just around the corner from work, so location is perfect for me, as is proximity to Hyde Park for a post-work run. Service is consistently very good, rooms are great and clean (with ironing board and iron which is unusual in my experience), and the breakfast is particularly good. Providing I get a competitive rate, I will continue to book the Park Grand on a weekly basis, and no hesitation in recommending the hotel for leisure or business purposes.

The only complaint I have is that my credit card has been repeatedly declined when booking via the Shaftesbury Hotels web site - I believe this is due to inability to handle with encrypted information, and requires a follow-up call to check the booking has been made.",4,2013,01,11
104,Our stay for my daughters Birthday in London,"I would begin by saying the staff were very helpful in giving us a good quiet room at the back of the hotel and we got upgraded to 2 double beds! Our room was changed on request as the 1st room we were given was pretty noisy from the road and the window did not close properly.  The room had been recently refurbished and the shower room was very modern.   We were also given a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for my daughters Birthday and a plate of fresh fruit, which was a wonderful gesture.  This made our stay very pleasurable and I would say the hotel was great value for money.  The breakfast was very good and the staff were helpful and attentive.  The only down side to us was the reception itself could do with a bit of a make over as it lacks any warmth and does not give a feeling of a 4 star hotel. However,  I would be happy to stay here again at this price in the future.",4,2013,01,10
104,Met all our expectations!,"Just returned from a two night stay at the Park Grand with my boyfriend. Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel. I have read a few reviews that say that the rooms are small, which I do partly agree with, but this definitely didn't cause any problems. No, the rooms aren't huge, but they are clean, well decorated, and have everything you could possibly need! The bed was incredibly comfy as well! 
Upon arrival, we were greeted and checked in very quickly, and were given directions to our room. The en suite was a little bit cramped, but it was all very clean and modern, and the shower was bigger than a standard shower cubicle. We had a small problem with the toilet, as the water wouldn't stop running after a flush, but we informed reception, and they sent someone up to fix it straight away. 
Breakfast was lovely, with plenty to eat and drink and friendly waitresses. The only problem we had was that we went to breakfast at the wrong time and had to wait a bit longer for a table. But that can be avoided by not leaving it too late. 
The hotel itself is situated in a nice area, about a 10 minute walk from Hyde park, and 5 minute walk from Paddington station. We didn't really look around for any shops or restaurants particularly nearby, it seems like more of a residential area, but there are plenty of shops and the like near the station.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel, as I feel that you get a really good deal for the price you pay, it's in a lovely location, the staff are friendly, and as long as you don't expect the Ritz, you'll be fine!",4,2013,01,06
104,Yes would stop again at a good price,"Hotel a little out of the way,  close to Hyde Park, but was good value for money with breakfast was included, staff were very plesant and helpful,room was very clean and tidy, everything in room you need",4,2013,01,05
104,great for Hyde park,hotel is well situated to queensway and Hyde park hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. the only downside was the mattresses were too soft and sinks in the middle would stay there again as the overall experience was good and was excellent value,4,2013,01,05
104,Would stay again,"Booked to stay here for a weekend away before Christmas with my boyfriend. Booked 2 or 3 months in advance and was ¬£280 for 2 nights in a Club room. I read in different reviews different things about club rooms, some on one floor and very small and others that had a bed upstairs so i emailed the hotel who confirmed that the club rooms were accross 2 floors. Nearer to the time (about 2 weeks before) i checked the hotels rates and the same room for the same date was ¬£213 and then under ¬£200 just before so if you want to take a risk they still have rooms booking just before a stay seems to save you a lot of money on a room. There was a cheaper rate when initially booked in advance but the small print did state that for that rate you could be in one of their sister hotels if they did not have room so i don't know if this is what has happened to other guests who complain of being moved. I was worried about this and also read about reoccuring 'maintanence issues' at the hotel so i emailed them 2 days before and was assured our room was guarenteed and there were no problems.

We arrived an hour early at about 1pm and thought we would try and check in and our room was all ready for us. They did ask at check in if we wanted a room on 2 floors or not as they had both available, we did want the room on 2 floors and would have been dissapointed if there wasn't one available but perhaps as i emailed in advance they made sure they had this one available. The room looked as per the hotels website apart from some of the finishings were a little bit poor such as the carpets did not meet the walls and the duvet cover was ripped in places. The bed and bathroom was very clean which is the most important things to me and little things like the carpet don't really worry me. There was a half bottle of wine on arrival and a fruit basket as advertised when booking. We had signed up to their premeir awards scheme and this stated if available you get a free upgrade which would have been to their duplex suite (same room but more spacious) but i assume it was not available but perhaps if we had booked a standard room we may have been upgraded to a club room free of charge. We wanted a club room though so happy to pay for it. Feel the hotel is good value for money. Looked at others in the area for a similiar price and they looked more like hostels so very pleased booked here. It included breakfast both mornings which is normally ¬£15 each. Good selection and most if it ok but some of the cooked items were a little cold.

It was about a 10 minute walk to Paddington station but looked as if a new tube was opening this year closer to the hotel. Hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. Would definitly stay here again.",4,2013,01,02
104,mixed feelings,"We stayed 4 nights in the hotels and i have mixed feelings, some things are good and others are bad.
When we arrive at 15.00h our room was not ready, but they apoligized 2 times. And after 10 minutes we could go into the room.
At th reception desk were friendly people.
The room was small, very small. But all you need is in the room! It looked good. The bed was very small and the matress was so saggy, so with 2 people in the same bed it was not comfortable. The pilows were good!
The bathroom was clean, but in the bedroom they didn't vacuuming all the days. The cups for the tea/coffee were also dirty. We put a don't disturb sign, and at new years day at 10 in the morning the housekeeping came to knock they want to clean the room! But we had don't disturb on the door.
The worst thing in the room was the noise of the other rooms,you could hear people talk in the room next to you and in the room above us, you could hear every step the people made!!!
So we won't go back to this hotel.",3,2013,01,02
104,Load of rubbish!,"My boyfriend booked this hotel end of October as a Christmas present for me, upon arrival today to be told they had a system error and had over booked... Although When we rang up last night they confirmed we had a booking and everything was fine. I will admit after reading reviews on here last night I thought this would happen.. So they sent us in a taxi to the grand royal hotel.. And got given a room which was literally abed and that was it, you couldn't even walk around the bed! Very disappointed in this hotel as we were looking forward to our stay. Believe negative reviews and don't bother booking a room cause you won't get what you booked!",1,2012,12,31
104,"Told by rude, shabby looking staff ""have two singles or be moved""","I decided to book a trip to London as a post Christmas getaway for myself and my Mother. 
I found this hotel online as part of a special deal.

I arrived with my Mother, after half a day of sightseeing in London.  We were looking forward to a rest and cup of tea.  When we got to the desk we were faced with two unprofessional staff members.  One was looking very shabby like he could barely dress himself and the other looked reasonable.  They were both very unclear in what they were saying to us but eventually managed to state that the room we had booked had maintenance issues.  I asked why they hadn't called and they said that they hadn't had the time.  Next thing we knew we were faced with choosing two singles or going to another hotel in the Shaftesbury ""Elite"" Collection. 

We chose to swap because we wanted a twin room.  
I asked that the room be to the same standard in the alternative hotel, and that they put us in a quiet room.  
We waited for a while.  In the meantime a couple came in and were told the same thing, and offered a cup of tea (which we were not offered).

I paid then for this new room (no. 111) and we were escorted across the road to the Shaftesbury Premier.  We were given room no. 118 (The Clubman) - This room was flawed and there were air conditioning units situated outside the window (which had a draft) - we had a broken nights sleep which impacted on Sundays sightseeing. 

The Hyde Park Grand could not have been 4 Star - running a hotel isn't brain surgery - ensure you have maintenance teams at hand, train your staff to be courteous and speak in understandable and well constructed sentences, dress smartly, treat people with equality, and ensure that you stay in contact with guests should problems arise.

This is not the first time this has occurred - looking back at previous posts there have been many times this has happened - 1st Aug, 19th Oct, 31st Oct, 27th Nov, 7th Dec, 8th Dec.

I look forward to the managers response and also will be posting a review to the Shaftesbury Premier page - as that hotel also had much to be desired.

I will never go to this chain of hotels again.",1,2012,12,31
104,"Great Place , Great Prices , Great Service !","You're in Town Visiting or for Business on a budget or not ; Grand London Hyde Park is The Place!  Great customer Service . Very detailed and Professional ! From the Moment you check in
To the time you reach your Room. Rooms are very Clean . The Restaurant has a  Great Service every morning. Great People , Friendly and Professional.",5,2012,12,21
104,Winter Wonderland,"A lovely hotel, we never seemed to exit Paddington station the same way twice so it took some finding. The staff were nice, not very chatty but always said good morning and called the lift or held doors open. The room was small but adequate, the bed was SOOOOO comfy and the room temperature was perfect. The bathroom was very small but the shower took up most of this so was lovely not to climb over a bath to shower. Water temperature was perfect, towels were a little on the small side but I just like a big bath sheet!
The room was absolutely spotlessly clean, which is the main factor for me. Tea & coffee facilities were replenished each day and the hair dryer was the best I have ever used!
Breakfast was nice, I think the orange juice was a bit over diluted and the tea was quite weak on our first morning, but again this is personal preference. Everything was hot enough, there was more than enough choice and a good English breakfast is a must when we are sightseeing in London.
I would certainly consider staying here again for the price and especially if we are visiting the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland again as the location was brilliant for this. Maybe a bit too far out of the West End for a one night stay but we were there 2 so it was fine.",4,2012,12,19
104,A good Hotel definitely,"The Hotel is very nice and good compared to other 4 starred structures according to London standards.

The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable.

Breaksfast is average, but the staff throughout the structure is very helpful and ready",4,2012,12,19
104,A weekend in London,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend in December 2012. The room was clean, verry well heaten, with confortable beds.. The staff at the reception (Georgiana and Cristian) was verry helpful, always smiling,  and proactive with our requests. They provided us useful travel tips and made verry good sugestions on restaurants we could chose. We felt really confortable.",4,2012,12,16
104,Good price for location and good service,"A nice hotel in a regency terrace very close to Paddington station. Very small rooms for basic offering, but all facilities present, with very good shower pressure (often a failing in many tall hotels converted from houses). Very willing staff, excellent breakfast, comfortable beds, and clean. For the price, given its location, hard to beat imho.",4,2012,12,16
104,SOOOO HAPPPY,"I stayed at this hotel a sunday night december 2nd 2012. I have chosen because it's really 6 minutes from Paddington station. So no need to take a cab. Apart this, the reception was clean but basic and very strangely I had to pay in advance the room. They upgraded me in wonderful room with kitchen but it was too noisy so I asked for a change. Immediately they found two other rooms that Dennis showed me and I have chosen one looking on the inner court. Not a great view but calm and sunny. And again upgraded. After 10 minutes in the room, a man asked me to fix the lights of the bathroom and everything functioned so well. Perfect big tv, space for clothing and luggage too... I ADORED IT... HOPE TO COMEBACK at those low prices with high service.",4,2012,12,13
104,Do not book at this chain of hotels!,"My partner and I booked for a romantic weekend away. We booked this hotel for the locality (close to Hyde Park for winter wonderland) and the 4* rating for added comfort. I had read a couple of the reviews after I had booked, which I wish I had taken heed off!

 Upon arrival on the Friday, we were told firstly that we did not have a booking, until I showed the receptionist our booking receipt & suddenly our printed details appeared. She then told us they no longer had any rooms avalible as the hotel had maintence problems and we would have to stay at another hotel. We quired this-asking for the hotel details and she couldn't tell us the name only that it was in Notting Hill and they would arrange a complimentary taxi for us. She then assured us that the room type etc that we had booked would be the same, as we didn't wish to cause problems and it had been a long day we agreed.

 When we arrived at the 'Shaftsbury Priemier' thier Notting Hill branch, we were shown to our room which was tiny, had no bath, no wardrobe, a shower you couldn't move in and the TV didn't work-we went back to the front desk to complain as we had booked for a deluxe superior at ¬£104 per night, and were given a box. The receptionist told us she couldnt do anything, and had had a long day (hadn't we all!) and would try and look into an exchange for our second night. We asked for a gatentee of this and after an awful night in a room smaller than our bedroom at home we were moved to a club room on the first floor...which was bigger but still the standard and size of an Ibis or Travelodge room. 

Please do not book this chain of hotels as it really is not worthy of the star rating or the price.",1,2012,12,08
104,Avoid at all cost,"We booked this hotel on 4th December for a stay on the night of 5th December. When we showed up after a long days work the receptionist informed us that they did not have any rooms due to a ""maintenance issue"". The hotel continued to check in other guests who paid cash but refused to give us our pre-booked rooms. This place is a total shambles. 

Dont waste your time, book at a proper hotel that is professionally run.",1,2012,12,07
104,False Advertising,"This hotel looks a luxurious 4* hotel, rooms look large and spacious.  We booked a superior tripple room, which on the internet shows 3 single beds.  However, on checking in, our room was small with one double bed and a pull-out sofa bed.  I spoke to the receptionist and she said that they sold the double room with a sofa bed as a superior tripple room and agreed that she had a lot of complaints. Once the sofa bed was pulled out there was not enough room to swing a cat let alone have 3 women do their hair and makeup every morning!  Just no space.  
There were no shelves in the bathroom and no where to put your belongings and the room was very very basic.  The advertising of a triple room having 3 beds is just false advertsing and disappointing when there are thousands of hotels in London to choose from which do have 3  proper beds.  
However, we did get ¬£45,00 knocked of the price of our stay but only after good negotiation with the manager.
The hotel was clean and bed lined fresh and good choice for breakfast. Staff are freindly and helpful.  Just don't expect rooms to be spacious.  The hotel if very very basic!",3,2012,12,05
104,completely misled,"I pre booked this hotel back in september and arranged a Club Room ( Paid in advance ) on arrival we were allocated room 604 which bore no resemblance to images in gallery on website, the room had very strong damp and foisty odour. The room was small and when questioned I was told that it had Club Room facilities. Other rooms had Club Room clearly marked on the door. The breakfast room is small and food is terrible. When I told the reception staff I was'nt happy as we checked out the best I got was a shrugged shoulder. This Hotel is nowhere near it's 4 star rating.",1,2012,12,03
104,excellent friendly service,"stayed overnight in triple room with sisters ( two twin beds together and comfortable bed settee) 
bathroom exceptionally warm with under floor heating. Additional towels, blankets and pillows provided on request without any problem. Staff very pleasant and welcoming throughout and a special mention to the excellent restaurant staff who could not have been more accommodating.
Excellent breakfast.",5,2012,12,03
104,westbourne terrace,"Nice hotel, good hospitality,room very clean with big shower,for the price I recommand taking breakfast.you are just 5 minutes away to Paddington station, 20-25 min walk to Oxford street, the Hyde park!
you are closer to downtown but paying a reasonable price.",4,2012,12,01
104,Pleasantly surprised,"I arrived at this hotel, having got a bit lost on the way from the train station, and having first turned up at their property across the road. 

I was very pleased with the service. It was prompt, attentive and helpful. i asked for an Italian restaurant recommendation, and got one, complete with directions. 

The room was spacious, and clean (apart from one chair which probably needs a bit of a recover. Everything was on hand and easy to find. The room was well heated, and there was a fan supplied in case it became too warm. 

The bathroom was clean and well stocked. There was one cracked tile, but otherwise it was a lovely bathroom. 

The breakfast was nice, well seasoned and hot. The toaster is a set a bit wrong though, once through is barely done, and twice through is burnt! 

For the price (¬£135) in a nice part of London, with a nice room and good breakfast, I would say it is a bargain and will be staying with them again. 

I must say I have read the reviews about being put in a small room and a basement and being moved to another hotel. Please read the print when you book, if you book the flexi rate they can do this (and they make it clear) but I booked a different deal - and could still cancel 48hrs before, and I got where I paid for. Whilst I was waiting (at the wrong hotel across the road) a man was being moved to another hotel, obviously I don't know what that other property was like, but the staff were every helpful, called a taxi, which turned up for him promptly.",4,2012,11,30
104,Wouldn't want my dog to stay here!!!!,"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Originally we were ment to stay in Park Grand Paddington but on arrival we were told our room that was allocated to us had a leak (obviously a lie as I have read other people's reviews. Then when we got to there sister hotel park grand Hyde park we were taken to our room M3 away from the other hotel rooms it was cold and stunk of cigarettes. It was a tiny room you couldn't even swing a cat in there or even walk around the bed. No mini bar which Is standard in most hotels these days especially a 4 star haha this hotel is more like a 2 star if that! When I  complained I was told there was grading of rooms that's why there was no mini bar, so next time I will have to pay more that 110 pounds to get a mini bar what a joke!!! It noisy and the fire alarm went off at 11.00 pm. I'm very unhappy with my stay here and can't wait to leave tomorrow!!! Would never come back. I advise anyone looking to come to this hotel to read all the reviews it is all true!!!!!",1,2012,11,28
104,Do not stay here,"We stayed here on Saturday for a friends Birthday.  We booked for 9 people and only got 6 beds!! We were then told they had no more linen in the entire hotel to make up any spare beds.  It took from midnight to 3am to finally get some spare duvets. They expected us to sleep on the floor.  The front reception desk were rude, unhelpful and no one would take responsibility as the manager was off! Breakfast was a a joke their was 17 table for the entire capacity of the hotel.  The food was dry, cold plates, smelly cutlery and frothy orange juice.  We could not wait to leave and we were not the only ones complaining.  I would not recommend this hotel for service, helpfulness of staff, standard of food or value for money.",1,2012,11,27
104,You may book here ...doesnt mean thats where you will stay !!,"I have booked this hotel for 1st December 2012, not even stayed there yet and am disgusted by their managements treatment of us as a party!

I booked this hotel for a family shopping trip. Centrally located, near to winter wonderland The  kids could stay while later and we wouldnt have to worry about dragging them across London to get to the hotel. 

However upon calling to confirm my booking I have been told that our hotel has been moved due to double booking (I booked this hotel 3rd October 2012) . Being told I had been moved to the Shaftsbury Paddington Hotel. .. no email or telephone call recieved to say this was the case. I called again to check the address and was advised Westbourne terrace w2 3YY it would appear there are numurous Paddington Shaftsbury hotels ... which one is ours?? Is there even a room booked. I have no way of contacting them? Does this hotel even exsist. 

As I am traveling with children I am concerned if there is a room booked at all. I am terrified to book another hotel as the Park Grand London Hyde Park has my Credit Card information, and  paying for 2 hotels would blow my budget. This was meant to be a relaxing Christmas shopping trip... If you want relaxation and peace of mind DONT BOOK HERE",1,2012,11,27
104,Londons Own Fawlty Towers,"My friend and I both had rooms , on  the 1st and  5th floors which we paid ¬£135 each for the night, the rooms to be fair were'nt too bad , mine was quirky with a picture window looking straight into the bathroom .  We experienced really bad service on return from the Theatre as my friends lights didnt work , apparently we had broken them using our door cards too fast in the controls , we were actually told off :-) and I mean told off . The next morning  I was woken up by the  fire alarms which I reacted too , PANICK PANICK PANICK , only to be told it was stream in the kitchen , the alarms continued to go off all morning , so no getting back to sleep for me , reading other reviews this is a common problem.    Breakfast was the icing for us ,Chaos Chaotic Mayhem sums up Breakfast , the waiter pointed to a table and said when it was laid we were to sit there, at the same time 2 couples must have been allocated the same table and ""our "" table was pushed together with another table and the 2 couples sat down with thier Breakfast plated , only for the waiter to pick up one the guys plates and actually evict him from the table along with his friend, we were horrified , we said we would wait but was told to sit there , we were shocked at the rudeness and was upset as we had to sit with the 2 wives whilst thier husbands were made to wait holding thier plates until they were seated elsewhere   , very embaressing .  On the way back to my room,  a couplewhere  in the lift with me and the duty manager , they were extremly upset as the lady had walked into her room only  to find housekeeping trying on her shoes , this just summed up the hotel for me.  It's in a very nice location, but it is not a 4 star by any means and the service is horrendus , rude unhelpful staff.",1,2012,11,26
104,Dont take a cat!,"After 30 years of leaving school, we had a reunion in London, linking up to South Africa to our school friends there.  We came from all over Europe.  First of all, to book 5 rooms was a disaster, as the one hand didnt know what the other hand was doing.  I called to book 2 rooms for the night before the others arrived, but when I got there, they hadn't understood and changed the nights around.  I booked single rooms not thinking that they would be 1.5 by 1.5m!! It was or us or our luggage.  I then had asked if we could use a room for our skype linkup, but that was forgotten and the person that I had spoken to wasn't there of course.  It was like living in a bunker.  6,30am on saturday the alarm in the kitchens went off, so obviously we couldn't go back to sleep.  No room in the breakfast room, as there were only 17 tables for about 300 guests.  I certainly do not recommend this hotel as it put a damper on things.",1,2012,11,26
104,Never again,"Husband booked this hotel for my 40th as a surprise.  What a surprise it was they supposedly had maintenance issues (read previously in reviews) so we couldn't stay in hotel had to go Shaftesbury hotel down the road.  Our complaint and unhappiness fell on deaf ears mainly due to inexperience and not understanding us.  Was rushed to other hotel which didn't look like one at all, no apology given, no upgrade offered.  The basement box room we were given had the fire exit stairs right outside window with workmen going up and down, shouting due to blocked drains and also having a good look in our room!  Now when I say box room I mean the room was built around the bed literally, whoever was by the wall side would have to climb right over to get out and you couldn't pass by each other as not enough room.  Very close to tears at this point my husband went back upstairs to complain on the deaf ears and was told he would be shown around another room, but was just handed the keys and had to find it himself.  This room was slightly bigger and you could walking sideways get around the bed, so this one we had.
I was very disappointed in the service we received or not as the case may be and my husband was disappointed as he had the park grand booked for a month before my birthday and we didn't stay there or had any correspondence to say that there was maintenance work going on.  So I feel that they took my husbands money under false pretences because if we had wanted to stay at the Shaftesbury we would have booked it.
Absolutely disgusting service from such a big chain of hotels!

104,Business trip with all boxes ticked,"Regularly visit London on a weekly basis so a good hotel with friendly staff, warm comfy room and bed, modern facilities and a hearty cooked breakfast always are a winning formula. Well you have all of this at this hotel. It's nice to have a full sized bath in these hotels and a large flat screen wall mounted, all the furnishings are modern and the rooms are clean. Will be making this my regular hotel moving forwards.",5,2012,11,21
104,would never stay here again,"stayed here for a two night break and was constantly kept awake from noisy water pumps and  smoke alarms at five in the morning by other residents in the hotel after being moved to the top floor we were yet again woken the nexted day by another smoke alarm going off at five sort the 
place out its just too noisy 

rooms were lovely and breakfast was great cant fault that services were good rooms really clean 
but I cant just get my head around the place being so noisy I would only recommend anyone staying here if you have no one above top floor I personally feel I would never stay here again",3,2012,11,20
104,"Modern, inexpensive and nice desk staff","Stayed here solo in September.  I was moved here from the Best Western because of issues at the hotel.  They gave me free breakfast because of  my move which was nice but I wouldn't have paid for it.  A good variety of items but too expensive for breakfast.  I had one of the rooms in the basement that had a window that lit the room lightly from the window.  The room itself was very modern and recently remodeled.  I thought the size of the room was decent for London standards.  Much nicer than another Hotel I stayed at in London and cheaper too.  Also great location only 5 minutes from the tube.
The only downside to this hotel was the wall being a little thin so at times it could be noisy in the hallways and other bedrooms.",4,2012,11,20
104,Stylish and really good value,"Stayed here in November, very happy with it - stylish hotel, decent size room and v nice bathroom, comfortable, reliable & free WiFi, helpful staff, great location between Paddington and Hyde Park and some nice restaurants / useful shops nearby - very good value, would definitely recommend among some of the dodgier stays I've had in this area!",4,2012,11,16
104,Go somewhere else!,"14.11 Late check in with confirmed booking.  No room free.  Eventuall get given a room and enter it to find someone else in there.  Then end up in basement small room.  The evacuated room at 1:15am with fire alarm.  No answer from reception and then told 'lady had hair dryer on 1;15am in the morning?.
Noisy, rude, dis-organised.  - go somewhere else!",1,2012,11,15
104,Super place to stay in London,This hotel is in a perfect location for a stay in London. Quietish location for London but close to tube local shops and great pubs. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but very clean and are all you need for a stay in the capital. The breakfasts are excellent. We will definitely be back!,5,2012,11,11
104,Nice stay,"Staff very friendly & helpful. Great price for the night & room very spacious for 3 of us. Breakfast was very good also. Good location, 5 min walk or so from paddington. Would recommend & would stay here again. ",5,2012,11,05
104,Best Deal in Town,"I have to say that this hotel chain have some good deals. 
The room can be a little bit small but they are fresh and have everything you need.
I paid around 80 pounds per night for a double room including breakfast and internet.",4,2012,11,05
104,Lovely people!,"Went there for a couple of days away from it all. The staff were superb, friendly but not overbearing. The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable. Bit hectic at breakfast, but so what? Very convenient for all tourist stuff and Hyde Park etc. We will go back there? Thank you to the staff again. Well done everyone!",5,2012,11,03
104,Three night stay,"Stayed at this hotel from 28 Oct - 31 Oct. The rooms were well kept and clean but a little small, beds were nice and comfortable. The ensuite had a good sized shower with plenty of hot water.
We found the staff cheerful and very helpful, breakfast was plentiful and a good variety to suit all tastes.
Hotel is well situated only a couple of  minutes walk from Paddington station.
The only thing missing here is a bar ( I didn't see one) .",5,2012,11,01
104,Single Night Stay,"Chose this hotel as within walking distance to hospital the price was v good & included breakfast. Deluxe twin room which was nicely decorated, bigger than i thought it would be,plenty of tea & coffee also fresh fruit which was a nice touch.Bathroom was a good size shower worked well everything very clean. 
Reception was a little slow but everyone was very helpful,breakfast was hot and plentiful although when it got  busy took a little time to replenish. 
Would definitely stay again if all rooms of the standard we had.",4,2012,10,31
104,"Your booking is confirmed, but there is no room for you","That's what they said when we arrived. The staff - looking glumfaced - explained that there were two unsold rooms on the night before and the hotel had sold them to people who wanted stay more than one night. And one of those rooms they sold was ours! The staff told us this was quite common practice in this hotel and they disliked having to treat customers in this way.

I'd booked it three months before and confirmed it five days before. The receptionist tried her best to find us another room locally but all she could offer was two single rooms in Kensington. Instead we accepted the only viable alternative on offer - a room at another Park Grand hotel 40 minutes drive away on the outskirts of London. 

And all that for ¬£149. If you want somewhere to stay that actually allows you into the room you've booked - NEVER go here.",1,2012,10,31
104,2 Nights in London,"Met the standard expected for the price & locality.  Small, but very comfortable double bedroom, tastefully decorated.  Fresh towels Day 1 and Day 2. Generous selection of tea/coffee and biscuits.  Only negative was that the shower and basin were slow to drain. Would stay again.",5,2012,10,28
104,Very Good,"Hello ,we came at 26 until 30  of October . !
The rooms they was very nice but little small but we didn't had any problems .
The staff was good , very quickly , always happy and we enjoying it !
Next is the Paddington station and the bus stop to Oxford street right opposite  !
Probably we will come back ! :)",4,2012,10,27
104,"Clean, but noisy and tiny","The location of the hotel is good, just a short walk from Paddington station. And the room was neat and clean. However, these are probably the only good things going for the hotel. 

The receptionist was quite disorganised, and it took a while to check in even though our guest registration was already filled in, as we had pre-booked. 

The double room is tiny. Hardly enough room for two suitcases, and not enough room around the bed, so that the person on the far side had to clamber over the other person to get in and out of bed. 

The walls are paper thin, and we could hear quite clearly the telephone conversation going on in the room next door, as well as someone snoring. 

The fire alarm went off 5 times during our 4 night stay, normally in the middle of the night. The system should be changed to only go off in the one room, rather than throughout the whole hotel. 
",2,2012,10,24
104,Great value and handy for Paddington station and Hyde Park,After extensive searches for accommodation we came accross this hotel. We booked a club room which is on 2 floors with a double bed upstairs and double sofa bed down with a small kitchen area and microwave. Free drinks and fruit in the room and I must complement the breakfast which was plentiful and hot although at times people had to queue for a table. Would certainly say it was excellent value for money for the 3 of us when you consider London prices-  particularly when single rooms often cost as much as a double. Would certainly stay there again.,4,2012,10,23
104,Centrally located - great business hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights in October 2012.
This is my second time at Shaftesbury hotel.

Had a deluxe double which was very sizable for London standards.
Location is great for business - about 200 meters (600ft) from Paddington station.

Furniture had a bit of tear and wear but the bed is fantastic.

Biggest con is the wifi (although free) is terribly slow.

Will definitely be coming back to the same chain next time in town as it probably has the best value in town.",4,2012,10,23
104,Would stay there again,"Comfortable, clean, convenient. Everything we needed from a hotel for the night. I booked two double rooms, and mine was great with two double beds in. There seemed to be some confusion about my friend's room booking, but they soon found her a room with a single and double bed in. I get the impression the single rooms may be a bit small, but this was not our experience with the double rooms. Great service looking after our luggage before and after check out/check in, but not the most friendly of Taff, although what would you expect in London? Everything you old need and convenient location. Good quiet night's sleep too.",3,2012,10,21
104,"Book Hyde Park, Stay at Heathrow","On a recent trip to London with friends we booked 2 double rooms at this hotel.  The money was taken from our account the day before we arrived but when we can to check in, we were told we only had 1 room and were offered the following alternatives;

4 Single rooms at their Kensington Hotel OR 2 Doubles at their Heathrow Hotel.

Now normally tales of refurbishments and a mix up at reservations would make me shrug my shoulders and say C'est la vie.  However, the fact that everyone who walked in whilst we were waiting for our friends to arrive also got the same story made me suspicious...

The offer for alternative accommodation at Heathrow included taxis between London and the new hotel so seemed reasonable until you compare the price of the rooms.  We had paid central London rates while the Heathrow hotel was considerably cheaper; at least enough to cover the cost of the taxis.  

Someone less charitable than me might suggest that that the Company running these hotels is having trouble filling their Heathrow property and so are over booking their central London locations deliberately.

Initially we were told there was no manager on site to deal with our complaint but then as we persisted and refused to move away from reception, miraculously the house manager appeared.  To be fair, he could not have been more apologetic but seemed very frustrated when we continued to refuse the Heathrow deal.  He tried to find us a room locally but failed; we ended up finding a room in the City for the same price ourselves.

They did pay for our taxi to the new hotel and offered us 2 bottles of wine.  When it came it was 5.5% abv - the promise of wine was as good as the promise of a room!  They did swap for some actual red before we left but honestly, when you've 24 hours off from the Kids, you don't want to waste the first 2 sorting out hotel accommodation you think you've already got.",1,2012,10,19
104,Great location and stay,"Booked direct on the hotel website a week beforehand. Wanted to be close to Paddington as I was travelling from there in the morning. Hotel was a short walk from the station, and an easy walk even with a suitcase.

Easy check in, and was pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded to a club room - which turned out to be a living room (fridge, kettle, microwave, settee, tv) then stairs up to a huge bed on a mezzanine level, with another TV. Shower room (no bath, but that doesn't worry me) was quite small given the scale of the rest of the room, but perfectly adequate.

Only downside of my stay was that the water early evening (I was heading to a black tie dinner) was at best only warm, although it was hot in the morning.

The fact breakfast was included in the price is excellent, and the breakfast itself offered a really good choice - cereals, continental style, fruit, yoghurts, full english - all self service, but well laid out, and easy to use. And tasted good too!

I wouldnt hestitate to use this hotel again next time I am in town (I stay around 5-6 times a year), and would probably consider for using with the family too.",5,2012,10,18
104,Almost Perfect,"I use this chain a lot for business in London simply because of the excellent value for money and the fact the everything is included in the room rate (breakfast, wi-fi, broadband...).

On this occasion, when I came to the hotel, there was no room available and there were plenty of other guests in reception with the same problem. Although the duty manager claimed computer error, I rather suspect that the chain was caught out for overbooking rooms without realising that the majority of other hotels in London were also fully booked.

After eventually finding somewhere else (more expensive) to stay that night I tried calling customer service the following day to resolve the matter. They didn't call back as promised.

I went back to the hotel for the 2nd night of my stay and found that they had cancelled my booking because I ""hadn't shown"" for the first night!?!?!

Eventually the duty manager Rinha Da Silva got on to customer service, arranged a discounted upgraded room and a bottle of wine which really made a difference and which will keep me as a customer.

I think this chain has such a great offering but they need to be more careful about not damaging their brand by allowing these mess-ups to happen in the first place, especially to members of their rewards club!",4,2012,10,18
104,Don't hesitate to stay here..,"I rarely write reviews & Im always skeptical of those I see.How do I to know if the people writing the reviews are like me? Well,between my 85 yr old mom, my middle aged sister & I, one of us should be able to relate to you. This place was great for all three of us and a perfect ""middle class regular folk"" hotel for a great price (considering that surrounding areas charge more for less.)  We had a triple room that was always immaculate and immediately serviced if we had a concern. Be careful not to get fooled by some lower prices nearby...they are below average. Gouran, Rinha, Jamal and andrei exhibited superior customer service...I cannot say enough good things about them! Every trip has a few glitches and problems, but they were sympathetic, kind & made us feel like we were premiere guests!!. Park Grand is just about four blocks from Paddington  Station, a quick walk to bus stops and near some affordable restaurants.

104,Great place,"I initially had a reservation at grand royal hyde park hotel in Bayswater, where i have stayed in my previous trip to london. Because of a maintainance problem, i have been transfered to this hotel , part of their chain. I found the hotel service just perfect, anything i asked for the staff they just found a way to meet my requirements. Being a little smaller than the other hotel- grand royale- they had the time and attention for all guests. Excelent breakfast, rooms clean, quiet place, central location. Sorana",5,2012,10,13
104,Perfect balance,"Finally found the hotel near Paddington with the best trade-off between price, comfort and location. ",5,2012,10,12
104,Good Business Hotel,"I am a regular at this hotel and stay about three times a month on average for my work in London. I keep coming back because the hotel is a really reliable choice. The staff are friendly and well trained, the hotel is clean and well maintained and the prices are really reasonable for London. For those who normally stay in hotels outside London you may think the rooms are small, but honestly this hotel offers more space than most of its competitors in the Paddington area.

Furthermore I regularly recommend the hotel to colleagues who ask for advice about where to stay.",5,2012,10,11
104,Very peaceful and recommendable for families,"Very central location; good breakfast.
We had a double luxury room and we enjoyed our stay.
The only remark is that beginning of October in Londo started to be cool and we had to ask for a proatble heater in the room.
The bathromm was a bit small for 3 people.
Overall a good hotel at a reasonable price (in central London) for a family stay.

104,good amenities but very small rooms,"Stayed here for 4 days on a business trip. The staff was very pleasant and helpful..always smiling and ready to help.

Service: Excellent staff! They made the hotel feel like home!

Location: excellent with easy access to Paddington Station and availability of metered cabs. Very close to most tourist attractions. We took meter cabs to go to all places as everything was close by. The beautiful Hyde park is a 5-7 min walk and it was lovely to go there in the morning. The hotel is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood.

Breakfast: standard spread which was done well. Recommended.

Room: The room was very very small. Not recommended if you are tall or large. The bathroom was even smaller and I really cant explain how small the shower cubicle was! It felt a bit stuffy at times especially as the window opened towards a wall (we were on the ground floor).

Did not like the room beds and pillows at all. They were absolutely uncomfortable.

These complaints aside, the room was fitted with all the necessary amenities in good condition like a large flat screen TV on the wall, small cupboard with hangers, a safe on request, few drawers, a table with chair, hair dryer, electric kettle with tea/coffee options, welcome fruits and  standard toileteries in the bathroom.
They had tried to make ample usage of the space in the room. Any problem in the room was immediately addressed. The room was maintaned well and very clean. Excellent room service. They had come to fix a light in the room in my absence. They cleaned the room and changed all the towels even when housekeeping for that day was already done! They even came asking if  extra towel/bath robe etc are needed.

The hotel staff and the service definitely made up for the small size of the room.

Would recommend to take this hotel but only take the larger rooms. Ask when booking. The hotel is good value for money if the room is a bit bigger.",3,2012,10,11
104,Not recommended if you are tall or wide!!!,"We took a party here last weekend as we were going to a Ball in Park Lane and I left my booking late. The hotel is well maintained and the staff very helpful. Don't meet for a drink in the bar though - it is really just a couple of fridges and a counter in the rather unappealing breakfast room.  The rooms are well kitted out and new but very, very small. The bathroom is tricky to manoeuvre round as a normal sized person let alone if you are larger than average.",3,2012,10,10
104,First impressions,"When we arrived I can only guess the receptionist was not having a great day. We checked in eventually after finally locating our booking was given our room number but not told how to locate it or where we could find breakfast the next morning. Our room was small but adequate although the aircon didn't have a lot of oomph and it was much needed due to the warm temperature of the room. The view from the window was of a wall covered in bird poo and the furniture was heavily water marked. First impressions were a bit worrying but things improved, the breakfast staff were friendly and the food itself was fine.  The receptionist on duty when we checked out was efficient and friendly, what a shame she wasn't on duty to welcome us too.  Very pleased with the price we paid but I wouldn't rush back, certainly not in the warmer weather.  ",3,2012,10,07
104,Unpleasant Experience,"When our party of 7 arrived at the hotel after a 15 hours flight, we were told that only one room was available. The receptionist took about 45 min to check us in. For the other 4, we were told to spend one night at their sister hotel, a Park Grand hotel which is 20-25 min away. But it was not so. The hotel was located near Heathrow airport, a good 45 min drive from the city. I was disappointed that the staff was not telling the truth. The breakfast was good. The complimentary wifi is very unreliable with intermittent disruptions. It is best to use the internet between 4-6 am when it is working well. The bathroom is super small, very much smaller than one you find in the balcony class of a cruise ship. Imagine, when you brush your teeth, your hand will hit the wall. We stayed at a duplex room, good for four, but the sofa bed need to be replaced coz the spring can no longer support the weigh of 2 adults.",3,2012,10,06
104,Good option,"Very good hotel with an ok price. Stayed there for two nights with my girlfriend while we were in London for a conference, and we were happy to say it was a good choice. The location is very practical, being only a couple of minute from Paddington station. The room had a good size and was very comfortable. The underfloor heating in the bathroom makes wonders when you want to have a shower in a cold morning! Staff at the reception was also very nice and helpfull. The only downside for us was the elevator voice in the morning... I believe people would be able to ear if it was going up and down with lower volume.
All in all, we would stay here again.",4,2012,10,06
104,good value for money,"Great area for base to sightsee london, big room for 3 people and fantastic bathroom, clean,well presented, staff were brilliant, breakfast was very good  with  a large  hot english to a cold continental choice to choose from,   a hotel that we will book again for future london visits. Access to underground and train station very close",5,2012,10,04
104,Impressive room at an excellent price.,"I booked the Park Grand at short notice for a one night stay with my wife. We booked a Club Room  at a very competitive ¬£111. The staff were excellent. Each time we entered the hotel the door was opened for us and we were offered help to take our luggage to our room. The room was in fact a suite on two levels In the lower level there was the bathroom and a kitchen area in the lounge.There was also a table, 2 club chairs, a flat screen TV and a bed settee. There were flowers, fruit, tea/coffee/ 2 complimentary soft drinks and a small bottle of wine and a flat screen TV. The bedroom was on a mezzanine floor. The bed was king-size and a second flat screen TV. 
The breakfast, which was included in the price was excellent.

As other reviews mention it is in an excellent location.",5,2012,10,02
104,"Good location, pleasant stay","Was due to stay in the Grand Royale London Hyde Park hotel but due to maintainence problems at the hotel we were sent to this one instead. We did not have a problem with this as we were notified a few days before travel and this hotel was still in the area we needed as we were going to the Wireless Festival which takes place in Hyde Park so we were happy as this hotel was still within walking distance. We also received complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience.

Check in was fast, our room was a bit of a maze to get to, lots of stairs and corridors once you get out of the lift. The room was small but not overly, and we didn't actually spend much time in there anyway so we weren't too bothered. The bed was comfortable. Being on one of the higher floors we had a lovely view from the window. The bathroom had a heated floor and the shower was powerful. The decor was nice and modern. The bedside lamp wasn't working when we arrived but someone came up to fix it instantly. Whenever we rang down for anything it was brought up extremely fast.

Breakfast wasn't anything special. I requested a fried egg on both mornings and they were brought out swimming in grease. The bacon looked as if it could have been cooked for a bit longer. And there didn't seem to be enough staff to be able to seat people, replenish cutlery and clear tables. In fact, it seemed to be just one poor woman doing all the work.

Overall we had a pleasant stay and would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,10,02
104,Nicely situated,Just returned fro three days away with a friend. The hotel is in a great situation for exploring London. The staff at the hotel were brilliant nothing was to much trouble for them. Hotel was spotlessly clean and the breakfast was wonderful. We did have a little blip!! with the lights in our room but the Manager took the trouble to ring us and the problem was soon rectified. I would definately recommend this hotel.,5,2012,10,02
104,Good value for money,"I recently stayed there with my wife, and we got a room for GBP 107,25, which is good, considering the chique neighboorhoud and the easy access to all transport. The room was not big, but both room and bathroom had everything you need and were very tidy. You get tea etc ... and there were bathrobes, a desk, wifi, flat-screen tv, etc ...",4,2012,10,01
104,Weeken away with girls,We booked last minute to stay so was not sure what we were going to get. When we arrived we found staff to be very helpful and polite. Room was a little on the small size but totally adequate for what we needed and clean. Breakfast had plenty of choice and set us up for a long day in the centre of London.,5,2012,10,01
104,"Cheap dump, basement rooms are rabbit warren!","First the girl lied to me. She said that they had ""maintenance problems"" and that she did not have a room for me as a result. Then she got on the phone with some central booking operator, who put her on hold. I kicked up a stink. She said that ""the other property"" only had a room at Heathrow!!  I kicked up more stink! Then she did have a room for me, but it was in the basement. Tiny, old, worn-out, barely clean and difficult to get to as it is an underground rabbit warren. The only good thing is the wireless internet, so I can write this review. Be warned, this place over-books it's rooms, they are terrible. But this is London, for a good room you have to pay a fortune.",1,2012,09,27
104,A great stay,"I recently spent four nights in this hotel, it was a very good experience, the room was tidy, very clean and comfortable, the staff always helpful and very kind. The location is perfect, very close to paddington and lancaster gate. Very recommended!",5,2012,09,26
104,Surprised at how spacious the room was,"We booked this online last minute a couple of hours before arriving for about GBP95.00.  We had room 402 (one drawback to the location was that you had a short flight of stairs to get to the room (we had 2 large suitcases and two carry ons) so it was a bit of a struggle.  On entering the room I was surprised at how nicely furnished it was and how spacious.  There was a pull out sofa bed and the bathroom was also large and room and plenty of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and soaps, extra towels etc.  We had a view of the city and it was glorious weather and we could leave the window open so no need for a/c (it had a/c).  Check in was friendly and quick.  We only spent one night and sorry we did not book this for the next few days.  The manager was there at check in and again when we checked out (fresh apples in a bowl at the desk!) and they all asked us if we enjoyed our stay (we did!).  Although a little further out than we are used to it was still within walking distance of everything we needed.",5,2012,09,24
104,As usual for a hotel in London,"The hotel is very well located close to Paddington underground station, it's very clean but, as usual, the room is so small, even if I've booked a superior double...the bathroom is 80 cm width!! The breakfast is good, with a big choice of what you like (sweets, toasts, ham&cheese, eggs...). It's not so cheap but ok if you're looking for a good service, a clean room and a good breakfast.",3,2012,09,24
104,Not the best,"Ok well lets start with check in. Arrived at 1230  only 1 person on reception. Lets say stop would have been faster. Staff were all very pleasant I have to say(but too slow) Told my room would not be ready (this was not going down well with the other guests either) and to come back at 2 but to cough up payment first . I retuned at 140 and joined the queue ( ill spare you the sighs and moans as one receptionist slowly checked everyone in) I was given my room card and told to take the lift which I did to find there was no such room number, I had to return to reception and was then told it wasn't that lift ( that I was told to take) it was through the doors and up the stairs anyway let's say the whole experience was painful. 

Room : very nice , clean and tidy .

Staff : very pleasant 

Overall : I wouldn't return I'm afraid the whole checking in process is to long and painfully tiring.",2,2012,09,21
104,FIRE! Not again!,"I will try to be as objective as  can. We booked the Grand Royale Hotel in Inverness Terrace, Bayswater but were phoned while on the train to London that their boiler had broken and we were being sent to the Park Grand, both part of the Shaftesbury Hotel Group. We were taken by taxi from one hotel to the other and given a free breakfast each day.

The hotel was supposedly rated four star although the AA certificate hanging behind reception referred to another hotel.

We were in a room on the seventh floor - part of the roof! Access was by lift to sixth floor and then stairs up one flight (not particularly easy stairs either, especially with luggage). The room was very small, hardly room to get between bed and desk. The shower-room was very modern but also very small - but not untypical of London hotels. The room was reasonably clean though slightly tatty.

Throughout our two night stay we were disturbed three times by the fire alarm, which were all false alarms and blamed on someone having a shower with door open! At 3:20 a.m.??

Breakfast was quite an experience! I have to say that throughout the stay all the staff were friendly and helpful. There seemed plenty of staff around at breakfast but unfortunately they were either poorly trained and/or could not communicate with each other. The food was hardly warm and was actually quite cold by the time it was placed on cold plates and taken back to the table. Items of food had often run out without the staff noticing and then they could only replace one thing at a time, so by the time I waited for some bacon to arrive the baked beans had all gone. The only eggs available at the buffet were scrambled and boiled, fried or poached needed to be ordered. One member of staff looked quite puzzled when I asked for a fried egg! Then I had to hang about for it as I wanted it with the rest of the my breakfast. If you got up from your table to get some coffee or toast etc, you could find your table cleared by the time you returned!

There was only one lift and so there was often a long wait to use it and heaven knows what happens if it breaks down - I would not have fancied seven flights of stairs!

We also had a problem with the cold water - at random times it would just stop for a few minutes before spluttering back to life. If this happened while in the shower, the shower would cut out. If you were using the wash basin the water would suddenly go extremely hot.

I don't wish to sound too negative - the staff were good and the location of the hotel was reasonable - just don't think it was up to four start standard.",3,2012,09,21
104,A Good Stay,"Room was clean, Emma and all the staff ws extremely polite. Stayed at a two single room with sofa which may have slept four, but we prefered to sleep three on two beds (two adults and a child) as the beds were luxurious. The room was spacious with TV and aircondition (which we did not need to use). The bathroom was clean. Breakfast tasty and plenty. Booked with an offer so it was very good value-for money, Near Paddington station and Lancaster gate (central line) which proved very convenient.",5,2012,09,21
104,Good stay,"A good stay. Room was clean. Miriam had been good to change us into a room with 3 single beds, instead of 2 singles with 1 sofa bed. The beds were comfortable. Staff were helpful. Close to paddington tube station. Love the stay and wud come back.",4,2012,09,18
104,Really good stay,Had an excellent spacious room that had both air conditioning and windows that I could open. As I tend to stay in Shaftesbury hotels around town. The only issue I had was with the elevator being constantly full. Otherwise I had a really good stay and will definitely use it again in the future.,5,2012,09,17
104,City break at the Park Grand Hotel,"We booked via the internet on a special 'one day' offer. It was excellent value. Room and bathroom very clean although the bathroom was very small. A friend who was staying in another room had a much bigger bathroom. Luck of the draw.

Bed was very comfortable but the walls are pretty thin.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking is great, immediately outside the hotel. Good breakfast. Book your breakfast as it is ¬£3.00 cheaper!",5,2012,09,17
104,Nightmare,"Booked a 5 night stay (on day 2 right now).. 
After arriving fRom Paris and an exhausting day of sightseeing, went to have a shower and no hot water.  Staff said nothing could be done until morning. So today i asked to speak to a manager. Not only did i tell her of the hot water problem  (which the night staff had made no record of) i demanded an upgraded room as the one we were in was so small there was no room for our suitcases.
Upgrade, omg  the room is no bigger, wallpaper is pealing  from wall and it's noisy and smells musty.",1,2012,09,15
104,Easy access,"We stayed here for two nights on the hotest weekend of the year!  The air conditioning was a godsend.  The hotel is in easy walking distance from Paddington and Hyde Park.  There are plenty of restaurants and cafes close by so paying for breakfast isn't really necessary.  The rooms are compact but nicely decorated, with a lovely comfortable bed and pillows.  There is a safe in the room which was very useful.  The bathrooms are modern and very clean and bright.  The shower was very powerful.  We had fruit in our room on arrival but no bottled water as stated on the website.  The staff were very helpful and  we were allocated another room as ours wasn't ready on arrival.  There are free daily papers in the reception and lounge areas.  We enjoyed our stay here. It was clean and comfortable and a place to rest up after a busy day in the city.",5,2012,09,14
104,"Lots of surprises, none of them pleasant","I doubt the authenticity of any review here that rates this hotel as anything higher than average.  If you're lucky, they might, on their best day, make it to average.

More likely, you're in for a bad experience.  Hotel doesn't have all the amenities it advertises, those it does have, are liable not to work.  And, for an interesting experience, try having a shower in the morning without cold water (yes, I said cold water).

Our stay was very unpleasant, and I mentioned it to the day staff (who, unlike some of the night staff, are actually nice enough).  Manager contacted me to ask for another chance.  But when I contacted him to book another stay at a promised discount rate, I never heard back from him.

I haven't even mentioned the tiny and shabby rooms, which, in fairness, are typical of most of the hotels in the area.

Overall, this hotel is rated as ""ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK"".",1,2012,09,14
104,Good size of room,Booked this hotel on booking.com in the morning arrived around 1pm checked in and our room was ready. Just around the corner from Paddington so very handy. It was clean the staff were very helpful. I would recommend staying here to anyone.Good value for money.,4,2012,09,13
104,"Good location, accommodation and staff","I've stayed at Park Grand London Hyde Park twice now, having selected it off Trip Advisor in the first place. This is a good place to staff for the traveller wanting a reasonable place in London which is not too expensive. The rooms are not large but adequate - well the shower in some rooms is a tad small - and are comfortable. Between the first and second visits they have rolled out wifi to the rooms, which is a real plus; and there is no extra charge like in other places which add ¬£10 a day.

The lounge is a comfortable place to work and sit and the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. Best to get a price with breakfast included or go up Praed St.

Paddington is an easy place to travel around from and has a range of places to eat.",4,2012,09,13
104,Fab deal for overnight stay.,"Booked the room on lastminute.com - a deluxe double for ¬£95. We were only in town for one night and wanted somewhere with a good location and easy access to transport and weren't expecting much in the way of frills. Considering that our room worked out as cheaper than staying in a Travelodge what we got was fantastic. 

The room was twice as big as we expected with a sitting room-type space and then a flight of stairs that led to the big, spacious double above. We were only a couple but this would have been perfect for families as the sofa could be pulled out to make another double effectively turning the room from a double to a quadruple. The bed itself was really comfy! The little kitchenette was cute even if we didn't use it at all. Overall, it was a large and spacious room looking out over the street and we had a great time. 

The staff on arrival were perfectly adequate - not exactly friendly but got the job done. When we were checking out, however, the lady on the desk seemed to make a special effort to ask how we slept and to wish us a warm farewell which was nice! We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the state of the breakfasts although our thought was a bit pricey at ¬£15 per person when there are plenty of little cafes etc just down the road which were delicious and much cheaper!",5,2012,09,12
104,Convenient location but dinting  small room,We arrived at Paddington and struggled to find the hotel as the name is the same as another one nearby.We were disapointed with the size of the room we had as I expected more from a hotel rated 4 stars. It was clean and convenient but I probably would try a different hotel next time.,3,2012,09,11
104,Exasperating,"bait and switch. Booked this hotel due to proximity to paddington station. Quick walk to find it, only to be told our REAL hotel was down the street. After much walking to find it (passive-aggressive desk staff give wrong directions), check in to find room too small for 2 suitcases. Purports to be 4 star - maybe 2. Purports to have wifi. Only in cramped lobby full of angry relocated people. ",2,2012,09,09
104,Definitely not a 4 Star Hotel!!,"I stayed here last week and was very disappointed as the pictures on the website make the hotel look Grand, but it isn't at all. I managed to get a good last minute deal online, on their website. Whether this is why I got an awful room, I don't know, but I asked to move, as they put me in the basement, which is like a maze, no signs to direct you back to reception and the room stunk of paint and the window had a massive crack on it and the windows were also about 100 years old, they did not open or shut very well, I might as well have had no windows! For a 4 star hotel this should NOT be the case! I also had a huge loud hot generator making an awful racket outside the window, so I asked to move, which they happily helped with, but the 2nd room was not much better, the windows were still broken and I could barley get in the bathroom, it was so small! There were also paint marks on the table and the chair in the room. It looks like they have added new rooms and done a quick job decorating, to get people in ASAP and they have not added TLC to them, which makes them look and feel cheap. I definitely will not be staying there again and it should be a 3 star at the very most.",2,2012,09,09
104,Very good location,"The hotel is in a very good location. Quite peaceful with good restaurants and transportation around the corner. Good and helpful service at reception and nice and clean in the room and the rest of the hotel. The room though, was very small, but the price was good, so you get what you pay for. I will go back, but next time I will book a larger room. Then I will give a 4.",3,2012,09,08
104,"Good, but not 4****","The location, the room & the price we paid for our stay we excellent. It was just the small things that let it down - Room Service : Sandwich was poor quality & stale & not presentation the best. Breakfast: Quality of the food was again poor, all felt a bit dated considering how modern the rest of the hotel is. Lots of nice staff but no actual table service, didn't even explain where things were & what was available. Noise: Windows very thin, no sound profing between rooms. We were kept awake most of the night by traffic noise & other guests just moving about in there rooms. Despite these issues I think we would stay again & give it another try. Staff very polite, helpful & nice. ",3,2012,09,07
104,Mixed feeling,"Having read all recent coments , we booked this hotel. My husband and our 10 year old son decided to stay here. 
On arrival were help by porter for luggage and our check in was easy, very helpful reception but room had stairs which was not expected. I enquired for other room but hotel was fully booked. 
Howere we were promised to be moved next day.
Only thing which I didn't likes the breakfast room which was in basement &  too long to walk from our room . Rest, we enjoyed our breafast as it was most expensive breafast I ever had in basement(¬£15).

On departure I request to see manger and was offered ¬£ 2 off per b/ fast which was good enough. 
This hotel is good hotel with friendly staff but bit overpriced :-(",5,2012,09,05
104,"A good hotel, would recommend.","I stayed at this hotel at the end of August with my mum and son for 2 nights on a sightseeing trip. We stayed in a triple superior room on the 6th floor. The room was pleasant and well sized, yes the bathroom is small but only as you expect from a hotel room and big enough to move around in. The staff were polite and friendly and the breakfast was good too. 
The location is great, a 5-10 minute walk from Paddington tube station, has various convinience shops, a Cheers wine shop and Italian restaurants nearby.
We booked at the 50% special deal rate and beleive it was great value for money.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again and have already recommended to family and friends.",4,2012,09,04
104,They saved our short stay,"Firstly please note that the Park Grand is not a 4 star hotel but 4 star ""guest accommodation"" there is a rather large difference, however for the price it is WELL worth the money.

We were in London for a friends wedding and had to leave the previous hotel in the early hours due to an infestation of Bed Bugs and at 6.30 in the morning began our hunt for somewhere else. Stumbling in the Paddington Area we finally came across the Park Grand at about 8.15am. The receptionist was very friendly, polite and efficient in getting us a price and informing us that currently nothing was available. However due to our predicament and deciding that it was really our last chance as we had to be out of London by midday to attend said function.

Back in the reception desk I enquired as to the earliest twin or double, we were desperate to get somewhere and the lady on reception on the 30th of August called Housekeeping and also got the porter to check the room, we reserved a room, paid up front and managed to drop our things, change and leave for the day. Room 702 is spacious, clean, modern and with everything you need for a stay in London and at ¬£82.00 per room per night we couldnt complain after the night before.

Iron was provided in the room, basics like shampoo and above all a clean space with nothing to grumble about, we needed a comfortable, quiet nights sleep on our return. 

Breakfast was served over 3 hours with a cold buffet or hot plate buffet, juices, fruit, tea and coffee. With this all included in the price, no wonder it seemed rather busy. We couldnt have asked for a better nights sleep and a special thank-you to the housekeeping, reception and porter team early on the 30th, you really did save us from quite an atrocious stay. I work in the industry and realise how hard it is to fulfill everyones needs all of the time, but on this occasion I cannot thank you enough.

DO stay here, the staff are friendly, its clean, modern, upmarket and best of all a stones throw from Central London. We shall definately be returning.",5,2012,09,04
104,Professional & friendly,"I selected this hotel as it is very near to paddington station .When we arrive they didn't have our room ready , the gentleman  upgraded my room and was big room for two of us.
Location is perfect , staff was helpful.I am going to pick up this hotel again when coming to London. ",5,2012,09,04
104,NOT a 4star!!- would not stay again,"When booking this room i booked two rooms together, when i got to the hotel one room was on the 6th floor and one was the basement, the reception staff gave us a small plate of fruit and a small wine for the inconvience\

To get to my room I had to get the lift to 6th floor then walk to flights of stairs, the coridoors were unbelievably hot! 

Seeing my room i was shocked!! It was really small and not well pressented! there was stained cup marks and th windows had rotten! One of the rooms didnt have a long mirror so it was hard to e ready. I wouldnt recommed the hotel but the distance for things is not too bad, we could walk to local food places and shops.

Overall the hotel is not very nice, defentley not a 4star!! But the location of this hotel is quite good

I wouldnt reccommed this hotel for anyone in a wheelchair /stability problems or who is using pushchairs and there are stairs to the hotel and stairs to the rooms",2,2012,09,03
104,Excellent service,"Hi to any person reading this review. My husband and i stayed here for 4 nights during the Olympics and added to that wonderful experience (we had tickets for the games) was our great stay at this great hotel, right in the centre of this great city. there is every possible thing a couple might need here, shops all kinds and great places to eat apart from hotel the tube to all parts of London so handy(glad we left our car outside London)we will stay here again for certain . The garden in the middle of city was the cherry on top and the hotel workers well words can only describe them as top class all from many different nations with the hotel guest as their no 1 priority. Breakfast is good and you can take a fresh apple in the reception when leaving/entering.
I would really recommend this hotel to my family and friends !!!!!!!!",5,2012,09,01
104,Great stay,"Excellent location near Paddington, 7 minutes' walk to Little Venice. Room very comfortable. Strange bathroom - extra-large shower at expense of shelves and hooks, but no problem. Staff friendly and helpful. I look forward to returning to this hotel.",4,2012,09,01
104,excellent value,"A very good hotel in a great location.All the staff were helpful and friendly.Our room was modern,clean and the beds were very comfortable.It was on the small side but you don't go to London to stay in your room.Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice.Would definately stay again.",4,2012,09,01
104,great staff,"Stayed two nights in August two adults two children in family room with two queen size beds,large picture window, a really good size bedroom for London what more could you want for a sighseeing weekend?.its a very large busy hotel but we found no problem with queuing for check-in breakfast etc.Staff,food, cleanliness all excellent,will return.",5,2012,09,01
104,Great value for money,"Close walk to both Paddington and Lancaster Gate. Rooms were great, our bed was so comfy which was much needed after a day of walking around London! Breakfast was excellent and the staff were helpful and friendly. Only downfall was the loud banging that started at 8am in the room above us.",4,2012,08,31
104,London trip,"When first walked to hotel , staff was very helpful and accommodating. Rooms were not ready so we left our bags there for free. It's in a good location. When we came back we were upgraded . We visit London twice a year and stayed many hotel but for this price it is the best we ever found.",5,2012,08,30
104,Extortionate Price and Rude Receptionist,"I booked here through an online site because it was one of the few hotels available during the Olympics that had rooms available that were just extortionate in price rather than extremely extortionate in price.  However when we attempted to check in, a very rude receptionist tried to tell us that we were no longer staying at the hotel but we could not understand what she was saying.  Eventually she managed to explain that we had been bumped over to the Shaftesbury hotel.  Despite asking why we were being moved no reason was offered or given.  From reading reviews of this hotel and the Shaftesbury we may have had luck escape but it does not excuse terrible customer service.",2,2012,08,28
104,OK for the price,"Found this by chance on-line -offer of the day. This hotel is OK for the price we paid. The rooms are clean and adequate, although it was described as having a fridge but we couldn't find it! The location is great for certain areas of London, you can walk to Kensington Palace from the hotel -it's literally only a 15/20 minute gentle walk through the gardens off the Bayswater Road.the price didn't include breakfast so we pre-ordered this. The breakfast staff need to be more aware of customers needs, after a little mix up with staff not having us down for a pre-booked breakfast we were pretty much left to fend for ourselves not knowing what the system  was for breakfast. Also they had run out of eggs, and it took an age for them to top these up, staff seem to avoid eye contact with you and so consequently miss important cues from customers that could easily be recified. The breakfast was adequate though a little over-priced. the hotel round the corner does a full english for ¬£7.50. 
Also we asked the hotel to order us a taxi, we were not told until the taxi turned up that it's there own car/driver and subsequently at a much higher price, it left us in an awkward position and out of politeness we used the service. This should be made clear to you at the time of requesting. We estimated that we paid an extra ¬£5 for that service which is fine if you are made aware of this.Otherwise you can flag a taxi down outside the hotel.
All in all this was an OK hotel in which I would stay in again, great location, clean and adequate rooms, friendly man in the reception area.",3,2012,08,28
104,EVERY ROOM HAD FAULTS,"We wasnt supose to stay at this hotel, we had orignally booked a hotel at inverness terrance bayswater but on the day had a all to say due to maintenance we had been oved ( load of rubbish - they do this all the time - see reviews ) we were moved to this hotel which is a 5 min walk to paddigton but away from bayswater where we wanted to be.

We were first moved to room 115 which was very small and has a tiny shower and as a larger lady i requested a bath we were them moved to room 810 which had a bath but had no air con and the window was over a generator which was too noisy to have the windw open. We were then moved to 110 which again had all the same issues and had a massive crack on the ceiling. 

We then complained to staff as this moving aroud trook 1 hour and we missed our dinner plans and were not happy, we were then upgraded to a deluxe room which had no bath but a bigger shower, it was a top floor room and was ok  - bed was softer but still a tiny room

hotel offered us 25% back on our stay and a free breakfast and free taxi to notting hil carnival which was nice of them, but this is no way a 4 star hotel, at most a 3 , probally a 2+

staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast was gorgeous, but hotel and its chain need to sort itself out.

I like 4 star plus hotel but would never use this chain again

Please stay away, its cheap for a reason.",2,2012,08,28
104,Great stay just minutes away from Paddington station,"provided us with great value for money, convieniently situated very clean and comfortable with use of a kitchen facilities. Beds were very comfortable, breakfast was good value for mony with great service throughout.m",5,2012,08,27
104,Excellent value for money,"Excellent value for money at this clean friendly hotel, plenty of ameneties offered and all utilities worked as they should. The quiet location was as described just five minutes walk from Paddington trains and tubes, the air conditioning was a godsend for an August break.

The staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast's wholesome and plentiful. No complaints, just a well done to the management and staff of the Park Grand Hotel Hyde Park London, who provided us with excellent value for money in a Duplex/Quad room with two adults and two teenagers",4,2012,08,26
104,Friendly Hotel close to good restaurants and tube station,"We stayed here with our 2 grandchildren in a ""quad"" room which consisted of 2 very comfortable double beds. Room was small but very clean and tidy. Bathroom was very small but excellent power shower. Staff were very friendly and the breakfast was good. Concierge facility enabled us to leave our luggage free of charge on our departure day for collection later that evening.",4,2012,08,24
104,Great stay!,"We checked out yesterday after a 3 night stay with our 2 kids aged 12 & 8. We stayed in London to do all the tourist things and have absolutely loved it! 
The hotel was perfect for our needs and I would highly recommend it for families with children. We stayed in a clubroom (or duplex suite as it was described on the website). We had a super-comfy bed downstairs and the kids were upstairs on a mezzanine level (which they loved). There was a flatscreen tv on both levels and even a small kitchenette upstairs!
Bathroom was small but luxurious with toilettries. Breakfast had everything we all fancied. Fresh fruit and flowers and even free wifi in the rooms. The staff were polite and helpful. The hotel was modern, clean and well presented. 
To sum up, it was perfect for us, we will stay again. When we booked in the day before, there was a special offer and I can't believe we paid less for this quality hotel than 3 nights in a Travelodge without breakfast!!",5,2012,08,24
104,A lovely stay,"I was a little dubious after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor.  However we arrived mid noon and were promptly checked.  We did have to leave a ¬£10 deposit and thr girl on reception couldn't really explain why, however this was refunded us the next day!
Our room was very warm but soon cooled down when we put the air con on! Room had water leak mark on ceiling, however was immaculately clean! Bathroom is so small you bang your elbow on shower when cleaning your teeth and I could hear the person next door snoring! 
Breakfast was lovely and served 7.30-10.30! For the price we payed it was good value for money and good location! ",4,2012,08,22
104,Excellent Value For Money In Great Location,"I arrived at the hotel just after 11.00am and was told that check-in would not be until 2pm which was fine - I waited in the area adjacent to the reception desk as I had just arrived after a 27 hour flight and was content just to sit.

Just after 1pm I was advised that my room was ready -  room #501. Upon arrival at the room I was amazed at the size of the room after having stayed in horrifically small rooms in London hotels previously.

The room contained a King size bed and was split level with a glass wall seperating the bathroom from the bedroom - it was simply brilliant!!

The room appeared to be newly refurbished and contained a welcome fruit basket and complimentary bottled spring water.

Even with the window open there was complete silence from traffic.

Breakfast was standard English with all expected items.

Hyde park was a 15 minute walk away with Paddington Station only 5 minutes from the hotel.

Contrary to other reviews on this hotel I have no issue at all in highly recommending this property!!",4,2012,08,15
104,ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING HOTEL - LIED TO BY CHECK IN STAFF,"I work in travel and let me start by saying i never take much notice to reviews on trip adviser...... DO NOT BOOKTHIS HOTEL AND TAKE NOTICE OF ALL THE REVIEWS BELOW,  UPON REFLECTION MY EXPERIENCE APPEARS TO BE A COMMON THEME WITH BOOKINGS AT THIS HOTEL.

I booked a DUPLEX SUITE ROOM, directly with the hotel online and payment was taken from my card before arrival.

 I arrived at the hotel at 12pm, signed my booking card, filled in my personal details and was told my room wasnt yet ready and check in was scheduled for 2pm.   All Absolutely fine this 2 hr wait would give me the chance to get my bearings etc.  The hotel stored my bag for these 2 hours.  

The room that was on my checkin card which i signed allocated to me and my party of 3 was 122.

I returned to the hotel at around 14.30 and this is when it stared to go wrong..... When i arrived to get my key for my room, the Girl on Checkin Emma -  was frantically looking for my details and such That i asked her if everything was ok..... I was then told that the hotel no longer had my room available and no longer had a Duplex suite available.  She spent several calls back and forward to what in assuming is central resevations, who continually kept hanging up on her.  They were telling her to tell me that the room wasnt available and i had been allocated another room.  this went on for another 5mins and she finally handed over a key to room 202, to which I asked - ""this is a duplex suite?""  - She instantly replied  ""yes"".

My party of three headed up the lift to our room.  Upon opening the door not shocked by what i Found this was a double room.  NOT A DUPLEX SUITE.  There was a double bed and i sofa bed that if i wanted to actually open i would have had to have piled up other furniture on top of each other and moving the sofa bed into an angle.  

To say i was raging was an understatement.  I booked paid and signed for a DUPLEX SUITE.  I got LIED to by the receptionist Emma.  I was told on my return to the receprion desk that my booking was never confirmed and they allocate rooms on checkin and there was none left. I was on Q apparently.  I demanded to see what i had signed only 2hrs earlier.  I demanded to speak to the resevations team and that i would NOT accept that room as it wasnt what i paid for.  there was no manger on site either and I was told I would only be able to speak to resevartions in the morning as they were refusing to speak to me.   They told emma that 202 was a QUAD room and that was the only room they were prepared to put me into.  THAT WAS NOT A QUAD ROOM.  I DO HAVE PHOTOS OF THIS ROOM.   I finally got a copy of what i had signed for but i was told this room was occupied by another party, there was a mistake by resevations.

After much shouting and deliberation - we got another room for my friend to sleep in as there was no way Anyone could have slept on the sofa bed in the tiny space that it was suppose to fold out into.  ROOM M4 - Was what could only be described as a total hole.  it was disgusting, but we had no other option but to take it.

The thing I am angry about the most is when we first arrived at the hotel -  if they didnt have the room why take our bags and get us to come back?  they must have know that the room wasnt there.  We were heading to the Olympic closing ceremony and I wasted more time than I need to arguing with staff 3hrs after first got to the hotel.  THEN BEING LIED TO - SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN I WOULD COME BACK DOWN AFTER SHE LIED SAYING IT WAS A DUPLEX.  I WAS FURIOUS. 

My theory is that i booked online and i got 50% off the room rate as per the special they were running.  They then took a booking from someone that paid full price and I was made to go into a room that i could have booked online for cheaper than what I paid for which was the DUPLEX.

 The next day I spoke the manager Ankur.  He was very apologetic but could not offer me an explanation as to why my room was there at 12 but not there by 2.  He offered me a 30% refund on my stay - refused saying i want a full refund.  He said he could not do that and then offered me a 25% refund......... EH???????  My total bill was ¬£116.  - ¬£36 back was what i was offered.  SHOCKING.  I said i would not accept anything less than ¬£66 - after being messed around and then lied to.  Again i asked him why the room wasnt available and he said we unfortunately had to carry out maintanance on the room and it wasnt fit health and safety for any guests........ FUNNY CAUSE THATS NOT WHATS I WAS TOLD BY EMMA YESTERDAY.  And upon this health and safety revelation -  i would like the health and safety looked into on room 202 -  a quad room that requires you to physically move a chair, table, dressing able and a sofa to get a bed out.

i got a refund of ¬£50 and Im still not happy.  I am going to be getting in contact with the reservations of this hotel and will be passing my experience onto my own company to make sure that we as a Company NEVER book this bunch of cowboys

DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL.  DO NOT BOOK ANY HOTELS IN THE SHAFTESBURY HOTEL GROUP.",1,2012,08,14
104,Very good breakfast.,"We stayed here for four nights during the OS week. It was very clean and just around 5-10 min walk to the underground. The breakfast was the best breakfast we haved eat in London, been here about five times. We would come back.",4,2012,08,12
104,A cupboard in the basement!,"We were transferred here as the Best Western hotel that we had booked had mysteriously had a flood in 30 bedrooms ( overbooked, more like!) My friend and I had 2 Deluxe single rooms booked and we were told that the equivalent would be given at the Park Grand. Well if this was Deluxe,  I would hate to see the Standard rooms. It was no more than a cupboard - the tiny bed was pushed against the wall to allow you to walk past to the window which overlooked the basement wall. Dark, old, scratched furniture completed the look! The bathroom was tiny - not even room to hang the hand towel. Park Grand you should be ashamed to give rooms like this to guests who have paid good money for decent accomodation. 
The bar was a disgrace - it is not a bar it is the breakfast room and was closed at 10.30pm when we arrived back after an Olympic event in need of some refreshment! What hotel does this??
The only decent thing was the breakfast. Avoid this hotel at all costs, it is not worth the money, believe me.",2,2012,08,12
104,"Don't know, we were shipped off somewhere else...","Booked a two night stay here in July.  My girlfriend was in London already so arrived at the hotel in the afternoon to be told there were maintenance issues and that 95% of guests were being moved.  When she enquired where, they said a sister 4 star hotel in Kensington and that they would arrange a complimentary taxi.  While waiting for the taxi, two girls were checked in to a room there.  She had to chase the taxi with reception and 15 minutes later arrived at the 3 star kensington townhouse hotel, near Earl's Court station.  They offered us a complimentary breakfast at the hotel over the road, however this was not something we were fussy about as we had booked room only.  She was shown to a room on the ground floor which was so small, there was not enough room to even put her bag on the floor, never mind when I was due to arrive in the evening with another bag - the room was literally a double bed and a cupboard for a bathroom.  She complained to the manager and was moved to a bigger room on the top floor.  The hotel itself was ok ish, however not what or where we'd booked. My girlfriend sent an email to the customer service team, due to the inconvenience she had experienced  and also as the rates on their website showed a big difference between the nightly rates at the hotel we'd booked and where we actually ended up.  We neither received a reply or any offer of compensation.  Avoid.",1,2012,08,01
104,Lovely Experience in Heart of London,"I had such a nice experience staying here, the location was superb, the room comfortable and contemporary and the team at reception were such a pleasure to deal with from check in to check out. Paddington station and metro was so close to access the Airport and it was a mere 35 minute walk along Hyde Park into Oxford Circus. With Notting Hill and Portobello Road so close too.",4,2012,07,29
104,Not what was Expected...,"We arrived and we were told our triple room wasn't available.  We were offered a 5 star hotel upgrade.  But then 5 minutes later the upgrade was taken away because they found a room for us.  After numerous pitying looks from other guests we were nervous about what the room would be.  When we entered we saw why.  Stains on the carpets and the third ""bed"" was a flimsy couch that they were going to put a sheet on.  I called the front desk and asked for the upgrade back.  Fortunately, they agreed and we were given a cab to a new hotel.  The cab driver was VERY confused and took us to the wrong hotel.  Fortunately, the new hotel was very accommodating and we were able to have a great last night in London.  Yes, this hotel is close to many attractions, but I wouldn't recommend it.",2,2012,07,20
104,The smallest rooms,"The hotel was on a good location, the room was very clean, but too small. It was impossible to make a move. We had to put some peaces of furniture in the hall in order to make space for our luggage. But, the staff was very professional and I'd like to thank Mr. Sagar Sharma for his help and hospitality.",3,2012,07,20
104,An underrated hotel (based on my recent stay),"I was transferred here by the Shaftesbury Metropolis apparently due to maintenance issues and I was somewhat dreading it due to the negative reviews on TripAdvisor. However, my stay was perfectly satisfactory so thought to let people know.

Summary:
A typical London hotel that appears to have been recently refurbished to a very good standard. My room was a one-person and therefore small, but not as small as other London hotels of a similar rating that I've stayed at. All the facilities worked fine, and the breakfast (included due to transfer) was of a higher quality than other similar hotels I've used. Two negatives were: (a) the sink in the bathroom while new was quite small making it awkward to use, and (b) I did not have wifi signal in my room so had to set up a local hotspot from my computer using the wired LAN.

A few other points:
At one point I could hear noise through the wall to next-door when they were being particularly noisy, but I think this was more due to the occupants than the building.
My room (808) was on the ground floor but at the back so while there was a window, it was actually one floor up and overlooked a courtyard containing the air conditioning systems. My window was single glazed so a bit of humming could be heard but it didn't bother me.
I found the staff to be very polite and helpful and so I didn't recognise the problems mentioned by the other reviewers.
When I was transferred, someone from Shaftesbury called me and explained very politely, and then followed up with an email giving me directions to this hotel. For me the transfer was not a surprise.
Perhaps one other thing to mention is that external first impression was not so great because some of the surrounding buildings are not in great shape and the paving nearby had a big pothole, but this was just a first impression.

Overall, I would stay there again and in my experience this hotel is underrated based on the current TripAdvisor reviews.",4,2012,07,19
104,"Hmm Twin de luxe, that's a joke.","Stayed here for 2 nights 13th and 14th Jul 2012. The room was described as a twin deluxe. Well there was nothing deluxe about it. Tiny and barely room to swing a cat ! I would hate to see what a basic room was like.
The hot water on the 1st night was non existant, when I complained about this, I was told you have to have the hot water running for at least 10 minutes before it will warm up. Well after half an hour I gave up. Although it was much better on subsequent days, after a memeber of staff came and did something, followed by him returning to regrout parts of the floor and walls ! What a ridiculous thing to have to go through. 
My bed had a damn great dip in the mattress too. Felt like I was sleeping in a hammock.
English breakfast was what you would expect, basic and not very warm.
For the price, I think you can, and I have had better at preimer inn and travel lodge. Nothing boutique about it, except the size of room. Will not be staying again.",2,2012,07,17
104,Lost property,Did not feel very welcomed when we arrived at the hotel just booked us in and staff could hardly raise a smile tiny rooms for the price that we paid ¬£229 for a double room for one night however I had left 3 items of clothing in the wardrobe( jeans T shirt and a jacket) contacted the hotel when i arrived home that night stated that they would check with house keeping they did this on several occasions each time I phoned them and the clothes were know where to be found ! would not recommend this hotel,1,2012,07,17
104,"ok, but nothing special","we went to this hotel only for one nite. it was very easy to find, it looked nice. we came around four in the afternoon, booked a club double room, but didn't get it. ok, no biggy. the room was very small, didn't have a fridge, a bathrobe, a microwave, like we were promised to get. we fell a sleep in te aftrnoon and some woman came into our room. so she appologised of course but I called the reception and they messed up the rooms. they gave us that woman's room and only god knows what happened to ours. we had a great view on the 7th florr didn't mind the stairs from 6th to 7th. we got complimentary water (that was included in the price but wasn't in the room originally!!!), a couple of coke and some fuit. We would rather have our room, though. the staff was nice, the room was clean, but as i said very small, brakfast was pretty good i must say. not sure if I would go there again. the location was awesome! Not bad but not great either....",3,2012,07,16
104,Very very disappointed.,"I booked a room at the Hyde Park international to be close to my friend's hotel. Two days before I left I found myself moved to the Park Grand due to maintenance. I had paid ¬£129 per night and found myself in a tiny cramped basement room with only a free breakfast to mollify me for the disappointment I felt. I had to find my way around a completely unfamiliar area of London to meet my friend the following morning. The walls of the rooms were very thin and I was woken up everytime someone decided to shower or use their facilities in the night. 

On the last morning of my stay I found myself idley googling so I didn't get caught out again by paying through the nose for absolute rubbish. I checked the room prices of the hotel I was at only to find they were on average about ¬£30 cheaper than the hotel I had been moved from. I am absolutely livid that I had, on good faith, paid up front at the hyde park international only to find myself in a room that didn't meet the original specifcations I had booked in and NO ONE, not one member of staff, had the courtesy or honesty to tell me this. I had to find out myself and then complain to management before anything was done. 

The manager tried to claim that the rooms at the hyde park international were cheaper than this hotel and that room rates vary but when I responded I had checked the weekend prices and STILL found myself having paid too much she agreed to give me 20% off my bill. I feel only slightly less annoyed now as a result of them having paid me some of my wasted money back but I was left feeling like the hotel was run dishonestly. It was a big stain on what had been a much planned for and anticipated birthday holiday. Please DO NOT book in with these hotels and if you are unfortunate enough to have done so already DO NOT swallow them moving your room without investigating the prices yourself because they won't tell you.",1,2012,07,13
104,Great location for the basic necessities,"I made a reservation here last minute through booking.com and was dreading it due to other travelers reviews about being moved to the other location. However, we checked in early afternoon and were given a room right off the lobby. It was very small, but it was clean. The location is unbeatable, a short walk to Hyde Park, Oxford Street, the Underground, and Paddington Train Station. It was a good price for the location, and I would probably stay here again for a short stay.",4,2012,07,12
104,"NOT 4* Quality, very dissapointed","booked via lastminute.com's 'Top Secrect Hotels' option so was expecting much better than a room on the 7th floor.....when lift ends at 6th floor....and having to carry bags up steep narrow staircase to stuffy room in what once must have been an attic/roof space; bedside lights wouldn't turn off so had to remove room key from card reader to sleep in airless room as that meant the air-con couldn't be used and woke to find no cold water properly piped to the bathroom so shower and WC were not properly available.....wasted hour and a half dodging in and out when some cold came through intermintently....reception indicated we would have to wait til 9am for maintainace to arrive ....we calleed at 7.30, will never stay there again",2,2012,06,23
104,"Very cute, modern hotel in Hyde Park.","Had to book this hotel at the last minute for just one night. We were originally booked for a double room at the hotel at 55 Shaftsbury, but after checking in were sent here, where we received a basement level room instead. The room was a little small, but was very modern and clean, with a good sized bathroom. I wish we weren't in the basement level, but I guess that was all that was left, booking last minute.

For the price we paid, I think this hotel was pretty good, and would be worth coming back to again. It is also very close to Paddington Station, so getting there was easy as well.",4,2012,06,22
104,Great overall short stay,Nice and clean with  tasteful decor. Nice big TV.This was the fifth time i'd visited London for business purposes(course) and was the best i'd stayed in for this price range (¬£79). I had booked a single and got a twin room which is always nice for the extra space. Breakfast was apayable extra (¬£12 if pre-booked) and was the usual range of continental and cooked in avery pleasant dining room.Complimentart toiletries and tea/coffee facilities.  Bar snacks were available but only offered room service ordering out of bar opening times closing and as travelling alone I would have prefered to order from room.Reception staff nice and friendly. . I requested a room witha view ( write up says available upion request) prior to arrival and did get it.I t was only an overnight stay so didn't really get to experience hotel further but overall it was a nice and uncomplicated comfortable stay.Great location for Paddington Tube station.,4,2012,06,22
104,Nice and Central,"Hotel is right outside the tube station which is handy. Close to Bella Italia and some Indian restaurants. A lot of foreign people running the place, which is fine no problems with that. They upgrade us when we got there claiming the ""club room"" is a bit bigger and comes with breakfast... however i would like to see what a ""deluxe"" room that we booked looked like as the club room was very small. What the staff need to understand is you cannot upgrade a couple to a club room and not give the upgrades that come with it such as breakfast... or its not an upgrade is it! so we went to breakfast and nobody said anything and we paid no extra, as we shouldnt.... as they said they upgraded us free of charge! Breakfast was nice, full English to choose from as well as cereal's juice etc. Big TV in rooms and beds were very comfortable. Sad though as most rooms only have a shower and no bath. I know when I go away I like to enjoy a bath.",3,2012,06,12
104,NOT A FOUR STAR,"we were very disapointed  we arrived at hotel,were asked for payment straight away,wanted to have lunch in the hotel,dont serve lunch
we booked a deluxe room,with a fridge.there was no fridge,no radio or clock,no phone,the window had a generator outside and a dirty brick wall,we wated to book a meal in the restaraunt, they said was open till eleven,they only served snacks,so has to go out for a mealy there was no lounge.to sit and have a drink,this hotel is not what it says on the website,spoilt what was planned as a surprise weekend.",2,2012,06,03

104,Perfect Holiday Trip,"Great Location, centrally located, good restaurants near by. It was my wife's birthday got a upgrade with a bottle of wine. A good memory that we will always cherish.",5,2012,05,29
104,"Great hotel, centrally located with friendly staff","I recently stayed at the Park Grand London Hyde Park and found it very clean, very good value for money, the staff friendly and informative and, not being too far from Paddington Station, a good central location for getting around London.  I will definately book this hotel on my next trip to London.",5,2012,05,28
104,Horrible hotel,"Tiny rooms, poor service. What is there to say. Definitely a high priced closet hotel.",1,2012,05,27
104,don't stay here if you want a 4* star experience,this hotel is nothing like the website and could not have been further from a 4* hotel - we booked on lastminute.com and were thus not treated with the correct respect. We were put in a small room in the basement that was just big enough for a double bed and a desk. There was a layer of dust thick enough to wipe my finger through on all the surfaces and coffee mug stains on the furniture. The windows were dirty and you could not sit at the desk properly as it was wedged up against the wardrobe. They did put us in a bigger room on the 6th floor but the furniture was still stained and the windows were broken. I traveled from Manchester for my birthday and was so disappointed I cried. Imagine if I had traveled further a-field than this.  Over priced and incredibly shabby. There will be a million better hotels than this.,1,2012,05,23
104,Definitely not 4 star!,"Checking in at 4pm in a foyer full of other visitors all waiting for rooms because "" the system was down"".  Some went out and left their baggage, others just became increasingly annoyed of not having a room after a long journey.  We asked if there was a bar where perhaps we could wait with a coffee and was told that it didn't open until 6pm.  The receptionist was annoyed that we were not happy!  The room had been described as deluxe but it had a desk/table covered in white cup marks, we had to make several trips to reception to sort out lighting, wi-fi etc.  Our room was cramped and you hear a lot of noise from the hallway and other rooms.  The shower was the most worrying as it took a long time to go from hot to cold and then becam too hot and when you adjusted the controls to change to cooler, it went to very cold and then immediately to scalding.  I was lucky that I moved out of the way very quickly otherwise I would have been very seriously burnt.  The room was clean and overall the staff helpful but this is not a 4 star hotel.",2,2012,05,23
104,"Very small room, dirty, cold, overpriced","i only had to stay there because I arrived last minute and everything else was fully booked. I got a standard room which was of very low standard, even for London.

The room I got was the smallest I have seen in ages. We could barely put(or open) our two trolleys(!). It's hard to move inside the room, I'm not joking. I stayed in autumn and temperatures were below 5 degree celsius. Unfortunately, the window couldn't be closed properly so I had to sleep in a very cold room. Apart from that the room wasn't cleaned to an average standard and you could find stains and dirt all over the place. Shower was cold too.

Sadly, the room was heavily overpriced. Will definitely not come back.",1,2012,05,04
104,"Unlucky, disorganised or just dishonest?","Having read other reviews on TA, I was half expecting to get ""bumped"" to another hotel; so much so that I changed my plans to check in earlier to get it over and done with instead of at the end of my night out.
The signs were there at check-in; no immediate record of my booking and a blank registration for to fill in. But hey presto, the receptionist came off the phone and I was allocated a room! It was tiny, a bit tired and gloomy and with no chair for the desk and no working aircon. However it was cosy enough and clean.
When I got back from my evening out, I walked past reception to hear a guy being told that (yes, you've guessed it) his room wasn't available because of a maintenance issue and he was being moved elsewhere.
The frequency with which this occurs (judging by the reviews here) means this hotel and\or the hotel chain must be extremely unlucky with maintenance problems. Or not, perhaps. Let the buyer beware.",2,2012,05,01
104,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!","Horrible, horrible experience at this hotel!! Stayed for 2 nights with friends for a friend's 21st birthday get-away. This hotel is definitely NOT a 4 star!! Very cramped bedrooms, no walking space and the floor space was taken up with our two weekend bags. The bathroom..I'm not even going to go there! When we arrived, the hotel staff were very rude, they had only booked one room for us (4 people) when we had previously booked and paid for 2 rooms, which we asked to be close together and were assured we would be..we were on separate floors! Very overpriced for what you get! Had breakfast the first morning in the hotel (poor directions to the restaurant), opted to eat out for the rest of our stay as the food was horrendous! Do NOT recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a nice 4 star stay! Will not be returning in the future and have told many people about our experience..they too will not be staying at this hotel! As in my title..AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!",1,2012,04,29
104,Great hotel.,"I'll reserved a room for 3 nights, but when I arrived at the hotel it was overbooked, the staff arranged a driver to take me to an other hotel. Not as good as this one, all expences at the other hotel where payed. Drinks, breakfast for the next day, the next evening i'll was taken back to the original booked hotel. I'll received a double room and also breakfast was for free.

104,central place in paddington,"this hotel is okay for a short stay in london. rooms are small, but comfortable, in room safe avalable. clean. check in was slow, check out same. friendly staff. location only minutes from paddington station. we did not have breakfast at the hotel. there is a nice portugese cafe nearby with excellent english breakfast. a lot of workers eat there.",3,2012,04,15
104,The worst 4-star hotel ever,"Is this a fraud? We have av fairly good idea what a de-luxroom in a four star hotel should be. A bit strange that we had to pay the full amount upon arrival and not at check-out. Because the hotell was fully booked, we were taken across the street to a ""similar"" room. Never have we had a bigger hotel-shock. Around the small bed was a one-feet space on three sides. In addition there was about a square-meter by the door. Outside the window a wall rised about a feet from the glass and blocked a possible wiew. And possible fire-escape..? In the middle of the night we heard a spanish couple check in to the neighbour-room and the first we heard through the door and wall was ""Oh my God...""
Rose early the next morning (why remain sleepless in bed..) and managed to talk us into a decent room in the main buliding. Although there was no refrigerator in this room either. During the day we saw - and specially heard - other guests telling the receptionist/manager the same story. It is hard not to belive that this is an official strategy from the hotel. Never again - even though the location is good.",1,2012,04,08
104,Avoid this overrated disaster (not a 4 star property),"Worst travel experience ever.  Property is NOT 4 stars.  Rooms are tiny, facilities almost non-existent, food average, and staff an absolute disaster.

We arrived at the beginning of Easter weekend and immediately got a bait and switch.  The company tried to move us to their neighboring property across the street... the Shaftesbury, or some such do to some alleged maintenance issues.We arrive in the room and it is a closet with a bed stuck in it.  An additional bonus was the permeating smoke smell in a non-smoking room.  As we had two rooms, it wasn't just a one room issue.  All seemed to be like that.  It certainly wasn't the 'deluxe' room we had paid for and certainly wasn't fit to house an 18 month old.

We went back to the lobby of the Park Grand and demanded to speak to the house manager.  Apparently, this was a new concept to them as none was available.  After wasting about 2 hrs., we finally received rooms in the Grand which were far better than the other property.  However, they were still quite small and they were not as advertised on booking dot com.

Would that would have been it.  The day before leaving we confirmed late check-out on day of our flight.  In the morning after breakfast, the manager approached my wife and said we would need to leave by 1.  I have never screamed, or had to harangue a hotel manager before.  I had to on this occasion as they were still not doing their job properly.

My suggestion would be to avoid this hotel at all costs.  You will be disappointed otherwise.",1,2012,04,07
104,I HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU,"I am a seasoned traveller and my TA comments are based on the quality of the hotel according to what I am paying.  So here goes. The hotel is just around the corner from Paddington Station. Turn right out of Station, right at next set of traffic lights, its' across the road on the other side.  The 23 bus passes the hotel (get on it at Paddington Station though where you can buy the ¬£2.30 ticket from the machine) The 23 runs 24 hours a day. It goes to Marble Arch, Piccadilly Circus, Westminster, Theatre Land, Oxford Street, Regent Street, the Strand and near loads of other main London places including Trafalgar Square and the British Museum. The bus runs every 5 minutes during the long day and also during the night.  The bus ride is a pleasant one and saves all the hassle of expensive taxis and tube rides. The 23 is a must if you are staying at this hotel. (We used it to get back from three Theatres after the evening shows, it stopped outside them all)  Now the hotel:- I had cause to make an observation and requested a move of room. (I was recuperating from an operation and needed a little more space) The staff were excellent, extremely helpful. My new room was well appointed. King size bed. Shower room a little small and if you are an extremely large person you may find the toilet a little cramped. But, hey ho, the price I was paying was extremely competitive so no complaints from me.  It had all the usual accessories. A Mr SWAPNIL assisted us a lot, (he couldn't do enough for us) his manner, as indeed the manner of all the staff was excellent. We did not opt for early breakfast but wandered to a little place we got to know well just a few hundred yards down towards Hyde Park in a cul de sac on the left. (Just off Sussex Gardens Opposite a very nice Indian Restaurant)  Right across from the hotel is a cul de sac with one good but small restaurant. Good Value and food. We did not have a car and I was very thankful for that.  Down the road is Hyde Park where you can walk right across to Kensington (Harrods etc.and Park Lane)  If you fancy a pint in the evening the Pride of Paddington opposite the Station was ok actually. The food there was a little expensive.  There are a number of late night shops and restaurant near Paddington Station. Take your pick. We found a very good Indian in a side street, excellent value and service) Mind you one and a half pints of lager at the Pride of Paddington was ¬£6!  During our stay we spent all of our time in Central London using the 23 bus as our chauffeur.  Anyway, hope this helps you all.",4,2012,03,28
104,Good Location but walking into somebody else's room was shambolic,"The hotel is a good location.. Just 5 minutes walk from the underground at paddington. Eay check in proceedure until we were given the key to a room already occupied with 2 people in the shower, Then the 2nd room was twin beds then the 3rd room was next to the lift on the ground floor and kept getting woken up. Room was pretty basic for an executive room (i think not) My recommendation is look elsewhere.. Also they charge ¬£12 for a breakfast.. DO NOT BOTHER there is a great italian near the underground that does a full english for a fiver",2,2012,03,23
104,Somewhere between dishonesty & a scam,"We had a similar experience to some of the others commenting on this hotel.  On arriving at the hotel we had booked, they informed us they had had a burst pipe and were sending us to another hotel (this one).  This set off all sorts of alarm bells as I had heard of this scam with elsewhere.  Sure enough, using the free internet in the lobby we spotted several other reviewers describing the same experience at this or other sister hotels.  If they habitually over book and need to move people around then they should just say this, it would have made little difference.  Instead though they blame something else and shuttle you off.  The hotel was fine and the staff helpful but I will not be staying at this or any of their other hotels.  There are too many competitors to need to take the risk.",3,2012,03,18
104,Good value -pretty basic hotel !,"Lets deal with the positives first - the hotel is well located and within easy walking distance of Marble Arch, Oxford St etc. The rate that we paid is great value, its not easy to find a central London hotel at this price. The reception area is luxurious compared withe the rest of the hotel !. The breakfast was quite good and was included in the rate ( even better !),
Checking in was a very long and laborious process( just one receptionist) and by the time we were finished there was an enormous queue behind us, I had a club room which was very small ( but most central London hotels have small rooms), the decor was tired and in need of a makeover, and the room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the main road ( Sussex Gardens). The charming victorian sash window was not double glazed, so things were quite noisy !.
Everything else was just ok - so all in all, not a bad hotel if you are on a tight budget,",3,2012,03,15
104,great value very pleasant hotel,"We were transferred to this hotel from a sister hotel nearby due to building works - taxi called, comp tea while we waited.  only round the corner.  Very happy.  Hotel was friendly and clean. Our room was near the back ( I think, not sure after walking down lots of corridors!) and plenty big enough and modern.  Bathroom modern and clean, only slight negative was the shower didnt seem hot enough.  We were given complimentary breakfast as we'd been moved and this was very good.  Buffet style, loads of choice fruit, croissants etc, full english, yogurt etc.  Wasnt sure if we were allowed it for a second morning but a quick phone call to reception and there was no problem.  All in all a very pleasant hotel which I could safely recommend and at a very good price for central london.  Easy walk to Hyde park or Paddington.",4,2012,03,10
104,Tiniest room ever,"I booked this room because of the location. Was a bit disappointed, but all in all I had a good stay. The free wifi only worked every now and then and my room was only slightly bigger than my suitcase. There was no floor space whatsoever, and there is no way I could have had another adult in this room, allthough it was supposed to be a double. The bed was 1 1/2, not a double and 2 suitcases iwould have been out of the question. The staff were friendly and helpful, though! And it was great that I could adjust the room temperature myself!",3,2012,03,07
104,"Very comfortable rooms, but lethal hidden drops along corridors!","This was the second time we have stayed in this hotel establishment. Both times we had excellent rooms, huge space! Mind you first time we had a ""club room"" with kitchenette and sofa area, and second just a ""deluxe double"". Both were massively spacious and extremely comfortable beds, kept beautifully clean and some great views out over Paddington, both sides of hotel. (Providing on high floors).... Although, the only issues we have come across here, were finding out they did not read the ""special requirements"" asked when we booked the room, as told them I had had major back and neck surgery on spinal discs, so needed extra pillows. Had to retell and ask when handed key. Felt it was unprofessional and lack of personal care. Out the lift on 6th floor had to go through door straight on our left, not that unusual in terraced hotels. Suddenly, I was sprawled over the corridor as unexpectedly stepped into ""mid air"" as 2 very steep/ deep, but small width stairs! I jarred the metal brackets in my back, which were very painful for the rest of my 2 nights. Unfortunately, it meant could not do as much as planned on my trip either, which was very upsetting. After going out of room later, did see a tiny warning sign on the door. It definitely is not big enough for the lethal drop waiting behind the door! If the staff had bothered to read the requirement notes they could have warned us about the drop beforehand, or given us a room without such riskability. Thought I was going to be spending my 2 nights in the hospital down the road!",5,2012,03,06
104,Room ok if you are a borrower,"I stay in London every week and unfortunately  my usual hotel was full booked and left with no option but to try another. 
Regardless of what rate this hotel room is sold at no body in this day and age should have rooms that are so small you physically have no where to even put your case. 
i cant understand what kind of person or traveler these rooms are aimed at because they are that small a borrower would be complaining. 
hotels like these need reporting and bringing to peoples attention as with the Olympics arriving very soon it will leave a very bad taste in our friends from overseas mouths.",1,2012,02,24
104,reasonable hotel,Stayed here while we were in london watching a show. we were on the 6th floor and didnt really have a view. the room was a bit small but was very clean. the bathroom was nice and the shower was very good. we didnt eat at the hotel as they were trying to charge us ¬£15 each just for breakfast but there is lots of places around to get food. probably wouldnt stay here again but it was ok.,3,2012,02,22
104,The Hobbit London Hotel,"I had to stay here last night for one night on short notice.  Everything else in London seems to have been booked out.
If you are 4' 6"" tall and do not suffer from claustraphobia then this hotel would be fine.  I am 6 foot tall and while I don't suffer from claustrophobia, small tight spaces make a little uncomfortable.  
The bedroom I had was on the ground floor facing the main road.  It was very noisey with only single glazing.  To give an idea of the size of the room - the bedroom had one standard size double bed.  On either side of the bed there was barely 1 foot of clearance until you hit the wall.  You could not comfortably walk around the bed so getting into bed by crawling from the end of it was the only way.  Not so bad though if the rest of the room was okay.  Well there was 2 feet of clearance between the end of the bed and the wardrobe.  And that my friends was the extent of the room, save the bathroom - which was in all honesty not too bad in terms of size and condition.  
I entered the room with one average sized wheeled suitcase and a laptop bag.  I put them down behind me at the door entrance and at that stage i could not move forward because of the bed and couldn't move backwards because my small amount of baggage was enough to block of the entrance!  All in all VERY small.  I tend to like to hang up my suit and shirts for the next business day in order that they are not wrinkled.  When I attempted to do this I found that the wardrobe was not wide enough to accomodate the width of its own hangers!  They hung at an angle, which meant that hanging anything more than two items in the wardrobe resulted in the door being wedged open.  This had the affect of bunching up the clothes hanging in the wardrobe and actually encrouching into the already sparse space between the end of the bed and the wardrobe.
To be fair the room was not in bad condition but it is extremely small.  I have stayed in other small city hotels before, but this is extremely snug, the smallest i have ever seen.  For more than one person travelling with more than one suitcase it would be impossible.
The only other comments I would have is that the whole hotel is 'snug'.  The corridors are narrow.  Downstairs for breakfast one is inclinded to bend down going through door ways because of the low ceilings in the basement area.  I would hate to see the rooms down there if they are as small as mine on the ground floor, coupled with the low ceilings it would be like sleeping in a coffin.

So if you are hobit sized with hobbit sized luggage then go for it.  If not I would suggest looking else where or at least preparing yourself for a 'snug' experience.",2,2012,02,22
104,Surprisingly good,"The hotel looks much grander on the outside than the price we paid which immediately reassures you. The rooms are small but are decorated well, are clean, has what you need and comfortable to stay in. The location was quite good - not far from tube stations or buses, which made it an ok base for the tourist attractions and more cost effective than staying in the heart of the West End.  I've selected very good as much better than staying in similar hotels and chains of hotels - although if we had paid full price I'd have been less impressed.

It wasn't perfect - the first annoying thing is that it has an entirely different name in gold lettering across the top where you would expect the name of the hotel, which is very disorientating when you're looking for it. We went by the address numbers after spending far too long wandering around and when up close found a small plaque with the name on that we were expecting - If it says Park Lane across the top you have found it! Secondly our key card needed re-setting every night when we returned, very annoying when you've gone up to the third floor, the door doesn't open and then you have to go all the way back down. This happened for the additional two nights we stayed after we checked in.

In all it is a good place to stay, you will often need to change twice on a tube so expect some travelling and if like us you made the most of your day this is not cheap as we travelled at peak times (before 10am and after 4.30pm).  Didn't have breakfast as not included in our booking and seemed a bit pricy to add, but the facilities in the room meant we could have a drink easily.",4,2012,02,18
104,Great Experience with nice  staff,"It Was  a nice experience for me with my family at Shaftesbury Premier Hyde park Paddington.Excellent service and warm welcome from the staff was very nice.
Some feature like the most-
1) Fresh flowers in room and on tables in Dining Room. 
2) Magazines and newspapers in reception. 

Nice trip.  visit again.",5,2012,02,13
104,"Never, ever, stay at this hotel....","The following is a copy of an e mail i sent to the web service who mailed me to check up on my experiences at this hotel :

Good morning,
 
Yes I will happily tell you of my experience at the Hotel Hyde Park Paddington.

I arrived in Heathrow on the overnight flight from Miami, tired and looking forward to a good sleep. On arrival in the hotel I was met by a scene of utter chaos that would make faulty towers appear like haven of tranquility. There was a crowd of about 12 people all complaining about different things. While I stood there, two different couples slammed their keys on to the counter, there faces flushed with pure anger, shouting about the fact that they could not even check out because of the incompetence of the staff. Another American couple beside me was trying to explain to a female staff member who was had about as much English as a parrot, where the Royal Albert hall was, and how do they get there. When I eventually jostled my way to the desk, they said that I did not have a reservation. As I tried to explain that I did, she was distracted by some one else who needed attention more then me. As I stood there dreaming of a bed, I was eventually told to sit down while they investigated. After about twenty minutes it became apparent that the only things that were being investigated where the broken lift, the fact that they could not find any reservations, and where this mysterious place called the royal Albert hall was.

 

Despite the fact that I had a pre paid reservation, I decided that it would be a more sensible option to cancel my date in London that night and get the first available flight home.  I walked out the door, boarded the Heathrow express, and got the first flight home to Dublin, which incidentally cost me over ‚Ç¨300.00. This was a small price to pay to escape what can only be described as a scene as disorganized and chaotic as an A and E department in Saigon in the late 70‚Äôs.

 

During my train journey home I reflected on the fact that it does not all ways pay to try out different hotel web sites, because as the old saying goes if it seems to good to be true it probably is.

 

I travel regularly, and will be returning to hotels.com secure in the knowledge that if you have found a professional hotel booking service, its better to just stick with them.

 

I have no doubt that other hotels on your site are superb, and the whole booking procedure was simple. What I would suggest is that you remove hotels such as the Hotel Hyde Park Paddington from your site, because one thing that I can guarantee and that is that every single person at that reception felt the same way that I did.

 

I look forward to hearing from you,

 

Kind Regards,

 

Brian O‚ÄôConnor

104,excellent stay!,"I stayed in this hotel for one night, together with a friend of mine; upon arrival we were welcomed with pleasure by an Italian girl, Stella, who we would like to thank particularly for her kindness and helpfulness. we had booked a deluxe double room, but given availability we were assigned a quadruple room with two double beds on the sixth floor, easily accessible by lift. the room was large and equipped with all comforts including hairdryer, safe, minibar, iron and ironing board, tea kettle, complimentary water and biscuits. unlike the room, the bathroom was very small and cramped, but still passable given our short stay. Cleanliness can certainly be improved, the only weak point given that we found several hairs in the shower and cobwebs. the property is located very close to Paddington station, easily reachable in just 2/3 minutes.",4,2023,12,05

104,"Not very good beginning, good ending thanks to STELLA","We arrived late and tired with a large suitcase. Access to the complicated room, doors and more doors. The door to the room worked only with the essential bolt, and the second security bolt did not work. Friendly staff checked and offered to move to another room, but I imagined the same ‚Äúlabyrinth‚Äù of access‚Ä¶ since it was already late, hungry and tired, we didn't move.
The next day, in order not to let us discuss the issue in the lobby, STELLA helped us, in addition to having a doubt whether the room category (Deluxe Double Room) was ours, because it was too small and located very far back... and well Yes, the name to my taste does not fit the room. Finally, STELLA made the difference, she showed us another room and we moved to that one for the next night, a big difference‚Ä¶ thanks to STELLA the experience at this hotel improved a lot.",4,2023,11,10

104,Great location for visiting London,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 days in August to visit London with my wife.
The location is excellent, a 5 minute walk from the Paddington tube station which allows you to reach central London in 20 minutes. There is also the train station in Paddington from where the Express train leaves to reach Heathrow Airport in 15 minutes.
As far as the room is concerned: excellent cleanliness with daily towel change, the bed in our room was a French double, so a little small but comfortable. The bathroom is small and has no window, but only a vent.
The area is quiet, you can walk to visit Hyde park and near the hotel there are many restaurants, supermarkets (in the station) and some souvenir shops.
The only flaw is that the hotel does not have a clearly visible sign and you have to pay attention because it is close to a complex of residential buildings with which it blends in.
To conclude, I would like to thank the reception staff: they were always very kind and helpful, especially RANIA who gave us so much important information.

104,Esperienza da non ripetere !,"Viaggiavo da solo ed ho prenotato per sette notti pagando circa ‚Ç¨ 215 a notte, senza colazione. All‚Äôarrivo alla reception ti offrono un bicchierino di succo di frutta come benvenuto; poi ti dicono come raggiungere la tua camera singola de luxe prenotata che si trova su un piano ammezzato; devi percorrere da solo, senza nessun dello staff che ti guidi nel percorso, una serie di corridoi, salendo anche una piccola rampa di scala con il peso dei bagagli. Quando apri la porta della camera non puoi credere ai tuoi occhi: √® piccola, lillipuziana, forse 5 metri quadri,  con un condizionatore sopra la testiera del letto che chiaramente tieni spento; la valigia non sai dove aprirla o poggiarla, l‚Äôarmadio √® piccolo, la moquette non d√† l‚Äôidea di essere pulita, le tende sono sporche ed impolverate alla grande, l‚Äôaffaccio √® su una palazzina di fronte a 4/5 metri dalla tua finestra con pareti scrostate; il copriletto √® leggero e non c‚Äô√® altro per coprirsi; insonorizzazione insufficiente, nessun frigorifero; lavabo del bagno di dimensioni ridotte al punto che se vuoi lavarti la faccia, l‚Äôacqua cade per terra. Alla fine del soggiorno a me che avevo pagato in anticipo non hanno dato neppure la ricevuta. Att.ne si chiama  Park Grand London Hyde Park,  ma di grande non c‚Äô√® niente e non √® vicino Hyde Park ma √® a Paddington; l‚Äôunico aspetto positivo e che la fermata dell‚ÄôUnderground √® vicina. Per quello che ho pagato mi sento turlupinato. Mai pi√π !

Grazie di cuore per aver regalato una bellissima esperienza sia a me che mio figlio.

√à stato molto bello trovare una ragazza che parlasse italiano cos√¨ simpatica ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2022,09,17
104,Buona posizione. Il resto da rivedere assolutamente.,"Camere davvero piccole, letti per due persone che in realt√† sono da una piazza e mezzo. Pochissimo spazio vivibile. Abbiamo preso una quadrupla (due letti da una piazza in mezzo) e siamo stati costretti a fare i turni per spostarci dentro la stanza. Bagno ancor pi√π piccolo se possibile (forse addirittura pi√π piccolo di quelli da nave da crociera per intenderci), con un lavello praticamente di cortesia; buono invece il box doccia. 
A ci√≤ si aggiunga il fatto che una sera, reduci da una giornata stancante, entriamo in camera e la troviamo esattamente come l‚Äôabbiamo lasciata la mattina (letti sfatti, asciugamani non cambiati ecc‚Ä¶). Andiamo a chiedere spiegazioni alla reception e ci viene detto senza batter ciglio che avremmo dovuto mettere fuori dalla porta l‚Äôapposito cartellino ‚Äúper favore rifare la stanza‚Äù. Argomento poco credibile dato che i giorni precedenti la stanza era stata riassettata a prescindere da tale cartellino e che altri amici hanno sempre trovato la camera fatta senza usufruire dello stesso. Sarebbe stato forse pi√π elegante semplicemente ammettere la propria negligenza.
Si salva solo la posizione (l‚Äôhotel √® vicino alla stazione di paddington) ma ciononostante il prezzo, data l‚Äôesperienza nel suo complesso, √® un po‚Äô troppo alto.
Non lo consiglierei.",2,2022,09,09

La primera habitaci√≥n que nos asignaron ten√≠a dos camas c√≥modas y un ba√±o grande, pero la tercera cama individual era un sof√° cama muy viejo con el cuero descascarado y el placard diminuto.

Zugegeben, das Zimmer war recht knapp bemessen, das Bad wirklich eng. Aber man h√§lt sich ja wohl die wenigste Zeit im Zimmer (vom Schlafen abgesehen) auf. Alles war jedenfalls sehr sauber, ordentlich und liebevoll hergerichtet.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr knapp 12 Pfund war einwandfrei, es fehlte nichts.
Wie schon anderweitig erw√§hnt, ist die Lage recht g√ºnstig. Man ist in wenigen Minuten bei der Central-Line. dem Hyde-Par und der Paddington-Station. Gleich um die Ecke findet man viele gute Lokale.",4,2021,11,21

104,Per Londra buon rapporto qualit√†/prezzo,"L‚Äôhotel √® in un palazzo stile vittoriano, a dieci minuti a piedi da Hyde Park e vicino a tre fermate dell‚Äôunderground. L‚Äôalbergo sorge in un quartiere (Bayswater) tranquillo e con molti servizi.
Gentile e disponibile il personale, buona la colazione anche se forse una maggior variet√† nel corso della settimana non guasterebbe.
Ho avuto l‚Äôimpressione che i locali siano stati rimodernati da non molto.
Abbiamo soggiornare in una quadrupla su due livelli, soluzione ricavata tramite un soppalco. Al piano di sotto c‚Äô√® un ampio letto matrimoniale; mentre a quello superiore √® stato sistemato un divano letto, piuttosto stretto per essere a due piazze. Soprattutto al piano di sotto lo spazio per muoversi √® risicato. A quello superiore √® presente l‚Äôunico armadio della stanza, largo una cinquantina di centimetri, dunque poco funzionale.
Il bagno √® moderno, ma molto piccolo. 
Buona la pulizia.

La camera, la 116, era molto carina e pulitissima con bollitore, t√®, caff√® decaffeinato e non √® dei buonissimo biscotti che ho gradito molto. Il letto perfetto sua come materasso che come cuscino. Il mattino dopo ho fatto check out ero di corsa e la ragazza alla reception Darja, ha fatto di tutto per sollecitare il taxi che tardava. Tutto molto bene.

104,Che delusione!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questa struttura solamente per due notti, siamo rimasti molto delusi in quanto le foto della camera che avevamo prenotato non rispecchiavano assolutamente le foto della camera che abbiamo avuto. Stanza decisamente molto piccola larga al massimo 2 m e 20, per raggiungere la finestra si doveva passare tra il letto ed il muro e non c‚Äôerano pi√π di 15/20 cm al massimo, inoltre bisognava fare attenzione a non urtare la tv ancorata al muro. Ovviamente anche il bagno era davvero molto molto piccolo, ad ogni modo fortunatamente la pulizia √® stata ottima ed il personale √® stato gentilissimo e molto preparato. L‚Äôultima nota negativa il riscaldamento, davvero troppo caldo, abbiamo provato a disattivarlo senza successo, siamo quindi stati costretti a dormire con la finestra aperta ovviamente sentendo i rumori esterni.

Tras nuestro 4¬∫ dia de estancia en Londres, al llegar al hotel nos encontramos con la habitaci√≥n bloqueada (con nuestras cosas, dinero, tarjetas, pasaportes, etc...dentro). Bajamos a recepci√≥n y la recepcionista (Adrianne¬ø?) nos indic√≥ que faltaban por abonar 2 noches (de nuestra estancia de 5).

Y ahi empezo un episodio kafkiano en el que cuando conseguimos que nos abriese tuvimos que oir perplejos que ""estuviesemos abajo antes de una hora"". A los 5 minutos estabamos abajo y ya habiamos abonado el importe: provocar una situaci√≥n incomoda a un cliente que lleva tres dias en un hotel y ha abonado su estancia hasta ese momento no es solo una falta de respecto. Es un acto totalmente innecesario y se√±al de falta de profesionalidad. Sin comentarios acerca de lo que vino despu√©s: dificultades para hablar con el manager (lo mas que conseguimos es que viniese el jefe de recepci√≥n), bloqueo de la habitaci√≥n tambi√©n al dia siguiente (esta vez ya con el 100% del importe abonado), ni una disculpa por parte de la recepcionista...Ni las instalaciones ni la profesionalidad del servicio de recepcion est√°n a la altura de un 4 estrellas.

104,Ottima soluzione per Londra,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel in 3 ragazze nel we del 19/05-22/05 e devo dire che il rapporto qualit√†/prezzo, per la sistemazione, i servizi, posizione e standard londinesi √® sicuramente pi√π che buono. Avevamo una camera con soppalco con letto matrimoniale nella parte soppalcata e divano letto nella parte ""giorno"" che comprendeva anche una piccola Kitchenette attrezzata con coffeemaker e rifornita quotidianamente del necessario, oltre biscotti e frutta fresca. Devo dire che il letto matrimoniale in cui ho dormito mi ha fatto davvero riposare benissimo, peccato non aver guardato che materasso c'era! La camera e il bagno erano molto puliti ed era previsto il riassetto pomeridiano.
Abbiamo trovato un'ottima offerta tramite il sito dell'hotel, che comprendeva anche la colazione (varia ed abbondante) che, in caso contrario, √® a pagamento. L'hotel √® situato a meno di 5 minuti a piedi dalla Paddington station della tube e vicino anche alla fermata dell'autobus che porta direttamente in trafalgar square o portobello road. Con una bella passeggiata di poco meno di 10 minuti si √® in Kensington park. 
Il Wi-Fi √® gratuito in tutto l'hotel e, come gi√† indicato in altre recensioni, viene fornito un cellulare con 10 chiamate gratuite da effettuare verso l'Italia e la connessione ad internet. La struttura √® situata su un bel viale alberato in edificio d'epoca, ma le camere sono ristrutturate molto bene cos√¨ come il bagno. Abbiamo apprezzato la cortesia di tutto lo staff, particolarmente di Ylenia che col suo sorriso e gentilezza ha sempre assecondato ogni nostra richiesta, e del portiere che ci ha sempre accolto con cortesia, professionalit√† e una parola  gentile.

Pulizia scarsa come anche la qualit√† degli arredi, decisamente usurati e scadenti. 
Forse un tre stelle appena. 
Sala breakfast senza infamia e senza lode, colazione appena decorosa, come anche reception ed accoglienza.

104,Lasciatelo agli inglesi!!!,"Premesso che io e il mio fidanzato  viaggiamo per conoscere i luoghi e immergerci in citt√† pi√π che stazionare in albergo,non ritengo che questo sia un hotel che rispetta le esigenze dei clienti!!!camera angusta, piccolissima quasi soffocante,non ti permette di concederti il meritato riposo al rientro!e nemmeno la notte la finestra dava sul cortile della caldaia dell albergo!üò±la metro di paddington √® vicina ma se soggiornate per pochi giorni scegliete una zona con una metro che abbia pi√π direzioni e scegliete un albergo pi√π confortevole e carino di questo!!!Lasciatelo agli inglesi se sono disposti a pagare tanto per non avere nessun tipo di confort!!!",1,2017,01,18
104,Traum Hotel in Traum Stadt,"Wir waren erst vor einer Woche im Park Grand. Den Weg von der U Bahn bis ins Hotel haben wir schnell gefunden und ein paar Abk√ºrzungen entdeckt, womit man innerhalb von 3 Minuten an der Ubahn ist. Der Bus f√§hrt direkt in der Querstra√üe zum Hotel los, Richtung Picadilly Circus. In unmittelbarer N√§he gibt es einige Fast Food Restaurants, Irish Pubs und Little Venice liegt auch gleich um die Ecke. Wir waren bereits um 9:00 Uhr im Hotel und konnten bis zum Check in problemlos unsere Koffer dort parken und zum Fr√ºhst√ºck die Stadt genie√üen. 
Das Personal im Hotel war sehr nett und hilfsbereit, sowohl am Check in als auch beim Kofferbringdienst aufs Zimmer. Unser Zimmer lag im 6. Stock, es war relativ klein aber kuschelig und sauber! In der Nacht war es sehr ruhig, aufgeweckt wird man von typischen Londoner Ger√§uschen, was wir aber gerade f√ºr einen Gro√üstadturlaub nicht schlimm fanden. Obwohl die Fenster nur einfach verglast sind, war es im Zimmer immer angenehm warm, wir haben sogar mit offenem Fenster geschlafen. Jeden Morgen wurden unsere Handt√ºcher ersetzt und unser Zimmer ges√§ubert. Bei Nachfrage nach einem Reiseadapter, haben wir sofort einen bekommen und konnten ihn bis zu unserer Abreise behalten.
Das Hotel sieht von Innen sowie von Au√üen sehr gepflegt und einladend aus, mit typischem englischem Flair. 
Wir werden dieses Hotel auf jeden Fall wieder buchen, es war ein traumhafter Urlaub!! ",5,2016,12,16
104,habitaci√≥n individual en el s√≥tano,"La oferta hostelera en las capitales europeas deja mucho que desear, en comparaci√≥n con la oferta espa√±ola.No merece las cuatro estrellas, y el lujo del que alardea en su p√°gina, no lo encontr√© por ninguna parte.
Habitaci√≥n min√∫scula, en el s√≥tano, pero recientemente reformada, limpia y cama c√≥moda. (no es poco )
Calidad precio, escasa. Bien situado cerca de estaci√≥n y metro.",3,2016,11,01
104,All'altezza delle aspettative ma...,"... non guardate sotto il letto.
L√¨ la pulizia lascia veramente a desiderare e questo √® il classico problema degli hotel inglesi con moquette.
Bagno pulitissimo, colazione internazionale abbondante e pi√π che buona.
Personale cortese e simpatico.
Ci tornerei",4,2016,10,13
104,"nettes Hotel, aber viel zu teuer","Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut. Es ist nur eine kurzer Fu√ümarsch (ca. 5 min) zur Paddington-Station (U-Bahn-Knoten, Bahnhof und Abfahrt des Heathrow Express)
Das Personal war sehr freundlich. 
Das Hotel ist sauber und modern eingerichtet. Es liegt in einem Altbau, wodurch man halt engere G√§nge und teilweise zus√§tzliche Treppen hat. Die Au√üenfenster sind Einfachscheiben verglast. Dies ist jedoch in London bei vielen Altbauten immer noch Standard. Aber im Winter halt doch etwas kalt.
Das Zimmer hatte 2 separate Queen-Size-Betten.
Ich h√§tte gerne mehr Sterne vergeben, jedoch erwarte ich mir f√ºr 250,- GBP echt mehr. Das Zimmer war viel zu teuer.",3,2016,09,24
104,Una habitaci√≥n muy peque√±a,"Lo que menos me gusto del hotel, fue la habitaci√≥n, demasiado peque√±a y en el s√≥tano. La cama de matrimonio peque√±a y pegada a la pared. No hab√≠a sitio para guardar las maletas. El ba√±o tambi√©n era enano. Al encontrarse la habitaci√≥n en s√≥tano, no dispon√≠a apenas de luz y la ventanita era imposible abrirla. Lo mismo sucede en el sal√≥n donde sirven el desayuno, muy peque√±os y cada vez que tenias que levantarte molestabas a otros hu√©spedes porque las mesas estaban muy pegadas las u√±as a las otras.
Lo que m√°s me ha gustado del hotel, ha sido el la ubicaci√≥n. Muy pr√≥ximo de la estaci√≥n de metro de paddinton, y bien comunicado tambi√©n por autob√∫s a los puntos m√°s tur√≠sticos de la ciudad, hay numerosos pub s y restaurantes para salir a cenar o tomar algo.

El hotel tiene una buena conexi√≥n wifi, el personal es muy atento y el nivel de limpieza es alto.",4,2016,09,23
104,ottimo rapporto qualit√†-prezzo,"Ci sono stato con la famiglia in luglio. Il personale √® stato accogliente e sempre disponibile. Premuroso su ogni nostra richiesta. Colazione ottima e abbondante.
Molto gentili anche per le varianti alla colazione a causa di intolleranze alimentari.
Camera pulita e dotata di ogni comfort. Lo consiglio anche per la posizione strategica
per accedere ai principali posti da visitare a Londra.",5,2016,08,11
104,Non un 4 stelle,"Nonostante avessimo riservato la camera matrimoniale deluxe all'arrivo siamo stati sistemati nel tugurio al piano interrato e da come ho potuto apprendere dalle altre esperienze non √® una pratica insolita per questo hotel (mi esimo dall'esprimere commenti a riguardo in quanto √® stato abbondantemente descritto da altri utenti). Dopo aver fatto notare alla reception dell'errore siamo stati trasferiti, dopo una notte passata nello scantinato, in una camera un pochino pi√π grande, ma la parola ""grande"" √® un'ossimoro, camera davvero al limite della decenza, piccola e sporca, moquette mai lavata (e dubito anche che qualcuno abbia mai passato l'aspirapolvere nei sette giorni di permanenza), sul davanzale capelli di ospiti precedenti, bagno essenziale, spazi minimi ed angusti. Londra resta sempre una delusione hotel troppo cari e tenuti male.
Personale davvero disponibile e cordiale ecco il perch√© la valutazione ""scarso"" e non ""pessimo"". Non ci siamo!",2,2016,07,21
104,Esperienza da ripetere,"Hotel in ottima posizione, in zona tranquilla, ben collegata, vicino alle stazioni di Paddington e Lancaster. Personale cordiale e disponibile. Stanza piccola ma pulita e comoda. Bagno con enorme ed elegante cabina doccia. Colazione abbondante ma la sala ristorante √® un po' piccola e se l'Hotel √® pieno pu√≤ capitare di dover aspettare che si liberi qualche tavolo.",4,2016,06,19
104,Ottimo,"Io e i mei colleghi siamo stati qui per lavoro, abbiamo trovato alla reception personale altamente qualificato, ospitali e molto simpatico. La posizione √® molto conveniente perch√© l'hotel √® a 5 minuti da Paddigton station e 7 da Lancaster Gate ovvero Hyde Park. Le camera sono molto accoglienti e pulite. Sicuramente se dovessi tornare o consigliare dove poter soggiornare a Londra suggerirei di venir qui!! ",5,2016,06,02
104,Solides Hotel f√ºr einen Kurztrip an hervorragender Lage,"Meine Bewertung tendierte von 3 bis 4 Punkten, habe mich dann aber zu 4 Punkten entschieden. Das Hotel liegt an perfekter Lage in Gehdistanz zur Paddington Station (Heathrow Express). Die Begr√ºssung im Hotel war sehr freundlich und das einchecken ging sehr schnell. Das Hotel stellte uns auch ein Handy zur Verf√ºgung mit dem man gratis in London ins Internet gehen konnte und Telefonanrufe in GB t√§tigen konnte. Wir erhielten vom Hotel noch ein Zimmer Upgrade, was wir ebenfalls positiv erw√§hnen m√∂chten. Das Zimmer war allerdings etwas schmudelig, der Teppich ist sicherlich schon seit vielen Jahren der gleiche, die Tapette an der Wand hatte ein Loch. Allgemein war das Zimmer relativ eng, aber wir hatten 2 separate Betten welche super bequem waren. Das Badezimmer war auch relativ eng, aber sauber und wohl das modernste am ganzen Zimmer. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war nicht spektakul√§r, war aber ok f√ºr die 10 GBP pro Person. Alles in allem ist das Hotel ok, wenn man sich aber etwas Luxus g√∂nnen m√∂chte, dann ist es sicherlich das falsche.",4,2016,05,25
104,Habitaci√≥n 001,"Un hotel bien situado en el centro de Londres, a un paso de la estaci√≥n de Paddington. Me aloj√© por viaje de negocios y me dieron la habitaci√≥n 001, se supone que como un ""upgrade"". La habitaci√≥n era bastante peque√±a, el ba√±o diminuto. La puerta del ba√±o chocaba contra el peque√±o armario de la habitaci√≥n, de forma que siempre hab√≠a que abrirla y cerrarla para pasar del ba√±o a la habitaci√≥n. Adem√°s, esta habitaci√≥n queda justo al lado del restaurante, de manera que a partir de la hora de comienzo de servicio en el desayuno hay un ruido constante de hu√©spedes entrando y saliendo. El secador de pelo estaba ""convenientemente escondido"" en el mueble bajo el televisor. No puedo decir que sea el hotel m√°s c√≥modo en el que he dormido... ",3,2016,05,23
104,Pulito e confortevole ,"Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per una sola notte, purtroppo non avevamo molto tempo per stare in citt√†. Ha solo due note negative, troppo caldo in camera √® troppo piccola! Per il resto nulla da dire, personale gentile ed educato e la stanza era pulita, cosa quasi insolita per gli inglesi! Ci torner√≤ sicuramente, magari per un soggiorno pi√π lungo ",4,2016,05,19
104,E' una garanzia,"Ottimo albergo posizionato in zona strategica. 400 metri dalla fermata di Paddington ma in una via eccezionalmente signorile. Possibilit√† di parcheggio di macchina privata a pagamento ma a Londra, ragazzi...Albergo ristrutturato recentemente pulito ed ordinato.  Colazione standard. Personale disponibile ed efficiente. Tutto nelle mie aspettatitve",5,2016,05,11
104,Hotel Molto Buono!,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia in questo hotel per 4 giorni. L'hotel dall'esterno √® molto bello. Le camere un po' piccole, ma confortevoli, con a disposizione oggetti per farsi caff√® e t√® in completa autonomia. Ma vi consiglio la colazione dell'hotel, molto buona ed abbondante, che varia dal dolce al salato. La posizione √® ottima in quanto nelle vicinanze vi √® la stazione di Paddington, e inoltre, √® una zona molto tranquilla con una serie di locali. Il personale √® molto cortese. Alla reception abbiamo trovato una ragazza italiana molto gentile, di nome Gaia, che ci ha consigliato ed aiutato. Sicuramente ci ritorneremo nel nostro prossimo viaggio a Londra! ",4,2016,04,29
104,Ottimo!,"Ben posizionato in una tranquilla zona residenziale, vicino alle stazioni di paddington e lancaster. Camere piccole ma pulite e accoglienti, nella nostra il bagno era confortevole con una grande cabina doccia. Personale cordiale e disponibile, tra cui alcuni italiani. Buona la colazione. Lo consiglierei vivamente e ci tornerei volentieri.",4,2016,04,28
104,Ottimo!!!,"Ho soggiornato qui con mia mamma a inizio Aprile  ed entrambe ci siamo trovate benissimo! Situato in una zona tranquilla e vicinissimo alla stazione della metro e dei treni di Paddington. Lo staff alla reception molto cordiale e disponibile ( soprattutto Gaia e Silvia ) e il servizio molto efficiente. La camera confortevole, accogliete e soprattutto pulita. 
Sicuramente soggiorner√≥ di nuovo qui nel mio prossimo viaggio a Londra.",5,2016,04,27
104,Nos cobraron dos veces la habitaci√≥n y tardaron una semana en devolver el dinero,"Estuve con mi familia en Semana Santa y tuvimos la desagradable sorpresa de que pagamos la habitaci√≥n el d√≠a que llegamos y unos d√≠as despu√©s volvieron a cargarnos el importe de otra habitaci√≥n utilizando para ello los datos de la tarjeta con la que hab√≠amos hecho la reserva. Hasta pasada una semana no conseguimos que nos devolvieran el importe. Por lo dem√°s el hotel tiene una ubicaci√≥n fant√°stica, est√° limpio y las habitaciones y ba√±os reformados no hace mucho. La √∫nica pega de las habitaciones es que son un poco peque√±as pero trat√°ndose de Londres nos pareci√≥ que la relaci√≥n calidad precio esta bastante bien, siempre y cuando no te cobren dos veces la misma habitaci√≥n, claro!",3,2016,04,19
104,Ottimo!,"Hotel pulito e accogliente, camere non molto grandi ma confortevoli, ottima posizione a poche decine di metri dall'underground di Paddington, nel pacchetto avevo la prima colazione, buona la continentale, ottima e abbondante quella ""Inglese"". Personale della reception molto gentile e disponibile, Sakar su tutti, il ragazzo Italiano  di servizio alla reception e al bar (Mattia), oltre ad essere molto gentile e disponibile √® stato eccezionale nel consigliarci alcuni luoghi e ristoranti, uno su tutti un ristorante Italiano in zona Highbury che sicuramente mi vedr√† di nuovo seduto su quei tavoli nel mio prossimo viaggio a Londra.",5,2016,04,12
104,Ottima posizione staff amichevole,"Nonostante il breve soggiorno mi sono trovata molto bene nell'hotel. Il servizio √® molto efficiente, e lo staff √© molto amichevole, a partire dal portiere Mattia fino al personale alla reception. Atmosfera piacevole e posizione molto buona se si vuole raggiungere il centro. La colazione non √© niente di speciale, ma dettaglio trascurabile, perch√© in compenso le camere sono pulite e ben arredate.",4,2016,03,23

104,London visit,"En mi opinion, el hotel es fant√°stico la atenci√≥n es muy buena. La habitaci√≥n es acogedora y el desayuno es excelente. La seguridad tambi√©n es muy buena al igual que el staff sakar. Vine con mi papa y estamos pasando unos d√≠as excelentes. La ubicaci√≥n me parece fant√°stica, ya que estamos a s√≥lo 2 cuadras del centro por si queremos comer o salir a comprar algunas cosas.
Volver√≠a a este hotel en mi pr√≥ximo viaje ya que me brindaron una buenisima atenci√≥n en lo que llevamos de la estad√≠a.
Big thank you to Mr Sakar , Lucian and Ms Adriana ",5,2016,03,03
104,Sconsigliato,"Purtroppo una volta arrivato in hotel sono stato informato che la stanza prenotata non era disponibile mi √® stato proposto un hotel nelle immediate vicinanze e per scusarsi presso tale hotel mi √® stata offerta la colazione,.............analoga sorte √® toccata ad altre persone che facevano il ceck in assieme a me. Sinceramente resto molto perplesso, la sensazione leggendo anche altre recensioni √® che questa sia molto pi√π di una casualit√†, e francamente non lo trovo corretto. A buon intenditore.......",1,2016,01,03
104,Top Lage - perfekt f√ºr Wochenendtrip aber nicht mehr,Das Hotelpersonal ist sehr freundlich und die Lage ist Top. Zur U-Bahnstation Pattington Station sind es gerade mal 5 min Fu√ümarsch. Da erreicht man dann jeden beliebigen Platz in London ziemlich schnell. Das Hotelzimmer (gebucht wurde ein Einzelzimmer) ist sehr sehr sehr klein. Was aber kein Problem darstellt wenn man nicht vor hat all zu viel Zeit im Hotel zu verbringen. Das Zimmer und Bad war sehr sauber. Preis ist f√ºr London auch OK.,3,2015,12,18
104,Ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo,"Sono stata due volte in questo albergo ed ogni volta che desidero regalarmi un po' di relax a Londra non ho dubbi..prenoto qui. Vicino alla metropolitana in una zona tranquilla, l'hotel offre tutti i confort ed i servizi di cui si ha bisogno durante un soggiorno. Il rapporto qualit√† prezzo √® veramente ottimo. In particolare voglio segnalare la professionalit√† della sig.ra Sanya che mi ha aiutato a risolvere alcuni problemi durante l'ultimo soggiorno con mia figlia. Ormai √® diventata la mia seconda casa a Londra!!",5,2015,11,09
104,Finalmente un hotel degno di questo nome in una citt√† come Londra,"In realt√† siamo capitate qui per caso.
Attraverso un famoso sito di prenotazioni alberghiere,avevamo prenotato in un altro hotel della stessa catena ma arrivati in hotel alle h 20,30 ci √® stato detto che avevano provato a contattarci (cosa non vera) per informarci di aver avuto un problema con le camere e che quindi ci avrebbero spostato con un taxi (pagato da loro) in un altro hotel sempre della stessa catena.
Quindi eccoci qui.
Probabilmente,confronto a quello che avevamo scelto ci √® andata meglio.
La camera penso fosse pi√π o meno la medesima ma almeno qui per il prezzo concordato abbiamo avuto anche la colazione ed √® pi√π vicino alla stazione della metropolitana.
L'hotel si trova nel quartiere di Paddington a 5 minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana.
Il quartiere √® pieno di locali (dalle grosse solite catene ai pub e locali pi√π caratteristici) in cui si pu√≤ decidere dove cenare.
Il personale dell'albergo gentilissimo.
Come camera avevamo scelto una tripla.Piuttosto piccolina(ma a Londra sono tutte cos√¨) composta da un letto matrimoniale e un soppalco su cui era presente un lettino singolo con una mini cucina attrezzata(lavandino,microonde e accessori per fare il t√®).
Il bagno pulito e nuovo.
√à sempre presente la solita e poco igienica moquette ma nei miei viaggi precedenti a Londra,non mi √® mai capitato di trovare una camera senza moquette.
L'arredamento tutto moderno.
La colazione pi√π che sufficiente.
Erano disponibili pi√π pietanze salate che dolci,ma anche noi che abbiamo optato per la classica colazione all'italiana abbiamo avuto modo di fare una buona colazione.
Come prezzo non che proprio te lo regalino,ma visto che si parla di Londra dove tutto √® carissimo,questo hotel ha un ottimo rapporto qualit√†/prezzo.
Sicuramente da compilare e,spero,da ritornare molto presto!",5,2015,10,29
104,Week end shopping a Londra,"Hotel prenotato ad agosto con richiesta di 2 camere sullo stesso piano 1 singola  per me e una doppia per mia figlia e mia nipote e prima colazione Gluten free per una persona. Nonostante i ripetuti solleciti sia da parte nostra che da parte di booking la struttura non si √® mai degnata di rispondere.
Al nostro arrivo, siamo state ricevute da una ragazza molto gentile , parlava abbastanza bene l'italiano e cortesemente ci ha informato che le nostre camere vicine ma sullo stesso piano al primo ,non sarebbero state pronte alle 14.00 ma un po' pi√π tardi. Abbiamo pagato il nostro soggiorno e lasciato le valige . 
Siamo ritornate alle 20.00. La ragazza non c'era pi√π era stata sostituita da un personaggio ""Sakar"" molto scortese e maleducato. In poche parole le camere non erano pi√π al primo piano ma nei sotterranei, al nostro disappunto dopo ripetuti solleciti abbiamo avuto due camere in due ali dell'albergo distanti e una si raggiungeva facendo una scaletta a chiocciola molto stretta. La stanza era un tugurio il bagno un metro quadro, questa persona continuava a scaricare le colpe sulla povera ragazza asserendo che non avevano mai ricevuto la nostra mail di richiesta. Errore perch√© la ragazza ne era a conoscenza .Abbiamo telefonato immediatamente a booking reclamando  . Ritornate alla reception abbiamo richiesto la restituzione dei soldi. Per magia dal cilindro sono spuntate due camere al sesto piano una di fronte all'altra. Finalmente alle 23.00 siamo riuscite ad entrare in camera.  Camere molto piccole e bagni piccolissimi. Consiglio vivamente una dieta per chi pi√π della taglia 42 perch√© difficoltoso Uscire da quelle docce. Altra cosa.. nel frigorifero √® stato trovato l'avanzo di un panino di un precedente ospite.  La colazione abbiamo preferito farla fuori dall'hotel per non avere ulteriori sorprese. Sicuramente torner√≤ a Londra ma mai pi√π in questo hotel.",3,2015,09,30
104,Ten√≠a muchos a√±os de no sentirme como en casa en un hotel,"La amabilidad y actitud de servicio del personal desde nuestra llegada hasta nuestra partida fueron de primera clase. Al llegar, nos ofrecieron un ascenso de la habitaci√≥n que hab√≠amos reservado, y estuvimos muy c√≥modos. La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es muy buena. El √∫nico detalle fue que las ventanas daban a la calle, y el ruido de los autos era molesto. El desayuno es delicioso, pero nunca ser√° como la comida mexicana. Definitivamente volver√≠a.",5,2015,08,10
104,Extrem kleine und eher schmudlige Einzelzimmer aber top Lage,"Bei Anreise wurde mir ein Zimmer im Untergeschoss zugeteilt. Das Zimmer war enorm klein, mit Fenstern bis zum Boden und direkt in einen kalen Beton-Hinterhof. Auf Wunsch durfte ich dann in ein Zimmer auf der ersten Etage wechseln. Die Gr√∂sse und die Sicht war noch dieselbe, jedoch nicht ebenerdig, was schon mal vorteilhaft war. Im Badezimmer gab es keine M√∂glichkeit etwas abzustellen, auchl ein Zahnb√ºrstenglas war nicht vorhanden.
Speziell ist auch, dass es keinen Lift hatte zu dem Zimmer sondern nur eine ganz kleine Treppe - was nicht ganz einfach ist mit einem Koffer.
Eher unhygienisch fand ich, dass ich das zweite Kissen jeweils auf den Schrank legte und es mir t√§glich wieder aufs Bett gelegt wurde... 
Positiv ist ganz klar die Lage innert wenigen Minuten ist man zu Fuss am Paddington Bahnhof und im Hyde Park. 
Ich denke die gr√∂sseren Zimmer sind in Ordnung, aber man darf sich nicht vom DELUXE Einzelzimmer t√§uschen lassen.",3,2015,07,02
104,Aceptable,"Estuvimos unos d√≠as en Londres y escogimos este hotel. La verdad todo correcto, hotel peque√±ito pero mono. Acostumbrados a la calidad que tenemos en Espa√±a este se queda un poco atr√°s, pero aceptable para estar en Londres y por tener una gran ubicaci√≥n. Precio unos 160 libras por noche.",3,2015,06,29
104,Nos alojan en otro hotel sin avisar,"Nada m√°s llegar, nos informan de que nos van a alojar en otro hotel que est√° en la misma calle. Me dicen que nos han enviado un correo inform√°ndonos de este cambio, lo que es absolutamente falso. 
Lo que sucede es que tienen el hotel completo y tienen un acuerdo con lo que ellos llaman un ""sister hotel"", que ser√° de una categor√≠a similar, pero que no es ni la habitaci√≥n, ni el hotel en el que t√∫ has hecho la reserva.
Acept√© porque estaba y sola con dos ni√±os y cansada tras el viaje.",2,2015,06,26
104,Insufrible,"Nunca hab√≠a estado en un hotel tan malo. La pieza que me entregaron ( si se puede decir pieza) era √≠nfima. No entran las maletas, no hay armario, deb√≠a pasar sobre mi pareja en las noches ya que la cama estaba pegada a la muralla. Pero lo peor era el ba√±o, deb√≠as estar de lado para entrar, es una mentira que este hotel se catalogue de 4 estrellas, me sent√≠ estafada.",1,2015,06,12
104,Excelente servicio,"Hemos estado en Abril de 2015, durante 5 d√≠as en este hotel de Londres. El hotel est√° bien, muy cerca (100 m aproximadamente) de la estaci√≥n de Paddington con acceso a lineas de metro y tren y con muy buena comunicaci√≥n con autobuses p√∫blicos  y de lineas tur√≠sticas. La zona tiene bastantes tiendas y restaurantes y animada vida. 
El hotel est√° muy bien. Es antiguo aunque remodelado. Estuvimos en una habitaci√≥n triple, amplia, limpia aunque el ba√±o era bastante peque√±o, pero creo que como en casi todos en Londres. El desayuno es tipo ingles, sin mucha variedad pero abundante y sabroso, aunque el comedor es peque√±o. 
La atenci√≥n recibida por el personal fue excelente, en especial la de Sanya, que nos atendi√≥ de manera perfecta en todas nuestras peticiones y preguntas.
Si vuelvo a Londres, no dudar√≠a en alojarme all√≠ de nuevo",5,2015,04,14
104,estancia muy agradable,"Este hotel es muy correcto, limpieza muy buena, el ba√±o peque√±o pero todo nuevo impecable, las habitaciones peque√±as pero la cama muy grande y comoda y el personal muy amable, est√° muy bien situado, en 10 min estas en la parte alta del Hyde Park, hay dos estaciones de metro pr√≥ximas y varios autobuses que llegan hasta all√≠, en Praed Str. hay comercios y restaurantes, es muy pr√°ctico, sin embargo no aconsejo tomar el desayuno all√≠ por el precio puedes encontrar sitios m√°s agradables, pues el salon es un poco lugubre",4,2015,04,10
104,estancia agradable,"Est√° muy bien situado a 3 minutos de la estaci√≥n de Paddington y a 5 minutos de Hyde Park
Estuvimos con nuestros  dos hijos en una habitaci√≥n duplex c√≥moda y confortable. El ba√±o peque√±o pero muy limpio y casi nuevo. El personal muy agradable y atento a nuestras necesidades. Si volvemos a Londres repetiremos.",5,2015,04,06
104,"Buon rapporto qualit√† prezzo, sopra la media inglese","Abbiamo soggiornato nel Park Grand London Hyde Park per due sere: lo staff ha immediatamente accolto le nostre richieste e ci ha assegnato due camere rispondenti a quanto specificato in anticipo. Le camere singole sono un po' piccole, le doppie molto particolari perch√© possono dislocarsi su due piani (letto su piano soppalcato). Le camere sono pulite (e spesso ci√≤ non accade a Londra), la colazione con una discreta variet√† di portate, dal dolce al salato. A cinque minuti dalla stazione di Paddington, ottimo crocevia per aggredire il centro. Sicuramente un hotel di Londra da tenere in considerazione per prossime sortite.",4,2015,03,31
104,"buena ubicaci√≥n, si viajes en metro y tren","tuve la oportunidad de hospedarme hace un mes en este hotel, tiene una muy buena ubicaci√≥n, como 3 min a estaci√≥n paddington, habitaci√≥n muy reducidas pague extra por cama grande y era una cama matrimonial, ba√±era muy reducida, limpio y un desayuno escaso, solo queso, fruta, cereal, jugo, pan y cafe. esperaba mas de este hotel.",3,2015,03,31
104,Centrico,"De muy f√°cil acceso, cerca de Paddington.

104,Mai stata meglio,"Si dice che a Londra sia difficile trovare una buona struttura a un prezzo abbordabile... Io l ho trovata qui!!! Io e il mio fidanzato siamo stati benissimo. Hotel bellissimo. Camere nuove. Bagno grande e nuovo! Ottimo il set per il the che ci ha permesso di bere qualcosa di caldo ogni mattina senza dover scendere. √à in una posizione ottima per girare tutta londra. In 5 minuti a piedi si √® alla stazione di paddington, servitissima. La sera non mancano posti dove cenare. Nei dintorni √® pieno di pub e fast food. Sono stata contenta della mia scelta e rispenderei volentieri i miei soldi per soggiornare qui. Siuramente se mi ricapiter√† di andare a londra ci torner√≥.",5,2015,02,18
104,Settimana a Londra,"Con la mia ""piccola"" famiglia ci siamo concessi una vacanza a Londra scegliendo questo hotel assolutamente strategico come posizione. La camera era molto accogliente, comoda e pulita. Il personale molto disponibile e gentile. La cosa che mi √® molto piaciuta √® stata la colazione decisamente abbondante tanto da non pranzare. Consigliato",4,2015,01,11
104,Ottima esperienza,"Sono stato 4 notti con moglie e tre bambini piccoli e ci siamo trovati proprio bene. Accoglienza ottima personale professionale e molto attento e gentile. Camera comoda e pulita , prima colazione abbondante e discreta qualit√†. Consiglierei a chiunque per posizione , a soli 5 minuti a piedi da metropolita di Paddington e 10 da Hyde Park",4,2014,12,27
104,2 settimane qui,"Sono stata in questo hotel per ben due settimane! Mi hanno dato una camera al piano rialzato, nessun ascensore per raggiungerlo e quindi ho dovuto chiedere aiuto in reception per la valigia. La camera molto piccola, per una persona a malapena, con letto incastrato in un angolo. Bagno piccolo ma sempre pulito. Armadio... Mezza anta! Che per due settimane e' stato un suicidio! Non ho comunque chiesto di essere spostata, anche se visto il lungo pernottamento mi sarei aspettata una sistemazione piu' degna! L'hotel e' comunque pulito. Colazione: il minimo sindacale! La vicinanza alla stazione di Paddington lo rende strategico. L'hotel non ha ristorante interno!",3,2014,11,22
104,F√ºr Singles grauenvoll,"Single-Rooms im Keller, Zimmer so winzig, dass man den Koffer nicht unterbringt, Restaurant bis 22 Uhr ist nur der Pizza-Service, Fr√ºhst√ºck geht, au√üer Kaffee, der besteht aus Pulver, Personal ist freundlich",1,2014,11,10
104,Valutazione complicata,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per tre notti, non per scelta ma perch√© spostati da un altro hotel che non aveva pi√π camere a causa di un errore durante le prenotazioni... e gi√† questa sembra una pratica ricorrente che si commenta da s√©, viste altre recensioni dei mesi scorsi.
La posizione √® strategica, vicina a Paddington, a Hyde Park e a Bayswater/ Notting Hill. Il personale alla reception non √® stato gentile n√© disponibile, a tratti abbastanza scostante e insofferente. 
La stanza era grande e soppalcata, anche se non troppo funzionale: pochi spazi per appoggiare i bagagli, scala angusta, cucina utile ma senza frigo bar. Bagno moderno e di design, ma senza un appoggio per il beauty case, oltre al lavabo poco accessibile per le persone basse di statura.
Colazione senza infamia e senza lode, ma non da 4 stelle.
Crediamo, in sintesi, che a Londra ci sia di meglio.",3,2014,09,20
104,Buon hotel in posizione semicentrale,"Definirei buono il mio soggiorno di 4 notti al Park Grand Hotel. L'hotel per√≤ non √® un quattro stelle come scritto sul sito e su booking.com. Lo definirei pi√π un tre stelle. La posizione √® buona: vicino alla stazione della metropolitana Paddington, quindi Piccadilly  Circus √® raggiungibile in circa 15/20 minuti di metro. In prossimit√† dell'hotel (sulla strada per arrivare a Paddington) ci sono un paio di ristoranti italiani, un alimentari ed un bar. Hyde Park √® raggiungibile a piedi in circa 10 minuti. La mia camera singola era pulita, seppur molto piccola. Lo staff √® stato cordiale nelle risposte e richieste di informazioni anche se entrando ed uscendo nessuno si degna ad abbozzare un saluto. Il pagamento √® richiesto in toto all'arrivo al momento del check-in: attenzione perch√© a quanto pare le carte di credito prepagate appartenenti al circuito visa electron non vengono accettate e andare a fare bancomat  per pagare in contanti appena arrivati in una zona che non si conosce (magari anche di sera!) non √® molto comodo. WI-FI gratuito sia nelle camere  che nella hall e sala colazione. Il costo della prima colazione √® molto elevato (15¬£ a persona ad Agosto 2014) soprattutto in rapporto alla poca variet√† offerta. Durante il mio soggiorno √® stato possibile usufruire di un'offerta ""pre-pagata"": la colazione la si poteva pagare la sera precedente al prezzo scontato di 10¬£. Consiglio a tutti di provarla almeno il primo giorno per poi decidere successivamente per gli altri giorni. Personalmente mi sono trovata abbastanza bene (brioches, toast, panini con marmellate e nutella, succo di frutta e caffe) ma il prezzo di 10¬£ √® sicuramente pi√π adeguato alla quantit√†/variet√† offerta. Ho letto recensioni contrastanti: chi lo ha trovato super e chi pessimo. La mia opinione √® che per lo standard di una grande citt√† come Londra in cui le camere sono generalmente piccole e la pulizia scarsa, questo hotel offre una buona qualit√† ad un prezzo accessibile e in una posizione comoda. Attenzione per√≤: posizione comoda non vuole dire centrale! 15 minuti di metropolitana (tra scendere e salire e viaggio) non √® centro!! Ovviamente stare in centro e in un hotel pulito vuol dire spendere di pi√π ed essendo Londra una citt√† molto cara, questo hotel risulta essere una spesa accessibile.",3,2014,08,25
104,Ottimo,"Buono l'alloggio √® il trattamento la posizione √® buona la metropolitana √® a 5 minuti di cammino.

La camera ha solo un piccolo armadio.

La strada dell'albergo √® tranquilla e si avverte un senso di sicurezza.  

Ok per tutto.

104,Excelente estad√≠a,"Estuve en este hotel en junio por una noche al tener que cambiarme de otro que no me hab√≠a gustado. Cuando llegamos no quedaban habitaciones pero el conserje nos ofreci√≥ ubicarnos en otro hotel del estilo en esa zona. Al parecer surgi√≥ una disponibilidad en este hotel e incluso recibimos un upgrade por el mismo precio de la habitaci√≥n standard a una suite con dos pisos donde abajo estaba la cama king size, toilette impecable y en el piso de arriba hab√≠a un sofa con otro tv lcd y una mini cocina completisima. La decoraci√≥n de muy buen gusto, unos cortinados de shantung muy elegantes, el personal s√∫per atento y la zona residencial muy tranquila pero a dos cuadras del metro Paddington, muy comodo, Tambi√©n muchos bares cerca de la zona y paradas de bus.

104,Unertr√§glich warm im 7. Stock / Nachtruhe Fehlanzeige,"Meine Tochter und ich wohnten im 7. Stock des Hotels. Nachdem wir nach vorangegangenen Recherchen schon darauf eingestellt waren, dass die Zimmer sehr klein sind, waren wir nicht weiter √ºberrascht, das auch so vorzufinden. Schwer ertr√§glich war allerdings die Hitze in unserem Zimmer, verbunden mit der Tatsache, dass wir unser Fenster (wenn man einen wackeligen Metallrahmen mit einer Glasscheibe darin als Fenster bezeichnen kann) maximal 2 cm weit aufschieben konnten, was auf keinen Fall eine Frischluftzufuhr erm√∂glichte. In der Nacht die Klimaanlage laufen zu lassen war unm√∂glich, da sich diese unmittelbar oberhalb des Betts befand. Also gingen wir dazu √ºber, die Klimaanlage morgens einzuschalten um die Temperaturen bis zum Abend hin herunter zu k√ºhlen. Leider stellten wir am Abend fest, dass die Putzfrau die Klimaanlage ausgeschaltet hatte.

Ebenfalls nur schwer ertr√§glich waren die extrem d√ºnnen Zimmerw√§nde. Wir h√§tten gar keinen eigenen Fernseher ben√∂tigt, da wir problemlos h√∂ren konnten, was die Nachbarn rechts und links von uns anschauten. Belastender war dabei, dass einer unserer Nachbarn bis nachts um 3 fernsah und sich dabei noch lautstark mit seiner Frau unterhielt. Nach einer ann√§hernd schlaflosen Nacht suchten wir im Zentrum die Drogeriekette Boots auf, um uns mit Earplugs einzudecken. Die kommende Nacht war daraufhin ertr√§glicher. Positiv zu erw√§hnen ist in diesem Zusammenhang, das der Portier, den ich in der ersten Nacht um 2 Uhr um Hilfe bat, sich der Sache sofort annahm und f√ºr Abhilfe sorgte, indem er zun√§chst beim Nachbarn anrief und als das nichts brachte, sogar nebenan klopfte und daf√ºr sorgte, dass der Fernseher abgestellt wurde.

Insgesamt muss ich feststellen, dass ich aufgrund der beschriebenen Umst√§nde leider nicht von einem erholsamen Aufenthalt sprechen kann.  

Entt√§uscht war ich auch von der Diskrepanz zwischen der √§u√üeren Erscheinung des Hotels und der Ausstattung der Zimmer (sehr klein, kein vern√ºnftiges Fenster, die Gardine war zerrissen...). Von einem 4-Sterne-Hotel hatte ich etwas anderes erwartet.

Positiv zu erw√§hnen ist allerdings die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter und die Lage des Hotels. Sowohl die U-Bahn-Station als auch der Hyde Park sind in wenigen Minuten zu Fu√ü zu erreichen. Ebenfalls zu Fu√ü erreichbar sind diverse nette Lokale in denen man Fr√ºhst√ºcken oder zu Abend essen kann.

Fazit: In einem sch√∂neren Zimmer mit angenehmeren Temperaturen, einem ""normalen"" Fenster  und weniger hellh√∂rigen W√§nden w√ºrde ich erneut einen Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel buchen. Ob es ein solches Zimmer allerdings gibt, bleibt zu bezweifeln.",2,2014,06,22

104,Buen hotel pero ojo en la eleccion de habitaciones!,"Muy buen para Londres, especialmente recomendado por su relacion calidad-precio localizado en la zona de Paddington, a cinico minutos o menos de dos estaciones de metro (Paddington y Lancaster Gate, que te conectan rapidamente con cualquier punto de Londres). Paddington es una zona tranquila y residencial en el mismo centro de Londres, ideal para descansar despues del ajetro de la gran ciudad. Al margen de sus calles tranquilas encuentras variedad de restaurantes, supermercados, pubs, ...

Pros del hotel:
- decoracion - moderna pero acogedora.
- desayuno buffet muy variado y en mi caso inclu√≠do en el precio, lo cu√°l es bastante dif√≠cil de encontrar en londres.
- trato del personal - excelente.
-  habitaciones limpias.

Contras:
- habitaciones bastante peque√±as ( habitual en londres) y todas diferentes. 
- ba√±o diminuto, el plato de ducha es el suelo del ba√±o.
- armario diminuto o casi inexistente! Caben 4 camisas (literal). no hay espacio para Abrigos, zapatos, etc.  nosotros tuvimos q dejarlos en el suelo en un mini hall que tenia nuestra habitacion.
- no hay mini bar.

A tener en cuenta: ojo con el servicio de taxi del hotel, pues nos cobraron 10 libras de diferencia respecto al mismo trayecto en taxi de toda la vida. Lo coment√© en el hotel antes de irme y eran consciente de q son algo m√°s caros pero no tanto. ¬°Tener cuidado, al no llevar tax√≠metro pueden timar, nosotros √≠bamos al Royal Albert Hall con lo cu√°l se aprovech√≥ al saber a d√≥nde √≠bamos... imagino!

104,Non fatevi ingannare dal sito,"cominciando dal fatto che le immagini del sito non corrispondo a quelle dell'albergo, siamo arrivati e siamo rimasti sorpresi dalla dimensione piccola della stanza, nonostante avessimo preso una di livello superiore. Poi scopriamo che c'erano degli abiti e delle scarpe di un altro cliente nell'armadio, che la cassetta di sicurezza era bloccata per via delle batterie scariche e manca il frigobar! avevano anche provato a dire che non c'era la colazione compresa nella mia prenotazione ma per fortuna ce l'avevo stampata.
per il resto, comodo perch√® vicino alla fermata Paddington,non  ha il ristorante ma ce ne sono abbastanza vicini, certo che pi√π che un quattro stelle assomiglia a un tre! 
addirittura ci sono stanza nel livello sottoterra vicino alla sala della colazione e un ultimo piano che non si raggiunge con l'ascensore!",2,2013,12,16
104,Il giusto valore per il prezzo (rispetto al mercato),"Se ti aspetti di trovare il raffinato ambiente suggerito dal sito web dell‚Äôalbergo vai incontro a una delusione garantita.

Le stanze sono piccole ma _abbastanza_ pulite.
La connessione Internet √® penosa, gratuita ma penosa. Quantomeno nelle camere: nella saletta all‚Äôingresso √® meglio.
La colazione √® decente; forse a 12 sterline uno se lo aspetterebbe ma non diamo nulla per scontato.
Se potete evitate la stanza 809 perch√© √® sopra il ristorante e l‚Äôodore di cibo √® abbastanza forte.

In preda allo sfinimento, e visto che oramai non c'era pi√π niente da fare (anche perch√® lei era francamente il classico 'muro di gomma'), al momento di pagare mi ha detto che il conto dovevano caricarlo sul loro albergo e non su quello nuovo. Non vedendoci chiaro, ed incominciando a capire che le offerte che fanno sono specchietti per le allodole che servono solo per smistare i clienti in altri alberghi (se guardate su TRIPADVISOR √® una pratica comune negli alberghi di questa catena), ho chiesto gentilmente che almeno sulla fattura mi venisse specificato che mi avevano cambiato hotel... lei voleva mandamelo via mail (e gi√†...)....gliel'ho chiesto stampato. Quella che, insomma doveva essere un weekend romatico per festeggiare l'anniversario tra me e mio marito, √® stato drammaticamente rovinato, perch√®, come se l'inizio non fosse bastato, l'albergo dove ci hanno dirottato √® stato ancora peggio. 
Se potessi, e non √® detto che non lo faccia, richiederei un risarcimento per tutto quello che ci hanno fatto passare e tutti i soldi che abbiamo speso per questo che doveva essere un we speciale.",1,2012,10,22
104,Per essere un quattro stelle mi aspettavo di pi√π,"Sono andata a Londra per 4 giorni e ho alloggiato in questo hotel grazie a un last minute. Per avere 4 * √® stato abbastanza deludente. La camera era letteralmente un buco, passando davanti al letto bisognava schiacciarsi contro il muro con il rischio di far cadere un mega televisore appeso al muro. C'era una sola finestra nella stanza che non si apriva neanche interamente, ma solo una quindicina di cm, senza contare che era uno schifo perch√® era sporchissima. √® stato difficile gestire lo spazio essendo in due con bagaglio a mano, avessimo avuto una valigia a testa non ci saremmo state. Anche il bagno era minuscolo, ovviamente senza bidet. La cosa pi√π positiva era la cortesia del personale, sempre disponibile. Anche la stanza e il bagno sono stati puliti bene, finestra a parte. Non c'era il minibar, n√® la cassaforte ma solo una scrivania con le cose per farsi un t√®. La posizione √® buona.",2,2012,10,14
104,Stanze ridicolmente piccole,"Qui per lavoro, la stanza √® talmente piccola che ringrazio di avere un trolley da cabina con il cambio per due giorni.
Avessi volato con una valigia, non avrei potuto aprirla e al contempo avere lo spazio sufficiente per raggiungere il bagno.
Mancanza di minibar, che davo scontato in un 4*
Pulizia ok
Location ok",2,2012,09,26
104,DECISAMENTE BUONO,"Ho alloggiato con la mia famiglia (2 adulti e 2 bambini) una settimana in una quadrupla al 1¬∞ piano; stanza sufficientemente spaziosa con 2 letti matrimoniali FANTASTICI; forse il bagno √® un p√≤ stretto, ma molto ben pulito come anche la stanza. E' un hotel a 4 stelle sufficientemente buono ubicato in un'ottima posizione a 3 minuti dalla metro e dai bus ed a 15 muinuti di cammino da Marble Arch .
Eviterei di effettuare la colazione nell'albergo che reputo troppo costosa; in alternativa vicino alla fermata della metro vi sono numerosi ristoranti ove poter fare colazioni a costi nettamente pi√π bassi.
Ci tornerei sicuramente.",4,2012,09,11
104,Ideal f√ºr Londonbesuche,"Das Hotel liegt an der Westbourne Terrace und hat eine wahnisnnig tolle Lage. Nothing Hill ist zu Fu√ü in 15 Minuten erreichbar, Paddington Tube Station ist in 5 Gehminuten erreichbar. Unser Zimmer war etwas klein (wer koemmt schon nach London und erwartet riesige Schlafgem√§cher?!), jedoch sauber, die Matrazen waren nicht durchgelegen. Es gibt eine gute Aircondition, das Bad war winzig, die Dusche (Glas) daf√ºr sehr gro√ü. Alles war ausreichend. Hatten ein sehr ruhiges Zimmer, konnten bei offenem Fenster schlafen. ZUs√§tzlich werden ein Wasserkocher, Kaffee, Tee und Kekese im Zimmer angeblten und vom Personal aufgef√ºllt. Das Personal war h√∂flich  aber uninteressiert, Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet war absolut in Ordnung. Hatten √ºber booking.com ein Spezialangebot gebucht - 75 Pfund pro Nacht - das war es auf jeden Fall wert! Was noch? Den Thai um die Ecke ausprobieren (Thai River Restaurant - 18 Chilworth Street) - 3 Minuten entfernt aber sehr nett und wirklich gut.

Wir sind in Stansted angekommen, von dort aus mit dem National Express Coach in die Baker Street. Von dort aus mit der Tube nach Paddington - Dauer ca. 1h30min.",4,2012,08,15

104,Buon rapporto qualit√†/prezzo,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel dal 1/05 al 4/05 approfittando di un'offerta su booking (c.a 280¬£ per 3 notti/2 persone). Ero inizialmente spaventata dalle recensioni di altri viaggiatori ma devo dire che mi sono trovata molto bene. La camera √® effettivamente molto compatta ma pulita e piacevolmente arredata. Il bagno, in particolare, era completamente rinnovato e molto funzionale (vedi foto). Anche la posizione si √® rivelata ideale: lontano dalla confusione del centro londinese ma vicinissima alla metro di Paddington e a pochi minuti da Marble Arch e Oxford Street. Lo consiglio!",4,2012,07,16
104,katastrophe,"2 zimmer f√ºr 4 tage bestellt  √ºber booking com bestetigt und vorkasse bezahlt,bei ankunft kein zimmer frei es dauerte 2 stunde bis eine l√∂sung gefunden war bei ein nahe gelegen hotel der zu dieser kette geh√∂rt.
schlimm ist das dort nicht davon w√ºssten das wir da ankomme und noch nicht gelogene 2 stunde warte zeit aben wir die zimmer bekommen,√ºbriegens die rezeption unterbesetzt alle kunde haben laut stark gewartet.
der rest brauche ich nicht zu schildern",2,2012,06,09
104,buono e ci ritornerei,"L'hotel √® in una buonissima posizione a circa 300 metri dalla metro in zona residenziale molto tranquilla, le camere sono piccole ma vivibili pulite e con possibilit√† di fare una mini colazione  grazie al bollitore in camera; sono presenti bustine di th√® e piccole confezioni di biscottini. il personale sempre gentile e disponibile..consiglio di prenotare pochi giorni prima della partenza cos√¨ che i prezzi delle camere si abbassino notevolmente, noi abbiamo fatto cos√¨ ed abbiamo risparmiato.E' un buon hotel anche se ovviamente non corrisponde ai nostri standard italiani di hotel a 4 stelle ma ad un 3  stelle comunque a Londra si sa che √® cos√¨ e va benissimo..",3,2012,03,07
