134,OUTSTANDING!!!,"The total experience totally exceeded my expectations!  The reception desk staff,  Laura, Kasha, Sebastian, Manual and Mohammad were warm, friendly, knowledgeable, patient and accommodating EVERY time there was an interaction!  Housekeeping staff and restaurant staff were the same. Food was great and entire hotel clean and hygienic!  A must stay conveniently located hotel.  OUTSTANDING!!!",5,2024,10,18
134,Fantastic Stay with Exceptional Service and Memorable Breakfast,"We had a fantastic one-week stay at Bankside Hotel in London. From the moment we arrived, the staff were welcoming, and Mohammad, the assistant manager, provided outstanding service throughout. He was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed, which really made our stay that much more enjoyable.

One thing that really stood out was the breakfast. It’s not your usual buffet offered at Marriott hotels. Everything was fresh and well-prepared, and the variety was impressive. The poached eggs and artisan breads were a highlight, smoked salmon spread was super fresh, and it felt like a lot of thought went into the quality and presentation of the food. Definitely one of the best hotel breakfasts I’ve had.

The hotel itself is modern and comfortable, with rooms that are well-designed and spacious. The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and stylish. The location is also very convenient, making it easy to get around and explore different parts of London.

We had a great experience and would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,10,17
134,"Welcoming, Cozy, Ideal Location","What a wonderful experience from start to finish. We were warmly welcomed by Kasha, a charming and inviting person and fantastic customer service representative. Kasha was a great resource for everything, from navigating the city to choosing the best restaurants. She made us feel very much at home. The room itself was extremely comfy and quiet. Between the blackout curtains and ultrasoft bed, it was hard to get up in the morning. The breakfast buffet was delicious and a great way to start a day of exploring the city. 10/10 love the Bankside!",5,2024,10,16
134,We will definitely come back again!,"We visited Bankside hotel/Artyard restaurant with my parents, partner and myself. The service was impeccable: Attentive, incredibly friendly and we got good advice in the restaurant. The food was exceptional. For instance: every ingredient in the burrata dish was used to its full potential, creating a flavour explosion! And even the plates where a thoughtful touch. As they were made from recycled broken plates. We will definitely come back again!",5,2024,10,11
134,Excellent Hotel Staff,"The front desk staff of this hotel was the nicest I have experienced! We were in town for a short trip to see Taylor Swift and they helped us fit in all we could during our quick visit. Kasha, Mustafa, and Sebastian were especially helpful and friendly in answering our questions and making recommendations to make our trip special! I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2024,10,08
134,Excellent business and vacation hotel near Blackfriars,We stayed at the Bankside for 2 weeks while I was on a business trip. The hotel is close to the city and the attractions while still being in a quiet neighborhood close to the River Thames and train service. The on-site restaurant was really good and there are good pubs nearby. The room was well appointed and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!,5,2024,10,08
134,"Wonderful staff! Kudos to Marcel, Raquel and Mohamed Hassan","We lived working with Raquel at the front desk. Her smile was so bright we almost needed sunglasses at her reception. Marcel and Mohammed rescued us from our own jet-lagged absent mindedness by gracefully returning our passports and credit cards that we left in the room safe! Yikes, that was a close call! The room was well made up everyday. We couldn’t have asked for better!",5,2024,10,08
134,Bankside Hotel weekend stay,"My entire experience was positive. All of the staff at Bankside were welcoming, from reception to housekeeping to the Art Yard restaurant. Mustafa Omar at reception was particularly attentive by helping us with our bags and bringing us refreshments upon arrival and departure. It added to the overall comfort of our stay.",5,2024,10,06
134,Beautiful and Warm 5 Star Hotel on South Bank,"Hotel was beautiful and beds were so comfy! James Burns, the Head Ambassador, was amazing! He remembered my husband and me from our stay 2 years ago! He gave us amazing food recommendations and quaint places to visit. We felt like we were with family. The wait staff at breakfast and dinner were lovely and the bartenders kept us laughing all night. 

Will definetly come back and stay here again next time we are in London!",5,2024,10,03
134,Excellent 3 course menu in its amazing Art Yard Bar & Kitchen,"Had the pleasure to lunch here this week: absolutely excellent!  Besides a beautiful designed location (this includes into the table setting), the just recently updates menu for the season had great choices for all of us and all the dishes were spot on: well prepared, good flavours, nice portions throughout our 3-course menu. Wine pairing was well chosen by our great staff, that was super attentive and pleasant. Will come back for sure!",5,2024,10,02
134,"Fantastic hotel, delicious breakfast!","Beautiful rooms, fantastic location, delicious breakfast, and super friendly staff! The rooms were spotless and comfortable, and the hotel is in a perfect spot for exploring the city. The breakfast had a great selection, everything was fresh and tasty. The staff made us feel welcome and were always ready to help with any questions. Overall, a wonderful experience—will definitely come back next time I’m in town!",5,2024,10,01
134,Extremely nice boutique  hotel experience,"Excellent service in all respects. The front desk staff were exceptionally courteous, helpful, informative and accommodating. The breakfast room wait staff were polite, attentive and efficient. The hotel's lobby and room decor was interesting, upscale and very well maintained. The room amenities (particularly the automatic espresso coffee maker!), electrically controlled window shades and comfortable beds were made for a luxurious experience. Only very minor issue is that location is not closer to the Underground. I would highly recommend this property.",5,2024,09,30
134,Lovely hotel,Wonderful hotel and staff. They had an art exhibition with free drinks. They also gave us free upgrade and wine. Laura was particularly lovely. It was a bit tricky to turn off and on our hotel lights and The bed seemed short and the pillows were a bit thick for my liking but apart from that all good!,5,2024,09,30
134,Weeklong Vacation for Two in London,"My wife and I went to London for a weeklong vacation. We had never been before. The South Bank looked interesting and the Bankside was rated highly and cheaper than similarly rated hotels. 

Right from the beginning, the service was excellent. Leena, one of the staff up front, helped me set up the reservation, making sure my wife could get into the room without me, as she arrived in London a couple days before I arrived. I then got a nice follow-up email, about a week before I headed to London,  from Leena saying they were looking forward to our visit.  A very nice touch. 

Then, when I got there, Laura T was able to get us tickets to a football (soccer) match for my favorite team - tickets I had been unable to procure.   Sebastian made us fantastic cappuccinos every morning, serving us with a smile. Every person on the staff did whatever they could to make our trip better. Could we have an extra electrical adapter- done. How about a corkscrew for the bottle of wine we bought this afternoon - done. The staff is simply fantastic. 

As for the hotel itself, it’s in a great neighborhood. We enjoyed the culture there (Tate Modern, Globe Theatre) while enjoying the food at the various venues, particularly Borough Market. And the Tube and buses are very accessible for getting around to the other parts of the city. 

The decor is modern. It is extremely clean.  The hotel is human-sized, as opposed to a big convention-style hotel. Sized so the staff can get to know your name during your stay. 

Our stay at the Bankside was one of the best hotel experiences I have had, and I do travel a bit. I look forward to going back.",5,2024,09,29
134,The beautiful Bankside Hotel,"The Bankside Hotel is a small hotel, and meticulously clean. The staff is helpful and friendly, going out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.  They made great recommendations for local pubs and restaurants.  The location is great, just a block or two from the Thames River.  The lobby is modern and not at all like the standard lobby in hotels.  It is a comfortable and relaxing space.",5,2024,09,26
134,Exceptional stay!  Book this now.,"This is a long review because you, fellow travelers, need to know how wonderful this hotel is. I spend 100+ nights in hotels annually. This is a rare find. 

Having read many rave reviews about the Bankside, my expectations were high. The service and quality of my stay vastly exceeded them! The fantastic location also makes easy in/out and moves you away from much louder and busier parts of London. 

My favorite part is the time the staff takes to get to know you and — best part of all — call you by your name! A small gesture that demonstrates thoughtfulness and attention to detail. Greatly appreciated. 

What a delightful stay from the moment of arrival! Mohammed greeted me with a welcoming smile in the lovely reception area — where you sit down to check in. It’s a nice departure from the standard process. 

He offered me a beverage to enjoy while we worked through the details of the stay, including some birthday plans for my friend arriving the next day.  He personally made arrangements that made her celebration extra special. What a star! I cannot thank him enough. 

But the excellent service didn’t end there. Many staff made our stay memorable. 

Special thanks to Kacia in reception for being welcoming and kind as we came and went from hotel. She always had a smile for us and gladly answered questions that we probably asked more than once. So thankful for her. 

Laura in reception was also friendly and helpful in giving us guidance. Very much appreciate her. 

Mersim in Art Yard Restaurant at breakfast was an absolute delight, as well. He warmly greeted me each morning as he made sure I had a hot beverage of choice when I sat down. From there, he arranged for anything I wanted or needed. He’s a gem!

Hanji and Dimbe in Art Yard were also wonderful, as was Raquel in reception. 

And, please know the food is outstanding! I had daily breakfast and a room service dinner. Fantastic food. 

Cannot wait to return!",5,2024,09,23
134,"Wonderful evening with family. Our server, Stephanie, was top tier!","My family and I enjoyed our first experience here at the Art Yard restaurant. The recommendations we received for the dinner options were perfect. The entrees, cocktails, and wine are fantastic. Also, Stephanie, our lovely server who assisted our table, was excellent. She provided on time service, delicious recommendations, and kind conversation.",5,2024,09,22
134,Overnight stay,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel, on arrival was met with a glass o bubbly and eased into check in, Angela on reception is a credit to the hotel and hopefully climbs the ladder as she went over and above helping us out after I messed up the booking. The hotel is stunning, the rooms spacious and delightful, the beds extremely comfortable. Breakfast was amazing plentiful. The only downside to our stay was having to leave. 100% we would Highly recommend this hotel and especially Angela. ",5,2024,09,22
134,Best hotel we’ve stayed at!,"I can’t say enough about this hotel! From the time we checked in we had the best service of any hotel we’ve been to. If you like walking this hotel is central to most London highlights such as the London Eye, Big Ben, Tower of London, Borough Market, St. Paul’s Cathedral, pubs, galleries,  the list goes on. Room was clean, bed was comfy and spacious and the staff were incredible! This hotel won’t disappoint!",5,2024,09,21
134,Top notch as always ,The same fantastic service as always. People at front desk and breakfast are si nice. They always ask how your stay is going and helpful. I've said this before. But my favourite london hotel by far. See you again in 2025. Thank you again for relaxing stay.,5,2024,09,20
134,Impressive employee.,"The entire staff was wonderful. One, Rio,came to our rescue with knowledge and kindness. I felt we should tell someone in authority how great she is. She was able to help with an electrical problem with both knowledge and kindness. I tripped circuit breakers and singed my adapter trying to plug a hair dryer in. She was able to fix everything and allay my fears.",5,2024,09,13
134,The highlight of our anniversary!,"Our one-night stay at the Bankside Hotel in London for our anniversary was absolutely perfect! From the moment we walked in, the amazing front desk staff made us feel so welcome and really went the extra mile to make our stay memorable, in particular Raquel, Kasha, Mo and Elena. The room was gorgeous—sleek, modern, and super comfortable. They even surprised us with a thoughtful anniversary treat, which made the night feel even more special. The hotel’s vibe is stylish yet cozy, and the location is unbeatable for exploring London. It was the perfect way to celebrate, and we genuinely didn’t want to leave. Dinner at the restaurant was lovely too! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a flawless stay.",5,2024,09,12
134,Immaculate hotel with amazing staff!,"Easily the nicest hotel in London hosted by the nicest staff in London. My girlfriend and I stayed there for my 19th birthday and receptionist Raquel upgraded us to an amazing suite with unexpected touches including balloons and champagne! The bathroom was almost as beautiful as the view, and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. We also had access to other facilities, so I took advantage of the outstanding gym they have. The staff were incredibly welcoming and made our night unforgettable. I cannot thank them enough and I would definitely recommend!",5,2024,09,11
134,No.1 choice for London,"This is my hotel of choice whenever I travel to London!! 
The front desk staff Richard, Mohammed, Raquel, Elena, Manuel, Sebastian & Herman are second to none ..
The rooms/beds are delightful and the  breakfast is diverse
The only time I would consider staying at another property in London is if Bankside was fully booked and even then I believe they would make a plan for me! 
6 stars",5,2024,09,10
134,Bankside is the right side for us!,"What a wonderful hotel!  I would especially like to thank the concierge team - especially Richard, Mohammed and Mikael.  I wondered about the location, but it was perfect.  We could walk along the Thames and walk to many places.  There was a small grocery across the street, the Waitrose, and easy walking distance to M&S Foods and Amazon Fresh.  The chocolates at M&S Foods were so good.  Lots of chocoholics in our family, so perfect souvenirs.  I use hiking poles to walk but it was no problem.  Our goal was just to ""walk around London"", and this fit the bill.  We did take some tours to other places like Windsor Castle, but ""walking around"" was our favorite part.",5,2024,09,10
134,Beautiful hotel in the heart of London .,"Beautiful hotel , with a contemporary relaxed style . All staff , without exception ,went over and above the expected to make our stay enjoyable .
 The standard of all communal areas was  very well designed . The bedroom was very spacious , clean and beautifully furnished .",5,2024,09,07
134,Lovely meal for party of eight,"Came here as a family and had a lovely evening…Had flavoursome good quality food, the broccoli was lovely. Really enjoyed my  Salmon dish as well. The other dishes were brilliant. The ambience was welcoming and we were able to feel very relaxed as a group of eight.

The waitress Stephanie was a credit to her team, was very attentive to our requests and took time to explain the dishes.   She made the night special.   Thank you Stephanie. :-)

We will be back i am sure",5,2024,08,31
134,Strongly recommend,The hotel is very new. Great location and staff. The breakfast was delicious and the buffet had a ton of selections. The front desk manager was so nice that he waived my breakfast since I told him I thought the breakfast was included. Would def come back again!,5,2024,08,30
134,Great experience!,We had the best experience at the Bankside Hotel! The staff remembered our names and treated us like family. They took care of our every need. Kasha and Mustafa were exceptionally kind. We will definitely be staying there again. Highly recommend it.,5,2024,08,27

They helped in every way possible to make our stay absolutely wonderful and pleasant. A big shout out to Mihael who was extremely pleasant and he gave a good tour of our room as well. Also, Rachael from the front office helped us book the premier league game tickets that was a wonderful experience foe our entire family. Thank you again Bankside Hotel for a wonderful vacation.",5,2024,08,24
134,Modern Hotel with friendly professional staff,"One of the top 5 hotel experiences I have had globally. The hotel features the latest modern upgrades and attention to detail that made me stop and appreciate my decision. 

Walking distance to local atmosphere (pubs) and the Uber to the train station took 2 minutes to arrive.

I will look for the Bankside the next time I travel to London.",5,2024,08,24
134,Bankside is a must stay,"Absolutely the BEST! Close to many amenities - including Blackfriars station (across the bridge). Amazing staff- so helpful and friendly.

134,A new favorite hotel in London,"We loved this hotel.  It was a bit farther away than we usually stay when in London, but found the walk to everything not a problem.

It is in a much quieter area than most other hotels we have stayed at, yet within a couple of minutes you can be in the hustle and bustle.

Here is what we really liked:
-We arrived early coming from the US and our room was ready.  That is a real win for a hotel.  
-The hotel was very clean and modern.  
-The staff was very friendly and helpful
-They had welcome water available and bottles of water to take out for your days outing
-The Rooms were very comfortable
-The beds were great with very soft cool sheets
-The breakfast was great
-The ac worked great and the room was nice and cool

Here is what we didn’t like:
-The pillows were very firm and bothered both of us

We would absolutely stay here again",5,2024,08,10
134,Bankside is a 10!,"We loved our stay at the Bankside! The staff is incredibly attentive. when we arrived, our room was not ready yet and so Mustafa Omar helped my husband with parking the car, sat at acquaint table, outdoors, continually checked on us to see if we need anything while we waited and made sure our bags were delivered when the room was ready, he was so sweet and acted like we were the only guest there. Bartender asked what I like to drink in custom blended a cocktail for me. Our room was beautiful very clean. I wish we could’ve stayed longer is my only regret and truly and enjoy the hospitality in the comfort of this charming hotel.",5,2024,08,08
134,"Perfect place, great staff, clean and trendy vibe. EXACTLY what we were looking for.","This was a fantastic hotel for business or leisure travel! This trip was for leisure and it suited us perfect. The rooms were spotless, the amenities were great and the staff was 100% focused on their guests. After a long 10 hour journey we were greeted 
by Manuel who made it a perfect check-in experience.  He also helped us through our entire 5 day stay and made us feel at home.",5,2024,08,06
134,Excellent service and great location.,"Great hotel from the moment we walked in. Greeted by reception staff who were extremely helpful and took our bags to allow us to explore London, even though we arrived very early. In particular, Mustafa was incredibly courteous and helped us in terms of planning our trip with my 7 year old. He went over and above to help us. Fantastic service and excellent location. Couldn't recommend Bankside more!",5,2024,08,04
134,"An excellent, high quality hotel on the South Bank","This hotel is excellent.  The reception is funky and high quality and feels like a sanctuary from the outside.  Check-in staff were friendly and efficient, both on arrival and departure.  We had two rooms - a room with 2 queen beds (Generous), and a king room (modest).  The generous room was very spacious, with high quality bed linen and a good bathroom with bath.  The modest room was also nice, with bathroom with shower.  It was a very short stay, so we didn’t eat at the hotel, but the generous supply of complimentary cans of water were much appreciated in the summer heat. I wish more hotels provided this! Everything in this hotel was immaculately clean, and furnishings and decor are high quality.  Would definitely stay here again.  Tip: spend some time in the cool little library area on the mezzanine floor, with its furry grey armchairs and books!",5,2024,08,03
134,Beyond all expectations. A hidden gem in London.,"We had simply the best stay at Bankside Hotel. I stayed with my daughter and a friend along with her children for a 'Girls' Night' in London and we ended up not leaving the hotel we were so comfortable! From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a treat. The staff are above and beyond welcoming and caring. The rooms were true luxury and the bed was possibly the best I have slept in.  It was all topped off by the delicious menu that catered for everyone's personal preferences at dinner and breakfast. The hotel interior is beautifully decorated with unique furniture and art pieces and in fact every item was clearly curated with such great care (we loved discovering the rocking.horse, Bankside honey and the added bonus of an Artist in Residence). Everything felt truly sincere and genuine Thank you to the whole Bankside staff for creating  such a special experience. We can't wait to come back.",5,2024,07,31
134,Amazing Experience,"This is an amazing hotel!! We came into the hotel exhausted after a grueling road trip. They quickly checked us in and provided a drink. Even though they don’t have valet, they helped  us locate a garage for the night. The beds were the most comfortable ones of our trip! We felt welcomed and appreciated!! The only thing I’d love to see is a pool. Thank you Bankside!!",5,2024,07,31
134,Excellent customer service & hospitality!,"Our family stayed at the Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection during April & May 2024. We wanted to let everyone know that we would give this hotel 10 stars if we could! Excellent customer service, cleanliness, friendly and welcoming! All meals and drinks were outstanding! We will definitely stay at this hotel when we return to London. Walking distance to many venues, museums including Tate Modern, Bourough Market and bridges. We found it much quieter than being on the other side of the Thames.",5,2024,07,26
134,A thoroughly recommended Marriott Autograph Collection hotel in the heart of London,"I am a very regular Marriott hotel user and as the group has grown hugely over the years, sometimes the very high Marriott standards are not quite upheld by the new acquisitions.

I had not heard of the Bankside hotel prior to booking, but as it was an Autograph Collection property (and far from cheap) I booked. I was Not disappointed.

This is a somewhat quirky hotel, set back behind the OXO tower on the South Bank, immediately off Blackfriars bridge. Outwardly, not marked as a Marriott and with a casual lobby and check in area, I was initially a little confused and sidled in.

A very pleasant young lady greeted me and - recognising my confusion- asked if she could help… She quickly checked me in and directed me to my room.

The rooms are extremely well appointed, with everything a top tier Marriott normally includes, but all at a higher level. A coffee machine with good coffee, a wide variety designer tea offerings and an unstocked minibar, but with canned water which is replaced each day.

Electric blinds (mine didn’t initially work, but were quickly fixed), ironing board and laundry facilities and a very nice bathroom with sumptuous - and plentiful - towels and designer toiletries. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a wonderful King sized and fantastically comfortable, bed…

The hotel also has a nice bar and a very pleasant restaurant with an interesting selection of tasty offerings and very attentive  and friendly staff.

Thoroughly recommended hotel in the heart of London!",5,2024,07,25
134,A memorable stay...thank you!,"I had one of the most memorable overnight stays at Bankside. My sister gifted me a staycation for my birthday, and everything was just magical. She mentioned to the staff on the day of the booking about my birthday, and as soon as we arrived, balloons, flowers, a delicious cake, and a bottle of prosecco were there to welcome me! It was so nice to see how the hotel really takes care of its guests and helps to make memories special and unique. Dinner was delicious with a special happy birthday decoration on my dessert, as well as breakfast. And last but not least, the room was spotless with super comfy beds! I hope I don't have to wait for my next birthday to enjoy another stay!",5,2024,07,24
134,Wonderful visit,"When I stay in London I like to move around to different hotels in different areas so that I get to know more places.  I am so glad I stayed at Bankside.  At first I wasn't sure if it was as convenient to tube stations and walking areas, but after one day I knew I did not make a mistake.  It only takes 4 minutes to walk to Southwark, a few more to Waterloo, and just a few minutes to walk across the bridge to Blackfriars station.  Borough Market and the Tate Modern are close at hand.  The walk along the Thames AND the walking bridge is a favorite.

Being close to the tube stations (and buses of course) I easily transversed the city going to Notting Hill, Kensington, the theater at night etc.

The hotel is fairly new.  It is VERY comfortable and has a nice restaurant. Very clean.  Lots of space to spread out.   Also a very good food market next door.

I just wanted to compliment the staff at Bankside.  They are so friendly and helpful especially at reception and in the restaurant.  Although I had excellent experiences with all of the people I encountered there, Kasha was an absolute stand out!   She has a wonderful manner and immediately greeted me by name each time I saw her over the 5 days.

She helped me immensely in figuring out my days events and how to get there by the tube.  She was genuinely interested in making sure that I, a solo traveler, had a wonderful time in London.

I would certainly stay at Bankside again while visiting London.",5,2024,07,22
134,One of the best Marriott properties in the world,"This is truly one of the best properties in the Marriott portfolio. This was our second stay at the Bankside, and both experiences have been superb. 

Starting with the staff: the team that works here operate at a St. Regis/Ritz-Carlton level. As a Marriott Ambassador, I've been to hundreds of hotels across the world and the folks at this property are exceptional. They also acknowledge and recognize Marriott status and go out of their way to make sure loyalty is rewarded.

The property itself is flawlessly maintained and no detail is overlooked. You'd be hard pressed to find a blemish on this property. The hotel itself is also centrally-located and if its not in walking distance you're a stone's throw away from the Blackfriar tube station.

The hotel restaurant puts out great food. From breakfast to dinner. Drinks are delightful. And it is evident the service staff take pride in working there.

Bottom line: while Autograph Properties are fantastic, this hotel belongs among Marriott's Luxury Collection.",5,2024,07,22
134,Best stay ever,"I recently stayed at Bankside to celebrate my sister's belated birthday, and it was an amazing experience from start to finish. The check-in process was really easy and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Our room was on the fourth floor, was incredibly clean, the bed was soooo comfortable, and the hotel surprised us with a beautifully decorated room, complete with a bottle of Prosecco, balloons, a cake, chocolates, and greeting cards to celebrate the occasion. We also had a fantastic dinner at the ArtYard, where the staff, food, and drinks were all excellent. I can't recommend this hotel enough for its great location and top-notch service. 🫶🏻",5,2024,07,22
134,Easy,We met in the city a few friends and we had to have a meeting about upcoming events. We were welcomed into the lobby in a comfortable spot and began our discussions on family and friends coming to the city from 5 countries. There was a lovely menu for the group to feel very welcomed. Thanks for hosting us for future events.,5,2024,07,21
134,"Superb Hotel, Superb Service","This hotel is the perfect blend of location, price, high quality, and tip service. It's is very clean, well-furnished, quiet, and has a good on site restaurant. It is located near many good restaurants and the south bank which is lovely to walk along. It is also situated near multiple Tube and National Rail stations, making it easy to get everywhere. Every time we headed out for the day, returned from work, and even after we checked out, Mustafa Omar helped us out with everything we needed with a warm welcome and smile. Stayed here many times and will always come back.",5,2024,07,21
134,Lovely Stay,"What a lovely hotel! The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. The breakfast was amazing. Big thanks to Manuel for helping me out as I arrived, as I had a quick turnaround to a meeting I needed to prepare for.

134,Beautiful stay!,"We had a beautiful stay! The hotel was very clean, beautifully decorated, very attentive staff, a very high end feel. The included breakfast was incredible! The location was great, close to the River Thames. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2024,07,18
134,"The ""Best""","Having traveled throughout the world and being a loyal Marriott guest for decades, I can truly say that my stay at the Bankside in London was as excellent as I have ever experienced. Apart from the fact that it is a beautiful property, well-appointed and in a good location, it is the people...the service that made this visit special. Leeza was exceptional. Greeted our party with a smile and bent over backgrounds to provide top-notch service during our entire multi-day stay. Her and her colleagues, from every facet of the operation were courteous, helpful and professional. 

One can't ask for a better experience and I will be certain to return to the Bankside next time I visit London.",5,2024,07,16
134,Book this hotel!,"This was our first visit to London and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for many reasons. The location was an excellent choice centrally located to access all must see highlights, both by foot if you prefer walking or by tube for convenience. A bonus was it was a very quiet refuge after navigating the busy streets with tourists, away from the overcrowded over rated commercial hotels. The staff was amazing and always went out of their way to keep you satisfied. We enjoyed Luigi the bartender and Manuel at the front desk, both extremely friendly & accommodating. The best was the bed, unbelievably comfortable. Beautiful Egyptian linens and comfortable mattress. Highly recommend you book this hotel for your stay!",5,2024,07,12
134,The perfect place for a special occasion,"Booked one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary at The Bankside Hotel as had tickets to a theatre play at The Old Vic which is located within 10 min walk.  
As you enter the hotel you step into a beautiful space designed mostly as an art gallery with the most friendly staff greeting you.
We got an amazing room on the second floor, beautifully decorated for the special occasion, thoughtful messages on the mirrors and greeting cards, and many surprises which made us feel special and pampered.  
Had dinner in the restaurant, the staff was very attentive to our order and received the food cooked exactly to our taste. Very generous breakfast next day with an abundance of options to cover all the preferences. 
Happy to have chosen The Bankside Hotel for our special day and very grateful for all the attention and care received during our stay.",5,2024,07,11
134,Beautiful Boutique London Hotel,"This hotel was one of the best properties I have ever stayed at. The room was equipped with everything (coffee and tea - blanket, water and treats) that was needed and loved the carafes on each floor with filtered water. 

The service of the front desk and staff were top notch!",5,2024,07,11
134,Wow---we loved it!,"My god, this hotel has spoiled me!
You walk in and the check-in desk is a large table. Staff is seated and welcomes you to sit with a big smile! How wonderful after a long flight, a train ride, and a short walk from the station. I will now never understand why all hotels don't do this!

The room was a good size with lots of storage, including drawers and a wardrobe, a large comfortable bed, desk w chair, sitting chair, refrigerator, tv, electric blinds, safe, robes/slippers, tea service and complementary crisps and water. The bathroom was comfortable, with a nice step-in shower (no tub in ours if that's important to you).

We were on the first floor and at first I thought I wanted a higher view of London. After one day, I didn't mind at all, and would request this floor if I returned. We were able to walk a small stair case to beautiful lounge to get to our room and never had to wait for a lift.

There was a water-filling station in the hallway, with cold, still, and sparkling options. They offered wine in the lounge everyday from 17:30-18:30 (5:30-6:30 PM) though we were always out in the city. Fresh fruit was in a bowl by the front door as we left each morning. We used room service once. It was fast and tasty!

Housekeeping was fantastic as was all staff we interacted with. Big shout out to the guy who helped us get a cab--he went above and beyond. Wish I saw his name... In fact, if any manager is reading this, staff who worked from the morning of 20 June- 26 June-- amazing! Big compliments to all front-facing staff in the lobby and those we didn't see in housekeeping! The gentleman who checked us in and the gentleman who took us to our room--wow! You made us feel so welcomed! You all made our trip even better with your kind, attentive service.

Location was fantastic! Right on the Thames! Near various Underground stations, the Borough Market, the London Eye, and more, as well as close enough (we thought) to walk all over the city! 

We stayed in three more hotels in the UK on this trip and the Bankside was definitely the best! Would highly recommend if it's in your price range or if you'd like to treat yourself.",5,2024,07,04
134,The Bankside Hotel is a special place,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff. One of the best if not the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Top to bottom, everyone is professional, courteous and helpful. The entire staff works hard at being efficient, pleasant and helpful no matter what the circumstance. The breakfast buffet is outstanding and the culinary staff and assistants are always there to respond to every request. Shout out to Raquel, Angela and German and to those whose names I inadvertently forgot for making our trip to London special in every way imaginable. Do not hesitate to book this beautiful, art filled hotel surrounded by excellent stores, restaurants, etc. Location is also outstanding so add that to the list of superlatives.",5,2024,07,01
134,Highly recommended!,Excellent service Sebastian in the coffee kiosk first class front of house staff so polite and helpful rooms excellent restaurant staff excellent service food fantastic quality. They remember me by name and have my order ready without even asking.,5,2024,06,26
134,Beyond my expectations!,"My husband and I stayed in London for three nights, and after exploring all of the Marriott options, we decided to stay at Bankside. I was expecting a nice hotel and helpful staff, but our experience was so far beyond that. Each staff member went out of their way to help, from extra waters, to fresh milk and biscuits, to bringing me an adapter, to helping with a  solid last-minute dinner reservation. I know these are things expected at an Autograph hotel, but truly, the friendliness of everyone at the hotel made for the best service we’ve experienced at a Marriott property. Also, it was easy to get to from the airport (the Blackfriars stop is minutes from the hotel), and it was a much quieter neighborhood than if you were to stay north of the river. We would definitely recommend staying here and will be back ourselves!",5,2024,06,25
134,Didnt stay there but had a very positive experience - please read,"While we didnt stay at the hotel, I want to thank Richard and his team for helping my family out during an unfortunate situation. Standing in front of the hotel, my daughter's cell phone was literally swiped out of her hands by a guy on a bike. We went inside and Richard and team sprung into action. They helped us to report the crime on line, called the police and were incredibly supportive. Without them, we would have been lost. (we are from USA). If this is the kind of service people get who arent staying in the hotel, i can only imagine how amazing they are with guests. next time we visit - we are staying there.  (PLEASE WATCH YOUR PHONES - APPARENTLY THIS THEFT IS RAMPANT).",5,2024,06,25
134,Worth every dime.,"Hands down, the best hotel experience I’ve ever had in London. This is my new favourite place to stay. 

The staff (under the direction of Richard the manager) are incredibly attentive and constantly go above and beyond. 

Would highly recommend it.",5,2024,06,22
134,Wonderful place to stay on our first trip to London,"We stayed here on our first trip to London and we had a wonderful experience.  The room was very nice and comfortable.  We had requested a sofa bed and it was set up on arrival.  The bathroom was modern and clean.  Our stay included breakfast at the hotel restaurant and the breakfast buffet was amazing.  Great selection of eggs, breakfast sausage and bacon, grilled tomatoes and mushrooms, pastries and breads; and as much espresso ,coffee and juice that we wanted.  Special mention to our two servers Mersim and Costi.  They attended to our every desire and were very friendly and welcoming.  Also the staff at the front desk were also friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful whenever we had questions about our stay at the hotel or London in general.  Thank you Romeo, Richard, Raquel, and Kasha!  You all made our first trip to London a memorable one and a wonderful experience!",5,2024,06,19
134,Great visit,"Great visit to celebrate my daughter’s college graduation! The hotel is in wonderful location. We were able to walk to the Tube and train station. Several restaurants in walking distance as well. Kasha and Manuel went above and beyond to schedule events and help us during our stay! 
Cannot thank them enough!!",5,2024,06,17
134,Stay here!,"By far the best hotel in London.  All of the amenities... none of the pretense. Incredible rooms, towels, and restaurant. The location was also perfect, especially if you need to traverse all ends of the city.

Milo's especially went way above and beyond during my stay.  This is my new London hotel of choice.",5,2024,06,16
134,One of my favorite hotels,"One of my top 5 favorite hotels in Europe (Is England still in Europe post Brexit*) !

Seriously the staff in this hotel ranks among the best of any hotel I've stayed in worldwide!  Even the man who makes the coffee in the morning (been with the hotel several years I think) always has a smile. 
Rooms are super comfortable, clean, and attractive. 

The little details make a difference and this hotel has them all.   Location is perfect

* the Brexit comment is a joke!",5,2024,06,12
134,Great place,This is an awesome property.  The customer service from the staff -- from the front desk staff to the bell men to the housekeeping staff -- was excellent.  The property is very modern and clean.  The coffee bar is wonderful and the restaurant is good as well.   Would definitely go back on another trip to London.,5,2024,06,09
134,A Truly Great Hotel,"Over the years, we've stayed in many hotels, both in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere around the world. This was one of the nicest. 
    The rooms are clean and well appointed, with good beds and good amenities. The staff is terrific and very helpful. 
    We particulalry liked the fact that members of the staff sit at a big, open table in the lobby instead of inside a plastic cage, so you can really get to know them. 
    The food at the hotel was good, and they also have a free coffee bar where, pretty much any time of the day or night, a staff member will make you your choice of coffee, espresso, tea, etc. etc. 
   The hotel is very well located on the south bank of the Thames, not far from the Tate Modern. You're only half-a-block from Blackfriars Bridge, so you can walk or Uber into the heart of London if you like. It's also only a half-block from the walkway along the South Bank, where there are lot of shops and restaurants, and at the foot of Waterloo Bridge there is an open-air book fair. 
    The next time we're in London, we'll plan to stay at Bankside again.",5,2024,06,08
134,Absolutely Delightful!,"I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and staff.  We loved our stay!  We loved the staff!  They were welcoming from the minute we walked in the door and every morning & evening as we walked through the lobby.  Kasha was so helpful to us in every way and a perfect example of a warm welcome.  She treated us like old friends from the minute we met; she called me by name every time we talked and always asked about our day.  Kasha gave us advice about how to best manage our itinerary.   Manuel did a wonderful job checking us in and making sure we were all set up in our room when we arrived.  We had a great experience from beginning to end.  As we left Mihael gave us a genuinely warm send off.  He helped with our bags, made sure our Uber parked in the perfect place, and even made my children the most delicious hot chocolate on the rainy day.  Bankside, your hotel is lovely, comfortable and welcoming in every way, but your staff makes it absolutely delightful!  A+ to the ladies and gentlemen who represent your hotel; they are top notch!  Don't hesitate to book a stay here; you won't be disappointed.",5,2024,06,06
134,Great hotel,"Very good hotel, excellent staff.  Not the real 5-star luxury from some hotels like the maybourne hotels, redcarnation, goring etc but that is reflected in the price.
Rooms modern and ok, no separate shower which is a minus in my opinion.
Breakfast exceptionally good! Staff and foodwise. Great location as well.
No recognition of marriott status but thats no dealbraker off course. 
Really good choice in its class.",5,2024,06,06
134,When in London only the best will do.,"My wife and I stay mostly in Marriott hotels, and this one is one of the best in our experience.  We were in London to visit our daughter at college.  The room was wonderful, the beds comfortable and the pillows luxurious.  The staff was terrific, especially Manual, who looked after us with special care. Bankside is wonderfully situated for us, near enough to our daughter's college with minimum travel complications and close to many of London's attractions. Bankside will be our stay of choice, from now on, when in London.",5,2024,06,03
134,Best stay in London,"Best hotel I have ever stayed at. The complimentary coffee was absolutely amazing and the service was astonishing. I wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in London. The location was nearby buses and the subway. Practically perfect. Mohammed was wonderful every day we saw him and another receptionist was fantastic at providing restaurant recommendations. The breakfast buffet was truly amazing and the orange juice was jaw dropping. I can’t recommend this place enough. If you happen to visit London, stay here!!!!",5,2024,06,01
134,Stay on Southbank,"Fantastic location, just a few steps away from the Thames with plenty of things to do within a very short distance.

Nearly walked past the hotel as reception looked, from the outside, like a hot-desking office, but once in, the check-in process was v friendly and professional with plenty of (sometimes unusal!) art to catch the eye.

We opted for a family room, with 2 x large beds which was very clean and a great size, especially for the location.

Bed was v comfortable, but sadly we had an issue with the blackout blind and a late check out that was disrupted.

On checking out, the issues were politely highlighted and in my opinion, he couldn't have handled it any more professionally than he did - Fantastic management and a great ambassador for the brand - I will happily return.",4,2024,05,31
134,Bankside in London,"I stayed at Bankside with a friend from 5/6 to 13/24.  We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Kasha.  She is my hero.  In addition to her normal excellent service she even paid for something on her personal credit card for me, after two of my credit cards weren't accepted.  Who does that?????
And when we were leaving she was on the phone and we waved goodbye.  She came out of the hotel to wave goodbye and wish us well.  She is in my heart.

Also would like to mention Mustapha, who was very kind and treated me like a princess.

Thanks to all for a lovely stay.  i want  to come back to London, and you can take no small credit for that.",5,2024,05,28
134,Great stay at Bankside Hotel,"A friend recommended the Bankside Hotel and we could not have been happier.  The staff was all very friendly and welcoming.  Kasha was a stand out.  She remembered  our names after check in making for a more personal experience. As a bonus, we were treated to the breakfast buffet during our stay.  It was very well stocked with fresh fruit, smoked salmon, eggs, bacon, sausage, porridge, baked tomatoes, mushrooms and more.  The night we arrived we were tired and ate in the hotel restaurant and were amazed at how delicious the beetroot burger on a bagel was.  The room was a good size with a very comfortable bed and nice towels.  The hotel provides water, chips and chocolate bars gratis in the mini bar which was a lovely treat.  The location turned out to be very convenient and not as hectic as other spots across the river.  It was an easy walk over the Thames or a quick hop on the Tube or Uber ride.  This hotel was a winner and we will happily return.",5,2024,05,24
134,Amazing,"The rooms were beautiful and had everything you need. 
We booked for my husbands birthday and we were in London for a show and wow. The rooms were so clean with an Amazing view. We love London and always try new places however this hotel was brilliant and we will definitely be returning. 
The staff were very accommodating and we can’t wait to come back.",5,2024,05,19
134,Bankside Autograph Hotel exceeded expectations!,"I don’t normally write reviews, but I had to after a wonderful stay at Bankside Autograph Hotel.  We were warmly greeted after entering the lobby and even offered welcome drinks.  The check-in process was quick, and the bellman was fantastic.  First he helped us with our luggage, then later he escorted us to our room, and he even brought us extra water and snacks.  The room exceeded our expectations.  It was spacious, well appointed, and best of all there were 2 queen beds!  But possibly the best surprise was Guest Services Mgr Leena Mistry.  Leena was knowledgable, helpful, and friendly.  This was our first visit to London, and Leena answered all of my questions.  She even offered restaurant recommendations, and we ate at Founder’s Arms and The Anchor.  We will visit London again and definitely stay at the Bankside Autograph Hotel.",5,2024,05,18
134,Bankside Autograph Collection 5 stars from Start to Finish,"My husband and I just returned from an extended stay at the Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection in London The establishment is 5 stars from start to finish. Let's begin with Kasha in reception. From the very first moment, she became our personal assitant and was there every step of the way to make sure we had the best trip ever. She coordinated an amazing Welcome (it was our anniversary), helped with every little detail from making sure we had almond milk for our coffee to spending a very long time on the phone with a touring company to help finalize our reservations for a day trip outside of the city, She also came in early on the morning with were leaving just to give us a good send off. She is a delightful, fun, intelligent young woman who is going places. The supporting staff were all excellent as well: Raquel in reception, Richard (Manager of Reception,) everyone in reception bending over backwards to help in any way they could. Mihael  seemed to always be there when you needed something, from carrying bags to coffee to pouring wine. Mrsim and Martin gave us outstanding service at breakfast every day. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. Mariana in Housekeeping was so helpful! The rooms are spectacular, so comfortable and chic I wanted to move in. Pillows were so soft and comfortable.  Also the location is just perfect, situated within walking distance right between the National Theatre and Old Globe Theatre. We were able to walk to most destinations in the city, and a short walk to the Tube if we needed it. We look forward to coming back for a return visit. Thank you all!",5,2024,05,17
134,Solid as concrete,Staff friendly. Reception well sized. Location good for The City or South Bank with generous room sizes. But watch out for the rooms which have the concrete frame structure intervening in the space. I had a huge pillar between my bed and my TV… I can imagine a few guests wandering around in the dark finding this a very big challenge…,4,2024,05,16
134,Amazing staff,"The hotel is comfortable and convenient but the best part by far is the extremely friendly and helpful staff. Everyone was great from the restaurant to housekeeping but the front desk staff, especially Gerrian and Kasha, were extraordinary. We look forward to coming back next time.",5,2024,05,15
134,My Favourite London hotel.,"This hotel is amongst the best I have stayed in worldwide.The rooms are modern, and I have every imaginable ammenity. Staff is super friendly and kind from the front desk to the people in the restaurant at breakfast.
Lady at front desk was very kind, helping me print a document for a game I am attending.
I will continue to recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues staying in London. Thank you again..",5,2024,05,11
134,Gem,"It’s a gem hiding between the tall buildings in the area. Impeccable amenities, team and service. The rooms are modern interior, comfortable size, and calming decoration. There is art everywhere - love coming here. The  team is exceptionally helpful.",5,2024,05,10
134,Fantastic,"Had the pleasure of staying at Bankside in May. We were there with both family and friends. What a delightful experience! We arrived in the morning after flying all night and they were able to accommodate us by having the room ready. We were met by Manuel who was fantastic. Very kind, provided breakfast. Mihael took care of the bags and provided water. The service levels provided throughout our visit, especially from Manuel was just terrific. Rooms were very clean and tidy. Finally, met Kasha who made the conclusion of our stay from checkout to reserving a taxi to the airport only reinforced  why we’ll be back!",5,2024,05,08
134,You must stay here!,"The Bankside Hotel was amazing!  From the moment we were greeted by the Lobby staff, we knew the service would be outstanding. Manull was extremely attentive and helped us surprise our friends with a special “Welcome to London”  gift. In addition, Mihaez was always helpful and made certain we had whatever we needed during our stay. 

I cannot praise the service enough. Manull was invaluable.   He and his team were always able to  provide assistance  with whatever request we had, from calling cabs to directions to the tube to dinner suggestions. 

Breakfast was delicious at the hotel  and the wait staff were quick and extremely personable. We enjoyed a night cap at the bar every evening and truly enjoyed our interactions. Finally, the  level of cleanliness at the hotel was the best I have experienced in a long time. Everything was clean and very well maintained. It felt like home. 

I would recommend this hotel for any type of stay in London. I will definitely return here.",5,2024,05,07
134,Bankside Hotel,We loved our stay at Bankside!  It is such a clean area with great places to go close by!  We took the Southwark subway and it was close and easy to use.  The location is great!  The atmosphere in the hotel is wonderful and the service was friendly and exceptional!  We will be back!,5,2024,05,06
134,Fantastic hotel for family of 4,"This hotel is worth the 5-start average review on Trip advisor. We are a family of 4 staying at a 2 Queen bed room for 2 nights. It’s very hard to even find 2 Queen beds in London without paying huge amount and we had a great experience. 

Here are some highlights:

1. Large room with modern facilities - this is a very new hotel and reflected in the size of the room, comfort in bathroom and modern electronics (plenty of plugs, usb charging, lights etc)

2. Excellent customer service - front desk offered my daughter a cute fox toy, offered us umbrella when it was raining outside, always kind and professional 

3. Great breakfast - affordable and high quality. As Platinum we also get 2 adult for free, totally worth it

The location is not in the central area (last time we stayed on Piccadilly), so it’s not as convenient to all the touristy zones. 

We will be back, thank you!!",5,2024,04,29
134,Amazing Autograph Hotel!,"As experienced travelers, we’ve stayed at many Autograph Hotels as well as similar hotels over the years. Hands down, this is the very best experience we’ve ever had! This is a top-notch hotel with remarkable customer service, cleanliness, and accommodations, and “culture.” In terms of customer service, the staff all “leaned in” to make our stay personable and enjoyable—front desk, breakfast service, housekeeping—very professional and at the same time eager to make our stay memorable. (I’ll call out four individuals who were exceptional every day of our 5-night stay:  Tsvetelina, Mercim, Manuel, and Sasha.) The Bankside Hotel is our new favorite London hotel! BTW, we usually stay closer to the theatre and shopping areas of London, but the Bankside Hotel is a perfect location for river walks, trendy restaurants and cafes, and it’s a straight shot to those areas on the Circle Line which you can p/u virtually across the street from the hotel. Also, the great bus lines are within a few steps. One final thing to mention is that the breakfast option is well, well worth it. You’ll be offered a great English breakfast, breads, yogurts, jams, eggs, specialty coffees, etc. in a buffet setting, along with very attentive table service. It’s a terrific way to start a fun day in London!",5,2024,04,25
134,Great stay!,Kasha at the front desk was amazing! She helped us with directions to wherever we needed to go. She sold us hop on hop off tickets and helped us plan our day. She also gave me an adapter when mine didn’t work. Mihael was so helpful with our luggage and showing us our room and its amenities. We had a wonderful stay!,5,2024,04,22
134,Exceptional,"There are many things to recommend about this new hotel. I have been to London many times and this was my first stay at the Bankside (I do have Marriot Platinum status).

The hotel and rooms are new, modern and immaculate. The shower was great and the bed comfortable and along with the blackout curtains (motorized) we slept great for our entire 8 night stay. The breakfast buffet was quite good with lots of healthy choices as well as the usual pancakes, bacon etc...

What really made this experience outstanding was the level of customer service. It was obvious the staff was trained well and focused on the guest experience. I want to especially single out the concierges James and Richard for their attention to detail and making sure all of our needs were taken care of. Also I must mention Mustafa-I almost wanted to tell him to stop doing things for us. He consistently went over and above to make sure we were well taken care of. 

I really enjoyed the South Bank/Southwark area as well The entrance is on a quiet street without the typical crowds of tourists milling about. The area is mostly business/residential but it's very easy to get anywhere in London as Waterloo Station is just a 10 minute walk and two other tube stations nearby. The hotel will also arrange to have a taxi waiting out front if you need or you can walk a block and get one yourself. There are a decent amount of dining options nearby but that's never really an issue in London anyway. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel-especially if you don't want to be in a hyper busy area.",5,2024,04,14
134,Excellent,"The hotel offered outstanding accommodations, and the staff exhibited exceptional hospitality. Our room was meticulously clean and organized. We look forward to a future return visit. We were fortunate to experience favorable weather conditions.",5,2024,04,13
134,Great Family stat,"We had a great time staying at the hotel, very comfortable rooms with space for the 4 of us. Breakfast was great and even offered wine during the weekday evenings.

Location is right in the middle of everything so super convenient starting point for the day.",5,2024,04,13
134,Great stay,"Great, warm staff who went out of their ways to help us. Beautiful and fun art. Awesome breakfast.

Very convenient location and great for running or walking along the river. The beds were very comfortable so it was easy to get a good night’s sleep.",5,2024,04,13
134,Perfect Stay at the Bankside!,"The Bankside is an incredible hotel on the South Bank and we will definitely be returning guests! We loved the style of the hotel, the thoughtfulness of the rooms, and the classy, modern aesthetic. We were given a very generous upgrade and very much enjoyed hanging out in the room at the beginning and the end of very busy days visiting friends and family and eating and drinking! One touch I loved was the reusable water carafes that they leave in your room and then you can refill them at water stations located in the hallway of your floor. A simple but elegant solution and one which I hope that other hotels incorporate!

The staff was incredibly responsive and thoughtful, even before we checked in! I appreciated the easy communication. Everyone was warm and welcoming, upon check in and out, and throughout the stay. We popped in after a long day to have a nightcap and snacks at the restaurant downstairs and we chatted with the woman who took our order (I think her name was Mela?). We briefly talked about our beer preferences and she recommended an alehouse down the road, taking the time to write down the information for us. So kind! She, and all of the staff, were super great!

The breakfast was delicious! It included a full English breakfast spread, but then had other offerings: warm bread, smoked salmon, fresh fruit and yogurt, salad, baked goods, and more. Everything was fresh and there was frequent turnover to keep it that way.

We absolutely LOVED the location, given that it was just a few minutes’ walk from the Tate, at least a couple of tube stations, and just across Blackfriars Bridge from the other neighborhoods we frequented. 

We will definitely be returning to the Bankside and plan on making this our home base in London!",5,2024,04,09
134,Excellent hotel and staff,"We had a wonderful three nights stay at the Bankside Hotel. It is clean and modern and a somewhat funky hotel with lots of style. The room was very nice and the breakfast was excellent. 
The hotel is well located for sightseeing and the Blackfriars tube station is just across the river and easy to access. 
Special thanks to Leena who went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable, even helping us to sign up for and use Uber. She was constantly kind and thoughtful throughout our stay.
We will return!",5,2024,04,07
134,Gem of a hotel in London!,"Outstanding hotel - staff are amazing, food is great, location is perfect. Have stayed here many times for work and I keep coming back. Richard their front of house manager always remembers my name and his team just offer the best service. Thank you!",5,2024,04,07
134,"Friendly, cheerful and helpful staff..","Very friendly, helpful and cheerful staff. While checking in, Richard and Stephanie  pointed the nearby attractions and the best time to visit them. They helped us with converting some cash. Breakfast was too good. Front desk helped us with moving the luggage. As it is closer to several attractions, we could reach majority of attractions with 10-14£ Uber fare. Water fountains in the corridor, artistic touch and good gym are other highlights.Best in class experience overall.. Thank you Bankside..",5,2024,04,06
134,Pleasant stay!,"It was great staying at Bankside hotel. The staff was veryy friendly! Miss Leena Mistry was extremely helpful and sweet. 
Our room was clean and had an amazing view.! It was a nice environment and very comfortable. 
It was a pleasant stay for me and my mom 🫶",5,2024,03,25
134,Spectacular throughout,"Spectacular hotel, the staff are superb and we absolutely loved the reception area and check in - very relaxed, informal, like walking into a lovely museum. Great room, beautifully decorated throughout, lovely thoughtful extras - offer of a drink on check in, water, crisps and chocolate in the room. Superb from start to finish and the location doesn’t get any better. Cannot wait to return.",5,2024,03,24
134,Great hotel and friendly staff!,"My wife and I stayed here for a few nights and loved it. The staff is very friendly and attentive to your needs. Especially Mustafa who helped us use their phone to call our airline, when our flight got changed. The hotel is also very clean and chic. Thanks for the great experience!",5,2024,03,24
134,Fabulous Hotel,"We had a fabulous time at Bankside Hotel, autograph collection. 
Everyone was so welcoming and friendly as soon as we arrived. The room was beautiful and spotless. I loved the little added extra in the rooms and bathrooms, Gorgeous products. 
Motorised blinds were great especially for a little lie in if needed. 
The breakfast was devine and The staff went above and beyond and We’ll 100% be back.
I would love to be looked after/greeted like this in every hotel I go to",5,2024,03,22
134,Amazing experience at Bankside!,"We booked our trip through Costco Travel (which I highly recommend) so we had done website research on Bankside but were otherwise unfamiliar with it. The instant we walked in the door we were greeted by James who sat down with us, offered water/coffee/tea, walked us through the reservation, and made us feel welcomed. The check in isn’t a traditional hotel front desk but a large table/desk with agents and guests seated. It was a unique experience and one I’d like to see at more hotels. 

Our room was very clean and comfortable…it felt cleaner than comparable hotels in the US and the towels are “bath sheets”, bigger and better than regular bath towels. The beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was outstanding. Locally sourced eggs, bacon and sausage with a kitchen staff ready to cook menu items as well. We also had room service one night, chicken caesar salad and a burger. The food was very good but room service is usually overpriced and this was no exception (24 pounds for the burger which is about 15 pounds at local restaurants). 

The Bankside’s location in central London is great…it’s not even a block from the Thames and walking distance to the Eye, Big Ben, Hyde Park and other attractions. It’s also just across the river from Blackfriers Tube stop. Don’t get a taxi or Uber, take the Tube! 

Overall, the Bankside is five stars…very friendly and helpful staff, clean rooms, delicious breakfast, and a great location. We definitely recommend and will return.",5,2024,03,21
134,Very nice friendly hotel,"Hotel on the Southbank which is an interesting area to wander around.  Great welcome at Reception which is an informal table with seating.  All hotel information was given including a wine hour 5-6pm on the mezzanine (maybe because of the level of room I had, I’m not sure).  Water and fruit in Reception area.  Efficient lifts and very nice room, comfortable bed, great shower.  Night lights.  Good blackout blinds.  Very easy checkout - it was a pleasure to stay there.",5,2024,03,21
134,Great Stay on the South Bank,"The hotel is modern, clean and comfortable. The location is walkable to many attractions and public transportation. The restaurant is excellent and the staff there - especially Mersim - were attentive, helpful and super friendly every day over a 10 day stay.  I would highly recommend the Bankside hotel for your next trip to London",5,2024,03,21
134,Great Staff team; Fantastic for gluten free breakfast,"The team of staff in this hotel are amazing-so helpful, friendly and proactive .  On arrival we were given champagne by Mustafa, he also took our luggage to our room ; he  independently wrote a list of nearby restaurants with gluten free food (because he heard me discussing it with the very helpful Michaela at reception) ;he went out to Waitrose nearby to get us a particular food item we wanted and instantly organised a very efficient maintenance man to solve a minor problem with the room's blackout blinds. All within 20 minutes of our arrival!
Breakfast was fantastic every day (we stayed 4 nights) in a spacious, calm and attractive restaurant. Since I am gluten free the staff made sure my breakfast was prepared in the kitchen rather than risk any cross-contamination in the buffet area. Special mention to Mersim, who is just fantastic at his job, so attentive and helpful in recommending dishes. The chefs are also great  - delicious perfectly cooked Eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs with mushrooms, overnight oats, Shakshuka. I was also given gf croissants. My husband ate from the excellent buffet.",5,2024,03,19
134,You will love this hotel!,Wonderful hotel with the nicest staff. Lovely second floor living Barry which feels like your own living room. Breakfast buffet is yummy and has a nice variety. We had corner attention with spacious bathroom. Hope to stay again soon. Omar catered to everything we needed!,5,2024,03,19
134,Great experience,"The rooms are clean and well-appointed. The service is genuine and exceptional. It's our 2nd time to stay here and we'll be back for a 3rd for sure.

I'd like to give a special mention to Mustafa Omar. He's been very helpful and attentive to our needs during our stay.",5,2024,03,19
134,"Great staff, especially Mustafa and Marsim","Mustafa and Marsim were both wonderful and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Staffs friendly and kind, location convenient, breakfast is fantastic. Solid gym, great breakfast. Good for business travelers and for family, close to the major sights.",5,2024,03,18
134,Amazing service and hotel,"Best Marriott I have ever stayed in. Amazing hotel and with excellent service. Definitely plan to stay again. The staff was attentive and went above and beyond. The rooms were well-designed, extremely clean, and comfortable. The location was central",5,2024,03,16
134,The Best Hotel and The Best People!,"This is the best hotel in London, and one of the best I’ve ever stayed at in the world. I’ve been traveling globally for about 30 years. In particular, the team of people are exceptional. In the restaurant, Andrea, Sebastian, Kostadin, and Dimbu are both kind and attentive and they make me feel at home every time It it’s exactly the same at the front desk with Richard and his team treating me as a friend every time I show up.  I’m probably forgetting some names but James and Mikayla and Raquel are really special and their ability to make a guest feel valued.",5,2024,03,16
134,Good lunch,We had a very nice lunch (2nd time this week) lovely grilled salmon fillet (with choice of how well cooked you want it) with crunchy broccoli and a good rocket salad. Previously (earlier this week) had a good Niçoise salad. (Fresh tuna… although could have had a little more tuna). Great service by Mersin. Very informative and friendly. Thank you Mersin,5,2024,03,15
134,Such a Beautiful Hotel!,"More details and family-friendly reviews on my blog 'The Frenchie Mummy' and on Instagram @thefrenchiemummy. So Google it and have a look there too. Merci!

Definitely one of the best hotels we stayed in London. Nothing could be too much for the staff. It was lovely to be greeted with a drink when we checked out.

The room was beautiful and spacious with lovely touches. It's also a great idea to have water stations on each floor to refill your bottle!

The restaurant is gorgeous and both the food and service was impeccable!
I could not recommend it more and it's also located in such a beautiful part of London!

Thank you so much for having us and being so welcome to our family!",5,2024,03,15
134,One of the best hospitality experiences,"This hotel was absolutely perfect from the minute we arrived. The staff is so friendly & accommodating. It feels like a small hotel because we saw the same faces during the 4 nights of our stay & they recognized us as well. Front desk staff helped me to book tours & plan my itinerary throughout my stay. Stephanie, Kasha & Manuel were helpful & always greeted me with a smile. Breakfast buffet was delicious & a value as it included specialty coffees & made to order eggs along with all the buffet items. The staff in the bar & restaurant were outstanding as well. The rooms were very clean, spacious & comfortable. Coffee, tea & snacks were nice. Overall the hotel exceeded our expectations, but what pleased me the most was the exceptional hospitality of the staff. They really made us feel welcomed & at home.",5,2024,03,14
134,Great staff,"Great hotel, 0 complaints. The standout was the staff and their friendliness. Specials thanks to Sebastian, Kostedin for always being ready to help. The hotel should give you all a promotion and a raise, it’s good to cultivate great staff.",5,2024,03,14
134,Overnight stay,"This is a great hotel.
Decor. Comfort. Service (shout out to Manuel who checked us in. And out. He was excellent and made everything lovely).
Didn't try the food, so can't comment.
I used the gym this morning. That was fun! All the equipment is modern (unlike my gym at home).",5,2024,03,12
134,"Don't wait, Book your stay here!","Every single part of the stay was absolutely amazing. I've been a member of the hospitality industry in a leadership role and this is what you expect from a staff. Everyone was welcoming, polite and engaging and it actually seemed genuine as opposed to a scripted feel. The staff was extremely cohesive and worked well with each other. Seeing this actually made me think of rejoining the industry to give the feeling to guests that I felt with my stay. As far as the hotel itself. Perfect! Up to date, prime location to great landmarks for sightseeing, and shirt uber rides to other areas for dining and such. The rooms were state if the art technology wise and well kept and comfortable. Atmosphere and ambience were perfect for relaxation, the restaurant is a nice setting far beyond typical hotel dining. It can stand as it's own entity separate from the hotel. They have an amazing art gallery and each space in the hotel is unique and beautiful. You can tell the decor throughout was carefully thought out. I can go on for days about this hotel experience but im sure you get the gist. Do yourself a favor and book it! Again big shout out to the entire staff for the amazing experience  I dont remember every name but I know they were all great. Special thanks to Mihael and Manuel also Elaina (spell check) from the night cleaning crew who help me reassemble a pegged seat when I thought I lost my room key in there. It was in my sock smh. I stayed from March 7- March 11 2024 so anyone who worked then....HATS OFF TO YOU, YOU'RE AMAZING! I forgot to say they also treated my 5 year old son with the utmost respect at any chance they encountered him. Royal treatment indeed. They even gifted him 2 vehicles at check in. I wish I could remember all of the names. Oh yeah I was excited about the resealable cans of water!🤣",5,2024,03,11
134,Great place to stay in London,"January 5th through 11th, 2024. 6 nights. It was very pleasant to stay in this hotel except for the dining. The diner food was not very good and expensive. We didn't try breakfast food at all. Walked to the Cote restaurant located next to St. Paul for breakfast every morning. Otherwise the hotel was excellent.",5,2024,03,09
134,A Warm Welcome - Always,"A return visit to this fabulous hotel with hubby and two adult daughters. We love The Bankside - from the super-warm reception from the Front Desk team to the uber-cool artwork around the hotel. The rooms are spacious and welcoming and the beds ultra comfortable. 
Breakfast is a good buffet or your choice of a la carte - served by smiley staff in a contemporary bar/restaurant setting. 
The hotel is both chic and comfortable (love the mezzanine level) with a team who always offer guests a genuine welcome. 
Can’t wait to go back!",5,2024,03,08
134,Spectacular hotel experience!,"From the second I stepped into the lobby for the unique lounge-like check-in experience, to the moment I checked out the experience at Bankside hotel was simply fabulous. The rooms were spacious and the bathrooms very modern and beautiful. The quality of the breakfast buffet was far above most 5 star hotels. The staff was so attentive and friendly the entire stay felt almost unreal. This was a vacation trip with my two sisters but ww all agreed that we would stay at the Bankside hotel for business as well in the future. Kasha - special thanks to you for making us feel so welcome at the hotel and taking such good care of us.",5,2024,03,06
134,A superb hotel!,"This hotel exceeded all of our expectations! The hotel itself is gorgeous, the art is curated with taste and adds another dimension to the hotel. The location is great - 15min walking from the London Eye and great metro connections. Finally, the service and staff are just outstanding! The attention to details and the kindness of every person there makes you feel so special and welcome. We would give 6 stars if we could.",5,2024,03,04
134,"Lots of character, charm, and art in a great location",Wonderful boutique hotel with lots of art and character. Super helpful staff and great breakfast. My boys loved it and wanted to come back often during the day just to rest a bit. Location was also a plus as we were close enough to walk to most places we wanted to see.,5,2024,03,03
134,Wonderfull Gem on the  Right by the Themes,This new hotel is full of surprises.  Locals come to walk around and look at the art and dine in the fine restaurant.  The rooms filled with art.  Upscale but quirky and surprising.  In the center of things.  This is definitely our favorite hotel in London,5,2024,03,02
134,Just Amazing!,"Out of all the Marriott Autograph Collections I have stayed at, this was the most beautiful, amazing staff and clean hotel I have stayed. From the welcome drinks when we checked in, to moving rooms around when a member of our party was unwell and needed to stay an extra night, I cannot recommend this hotel enough. When I return to London, I will make it a point to stay here again.",5,2024,03,01
134,Great find!,"This is my new favorite hotel in London. The people are super friendly, the breakfast was delicious, and the room was lovely and very quiet. I will be returning! I was upgraded to a king room. It was very comfortable in spacious. I do not know what the other rooms were like. The only small room for improvement would be the gym because it was a little too small for the size of the hotel.",5,2024,03,01
134,Fully recommended,"Great experience and big kudos to Maia, who was very helpful at getting me set up and address some business logistics that needed to be handled. Rooms in very good shape and business lounge was exceptional to get work done. Restaurant was also very convenient.",5,2024,02,29
134,10/10 stay at this beautiful hotel - staff were impeccable.,"Absolutely amazing hotel. Definitely the best Marriott stay my partner and I have ever had! So so beautiful, with amazing art -and decor everywhere!
Although the hotel itself is impeccably clean and the decor is amazing, what made our stay was the lovely staff. The staff are incredible to say the least, going absolutely above and beyond to accommodate for anything needed throughout our stay. My partner and I said we felt like we were treated like ‘Kings and Queens’.
A special mention to Mustafa and Kasha who were extremely personable, kind and genuinely lovely people to be around - all the way from the start of our stay right until we checked out, constantly asking if we needed any help with anything at all, nothing was asking too much and they truly made our experience in the hotel perfect, it’s a shame we were only there for one night, we could’ve stayed forever!
Also a mention to Joanna, who hosted the free wine hour and was again lovely, so easy to talk to and made us feel so comfortable .

The room was amazing, not to mention the fact that we were surprisingly upgraded, (again, due to the lovely staff!!) The bed, pillows and blackout blinds were some of our favourite parts about our room, not to mention the lovely bathroom and decor (again).

Just overall an absolutely amazing stay and we will definitely, definitely be returning (for the staff alone), what a lovely, lovely night we had in this hotel and we would just like to thank everyone for their genuine kindness and hopsitality :)",5,2024,02,28
134,Highly recommended,"The staff at Bankside is top class. I have stayed at many boutique hotels and this place ranks at top of the list. The amenities, work space and overall comfort makes it worth staying here and experience enjoyable. 

Special thanks to Mustafa Omar, Raquel, Leena, Olga and the rest of the staff for making me feel at home. Hope to be back soon!",5,2024,02,28
134,Worth it,"Really nice hotel , the rooms were very spacious and clean ,the  staff they were very friendly and professional really we enjoyed our stay , from the check in to the check out it was such an amazing experience , definitely coming back next time .",4,2024,02,26
134,Good hotel …could make even better.,"Hotel well situated and easily accessible/ Rooms well equipped and up to date. Just a pity there no possibility to open any windows so the air is very dry. Plugs not very convenient if you want to use shaver or hair dryer front of mirror. 
Overall clean, efficient wifi, nice bar and restaurant. 
Staff on the 1rst evening was very good, Sacha (not sure if the name) was amazing. The other days the breakfast staff was not really friendly and not very well organized. Same for front office staff they are constantly sitting and on their screen so forget to get a simple « hello » as they don’t see you when you pass through the lobby area. 
Breakfast buffet on Sunday was very disappointing, all was empty at 9:30am and almost none of the staff react on this! So to conclude good hotel but staff need better training to focus on details that make the difference in a real autograph collection.",4,2024,02,26
134,Incredible Stay,"My second stay at the Bankside was excellent. From the second we walked through the door we were greeted by friendly and welcoming staff. Beer on arrival was an added bonus! And Mustafa being a fellow Liverpool fan made it even better. YNWA 
Also a big thank you to Angela and Kesha!!",5,2024,02,26
134,Best Hotel south of the river,"Came for a weekend in london with friends. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel like family, James and Manuel were sensational and made sure we were looked after throughout our stay. They gave us great recommendations and the entire team were amazing. Great location, amazing hotel and even better service",5,2024,02,25
134,Above all my expectations!,"We absolutely adore staying at The Bankside, this is our second time in four months. This trip specifically, was even more memorable thanks to one of the Managers, Mohammed Hassan. Since our first visit Mohammed has treated us like family. This time he really outdid himself. I wanted to gift my son tickets to watch Arsenal play and we could not find any. Mohammed asked his concierge department and got the tickets for us and to make it even more special he even got my sons Arsenal scarves for the game. The tickets were phenomenal but what made it extra special was his attention to detail knowing what we like and appreciate. Bankside is my absolute favourite hotel and each time I come what differentiates it from any other hotel is its staff and how happy they are doing what they do, again, treating guests like family. We will be back again and again and I highly recommend Bankside to everyone. And to Mohammed, we are eternally grateful for making us so happy!!",5,2024,02,25
134,5 Star Hotel That Exceeded All Expectations,"Recently, I visited London and I chose the Bankside based on the stellar reviews. The Bankside more than delivered on all accounts and I will be back. 

From the moment I arrived I was warmly welcomed and made to feel at home. James and Kasha went above and beyond ensuring my stay was an absolute pleasure. 

Additionally, the porters, housekeeping, and the restaurant staff were also phenomenal and always friendly.

Last, but certainly not least, the rooms and the premises are modern and very stylish. I did not want for anything and felt very comfortable. The location is convenient to the underground and is also walkable to many restaurants, theaters, and bars too. 

I could go on and on but suffice to say you really should stay at The Bankside you won’t be disappointed.",5,2024,02,25
134,Amazing Customer Service.,"Had an issue with my reservation and Mohammed was exceptional. Wasn't sure if the issue would be handled, but he handled my issue with care and efficacy.  The customer service overall was amazing. I will definitely stay here again when visiting London. 10/10",5,2024,02,25
134,"I am 65 years old, world traveler & must say that this was my best Hotel stay ever!😊😊😊","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 6 stars for Hospitality!

Bankside, it’s so difficult to write positive reviews about you as I need
 FULL DAY TO WRITE ABOUT YOU ALL. So I thought , let me quickly just point out the flaws I noticed but I wasted whole day & couldn’t think of even one. 
I was there for 7 days, from different country but felt more than home here.

Noticed you ALL work as a team with beautiful smiles on your faces & treat everyone the same.

One of the best locations close to many famous attractions of London , best service , good food, best quality bed for good night sleep, spacious rooms. Water fountain on every floor was really a good idea. 
Thank you ALL for your hospitality and for making us feel so welcome. We can't thank the hotel employees enough for their kindness , best polite behavior, they were beyond our expectations. 

Stephany , the cup of tea you offered me when I needed the most , I remember you got up from your desk & came with a cup of hot tea . 

 Sorry, for forgetting the  names of all out there. 
 CANNOT PICK ONE OVER OTHER AS COMPLETE STAFF IS COMMENDABLE.
  Hope to visit you soon.
  Best wishes - Katyals",5,2024,02,24
134,Great hotel in a convenient location,Great hotel in a very convenient location.  Great room layout. The bed was extremely comfortable. Great staff.  The breakfast buffet was good and they provided gluten free options for my wife.  Easy access to multiple underground stations.,5,2024,02,24
134,5 Star Experience on a budget!,"This hotel is lovely, clean, and the staff is very helpful! Now for the review...

Location: Do not go to London without an itinerary #1, but #2 even with your itinerary everything will more than likely be spread out, sooooo don't overly fixate on where your hotel is because you will be Ubering everywhere as if you work for them LOL. THIS hotel is perfect IF you do not want to spend all of your $ on hoteling, but still want a great stay! There are restaurants, bars, stores, parks, and gyms all in walkable distance, so if you like walking this is perfect for you.

Rooms: The rooms are clean and modern, the bathrooms are small which is normal for London, but needless to same the rooms were clean and comfortable.

Food: I didn't have one meal on property, but there are tons of restaurants and stores around hence why I didn't.

Staff: 10 out of 10, everyone was helpful and extremely attentive which I loved!

Small Hotel: I loved the fact the hotel is not large, so I did not have to walk all over creation as my mother says lol to get where I'm trying to go. Literally it would take me 1 minute to get to my room and 1 minute to get out.

Gym: It's small, but gets the job done, but there's also a gym adjacent to the hotel with classes you can check out as well.

Give this place a try for a 5 star experience on a budjet!",5,2024,02,22
134,Wonderful! - and staff that go above and beyond with the kindest hearts! Family's read this one!,"We stayed at the hotel during the last weekend of half term, myself, my husband and our two daughters. The hotel is beautiful, artistic, luxurious and homely at the same time. The rooms lovely and the beds were so comfortable.
We were looked after so well by the staff everywhere - front desk, waiting staff, porters - all were friendly and so helpful.
However - disaster struck when we got home and realised my daughters precious Hippo teddy Moomba had been left behind at the hotel. I called and thankfully he had been found. The wonderful Mustafa said he would send Moomba straight away back to us and we were so grateful. Moomba arrived today after having had quite the adventure! A postcard detailing the fun he had was enclosed along with multiple photos of Moomba at the gym, in the kitchen cooking, working the front desk and generally having a brilliant time were enclosed. I cannot tell you the joy this has brought my daughter! And what an amazing team to do this. Pure kindness and they have secured my families business whenever we are in London from now on! So much effort and kindness.
Bankside - Thank you!!!!!!!!!",5,2024,02,21
134,Wonderful Hotel,"We had an amazing visit at Bankside.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff is amazing, especially Richard who is incredibly helpful and thoughtful.  Bankside is also in a great location in walking distance to all the sites, several tube stations and great restaurants.  We will be back soon.",5,2024,02,20
134,An Amazing Hotel Close to Everything!,"I had a fantastic stay at the Bankside Hotel earlier this month (Feb 2024) and if I were able, I would probably choose this hotel again. As a Bonvoy member, I did a ton of research on London Marriott properties and this one kept rising to the top of each list. Having stayed there for four nights, I can see why. To help, I'll organize my review into three parts: people, accommodations, and location.

People: It all started at check-in with German, who got me settled in to my room. We had a minor issue with the first room, but it was resolved quickly and efficiently with no additional hiccups. German was a star, and every time I entered or left the hotel, we greeted each other by name. It's small touches like that which tells you about the quality of the staff and how much they enjoy their vocation. And that joy is then transferred to the guest. That's how hospitality works and the Bankside is full of capable, professional, and caring staff members. I had them make me a list so I wouldn't forget. In addition to German, there was Manuel, Raquel, and Michaela, who all made my stay memorable and enjoyable. Business travel can sometimes be a drag, but with these employees making one feel like they're a part of an extended family, it almost gets to a point where you want the stay to continue! The people here really do make the difference. I know I'm leaving a few out, such as those in the dining area, but everyone contributed in so many ways.

Next, accommodations. The Bankside is immaculately clean and well-kept. Housekeeping did an amazing job with my room and kept it as pristine as when I first entered. The entire property, from lobby to restaurant to bar is modern, trendy, and posh, but in a way that makes you feel as though you've found an eclectic secret in London. The bed was extremely comfortable, thermostat easy to use and understand, and bathrooms spacious and well-lit. A nice added touch are the water stations on each hallway. My room was plenty big for a London hotel, but I imagine the larger rooms are even better!

And finally, location. The Bankside is as the name suggests, in the Bankside area near Blackfriars Tube and ThamesLink stations. It's incredibly convenient to Borough Market, London Eye, City of London, Tower Bridge, etc. and walkable to all of those sights. It is tucked far enough off the main road that noise is not an issue. If you decide not to eat at their delightful restaurant, there are tons of choices nearby, from pubs to fine dining. 

I would absolutely stay here again based on the location and the cleanliness, but the people really make this place an amazing choice when in London. The reviews are so accurate. You will not go wrong here. Philip and his team of hospitality experts on staff will turn your stay into an amazing time. Hope to see them again soon.",5,2024,02,19
134,Excellent hotel - just room for improvement at breakfast.,This hotel is beautifully modern in its decor with thoughtful layout in the bedrooms.  Rooms and bathrooms are immaculately clean as are hotel’s common areas.  Polite and efficient staff.  Breakfast is provided in the adjacent restaurant which is a pleasant space however the buffet breakfast offering (as so often of late in very many Marriott hotels) was rather underwhelming with a lack of range in the cereal offering with no granola or porridge (available on a la carte menu only) and a v small offering of dried fruit and nuts which lacked variety.  The cooked buffet offering rather dried out & insipid (especially sausages) and was not overly hot.  We paid £18 each for the buffet breakfast and it was not worth that price.  Aside from the disappointing breakfast the hotel is somewhere I’d definitely return as the hotel is nicely located and is of a v high standard for the price and location.,4,2024,02,17
134,Pleasant Stay,"Overall the hotel is very good. Front desk team were really professional and helpful. 
There is only one resturant in the hotel which limits the food variety. The resturant was good in-term of the staff friendliness but nothing impressive on the menu whether its breakfast , lunch or dinner. Room was clean. Gym not really good enough.",4,2024,02,16
134,very comfortable stay at Bankside.,"I stayed at Bankside hotel last week,  5thFebruary 2024. From the minute we walked in the atmosphere was cosy and welcoming. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were greeted by a lovely guy at the desk called James (I think) who checked us in and took care of all our needs. I loved our room which was very comfortable and spotless. I slept like a log. Breakfast next morning was delicious and plentiful with courteous staff attending to us. We were able to walk easily to everywhere we wanted to visit. Although there is a tube station 5 minutes away, we never used it. We walked every where.I would readily recommend this hotel to any of my friends.",5,2024,02,13
134,Another happy experience,"Returned to this hotel with a friend on this occasion.  From the moment you step through the door you feel welcome and there is such a nice relaxed feeling emanting from the hotel staff.
The room was perfect.  The breakfast offering was delightful.
Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2024,02,12
134,A perfect “Arty” get away,"I was in London for a business trip and I was triggered by the hotels location and art affiliation. I was very impressed by the overall design, very helpful staff and a surprisingly good restaurant.

My room was very comfortable and provided all I needed. 

Overall great price and quality ratio …",5,2024,02,11
134,Perfect little staycation!,"I frequent the restaurant Art Yard quite often, and decided to stay a weekend in the hotel! And wasn't disappointed! :) The rooms are beautifully designed and decorated, clean and comfortable, and the team is lovely and attentive. Thank you for a nice and pampered stay.",5,2024,02,11
134,Terrific hotel.,"My husband and I just got back from a lovely two night stay.  Everything about this hotel is great.  The staff at check in were welcoming and extremely efficient.  The first thing you will notice is that the entire hotel is immaculate.  The beds are extremely comfortable and there is a nice assortment of pillows.  The hotel does not skimp on towels.  There were more than enough for your needs.  Great tea selection in the room.  The women who serviced our room each night for turn down service were friendly, kind and again very efficient.  The hotel hosted a one hour wine party the first night we arrived.  My husband had a call during that time so I popped down alone.  The woman pouring was very kind and friendly.  Breakfast had a wide assortment of food on the buffet and there was a separate menu if you wanted to order something different.  The elevators in the building are also quick.  Never waited more than a few seconds.  The hotel is very well managed.  Anything you need is delivered immediately.  In short, this is a lovely, hotel with a modern vibe.  We plan to go back.  My one bit of warning is that our taxi dropped us at a hotel down the street.  The sign outside this hotel is easy to miss in the dark. So make sure you have the address handy.",5,2024,01,28
134,Best of Autograph Collection,"This is a very modern, well appointed hotel with all the benefits and perks of being a Marriott property. Each floor had a water refill station which was unique and welcomed. Gym was a bit small but had a Smith machine, weights up to around 40 lbs and some cardio machines.  Breakfast was at the attached restaurant and offered a very nice Buffett or a menu option with excellent coffee. If you are a status member with Marriott your perks will go far here. Staff was friendly and helpful!",5,2024,01,23
134,Beautiful and central to everything,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service, breakfast was great. The hotel is located very close to Blackfriars bridge and centrally located. Staff was incredibly helpful with all our needs. Room was spacious, comfortable with many small touches for our enjoyment. Quality hotel.",5,2024,01,22

134,Excellent.  Will be back.,"This was an excellent home away from home.  Recommended by a friend that has visited London many times.  Comfortable, modern lobby with a warm welcome after a long day of travel/seeing the sights of London.  Loved that we were able to walk to all.  Rooms were comfortable, modern and very clean.  Easy walk to several restaurants.  Whole family loved the breakfast each morning.  Will definitely be back.",5,2024,01,14
134,Excellent stay,"Our family of four including two children (ages 8 & 12) enjoyed our stay at Bankside Hotel. The hotel is very clean, rooms were spacious and restocked daily, beds were pleasantly comfortable.  Breakfast buffet was tasty. We will definitely stay here again when visiting London!",5,2024,01,12
134,Classy and convenient to everything,Right off the Thames river and Waterloo bridge. Very convenient to most attractions but bring your walking shoes. Very nice breakfast and our room was quite nice to European standards with small bathroom but very comfortable bed. Lounge from 5-6 everyday was an added bonus. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2024,01,07
134,Bankside was perfect for us.,"Bankside was a great hotel for our family vacation to London. Very clean, nice rooms, and great atmosphere. We were there for 6 days and the entire staff was fantastic for our entire trip. Front desk was always friendly and helpful, the cleaning staff was great every day, and same for the restaurant staff. Anytime we had an issue, and there is only one I can think of, they solved it immediately and made it painless. It’s close to multiple underground stations so great for sightseeing. Would absolutely stay hear again. ",5,2024,01,02
134,Fabulous Stay!,"Comfortable beds, very quiet hotel, amazing service! Food and drinks from the bar were fantastic also. Central location to many sites. Highly recommend and would stay here again! Easy check in process and helpful staff. Beautifully decorated for Christmas also!",5,2023,12,24
134,Beautiful Hotel that is also an Art Gallery,"The front desk welcomed me graciously. 
The Christmas decor is magnificent. The food is wonderful. I cannot say enough about the beautiful room, which came complete with its own Christmas tree. I loved this beautiful hotel and its beautiful people. It is also conveniently located near the Thames River.",5,2023,12,10
134,The perfect London stay,My parents came to visit me for the first time in a while and were looking for somewhere cosy yet sophisticated to stay and this was the absolute perfect spot. It's so well-located for both London Bridge transport and some touristy bits like Borough Market. I think it'll be their go-to next time they're back! Don't skip on the brekkie - was definitely the highlight of the stay for me! ,5,2023,12,06
134,Smashing stay.........,"As a word of reference I'm a Lifetime Platinum member with over 900 nights in Marriott hotels. This hotel will rank in the top 10 of those stays. What I liked: 
1. New hotel.  Overall very fresh and nice. 
2. Nice room. 
3. Nice large elevators (somewhat of rarity in Europe). 
4. Hotel doesn't nickel and dime you. Various extras thrown in. 
5.  Extraordinarily nice and accommodating staff. 
6. On a quiet side street so very minimal outside noise.  
7.  Just outside of the most touristy areas, yet very central and close when you want to get to them. 
8. A block away from lovely promenade along the Thames. 
9. Nice breakfast. 

Things I'd change if I nitpicked: 
1. Doors very loud when they close.  If you have neighbors coming and going you will know it. 
2. No views (flip side of advantage of being tucked away on a side street.) 
3. Can't open windows. 

Overall I was super pleased with the stay. ",5,2023,11,23
134,Wonderful experience from beginning to the end!!!,"My experience at this hotel was top-notch. I was welcomed warmly by James. He informed me of room upgrade through my Mariott membership. James offered me a free beer and even volunteered  to bring it to my room to allow me to get settled as soon as possible, which was so thoughtful. The room had a breath taking view of the city, included so many free amenities (snacks, treats, Nespresso coffee and tea)  The rooms are so modern and comfortable. They've manage to be new, modern, and create an impressive, unique experience as well. Not all hotels can manage to strike such a delicate balance so easily. The hotel restaurant for dinner and breakfast was good as well. Not to mention, the customer service at the restaurant was also wonderful and personable. Plus, the hotel is so close to the train station making arriving and departing so easy.

This is the first time I've ever felt special by being a Mariott member. MARIOTT please take note, this hotel really know how to treat their customers. And again a very special thanks to James for providing such a great start to my stay at the hotel. I will definitely be back again.",5,2023,11,17
134,Recommended ,We stayed at the Bankside for 2 nights with our children (age 2 en 0). The experience we had was amazing from checking in till checking out. The team was lovely. We had an amazing breakfast and in the evening we enjoyed some drinks in the restaurant. A special thanks to Carmella who showed us the beautiful art in the basement. We are definitely coming back. ,5,2023,11,13
134,Awesome experience with Manuel!,This was my first time in London. I can honestly say this was the best hotel experience I’ve had in my entire life. The staff was awesome and so friendly. Upon check Manuel had two glasses of wine for us before we could even get to room. I’m addition Jay was great as well when we had issues streaming on tv. Small staff but well trained and experienced in customer service. I will highly recommend this place to anyone on the world!,5,2023,11,11
134,Love the Stylish Bankside Hotel London!,Second visit to the Bankside Hotel London and we love this stylish boutique hotel. The art and decor are modern and fun. The beds are so nice. The restaurant hosts a lovely breakfast every morning. For the gym bunnies there is a nice fitness center with cardio and strength equipment. The front desk is super friendly and helpful. The hotel is environmentally minded with carafes for water in the rooms that can be filled in the hall. The location is splendid for business or leisure. Next to the Thames Link and short walk to Waterloo Station and Borough Market. Great for Marriott enthusiasts ,5,2023,11,07
134,Bankside gem,"This hotel is the perfect place to stay in London. We had a wonderful stay and can’t wait to get back. We visited many other hotels during our visit but this one and its location is our favourite! The staff go out of their way to ensure you’re happy with everything: special shout out to the front desk staff Raquel, Richard, Manuel and especially to the restaurant staff Joshua, Liza & Tomas. The food in the hotel restaurant is amazing which is great when you don’t feel like going far for dinner after a long day of sight seeing. We will absolutely stay here again, we were so happy with everything and everyone.",5,2023,11,07
134,Great Boutique Hotel in Bankside!," This is my first time at this property as I usually stay in Mayfair.  We chose to stay here as we were visiting a family member who lives in the Bankside/Southwark area of London.  The hotel is fairly new.  The location is wonderful for those wanting to visit tourist sites and the Borough Market.  The staff is friendly.  Our room (we used our suite night upgrade) was large with a lovely view of Blackfriars Bridge.  The morning breakfast was nice and the lattes were fabulous.  The gym in the basement was adequate.  I would definitely stay here again if traveling to this area of London.  
",5,2023,11,02
134,Artfully Elegant,"Everything about this property  was amazing.  The front desk staff had the answers to all of our questions - and provided us with converters when the ones we brought did not work.   The restaurant was lovely ...the tomatoes for breakfast were the best we have ever eaten.  The cocktails were delish and we particularly liked the Bees Knees with its slice of honeycomb.  And the art and the ambience delightful. There was a water station on every floor with sparkling and still water.  The rooms were spacious (yes, in London) and the beds and linens soft and comfy.  First time we went ""modern"" across the pond and it turned out to be a great decision! ",5,2023,10,30
134,Great hotel,"This hotel was wonderful.  We typically avoid hotels and stay in airbnbs but this was exceptional.  Really nice staff, quiet rooms, great bathrooms, very comfy bed.  We loved it!

The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was wonderful-Dimbu was especially kind and helpful-she went above and beyond each morning remembering what we wanted to drink, my gluten free toast and paid close attention to every detail.  ",5,2023,10,26
134,Stay here if you need two queen beds!,"Wonderful hotel if you need two queen beds! Spacious room, fantastic shower, plentiful waters, comfortable beds and convenient location. I traveled with a friend and was so happy to find a place that had two queen beds. The only improvement would have been that the AC in our room never fully cooled down, even after maintenance came- however, we’re Americans that like it cold and we’re running hair dryers. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,10,25
134,Wonderful London Hotel,"We had a wonderful time in London last week and are glad that we chose the Bankside. Check-in took less than a minute, and our room was ready early upon our arrival. The front desk is always well staffed and they are very friendly. 
Received complimentary buffet breakfast with titanium status, which was great. It is well appointed, including made to order coffee beverages. Our first day we ordered some coffees in the afternoon from Tommy and we saw him for breakfast the following 2 mornings. His friendly demeanor and smile did not go unnoticed. 
Location is excellent. We walked to many spots (Borough Market, Tower of London, St Paul’s, Westiminster Abbey, The Eye, etc…). When not within walking distance,  we took Ubers which were readily available at all hours.",5,2023,10,23
134,Newish hotel in a great location ,"This modern and fairly new hotel is superbly located on Bankside, a short walk to the Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe, and Borough Market. 

The staff are friendly and welcoming and our room was very nicely decorated with partial views over Blackfriars’s bridge. The room included a spotless walk-in shower room, a Lavazza coffee machine, some free snacks, and water. The only issue we had was our TV which kept loosing its signal and switching off. 

There's a small gym on-site and a nice restaurant too. The buffet breakfast was very decent and included excellent freshly brewed coffee. 

Overall, this is a very good hotel which is highly recommended if you are planning to stay in the area. ",4,2023,10,20
134,My favorite Hotel of our European Travels this year,"The location was great, the food was excellent, but the service is where they really shined. The front desk and wait staff were attentive, friendly and professional all at the same time.

Thank you specifically to Raquel and team for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,10,12
134,No worries love.,"My wife and I stayed here for two weeks recently.  We selected this hotel for its location and proximity to the Tate Modern, the Borough Market, St Paul’s Cathedral and the London South Bank Walk.  We enjoyed everything about this hotel: the restaurant is great, our room (and the hotel in general) was very clean and the staff is exceptional.  On Monday thru Thursday evenings there is a complimentary wine hour hosted by rotating members of the hotel staff.  It’s very nice and gives you the chance to meet and converse with members of the staff you may not normally interact with.  It gave my wife and I the opportunity to meet Sofiane Kaced, the Chef d’Hotel and Morena Mannino, the Director of Sales.  Sofiane was very gracious and insisted on giving us a tour of the hotel’s art collection.  Morena, who chatted us up for some time, was very helpful with tips on transportation and sights not to missed.

We also had great experiences with the front desk staff.  From Mohammed, who checked us in, and Mariana, who went above and beyond the call of duty, to help with hailing cabs and everyone else who made our stay special.

And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Manny.  I’m not sure of his job description.  He is a very tall young man who is very helpful and seems to be everywhere.

It is our plan to return next fall.  “No worries love”",5,2023,10,10
134,Amazing first visit to London,"From the moment we checked in at the front desk, Marianna and the entire Bankside staff has been nothing short of amazing. The restaurant staff were very kind and attentive. Rooms are beautiful as well as the entire establishment. Next time we visit we will most definitely stay here again and for a longer period of time. I also wanted to surprise my husband for a belated birthday with this stay and the staff provided desserts, snacks and bottle of champagne.",5,2023,10,01
134,Amazing hotel in London ,"Amazing hotel in every respect!  From the warm and friendly welcome at check in, to the beautiful and clean room, to the perfect breakfast and restaurant.  Literally everyone we met from the staff was as friendly and kind as you could hope.  I stay at over 100 a year with Marriot properties and this is by far my favorite in a very long time.  Cannot wait to come back.  I suggest stopping in the restaurant for a dessert and drinks - the chocolate lava cake and the warm apple tart were truly spot on.  ",5,2023,09,30
134,"The London Hotel fit for Kings and Queens, an experience we will never forget!!! ","Our experience staying at The Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection was absolutely stellar!! Of course the hotel is beautifully designed… but the staff, food, beds, ambiance and artful decor is incredible and we truly felt like VIP guests with every interaction!  If you are going to London, you will not find a more sophisticated, elegant, warm and luxurious hotel!!! This was my 5th visit to this amazing city and I would not stay anywhere else. Thank you to TEAM Bankside for making our vacation the best ever!!! ",5,2023,09,30
134,Fabulous location on South Bank,"This hotel by far exceeded our expectations. Brand new and a few steps from south bank and Blackfriars bridge, the hotel was centrally located for all of our outings. At check in, the lovely assistant (jet lagged - i cannot remember her name) was able to get us into our room earlier than expected and we are so grateful. The room was superb with the comfiest of pillows and bedding. The temperature in the room was pleasantly cool and quiet as a whisper. Housekeeping (fantastic) provided turn down service, plenty of fresh water and coffee and the room (upgraded to a suite) was well appointed and beautifully designed. The breakfast was outstanding  with plenty of healthy options each morning provided by our server, Olga, who made our experience even better. Management Richard and Mohammed, made sure our stay was exactly as we had hoped. We absolutely loved the location for our trip and definitely plan to come back in the near future. Thank you for a wonderful anniversary. Eileen and Frederick C",5,2023,09,28
134,The pillows and bed set this apart.,The pillows and bed set this apart. Luxury hotel with closeness to many fun tourist attractions. The reception was professional and polite with a speedy check in service!  Will recommend this to anyone looking for a fabulous night sleep:),5,2023,09,28
134,Just Wow! Fabulous property and staff.,"What a beautiful property and accommodating staff. From the early morning requests for coffee to the kind assistance of the front desk and restaurant staff, the Bankside proved to be the perfect place for our party. The rooms were immaculate and comfortable and the restaurant food was delicious. Great value and location as well. Special thanks to Richard, James and Raquel at the front desk for their kindness throughout our stay.",5,2023,09,20
134,Hotel in a quiet area,"Traveled with family for an extended layover.  Had 2 rooms, a spacious ""starter suite"" and a ""generous room"".  Tried to get connecting rooms. Started the process (weekly calls) a couple of months in advance, but did not get it. Rooms were fairly far apart but on the same floor. Kids aren't that young anymore so it wasn't a big deal but something to keep in mind if your kids are younger.
Breakfast buffet was a nice way to start the day. Coffee service was amazing although when I asked for a second cup, sometimes I'd get a weird look and more cutlery. Perhaps it was my North American accent? Ordered room service once and the salmon is about the size of a piano key so beware. Everything else we ordered was fine.
The front desk is set up like a conference table. It did seem like I was bothering them when asking a question.  They do give out umbrellas like candy when it's raining so that was really helpful. Taxis (be very specific where you are headed. If you don't say ""Marriott"", they're taking you elsewhere) and Ubers had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel and sometimes the entrance. 
Was initially unsure of the location but once we made it out to other more congested areas, found it was lovely to go back somewhere that is less crowded after a full day. There is also a small Waitrose as well as an Asian market around the corner for all your snacking needs.
This location was within walking distance to Borough Market though the place is insanely crowded so don't go starving and be ready to queue for a bit. Can also walk to Shakespeare's Globe and some museums. It's a really lovely stroll along the river. 
Overall the stay was pleasant but it didn't exactly gain my undying loyalty. Will try another next time. 
",4,2023,09,18
134,Great location and a special hotel!,"My wife and I stayed for 5 nights and loved the place. Staff are very friendly and helpful, and the hotel is clean and reasonably new. While no concierge lounge is available, the quality of the food and breakfast selection helps to offset this. They offer great little perks that make it a little bit special. Add in the fantastic location, and you won’t be disappointed.",5,2023,09,18
134,World class service and all the comforts of home.,"We had an absolutely fantastic day. The staff was personable and professional. The rooms were very comfortable and beautifully decorated. We loved the breakfasts downstairs and the beautiful amenities. Special thanks to Richard, James, and Racquel for their kindness and professionalism. We will definitely stay again when we are back in London.",5,2023,09,18
134,Fun Family Trip to London,"Loved this hotel. Great location and large rooms. Nice little touches in the room including free cold waters, snacks, and NESPRESSO coffee maker! Hotel breakfast was yummy too. Would definitely stay there again! ",4,2023,09,12
134,Family at London,"Great hotel, fantastic room and location.
Breakfast of high quality and a very friendly staff… from the receptionists, to the cleaning ladies and restaurant staff.
A special KUDOs to Manuel & Fábio for the friendly support.

Recommend you to book the hotel with breakfast included.",5,2023,09,10
134,A trip to remember!,"We stayed at the Bankside hotel for two weeks. The proximity to the prominent sightseeing places, walking alongside Thames and the cheerful staff made the trip quite memorable. I would like to extend my gratitude to Tamas and DeDe for making our mornings very pleasent. ",5,2023,09,09
134,Not happy place,I visited this hotel I found  the staff on the front desk rude and extremely unhelpful. Unkind. This is not a hotel that wants to attract return customers I feel. I will never enter this hotel again. They should learn to be more helpful and kind.,1,2023,09,08
134,Beautiful Bankside,"Hands down the best experience I have had in a very long time! 
Visited this beautiful hotel on my honeymoon. From booking, reaching out in advance, chatting to the team before arrival, checking in, coming and going, the list goes on. Huge kudos to the General Manager for running a spectacular property!",5,2023,09,06
134,Stay here! Amazing from start to finish!,"We recently stayed here for 9 nights and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish.  Everyone was so welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Our room was extremely clean, the bed and pillows were so comfortable and the shower pressure was great! We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet which had a nice selection of items and a very friendly staff. It was a very relaxing hotel to come back to after a day of running around.  It’s in a great  location in walking distance to the Thames, Tate Modern, many restaurants and pubs, the underground, etc. I have to give a big thank you to Richard and the front of house staff who were always so genuinely nice.  When my husband and daughter were going to the Reading Festival and there was a train strike that day he took the time to help them map out a way to get there!  Our daughter was staying in London to study abroad.  As we were leaving Richard mentioned, she knows where to find us if she ever needs anything.  We would 100% stay here again! ",5,2023,09,05
134,Truly Amazing Property,"Hard to describe how fabulous this hotel is.  The location is fabulous if you’re looking for something other than the typical  central London experience.  The staff are amazing, warm, generous and truly epitomize the meaning of hospitality.  It felt like you are staying with family.  The decor of the hotel is thoughtful and inspiring.  Big shout out to Alina at the front desk and Julia in the restaurant.  You are very special people and you made my stay even more amazing!",5,2023,09,04
134,Wonderful London hotel!,"We enjoyed our 10 stay at this hotel with friendly staff especially Manuel. He always greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome every time we would return  from our London adventures. Our room was great and  super clean!  Bed was sooo comfortable. Really liked floor plan. We had a king size bedroom with lots of room and appreciated the big desk to use our computers  and charge all our devices. Technically, the room was fantastic with convenient outlets, automatic black out blinds which was perfect  for sleeping well and getting over jet lag. Above the nightstands there are buttons to control all the lights in the room. The bathroom was plenty big for two of us with a walk in shower and a night light under sink and at front door, clever. One issue with shower was there was no cold water. We had to turn the knob to the coldest setting otherwise the water was scorching hot! Even on coldest setting is was very warm, but we were ok with that.  Sink taps were fine. The restaurant staff was great and we had a few good meals there. The evening manager was kind and friendly making sure my husband’s meal was dairy free.  We loved this hotel and would stay here again! ",5,2023,09,02
134,Amazing!,Great hotel! Room decor is awesome! Lobby checking was great. No complaints here! Room service food was REALLY good! A quick walk outside and you are at the bridge with beautiful views of the River. Definitely one of my favorite hotels. I was placed on 5th floor (top) no road noise. Hotel is a bit tucked away from Farringdon street so that’s nice. Cabs can be called within 2-3 mins. Lovely hotel all in all,5,2023,09,01
134,See London from the Bankside!,"Our stay at the Bankside was outstanding from the moment we arrived — and were greeted with warm smiles at the reception desk by Mikaela and Kasha (sp?) — until we departed. The accommodations were very comfortable and well designed — with multiple electric outlets on both sides of the bed!! A multi-option breakfast in the dining room was ample and served by friendly and accommodating staff. While not in the obvious location for first time London visitors, it is just a couple of blocks from a Tube station and a block from a Railway station that can quickly get you anywhere in London or beyond. It’s also conveniently located close to the boat system for water travel up and down the Thames. Then, in the evening, you return to Bankside and stroll along the River for dinner any/or drinks — or explore the nearby neighborhoods for local restaurants. While we’ve stayed in Central London we found the Bankside to be great new alternative.",5,2023,08,31
134,"Classy, surprising and fun.  Even if not staying you would go for the art and food.","A spectacular unusual hotel with warm staff and lots of surprises.  Art everywhere, people visit the hotel just to see the art.  While the hotel is classy, it is not stuffy.  It is a fun place to stay.  The modern rooms have all kinds of convinces that we have not experienced before.  The restaurant is frequented by locals, always a good sign.  Plenty of Vegetarian and vegan dishes.  The best hotel we have ever stayed at in U.K. and one of our all time favorites.",5,2023,08,28
134,"Fabulous, Convenient  - Yet Quiet!","This is a fabulous quiet hotel just a short walk from the Tate as well as the Borough Market. Conveniently just over the bridge from Blackfriars. Staff was always very helpful, rooms were comfy and well appointed. Showers had good water pressure. Drinking water taps were in the hallways so you could fill up your rooms carafe with soda or plain water. There is a Gails Bakery in the same building complex so breakfast was easy.",5,2023,08,25
134,Sublime Experience at Perfectly Located Hotel,"I can understand why this is in Trip Advisor’s circle of excellence —our experience was fantastic and although we split our stay in London between two hotels (not knowing the neighborhoods), I wish we had stayed here solely for our week long stay.  

The hotel is fantastic and started blissfully with a super early check in allowed (they had a room available for us at 10:30 am after we arrived from an early morning flight into Heathrow) and so grateful since our family of four was able to shower and freshen up before hitting the National Gallery.   They were so sweet to allow us a delayed check out as well (noon check out which allowed us to fit in St. Paul’s the morning we left).

The room was a good size for London with comfortable modern beds, a really clean interior, and I loved the skin care products (fragrant smell and moisturizing).    I loved the modern decor and little touches with complementary water and the bamboo room cards.   With the warm weather, it is impressive how cool the room got and the blackout shades were great to help with jet lag.   

With my husband’s Marriott status, they were kind to give us two complimentary breakfasts and the buffet was excellent. 

What couldn’t be beat though is the fantastic location—walking distance to Thameslink (Blackfriars) and the underground (Thameslink/Blackfriars) and walking distance to so many fantastic sites (St. Paul’s, Tate Modern, Millennium Bridge).   More importantly there once on the tube there are few spots you have to head on for major London spots (eg Westminster with Big Ben, the Abbey, and National Gallery is just a stop away).",5,2023,08,25
134,Great London Hotel Choice,This hotel checked all the boxes! The family room is great when traveling with kids. The drinks at the bar were excellent as well as the children’s menus. Loved the bathrobes and slippers. Location was super close to Borough Market and close to many tube stations. If you are spending a lot of time in central and northern London then this location isn’t for you.,5,2023,08,19
134,Always something that makes us want to come back,"We stayed at Bankside Hotel for the first time in October 2022.  Liked it so much that we decided to come back for our July/Aug London trip this year.  Saw a few new faces at the Desk but the rest all remembered us.  Richard the Front Desk Manager runs a tight ship and has a decent team cultivated.  By the way, congrats to Manual for a well deserved promotion.  He was excellent when he took care of us in his Porter role last time.

Overall our week long stay was another great experience and this time we were most impressed by James, the Chief Ambassador.  

James stood out last time with his professionalism and efficiency, and he took it to another level this time.  The following incident tells you what a difference it makes to stay in a hotel that makes you feel like you are being well taken care of.  

After a week’s stay at Bankside, we took a side trip to Manchester and returned to this hotel for a couple of more nights on August 8.  It was the day when there was a gas explosion which messed up all the train schedules and Manchester Piccadilly Station was a complete mess.  

We went through half a day of train cancellations and countless last minute rush from one end of the station to the other due to constant platform changes.  This was particularly brutal for us who are both elderly and unfamiliar with the train station.  After a day’s torture, we finally got to the Bankside feeling totally exhausted and stressed out.  

Then we saw James waiting for us in front of the Desk with our room key packets in hand, saying “We are all prepared for your return and everting is set, no check in or anything needed, just have a good rest and enjoy your room”.  Later it turned out that the room was a very nice upgrade.  Well, one can imagine how much all this was appreciated after an unusually rough day. 

James has demonstrated what true 5-star service is about - well anticipates guests needs in advance, and delivers efficient attentive service with poise.  We sincerely hope to see him again on our next visit.  Thank you James, thank you Bankside Team!
",5,2023,08,18
134,Our favorite hotel in London,"This was a repeat stay with our son attending university in London, and Bankside remains our go-to.  Marianne checked us in and made us feel quite welcome - even offering to bring our bags up to our room herself so we didn’t miss a welcome drink at the ArtYard bar and restaurant that is connected.

We enjoyed the ArtYard buffet breakfast every morning of our stay.  There is a nice variety including smoked salmon, pastries, eggs, sausage, cereals and fresh fruit, though I would prefer being able to use the platinum benefit as a dollar credit towards the a la crate menu as many other Marriott properties do (especially since I’m a sucker for avocado toast, which my sister had!)

Three of us shared a room with a king and a sofa bed that easily folded up to make room during the day. The room amenities are outstanding, with Nespresso machine for coffee and tea, gourmet chips and carafes to keep the room well stocked with sparkling and/or still water (in addition to some cans of water and cream for coffee in the mini fridge).  Shower was luxurious with soft fluffy bath towels.  Monday-Thursday we enjoyed the complimentary wine hour before heading out to evening activities.

The hotel is centrally located in Waterloo - a 5-10 minute walk along the water from all the tourist craziness by the London Eye - so you can get there easily and also feel like you are getting away when you return to the Bankside.  Just across the bridge is Blackfriars tube station, making connections very easy, and also the site of Blackfriar pub which is notable for its Arts and Crafts interiors, listed with the National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors - a great place for a pint.  

We were sad to leave, but at the push of a button, they had a proper British taxi at the corner - excellent service from start to finish.  We will definitely be back!",5,2023,08,13
134,"Great hotel, great accessibility!","We loved Bankside, I was traveling with a wheelchair and accessibility was great! They put us in their accessible room and it worked out wonderfully. The staff is lovely, friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic. The hotel restaurant is a great place to stop for food. Would definitely recommend staying here. ",5,2023,08,11
134,FANDABYDOZY!!!,"WOW! Where do I begin. We absolutely LOVED our stay here. The design and the amenities of this hotel were first class. 
Entering the hotel and greeted by reception staff sat around a bespoke table with beaming smiles was very special. We were then upgraded due to our titanium status and what a room that was🥰🥰
We were surrounded by fabulous works of art around the hotel. The hotel itself was clean and tidy and all the staff smiled and spoke to us. In the afternoon, there was a knock at the door and we were given a small plate of macarons and two chocolates kingside a hand written card. Can’t lie…felt very special.

We had the BEST mixologist-Tyrese who made us the best drinks. What a gem!

We then retired to bed and what an experience that was… the sheets…..OMG!!!! I swear, it was like sliding into a silky satin dream. Must be the BEST  sleep I have had in ages. I suffer with insomnia and as soon as my head hit the pillow, I was out until the morning.

We had a lovely breakfast which was included in our stay and apart from the chef being a little bit grumpy…EVERYONE else was exceptional. The  cappuccino and orange juice was nothing short of perfection and the level of service was amazing.

Would we return? Hell yeah!! Just you try and stop me!

Thank you and if you are thinking of going, don’t hesitate. Just go ahead and book! 😍",5,2023,08,10
134,Very good,"Excellent location, with many sites easily reachable by public transportation. Good bakery and supermarket around the corner.

High standards in the room (I had a suite): excellent bedding, bathroom products, turndown service, coffee and tea facilities, etc. Adequate fitness room.

Good service and very kind and attentive staff. Because of the pleasant layout, the hotel feels more like boutique.

Breakfast buffet was pretty good but a little limited (you can order some dishes a la carte for a supplement).

I chose the hotel because I was attending a conference nearby. Not the most exciting area of London, but good value for money and not really far from the main sites and shopping.

I was wondering why a Marriott gets such high ratings on TA, but it is definitely deserved.",4,2023,08,10
134,Seriously amazing hotel,"I’m actually a little reluctant to write this review as I don’t want this hotel to become overrun to the point that it gets hard to get reservations.

I like to try new places and have stayed in literally hundreds of different hotels in all different categories from luxury (Ritz, Waldorf, St Regis, Claridges, etc.) to low budget in major metropolitan cites (Boston, NYC, Amsterdam, London, Paris, Chicago) and many other places.  The Bankside is easily in my top five hotel stays ever and at the price point is a serious contender for #1 for me. 

My wife and I stayed there five days for our 25th wedding anniversary celebratory trip and I can’t say enough good things about the hotel, the service, the relaxed vibe, the art, and the amenities were all consistently amazing. 

Note that it’s a 10 minute walk to any tube stop, but the hotel is always quick with a taxi and the staff apologized profusely when we had to wait 5 minutes for a cab one time and gave us up to the minute updates as we waited. There is plenty to do in the area and some great bars, restaurants, and parks within a few minutes walk. 

Special tip: don’t miss the hidden library lounge and porch area on the 1st floor.

Special thanks to the front desk staff who took my quick note in the Marriott App chat about it being our 25th anniversary and decorated our room with rose petals on the bed spelling “Love” and a heart plus other special treats. Also, a special thanks to Thomas (Tomas?) in the restaurant who was a rock star with constant amazing service.

134,Above and beyond for a special celebration,"This is the second time we have chosen Bankside Hotel for our stay in London. The first time was for the location and because we have points rewards with Marriott. We were so happy with our stay and the staff there last August 2022 that we booked again this June 2023. This trip was so special because it was to celebrate my mother’s 87th birthday and her first trip to London to rest before her first Mediterranean Cruise. Bankside went so above and beyond in their service to make it the most memorable hotel stay ever. First of all they made sure we could have adjoining rooms so we could help with her mobility issues and aids. Then they acknowledged her birthday with personalized card from all the staff, gift and complementary chocolates and sparkling wine. They were so helpful in every way. It meant so very much to me that she enjoy the trip of a lifetime and while I knew the hotel staff were superb everyone really went far beyond to make it truly her trip of a lifetime!!!! Thank you all!!!! I can’t wait for our next visit……",5,2023,08,01
134,Excellent Hotel!! Highly Recommend!,"We stayed here because of Costco travel package and it was a great stay:

Loved:
• hotel staff addressed in English and spoke fluent English
• was easy to get around London from where located
• breakfast was fabulous - great selection of hot and cold options 
• rooms clean
• nightly wine tasting was small, but nice extra perk, we only went one night based on schedule but it definitely enjoyed 
• water and snacks replenished in room was perfect, never ran out of water and snacks (chips and chocolate) also nice extra perk, small things make a difference 

Recommended Improvements:
• minimal, really loved our stay here, and I don’t say that often (a/c could have been better though)",5,2023,07,24
134,Comfortable modern hotel in a good location,"Spacious rooms, quality finish and fixtures, comfortable bed and great amenities. Bonus was the water dispenser at every floor; could easily refill water bottles there. Breakfast wasn’t a huge spread but was sufficient. Another plus point was the location - short walk to the tube stations, cafes, supermarkets and down the river from tourist attractions like the Tate Modern.",5,2023,07,19
134,Outstanding,"It was very hard to find the entrance to the hotel. We eventually had to go through the restaurant. Once inside, we realized how special this hotel is. It starts with being greeted with a smile and they quickly took our luggage to the side so we could sit and check in. We just had a 2 hour drive from Gatwick and it was now about 9:30am, too early to get in our room. We needed to buy some items for our cruise that would start in 2 days. They called a taxi for us and off we went. We got back to the hotel around 2pm. We were given our card keys and our luggage was already in the room. 

Comfy bed, soft sheets, soft towels, good blackout drapes. Very very quiet. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant which was OK. The next morning we had breakfast there but my eggs were way overcooked. Sent back. The new plate had the same problem. The manager came over and profusely apologized and then comped our meal. We took the short walk to the train station for our Windsor Castle tour. The hotel is in a really good location. The next morning when we walked in for breakfast, the manager came over to us and said that she was comping the buffet. We really didn't expect that. But this hotel and restaurant really do go overboard to make sure you have a memorable stay. 

If we come back to London, I would definitely stay here again. Oh, one small tip. Turn the water temp in the shower to cold. If you don't, you'll find the water is really hot.

134,Stay at Bankside-Bank Good Memories Forever,"Angels must have blessed us the day Angela at Marriott Bankside London answered our call from the USA. We needed transportation to the hotel from the Cruiseport. Angela knew the perfect experienced driver with large,
comfortable vehicle to hold all of our luggage. 
She offered to book for us and put fare on our hotel bill. We were thrilled with the driver. He pointed out all the highlights of London. He was very safe, middle aged driver.  
We felt as if we got a free tour guide along the way! (We used same driver back to Cruise Port
for next trip.) Angela was there when we
checked into hotel. She asked If we were celebrating  a special occasion. We
were later in the week—our wedding anniversary. My husband asked for nice
place to celebrate. She not
only recommended the Shard, but called and got us a table by the window, even though London was loaded with tourists for
the Coronation. When we returned
to our room, we were surprised with 
 a bottle of champagne, desserts,
and a happy anniversary card! 
All of the employees were ten stars. But it was also Angela who got us a tour of London when all were sold out. We also loved the on site
five star Restaurant, Art Yard! As platinum elite, we have eaten at Marriott restaurants all over the Country. Art Yard ranks number one on our list. Cannot even describe in words how delicious the tender baked fish plates were. The presentation of each dish was magazine worthy!! Amazing team members were Tomas and David of Ecuador. We ate most of our meals here and loved the ambiance and aromatic scents, culinary skills on full display —
all at reasonable prices. We were grateful for David providing us a tour of meeting rooms adorned with unique local art. (Have to get company to book a trip to London!) Hotel is within a safe walking distance to many stores and sites. 

We highly recommend tourists stay at Bankside, where one will get enough love and great memories to “Bank” forever!",5,2023,07,12
134,Nice hôtel ,Good and comfortable hotel with nice view and good location . The service is really nice and special.we loved to. Stay there in it . The food was delicious and  the bethrooms and the rooms are Soo Soo clean we felt very safe and calm . Good place to relax ,5,2023,07,03
134,Excellent London Option,"We chose this property for a few reasons:
*Central location
*More affordable than the Grovenor’s Square or County Hall
*Did not charge extra for 3rd and 4th people (ages 16 & 14 are considered adults in London hotels)
*Free breakfast (for Titanium)
*Abailability of rooms with 2 queens

LOVE the property and service at this hotel. Here are the highlights:
*Amazing customer service. The check-in was like no other. We were invited to take a seat and were offered cold drinks. 
*Very nice gym — even had a hydro rower. 
*Modern, clean rooms. 
*Housekepekng did a wonderful job. 
*Over-sized and soft bath towels. 
*Tasty breakfast buffet. 
*Free snacks and water in rooms. 
*Welcome gift of 8£ food/beverage credit (or 1,000 points). 
*Hand-written welcome card and even some Prosecco and treats. 
*Numerous newspapers available through the website/WiFi log-in.

Keep in mind that there isn’t a lounge because it’s an AC, but I was able to get free breakfast for 2 anyway. 

The ONLY negative is that the shower threshold is high and the tub is steep and slippery where you need to exit. My wife and I both slipped and fell pretty hard. Use caution when exiting the shower. (See bruise in last pic.)",4,2023,06,30
134,Great hotel with a couple caveats,"Overall, this hotel is excellent. It was spacious for a family of four, very clean, well appointed. The neighborhood is also clean and quiet, but easily accessible to all the London sights and a quick walk to public transport. The front desk staff are welcoming. 

Two minor issues, not worth detracting a full star, but important to point out: the tub/shower combo is an accident waiting to happen. The high tub wall is lovely if you want to use the tub, I’m sure, but extremely difficult to climb over onto the angled tub floor. There is no handrail and after you’ve used the shower and everything is slippery, it’s even worse. Someone is bound to grab onto the towel bar to prevent a fall and will tear it right out of the wall. For someone with back issues, I found this setup problematic and uncomfortable. 

Second was the restaurant - we didn’t eat there but did order room service once. It took over an hour for the food to be delivered, and the person taking the order seemed to have little to know understanding of gluten allergies (my daughter has celiac) despite some of the items being labeled gluten free. They forgot to bring part of the order, and the chicken burger I got was an inedible slab of paper thin chicken fried beyond recognition as food. So, stay away from room service! 

Otherwise, a well-positioned and lovely stay in a vibrant area of London.",5,2023,06,27
134,Where do I start?,"We went through Costco travel and was pleasantly pleased with this hotel.  Although the hotel is only 30 minutes from the airport,  it ended up taking us nearly 2 hours to get here due to traffic.  (It was the kings birthday celebration) the hotel is crushed in a small space but not very far from major attractions by walking 30 minutes or subway 10 minute walk. We were able to see just about everything. The restaurant was good, we had lunch one day and Kasha our waitress was great, she was very attentive to our needs. Continental breakfast was included in our package so we had sausage,  eggs, yogurt,  potato cakes, coffee,  bacon, and an assortment of bread. The room was very nice, clean and a great size for the 2 of us. The king bed was so comfortable,  it seemed as though we were the only guests in the hotel because of how quiet it was,  although I know there were other guests.",5,2023,06,20
134,Amazing hotel right in the heart of it all!,"This hotel exceeded our already high expectations!  We arrived jet lagged from a flight that was delayed nearly 2 hours.  We were welcomed as soon as we approached the front doors by a wonderful doorman.  The front desk staff were equally warm and made us feel at home right away.  The room itself was immaculate.  The complimentary snacks were a lovely surprise, too.  Each morning we had the breakfast buffet and it was delicious and oh so fresh (try the mini muffins-the best!).
All around an elite hotel that goes above and beyond to satisfy their customers.",5,2023,06,16
134,Fantastic hotel with amazing service!!,We ended up staying at the hotel for a week and even used the property as a home base to come and go - visiting the Cotswolds and Nottingham. The staff went above and beyond each and every day and always took care of us like family! Everyone from Mohammed Hassan who is exceptional and front desk staff to those in the restaurant and bar - especially Kasha and David to those in housekeeping. The entire property is lovely plus very quiet. The beds and pillows are super comfortable as well. They have a small well outfitted gym and the restaurant plus bar is absolutely superb. You can’t ask for anything more - a block from train and underground so great location as well. Thank you for everything- we will return!!,5,2023,06,14
134,Wonderful dining experience ,"Sofiane Kaced the chef served up the most delicious food. I’d never tasted so many wonderful plates.  Tyson was great and made us feel super welcome from
The moment we entered the building. Very calming ambience and extremely attentive. Full marks to the staff and hotel for a relaxed, enjoyable time ",5,2023,06,13
134,The most hospitable hotel ever.,"The service was extremely impeccable.  The hotel was beautiful, extremely clean and safe in a lovely party of town. The staff was so accommodating and super friendly. We kept extending our stay because they truly provided 5 star service.  The stay at Bankside AC made our vacation super special and I thank every  single member of their team for such a remarkable experience. ",5,2023,06,08
134,Fabulous stay,"Fabulous stay - great room, friendly service, good breakfast. Everything was fantastic. It’s our second stay and we’ll be back. Great experience and I’d be happy to recommend it. Great position too - close to the tube station and a lovely place to wander around. ",5,2023,06,06
134,A dream trip to London for 4 nights!,The room was very very nice and the bed was perfect. We had the breakfast buffet that was amazing with the  servers being very attentive. Our checkin went very smoothly with Marianna and she was wonderful and continued to be  very helpful with suggestions for getting around London during our stay. We loved the location of the hotel !,5,2023,06,04
134,Do not miss the chance to stay at the Bankside!,"Impeccable service and a cozy but modern and innovative feel make this an amazing stay.  5 out of 5 on the fluffy towel index (and they were grey, not your standard white!). Organic modern decor makes the room restful and calming. I almost extended my stay in London just to experience another night with the super soft sheets and comfy bed. Service was warm, kind, quick, and fabulous. 
Great location of course.  Don’t miss staying here!!",5,2023,06,02
134,Fantastic Hotel,Great Hotel .Entire staff was great. Most accommodating Great Service and Ambiance.It was our 51st wedding anniversary and the gave us a bottle of champagne.The staff made us feel really welcome .Special thanks to Jay in maintenance do all of his help.,5,2023,05,29
134,"Yes, all those 5 star reviews are legit!","I am suspicious of businesses that have a high % of 5-star reviews. So while I decided to take a chance at the Bankside in Southwark, a part of London that is increasingly becoming more attractive to tourists, I certainly went in with a “You’ll have to Show Me” attitude. And in all honesty they did! Richard runs a smooth operating hotel with a gracious staff bending toward the younger side. It started at checkin with an offer of water, coffee, or beer!  — surprised, we just chose water. What followed was 5 days of casual, friendly & efficient service — at reception, at our complimentary breakfast in the restaurant, with housekeeping, and when small problems arose which might have engendered debates/arguments at other hotels rather than quick, fair resolution. Yes, the 5 star reviews are legit. We’re sure we’ll be back our next time in London.",5,2023,05,28
134,Amazing Stay & Bankside Hotel  Gracious  Staff and Management Personnel,"My husband and I had the most amazing overnight stay at Bankside Hotel in London SE1 last April 26.

Evi checked us in with her big bright smile.  Instantaneously, we hit it off and felt her warm presence.  While I was looking around, I noticed the exciting vibe of the hotel.  The ambience was  trendy with a touch of  modern meshed with intimate and cool amenities and lots of whimsical art scattered everywhere which I truly appreciate.

The Bankside Hotel Management Staff surprisingly welcomed us with a chilled bottle of champagne with a plate of chocolates coupled with the most wonderful and personal note from the Bankside Hotel personnel staff.  It was during check in, that I casually mentioned that my husband and I will be celebrating 27 years in May and that it was an early anniversary celebration.  It was priceless indeed!

Therefore, my hats off to the entire Bankside Hotel management staff for their gracious hospitality:

- GM Philip S 
- Executive Chef, Sofiane K
- Managers, Raquel H and the rest of the team

So keep it up, smile, shine and continue to provide excellent outstanding customer service because this is what sets you apart. 

We will forever be grateful and definitely treasure the delightful memories that would only last a lifetime.

Bravo and well done Bankside Hotel Team!

Thank you so much again,
Enrique (Rick) and D

134,Great Hotel,From the moment we arrived this hotel shined. Providing a welcoming checkin experience where they provided us with free drinks and then realizing we hadn’t had breakfast yet provided us a free and great breakfast buffet   The breakfast buffet was good enough we had it each morning of our stay. The room is comfortable with great beds perfect to collapse on after walking London all day. The entire staff was attentive and friendly. We are definitely going to stay at this brand hotel again,5,2023,05,21
134,The little things make the difference,"As soon as you arrive at Bankside you just know that it will be perfect. You are given a complementary drink at check in. Raquel is amazing and very professional, she took care of us in a very special way. We also spent some time with her at happy hour, she is a lovely person. We stayed for our anniversary and after our conversation she sent us a bottle of wine to celebrate. Wonderful staff! The room is excellent and most comfortable bed ever. Breakfast is just superb. 
As I said - the little things are important!",5,2023,05,21
134,Our Home Away From Home in London!,"The Autograph Bankside is our ‘home away from home’ in London. The team are brilliant and so supportive! I have spent over 35 days in the property in 2023 largely for business - The rooms are spacious and the location is perfect. Philip and his team are great hosts - Mohammed, Aida, Raquel, Angela, Michaela and Monana make our stay. Great conference and meeting facilities. This stay is all about my wife’s birthday and the team have really made her feel special. We love the experience of staying at Autograph Bankside - As a Bonvoy Marriott Ambassador I am very selective about where I stay… Well done Philip and the team.",5,2023,05,21
134,Bespoke and quiet hotel,"This is a small hotel part of the Marriott, we loved it, small, cozy with everything needed and very close to the city of London. Nice view, confortable bed a nice little gym, a lovely sunny terrace and a quiet upstairs lounge. 

The staff made us feel very welcome all the time. The cleaner was very lovely and helpful. 

I would like to praise Tamas (waiter) who was very friendly and helpful during my stay. 
I requested a gluten free breakfast and some of the staff couldn't offer me anything apart from the buffet breakfast (which had many gluten options). 

Tamas came along with the menu and was very helpful and friendly and recommended me a few things on it that could be adapted to gluten free.  The breakfast was amazing, all gluten free (overnight oats, delicious coffee, chia pudding, avocado on toasts, eggs Benedict). Tamas really knows how to make people feel welcome and give the best options available for their needs (even if they are hard to find). 

When you are coealic it is very hard to get to a five star hotel and find that the breakfast you've paid for is limited to toasts, fruit and coffee and Tamas reassured me that I could have a good breakfast as everyone else, but gluten free . I have to also praise the cook for the delicious dishes. Our experience was very good.  

Thank you Tamas!",5,2023,05,16
134,A Five Star Hotel that does not disappoint,An absolute wonderful stay in London. It is quick walk to the Blackfriar tube stop and Borough Market. The staff is wonderful and attentive but not stuffy whatsoever. The room was large and airy which was surprising as they are usually smaller. The buffet breakfast was lovely and the water stations in the hotel were wonderful. We will be back for sure!,5,2023,05,15
134,Such a nice hotel!,"My friend and I stayed here as part of a package from Costco. Having not picked the hotel ourselves, we were pleased that it was such a great choice. The check-in staff were wonderful, especially Aida. The room was spacious and we got snacks from Waitrose most days. Was such a nice hotel to come back to after long days of sightseeing.",5,2023,05,12
134,Lucky find in Southwark,"We stayed here 5 nights. This was on a recommendation of a friend who stays in this hotel often while doing work in London. The check in was top notch. Of course we were jet lagged on arrival from US overnight flight. The hotel arranged a transportation from Heathrow ($130USD). They were able to get us a room that was already clean so we could check in straight away. I think the only ""down"" side was that it didn't look like the photo of the room I had booked online. Anyway, it is a modern clean hotel with many staff at entry. Although it was slightly impersonal in the lobby as we went in and out daily often. The young man who showed us to our room (Scottish) was super friendly. I read about the area - just over the Blackfriar's bridge on the opposite side of the Thames to central London. (Southwark) I was glad we stayed there. Central London was packed and less neighborhood-y. The area is home to many concrete buildings from the 70s-80s. They are being re-done. This is one. What makes it great is sound quality. It was perfectly quiet. It was modern. They have a nice system of red and blue buttons on the door lock to indicate ""do not disturb"" and ""clean the room please"". The room was cleaned every day. Spacious for a ""double room"". Comfortable bed with all the amenities - safe, refrigerator, robes etc. Free soft drinks and popcorn. We ate at the restaurant on arrival which was quite good. I had some drinks in the evenings. I found the restaurant and common areas nice and quiet. The staff in the restaurant were always so friendly. The hotel is a 15 min easy walk to Borough Market - with many excellent food options. Felt very safe to walk at all times. Short walk to Tower of London. Short walk over bridge to Covent Garden. Easy to walk to Westminster. I felt lucky to have made this connection to a comfortable home base for our 5 day stay in London. ",5,2023,04,28
134,Really enjojable repeat visit.,"We returned to Bankside and were not disappointed.  The staff throughout the hotel were welcoming, nothing was too much trouble.  The staff at reception were happy to help with any questions on where to go, how to get there and on what to see and do.
We had a lovely room at the end of the corridor, everything was perfect.  The toiletries were super.   The location is fabulous for getting around central London.  We will be back!",5,2023,04,27
134,Staff aims to please,"When we are in London we like to experience different hotels and locations. We had never stayed on the South Bank before.  The hotel was within walking distance to Borough Market but needed to take an Uber to more central London.
There were 3 of us traveling so we needed a room with a king bed and a sleeper sofa.  The king bed was very comfortable but unfortunately there was little support in the sleeper sofa. We were surprised how spacious the room was for London.
We booked through Expedia so two breakfast buffets were included.  The buffet offered a variety of hot and cold items. Since there were 3 of us, we knew we needed to pay for 1 breakfast per day but was surprised it was 24 euros each day. The staff at breakfast was very attentive.",5,2023,04,25
134,Gorgeous and Modern,The entire hotel is gorgeous and modern. The rooms are well appointed and we got an amazing nights sleep. Very comfortable pillows. Breakfast was an extra cost but delicious. It was easy to get an Uber from there and they held our luggage the day we left until it was time to take the train.,5,2023,04,18
134,Ideal location,"Location is ideal for access to many of the interesting and fun tourist sites.  The room was on the small side but very comfortable and quiet.  The food in the on-site restaurant was excellent.  We were not fans of the ""special"" cocktails offered from the bar--expensive and odd combinations.  The staff were cordial and helpful.  Recommend this hotel if your visit is short and you want to be close to the action.",5,2023,04,13
134,Excellent stay!,"We had a wonderful stay at Bankside.  The location was convenient and quieter than what I imagine some areas being.  The staff was very friendly.  I love how eco friendly the hotel was.  They had many lovely touches, including cold, flat, and sparkling water filling stations on each floor.  I used room service once and it was very quick without all of the extra fees.  The gym was very well appointed!  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,04,12
134,"Great staff, lovely boutique-like hotel","The room was lovely.  Modern and minimal but still very warm and inviting.  Big windows, nice large TV, big shower.  Every floor has pitchers for water (sparkling & still) that you can bring to the room.  Love that.  Vending machines for wine and snacks and...sundries. 

The staff are really lovely and go out of their way to make it feel like a warm reception.  Speaking of which, they have a wine reception during the week, which is nice.  Breakfast is good (if pricey).

The only (slight) downside for me is the location, as it's not close to the sights I tend to want to go to other than the Tate Modern, which is very close.  But there are shops, restaurants, etc all within walking distance, so it's really just a matter of deciding what location you like.

But you can't go wrong with the hotel itself.",5,2023,04,11
134,Excellent modern hotel,A wonderful hotel with first class facilities and outstanding management and service. Many details like not charging for items in the room and great help from the front desk in just about any matter sets them apart. Restaurant in site is very good. London s definition of spacious is always different from the US but the caliber of the faculties are excellent. Location is awesome and right in the middle of most things in central London. Highly recommend,5,2023,04,08
134,"Intimate, Professional Style with Elegant Modern Decor","The Bankside Hotel provides an intimate, and customized welcome to London, so much so that the  ambiance warms you as you enter the lobby.  The music, the mid century modern decor, the modern art, and the music in the background, welcomes you in with style and grace. Meanwhile you could not ask for a better location, it is both a focal point for access to all of the city,  and a hub for everything on the Southbank such as : The Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe, Borough Market and much much more. The service was friendly and professional to perfection. When I asked for new sheets, they provided extra sheeting and extra towels before we even finished our request.  The restaurant staff and the chef were excellent. The breakfast buffet was not only fresh and delightful, but perfectly displayed. The late night bar and menu provided an excellent denouement to our adventurers in London.  Hats off to the management and staff for making us feel so welcome.  We will be back again soon! 
( PS they have a full gallery on the lower 1st floor unique art on display and gym with a peloton bike and a peloton style rowing machine)",5,2023,04,05
134,London Adventure 2023," Bankside was located in the Perfect place.  Everything was very centralized and easy to get to.  The hotel was spacious and cozy.  The staff was friendly, helpful, nice, professional and always welcoming and very helpful.  Specialy Mrs Mariana she help me book dinner reservations, guide me to where I wanted to go and recommend awesome restaurants and places to visit.  She was always very helpful with everything  we needed.   💕🦋 Thank you everyone at Bankside for making this an even awesome adventure.  We will be back again.

134,"Modern, Clean, Spacious","This hotel was perfect for my long weekend get away with my teen son.  The room itself was well appointed....spacious, great comfortable king sized bed and a sleeper sofa that my son choose to sleep on the top and only once opened up.  He is tall, and just lying on the top was fine for him along with the extra blanket that was on the main bed.  Although we could have asked for bedding, he declined.  The shower was awesome - lots of good water pressure and you had both a rainshower or regular shower head (which could be easily detached from the holder).    The room came with Nespresso coffee maker with coffee, tea, and real milk in the fridge.  All of this, including the popcorn snacks were complimentary.  Water - cold, still, and bubbly can be found at a dispenser in the hallway and your room comes with a pitcher.   At the end of the day, the rooms were modern, clean, and had everything we needed.

The one thing that I noticed is that noise from the hallway, especially when room doors are being closed.  Not awful, but if you are sensitive to noise, perhaps asking for a room on one end of the hallway would be better to minimize this.  

I really liked that this is a smallish hotel (5 floors).  Lots of comfortable seating in the lobby.  The check in (and check out) was straight forward and felt much more relaxed as you sat at a table while all of that was done.   The staff at the front desk were very nice and always greeted us coming and going.

I found the location to be great.  5-7 minute walk to Black Friars (train and underground) and 5-7 minute walk to Southwark station.  There is a small Waitrose around the corner to get some tidbits. Gail's is also around the corner if you are looking for coffee, croissants, typical bakery fare.  The Tate is a 5-7 minute walk away.   

The bottom line, I would definitely consider staying at the Bankside the next time I am in London....and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later.

134,The Perfect Hotel in London,"Perfect location, staff, room/bathroom, amenities, facilities, restaurant & breakfast offering. Compliments to all for making our stay in London so wonderful. Will definitely be back to the Bankside Hotel. ",5,2023,03,29
134,Fantastic London hotel!,"We loved this hotel!  Everything about it was perfect: the outstanding service, the clean spacious rooms, the food (loved the breakfasts and the happy hour afternoon wine), the central location (we were close to everything in London), and mostly the classy but unassuming “fun” vibe.   We got a glimpse of what was to come a few weeks prior to our visit, as the friendly staff assisted us in our airport transportation.  They really went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect.  From recommendations on restaurants and fun things to see to assistance with reservations and other arrangements the staff couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful!   Their “Bankside love” motto really came through!!  We will stay here again!",5,2023,03,26
134,Excellent experience,Our stay at the Bankside Hotel far exceeded our expectations. After a long overnight trip we were warmly welcomed and were able to check in early and catch a much needed nap. The room was spacious even with the pull out sofa open. The bed was very comfortable and the room darkening shade let in no light at all. Most importantly we were unable to hear any noise outside of our room from the hallway to rooms above and below which is very unusual for any hotel. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is centrally located to many attractions and train stations. I highly recommend the Bankside. ,5,2023,03,24
134,Great Rooms even better Service,"Having stayed at this hotel many times it never disappoints.  The welcome is always friendly and service excellent.  The hotel has its own style and the thing that makes it are the great staff who work there, clearly proud of the hotel and the service they offer this shines through in the experience.

The rooms are great, the best feature being the beds which I think must be amongst the most comfortable of any hotel bed in the world, I cannot think of a better bed I have experienced.  The rooms are always well maintained and feel spacious as well.  The bathrooms include a good sized shower with excellent water pressure and very nice amenities.

The breakfast experience is a buffet by standard with the option of ordering extras from a menu.  The quality of ingredients used is of a high standards and service excellent.

Overall my best way to describe Bankside is a hotel where corners have not been cut and everythign used is of a very high standard, this is then made even better by staff who are amongst the best around, being approachable and friendly while remaining professional. 

It is easily the best Marriott Hotel in London, but it is also a hotel that for its market is probably the best in London as well, you have to spend a lot more to find anything that can compete with the combination of great staff and really good hard product,",5,2023,03,19
134,"Modern, eco-friendly hotel","We cos this hotel because its location and we were curious to see it as it is relatively new hotel. Tate museum is 5 mites by foot. It was a pleasant surprise, the modern and practical design of the room, nice service, good technical equipment, and environment friendly. Nice and thoughtful.",5,2023,03,17
134,"Great service, comfortable and spacious rooms, and convenient location!","I booked this hotel based on its great reviews, and boy, it did not disappoint! I highly recommend staying here! The service was wonderful, the room was truly spacious (we had four 20-something & 30-something overpacking girls, so that's saying something!), and we personally loved the location. It was right next to a great pub, Doggett's, and a short walk across the bridge from another great pub, Blackfriars, and a tube stop that easily took us all over the city, and about a 15 minute walk from Borough Market. We also ate at several restaurants (both classic British and Indian food) within easy walking distance to the hotel (5-10 mins), all of which were truly amazing! We felt safe, comfortable, and welcomed, and I would recommend it to friends and would gladly stay there again! ",5,2023,03,13
134,Perfect in so many ways,"I booked a stay at Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection based on reviews. I chose to use it as a home base for my spontaneous late winter holiday to London. I stayed nine nights at the hotel. The wisdom of my choice revealed itself as the trip unfolded. Everything I wanted to do was convenient to this location.

Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection is an intimate five level hotel. A stay of nine nights is plenty of time to get to know a hotel and its staff.

Room: My room was clean, comfortable, and very quiet. I was never disturbed by outside noise from the street, or inside noise from slamming doors or hallway chatter. My room had a floor-to-ceiling single window with a light-blocking electric blind. The room was equipped with a coffee maker with pods, and plenty of tea options. Housekeeping was daily and provided complimentary in-room snacks. There was even an art-kit in the room for sketching. There was a pitcher in the room for getting filtered still or sparkling water from a station outside the room. This was a very nice touch. I used my Bonvoy app to access an electronic key on my phone.

Meals: My rate included buffet breakfast in Art Yard. There were PLENTY of hot and cold options for breakfast. Since I was traveling solo, I chose to have most dinners in the hotel as well.

Wine reception: I took advantage of the 5:30 PM wine reception twice during the stay. Again, this is a nice touch.

Public spaces: Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection is set up as a gathering space. There are many sitting areas near reception and in Art Yard. My favorite spot was upstairs in the quiet mezzanine level seating space.

Staff: The staff deserve 10 stars out of 5. I felt welcome from the moment I walked in. My room was ready when I arrived at the hotel since I used precheck-in on the Bonvoy app. That was great since I had flown overnight from California and taken the London Underground to the hotel. Staff quickly remembered my name and called me by name throughout my stay. Friendly and professional staff are the backbone of a fine hotel.

Location: I used Blackfriars Station on the District Line quite a bit. The hotel is just across Blackfriars Bridge from the station. There were other options as well within walking distance. I usually stay on the Southbank when I'm in London because I enjoy walking to Borough Market, Tower Bridge, St. Paul's, Westminster Bridge, St. James's Park, etc. The hotel is very close to Tate Modern.

Fitness Center: The fitness center was adequate. But this is the one area I recommend improvement. There are 8 aerobics stations, yet only one bench. That was disappointing because the one bench was often in use when I went down to workout. Adding a second bench would improve the guest experience.

Departure: I arranged for a ride to Heathrow with reception in advance of departure. They set up cab service. The drive arrived half an hour early, which was great. He didn't rush me, but I appreciated not having to worry about my car arriving on time.

Overall: I will stay at Bankside Hotel, Autograph Collection again. I liked the relaxed, friendly, and welcoming feeling, the comfortable room and spaces, good food, and fantastic location on London's Southbank.",5,2023,03,13
134,Excellent all round hotel,"From start to finish we were so well looked after by reception, especially James.  We were made very welcome.  A very comfortable and clean room with everything you needed including the most comfortable bed ever and a perfect shower! The hotel is very well located on the South Bank, easy access and ideal for Waterloo station. The buffet breakfast was tasty and ample choice.",5,2023,02,20
134,Lofty vibes in London,"I loved the unique lofty and oversized layout of this hotel. It didn’t feel like a hotel, it felt more like a US style apartment and everything was big and oversized and generous. It’s not cheap but it’s worth it. The staff were all welcoming and the vibe and decor is completely my style. If I had one critique it would be that the restaurant was a little bit too warm at breakfast but aside from that this place is a new firm favorite of mine.",5,2023,02,19
134,Very friendly and relaxed,"I have stayed at Bankside a few times now and I really like it.  It is very clean and the rooms well appointed but with a relaxed and contemporary vibe.  Very comfy beds and pillows.  Their tea and coffee are excellent - a must have after a big night out!  The staff are great.  The location is excellent for the things I want to see and do when I visit London.  My teenagers like it too - the rooms are luxurious but cool.  I always feel welcome as these guys are not too snooty, unlike some cool London hotels.",5,2023,02,15
134,Thoroughly spoilt,"My husband and I have just spent a wonderful weekend at Bankside celebrating our wedding anniversary. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. We were thoroughly spoilt throughout our stay. Our luggage was taken to our room for us. We had a lovely lunch in the hotel before heading off to see a show. The hotel organised a taxi for us which arrived in minutes. On our return we had some drinks followed by a lovely meal in the restaurant. 
Our room was gorgeous and we both had a great nights sleep. 
Breakfast was superb, those scrambled eggs! 
We had a very refreshing weekend away and hope to return soon.",5,2023,02,13
134,Weekend away,"Nice, bed, nice pillows, no views at all, but a good location for getting around. Staff on reception are excellent.
Only gripe I have is at breakfast we were asked if we were happy with the self service buffet, which we had, but it was a self service buffet and we were hit with a 12.5% service charge, for a self service buffet £54 for two people is steep, as with any buffet it was warm, not hot and went cold before you finished it. Had to ask for a refill of filter coffee as well. Nice hotel, breakfast for the price was a let down.",4,2023,02,12
134,Perfect Choice,"Lovely hotel with beautiful decor. rooms are big and comfortable, shower is big with perfect pressure:). the location is great, few minutes walking from Tate museum (go there), Blackfriers station and Borough market (go there!). breakfast buffet is somewhat small and the same every day but excellent quality.
",5,2023,02,09
134,Bankside Hotel: Luxury Collection experience at an Autograph price,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Bankside Hotel over a two week work trip to London, giving me ample time to get to know the hotel more than a typical in-and-out stay. All I can say is, I couldn’t be a bigger fan of this property, its amenities, and the people working there. 

Before my arrival, I contacted the hotel and they were kind enough to pre-block me in a larger room thanks to my Ambassador status and long stay. Most Marriott hotels refuse to do this before arrival, but the Bankside was happy to accommodate. Off to a strong start. 

The Bankside’s location turned out to be a positive. Close to multiple rail lines, the Tate Modern, and an easy walk to the wonderful Borough Market (filled with eating options). While the neighborhood feels a little off the typical beaten path, it was fun getting to know a new spot in London. 

The room is the most important part of a stay for me, and this one did not disappoint. Super comfy bed and bedding, great modern design details, wonderful bath amenities (Grown Alchemist!), and lots of other little touches like actual milk for coffee - not the gross powdered stuff. Every floor has a complimentary water dispenser (including a sparkling option) with carafes to take back to the room. Free in-room snacks too. It’s smart and thoughtful touches like these that separate good hotels from great ones, and the Bankside is the latter. 

Daily Breakfast was included with my room (not sure if it was a status perk or the rate I booked). While food options felt slightly repetitive over a long stay, I found the service incredibly friendly, the breakfast high quality, and the avocado toast delicious (yep, I’m a Millennial). Breakfast buffets by their very nature often feel service-less, but the people working in the Bankside restaurant managed to make every morning feel truly hospitable. No time for a full breakfast? The small coffee bar turns out delicious lattes and has to-go pastries, yogurt, and fruit - and continuing the theme - is all completely free for guests.

The Bankside’s common spaces continue the hotel’s thoughtful design. A somewhat hidden floor above the lobby provides extra space to work or socialize. The lobby itself has lots of comfy nooks and crannies to enjoy their complimentary wine happy hour, meet colleagues, or just mix it up. The gym is small, but has nice new equipment, towels, and cold water.

But the best feature of this property isn’t the physical details or freebies. It’s the wonderful team members who work there. The Bankside clearly has a high-touch service culture that you can feel in every genuine, friendly, and helpful interaction across everyone (and I mean everyone) who works there. One of my favorite examples of this was a bellman who, as I was getting dropped off by a taxi, asked the cab driver if he would like to park and use the hotel restroom after a long day of driving. These small acts of kindness matter to me, and this hotel brings them with warmth and authenticity.

Being on the road for long stretches of time can take a toll, but luckily the Bankside Hotel was my new favorite Marriott property and home away from home in London. I highly recommend that you make it yours, too.",5,2023,01,30
134,It should have been a 5,"I was going to rate this hotel with a 5 but unfortunately I couldn't. The reason is that our room hadn't been made during the whole morning that we were out and when we returned tired to relax in our room it was still undone and not cleaned. 
I called the reception and they asked me if I wanted them to send someone then, to which I replied no since we wanted to nap. Despite that the cleaning lady came knocking on the door multiple times, all sweaty and stressed. 

Apart from that incident the remaining of the stay was impeccable and I'm very happy that we found this hotel for our future stays. It's new, modern, with excellent, stylish and funny design. The staff is extremely friendly too and I love the reception area, that makes you feel like you enter a house, with its huge, gorgeous table, and seats. It's so much warmer than the typical reception desk that resembles more an airport check in than a hotel.

We also had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, twice, the food was excellent and the staff professional and friendly.",4,2023,01,20
134,"Super friendly staff, great location, arty, fun, perfect city hotel","Best cappuccino a hotel ever served me, so for that already highly recommended. We felt so welcome by the friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was very fresh and many options. The room was spotless and very silent and the bed comfy. The location is great and so close to tate modern and make sure to take the Uber boat  (towards tate Britain) to see the city from the Thames, incredible! Hope to come back.",5,2023,01,17
134,Amazing Christmas at the Bankside,"We stayed at the Bankside for 6 nights over the Christmas holiday and it did not disappoint. The location was a walkable distance to several great attractions in London (Millennium Bridge, Tower Bridge, London Eye, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace).  

We are a family of 3 with our son being 10 - they had our room ready for us upon check in with the sofa pullout already made up for my son when we got to the room. Our room was decent size for a European hotel, with the king bed and pull out sofa made up, there was still plenty of space to move around comfortably. The storage space was ample with the closet, shelves and drawers for putting all our stuff away. The bed was raised so we were able to store all of our suitcases under to make more room.

There were plenty of outlets and USB ports throughout the room for all of our devices and my son loved that the curtains were controlled by a button on the wall, which provided a nice blackout situation in the room. 

There is a mini-fridge (not very cold) in the room, along with a coffee/tea maker, a nice select of teas, flavored popcorn replenished daily and near the elevators, they had a self service water station with cold, room temp and sparkling water with glass carafes available to use. 

The bathroom was nicely appointed with the most incredible product from Grown Alchemist, which I think is now my favorite hotel amenity smell. So amazing!! 

The front desk attendants were all so gracious and helpful with giving directions, hailing a taxi, etc. 

We didn't eat at the restaurant but had drinks a few nights at the bar. 

Overall, we would definitely stay here again - it was a lovely stay.",5,2023,01,17
134,"A solid, high-end stay on the Southbank .","Very happy with this hotel - it's modern, chic and our room was large and comfortable. Check-in was easy-going, with lots of friendly chat,and a very welcoming atmosphere .
We did have a slight issue - which meant we had to do some chasing to enable contact with the hotel itself to query some issues after our stay. Im very happy to say the manager got hold of us once the issue had been brought to their attention, and it was dealt with quickly, effectively and generously. This is very much in line with the positive Marriott experiences we have had elsewhere, so were pleased at such a positive and attentive resolution. In particular I was very impressed at how the Hotel manager dealt with our query. The hotel is still fairly new - maybe a little too far from easy public transport - especially to tourists not familiar with the area. But the area itself is a good base to explore from, if you are happy to be a bit more independent, and be away from teh crowds of the West End. Borough Market and London Bridge Station is maybe a 25 minute walk away - and the same in the other direction if you want to get to Waterloo. Its nice to be so close to so many up and coming bars , restaurants, and trendy attractions like The Tate Modern. Breakfast was good - decent coffee, attentive staff and a pretty standard food offering - nothing amazingly different or unique, but nice enough. We're big fans of this area, and have now stayed at most of the Bankside hotels . If you can get a cheap rate then this is a fairly decent option - its not as eye-catching as Sea Containers, but its cheaper, and the service is of a very similar standard. For my money the rooms at Native bankside are a bit larger, and the location is much better - but you can do a lot worse than the Bankside Autograph. Staff and service at the hotel were of a very high standard, and we would be happy to return.",4,2023,01,10
134,We loved this hotel from the moment we arrived,"My family of 3 spent 10 nights here and we can't recommend it highly enough. For me the key components of a great hotel are: welcoming staff, quiet rooms, comfy beds, and delicious food. Bankside Hotel was 5 stars on all of these. 

The staff are the standouts here. When we first walked in we weren't sure we were in the right place because the front desk staff were sitting at tables rather than standing. But we quickly realized this is part of how they make the experience so friendly and comfortable. They asked us to sit down, offered us a drink, and made us feel right at home. The homey vibe continued for the rest of our trip. The staff go out of their way to solve any problem. For example, I like to read the newspaper in print. No problem, they ran out to grab a copy every morning. 

One of my pet peeves is when pricey hotels nickel and dime you for any little extra. Not the Bankside. Want a hot chocolate or an espresso in the afternoon? The staff are happy to go make it--at no charge.

We loved the location. You are so close to the heart of London, but being just across the river (it's a 5 minute walk to cross the river) brought a certain peace and quiet.

One word of warning: the rooms aren't big. We had the room they advertise as a ""generous"" guest room with 2 queens. It was sufficient, but I wouldn't call it generous. I'd avoid anything smaller than that.

Bottom line:  We'll never stay anywhere but the Bankside on our future trips to London.",5,2023,01,07
134,Amazing hidden gem in London City - already booked a return visit!,"Amazing little hotel in the city - a newly opened hotel so not yet on the beaten path. Staff were so friendly and helpful (especially the doorman who was so lovely and helped with all my bags), the decor and vibe was funky and really warm and the food was great. Rooms were clean, very quiet and had super comfy beds. I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels in the city and this is my new favourite - I’ve already booked a return visit in February!",5,2023,01,03
134,Great experience over Christmas!,"Our experience was amazing. Every staff member we interacted with was kind, caring, and professional. Our room was cleaned perfectly each day, and all meals in the restaurants. were great. The front desk staff was outstanding, every single one of them. The hotel itself is immaculate and is well located for walking everywhere or using the public transportation system. The front desk even gave two Christmas gifts to our son, since we stayed there over the Christmas season. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.
The artwork was unique, as were the various furnishings set up all around. Even the ceiling in our room and walls in the bathroom had unique textures. The food and drinks really stood out as super high quality. The staff took great care in preparing and serving every meal. A five-star experience all around!",5,2023,01,02
134,Chic Experience,"My second time staying here, the Decor and Rooms are nice. The only thing it is missing is a pool, other than that I can't fault it! 

A very Clean & Comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2023,01,02
134,Lucked out with this phenomenal hotel find!,"We walked in the door at 6 am after an overnight flight and were greeted (thank you Richard) by name and given coffee with such grace that you felt like they had been waiting for you. We traveled when there were train and tube strikes - the front helped us arrange airport transfers and always had a smile and time to give directions and suggestions. They did this without being invasive and our room had a gorgeous view of the south bank. So close to Shakespeare’s globe , the Blackfriars train station and walking distance to the London eye. Great bar. Great restaurant and the bedding and towels will spoil you!",5,2023,01,01
134,Wonderful,"Great stay
This hotel has a lot of nice little touches!

Welcome drink on arrival 

Filtered water (still and sparkling) available on each floor 

Turndown 

Good location near Underground Rails

Modern rooms aka USBs, Nespresso, high end bedding 

Our rate included breakfast and it was wonderful. Large buffet. 

I hurt my foot on this trip and the Manager Diana helped me get to the airport quickly. She was so empathetic. Thank you Diana. 

Quick replies to chat messages asking questions such as where to go for dinner. 

I see why this hotel is #7!",5,2022,12,31
134,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel!,"What a fantastic hotel. I 1 stayed at the Bankside four times in 2022 and wouldn't think of staying anywhere elseFrom the amazing service provided by the restaurant managers (shoutout to Ellis and Andrea) to the folks at the front desk I always felt well taken care of. Amazing location in the arts district with close proximity to trains and underground. The mid-century warmth and vibe of the place is second to none. I travel globally for work and I'd not hesitate to recommend the Bankside Hotel to anyone, hands down!",5,2022,12,27
134,Super hospitality,"I’ve stayed in hundreds of hotels and most are average however Bankside is a cut above the rest. Great service, a wonderful room and fantastic position in the city …
From checkin to checkout friendly staff ready to help in any way!
The next trip to London will certainly include this pearl of a hotel .",5,2022,12,26
134,Best service!!!,"Our first trip out to London from the U.S.. Bankside is one of the most beautiful, modern, clean hotels we have ever seen. Fantastic location, close to everything including the Tube 0.3 miles away. After a long trip, as soon as we arrived, we were immediately greeted with warm friendly smiles, an offering to sit down, and a drink! As we were checked in they acknowledged our Platnum Bonvoy status and extended the complimentary breakfast to the entire family of four. Speaking of breakfast- wow!!!! What a feast! My son has major food allergies and could easily fill up with the options of gourmet sausages, perfectly sunny side up eggs, fruit, fantastic charcuterie board. Etc.  Water filling jugs including sparkling water on every floor. Our trip was unfortunately affected by the Eurostar strike where we had to change our plans to Paris and leave London a day early. Because we booked at the Bankside at a non refundable price, the staff here made arrangements for us to use that same credit at a later date when we return in a few days. Kudos and thank you to this exceptionally kind staff, especially Mohamed, who was active and immediately responsive during all in person and email communications!! Do not hesitate booking here!! You will not regret it.",5,2022,12,24
134,Great place for team events ,"This place is absolutely amazing! The rooms are luxurious, the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. All our needs were anticipated and our expectations were exceeded. My favourite experience was dinner that I’ve organised for my team at the restaurant. We were welcomed by the amazing David, who introduced us to a special Christmas cocktail- delicious! No one could stop at one! The food was fantastic, waiting time was ideal as the staff made sure to allow us just enough time to chat as well between meals and our dinner had a lovely flow to it.All the wines that we were recommended were fabulous. There are plenty great options to choose from on the menu and quite a good range of plant based options and that is something I really appreciate as a vegetarian but there were many options for the meat lovers too.The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and all of us felt like we didn’t want to leave. Definitely an experience to repeat, highly recommend this lovely hotel and I can’t wait to go back !",5,2022,12,19
134,Wonderful welcoming stay,"Recently visited London for family weekend Christmas break and a celebration.

Hotel I must say from the point of arrival really impressed me as you immediately begin to relax on check in.

Check in excellent and the team really helpful and whilst checking in could not do enough to make you immediately feel comfortable with welcome tea and water etc.

Room excellent and spacious with lovely little touches and spacious with Nespresso machine and lots lovely little extras.

It was birthday celebration and the team left us a lovely card and surprise which was lovely touch.

Location excellent from getting around Southbank, London and all the transport links.

Lots of things to do nearby.

Breakfast very good and we also enjoyed our lunch.

For sure when next in would definitely stay again and can see why the hotel has been rated so highly.",5,2022,12,11
134,Wonderful stay at a terrific property,"My wife and I took a quick trip over Thanksgiving to London and chose the Bankside because of its location and size.  It is very much like a boutique property, and has a great feel.  Perfect location for walking just about anywhere.  We walked to Harrods twice, Buckingham Palace and many other locations over our 4 day trip.  The staff are incredibly accommodating and friendly.  We checked in with Mohammed, who was informative and provided some great info on the property and surrounding area.  Manuel and Eduardo seem to be on duty 24/7 and were very gracious in providing support for any requests that we had.  We dined in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and really enjoyed our interactions with Kasha and Valencio.  Flatbreads are very tasty.
The rooms are very comfy, and housekeeping does an exceptional job of working around the guest timelines.
We would definitely consider this property on a return trip.",5,2022,11,30
134,Great London Hotel,Very modern hotel.  The service at this hotel is exceptional.  Great location.  Close to the Blackfriar tube station and Tate Modern.  Breakfast was great.  The staff is happy to call a cab or make you a coffee.  We really enjoyed this experience.,5,2022,11,29
134,Wonderful overnight stay,"Had a wonderful overnight stay at this beautiful hotel this week.    Could not fault anything.    Firstly their reception layout is brilliant - informal and friendly.   The hotel hosts a wine hour early evening in reception which is a lovely idea - unfortunately we were unable to attend as had to leave the hotel at 5 to get to the ABBA arena!! Our room on the second floor was lovely - probably had the best night's sleep in any hotel I've ever stayed in - bed and pillows perfect.    There is everything you would need - tea and coffee, iron and ironing board and gorgeous bathroom products.   Breakfast next morning was superb with plenty of choice, including a full English.   The staff are so friendly too.    The hotel is in a great location with wonderful views over the river.    Have no hesitation in recommending this beautiful hotel.",5,2022,11,17
134,BEST LONDON STAY!,This is your London hotel! The bed is extremely comfortable but most impressed with the service. Mohammed checked us in and was very kind greeting us with hot tea. He flawlessly introduced us to Manuel who was incredible! He showed us to our room and explained all of the features told us where to find the breakfast which was exquisite. He really made our stay memorable with his kind greetings and gestures. He deserves a raise! We will definitely be back next year to stay at bank side hotel. ,5,2022,11,07
134,Amazing hotel/Team and the best stay,"What an amazing stay. From the moment we walked in we were greeted in such a friendly way and offered a drink after a long journey.
We stayed 3 days with our daughter Sophie and all the team were amazing from reception to breakfast.

Great location for shows Wicked was great and close by.

Amazing team!

Great rooms and a nice gym.

We will be back and Richard who we met thanks so much for our stay pass on my thanks to your reception team Mohammed and the lovely staff that checked us in. Your waitress at breakfast long dark hair so sorry I did not get her name was great.

Thanks again and we will be back to an a real great personal hotel.

134,beautiful hotel in excellent location BUT poor tourist concierge skills,"I traveled to see the Green Bay Packers play an NFL game in London on Oct. 9, 2022.  In searching for a hotel, I was impressed by the online reviews for this facility.  I was, however, disappointed by what I found.  As an Ambassador-level member with Marriott, I have stayed at hotels all over the world.  While this hotel is beautiful physically and has some appealing features, it is sadly lacking in one key area:  the staff has little tourist information knowledge of London.  This is odd and, also, somewhat striking.

One of the first things I did when I arrived was to ask to speak to the concierge.  I was told by the man at reception, that though the hotel does not employ a concierge, he would certainly be able to help me.  When I asked about the NFL game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, it was clear that he had no knowledge of the upcoming event or how to get to it.  He went on his computer and was, only then, able to provide transportation information.  To my amazement, the next morning at breakfast in the hotel dining room, maybe 10 or so guests were dressed in green Packer jerseys.  It was not just me who had come to this hotel to see the NFL play, but lots of others; yet, the staff were not really prepared to assist us.   One of the reception staff actually provided me with directions to the old Tottenham Hotspurs stadium.  Apparently, a new stadium had been built in the last couple of years.  And this lacking of the hotel’s employees carried over into other activities.  For instance, when I asked about how to get to Harrods, the lady had to go on her computer to supply directions.  Eventually, I eschewed the front desk altogether, something I have never done during my travels at other international hotels, and ended up using my cellphone for directions to major local tourist attractions.

On the slightly brighter side, this hotel has some nice features.  It is relatively new, so the building is mostly bright and shiny.  It is in downtown London, near the Thames Rivers and an Underground (subway) station.  It has art pieces and an art motif, throughout.  On each floor they have in the hallway a sort of water station with 3 choices:  cold, moderately heated, and bubbly water.  And, this facility apparently takes fire safety seriously.  There are all kinds of fire signs prominently posted throughout the building, fire extinguishers in full view on the floor in the hallway (in a tasteful manner), and they even have a sort of fire drill on Friday afternoons (as it turned out, I was fighting jet lag having arrived Friday morning from the U.S. when the fire alarm went off).  The breakfast, which was included in my room rate as an Ambassador benefit, was excellent, both healthy and delicious.  They even have a vegan option, which I tried.  They have a pantry next to the dining room, where they leave out fresh fruit all day for people to take, a nice touch.  They have cute “vending” machines on each floor which dispense not just potato chips and Diet Coke, but also expensive bottles of white wine and champagne.

There is no gift shop, no ice machines on each floor, no pool, no Marriott lounge for Ambassador/Titanium/Platinum members, and no business center.  If you want to go online on a desktop/laptop, they will let you use a front desk computer, but that seems a bit cumbersome.  The name of the hotel, “Bankside Hotel,” confused me, as there is no major banking center nearby.  As an employee explained, the building is near the bank of the Thames.

A positive note about the staff is that they are generally very friendly and some are willing to go out of their way to provide extra help.  The restaurant manager, David, was particularly helpful.  At one point, I needed to go to the local drugstore one night right before it was set to close, and a staff member walked with me out of the hotel to point me in the right direction.  This was much appreciated.

Overall, this is a pretty good hotel but it has a glaring weakness for tourists, particularly for international travelers.",4,2022,10,19
134,Amazing staff and overall experience,"There's a reason this hotel is ranked so highly. The staff is simply amazing and the hotel is gorgeous. We arrived from an overnight flight and I was feeling awful. The front desk got me a cup of tea and went to work on finding us a room that was ready so we could check in early and I could lie down. The room was gorgeous and spacious. Fortunately, I felt much better after a two-hour nap and a shower. From there, the service only got better. Front desk staff consistently gave us advice on seeing the sights, public transportation, etc., and often got us a taxi when we needed one. The breakfast buffet was delicious and diverse -- I don't eat meat, so I appreciated the mushrooms! You can ask for a coffee or latte at any time of day or night and someone will make one for you. And the water in the hallways included room temperature, cold, and sparkling. I have never seen that in a hotel! We ordered room service three times when we were too exhausted to go out, and each time it was fast and delicious. The hotel is near at least two metro stations, and yet at the end of a long day it's in a quiet neighborhood. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that our six nights here were magnificent and we can't wait to get back to London!",5,2022,10,18
134,Best place in London.,"All I can say is WOW. This hotel was amazing. Sure, the location is a bit off the beaten path from the London attractions, but you’re not far from the tube. Also, the front desk staff are AMAZING. All of my questions, they quickly answered and helped me with solutions. Breakfast buffet was delicious, too. My favorite were the croissants. The beds are comfortable, the rooms extremely clean and modern, and the staff will do everything in their power to make you feel welcomed. They called me a taxi to get back to the airport, and they were so professional that the cab driver came to greet me in the lobby! How amazing! I will definitely be back.",5,2022,10,14
134,People are what makes a hotel experience Wonderful!,"I have travelled all over the world and to a lot of hotels. I had visited London for 4 days and wish that I had booked my stay for much longer. Your staff is Excellent! I was first greeted by Raquel upon my arrival she was very warm, professional and exceptional. Michaela was also very kind and personable. Edwaurdo offered to always help me with anything and he did the entire stay. Sebastian asked me if I would like coffee and he made me the best coffee and espresso that I have ever had in any hotel. I thought that I was in Italy. Alvis the night lobby attendee was a welcome back from a long day out and about. 
Breakfast every morning was especially special thanks to Andrea! Andrea is a real gem and amazing asset to your hotel and all of the Bonvoy family of hotels. She is so genuine, caring and went far and beyond in every way to make breakfast and espresso time totally amazing. No words can describe how valuable she truly is. Haijei was also very wonderful. Whoever hired your staff and especially Andrea and Sebastian is a truly exceptional hiring manager. Everything about your hotel was unique, clean, with great decor and once again the most impressive staff I have ever experienced! They all need appreciated and recognized. I live in the United States and will be back very soon thanks to your group.
Definitely 5 Stars due to your amazing people...",5,2022,10,13
134,Excellent all around,"We booked the Bankside mainly because of the availability of a room with two queen beds, which was a must for us. But it was such a great hotel in every way. Our room was comfortable and quiet and a very generous size, the service was fabulous from literally everyone we encountered, the breakfast was good. Although it's not in one of the kind of best-known areas for tourists to stay, it was within walking distance of a number of things and very accessible to public transit. We were just really happy all around.",5,2022,10,12
134,"Great hotel, great staff","I would give this hotel ten stars if I could. It's very comfortable, quiet and clean but the real stand out are the employees. Every single employee is kind, warm and hospitable. I don't know where the management has found these exceptional people! Andrea, hostess in the restaurant, knew my room number by the second day and knew my preferences. Svetelina made sure all my gluten free needs were taken care of. Sebastian made my drinks with a warm hello every day. Dimbou was always there to help with a smile. Mohammad at the front desk went out of his way to help whenever I needed anything. Also, because I have to do back exercises on the floor, I get to see how clean or dirty hotel rooms really are. Let me assure you, this hotel is clean. Even the places that guests don't see, like under the beds, are very clean. A shout out to the fabulous housekeeping staff!
This hotel is also fabulously located, walking distance to the theater district, museums, and great restaurants. Can't wait to return!",5,2022,10,10
134,Great hotel,"What a fantastic hotel! 
I was down in London with my girlfriend for the London Marathon.
The hotel was beautiful and the rooms were nice and spacious.
The location was just perfect as you have Blackfriars train station that is a minute walk away and the underground is just across the bridge(5 minute walk). We will definitely stay here again,we felt welcome throughout our stay and the staff were so friendly. Thank you for making the weekend even more special!",5,2022,10,10
134,Top marks,"After a big long haul journey it was nice to check in to this upmarket hotel perfectly situated  to witness the wonderful British tradition of queuing just across the road . All walks of society were so respectful in wanting to pay their final respects to Her Majesty The Queen. 
The hotel was super comfortable, friendly and up to date. We slept like babies",5,2022,09,30
134,Moving on up,"Bankside Hotel.  You walk in to this lovely sweet smelling reception area to a smiling receptionist named James who basically takes care of all your questions and needs.  

You walk through the lobby and you see all this cool modern funky art. As an old person just being there made me feel like a young London hipster.  

As we went to our room they had this cool vending machine. I know who's ever heard of such.  I can't explain it. You just have to see it.  They also had free water stations throughout the hotel which I appreciate from an environmental perspective. 

We had a large double bed room with the softest robes and a bath tub.  Great decor and wonderful coffee maker.  

The gym had a Peleton, rowing machine along with all the usual weights and treadmills.  

Location was pleasant with views of the Thames as you walk along the path.  

If you want a little splurge and some wonderful service this is the place.",5,2022,09,26
134,Great Hotel and Staff,"The hotel is situated about halfway between the London Eye and Tower Bridge, so a great location. The staff were excellent and extremely helpful. The room was bright and well-equipped. We will be back!",5,2022,09,26
134,Can’t trust the staff,"Overall a good stay but some issues arose that indicate poor communication problems. Room was great - had some nice tech features we had not seen before. The vending machine by the elevators with the emergency engagement ring and other items was very entertaining. Location was great. (There is no “perfect” location in London, it’s just too big and spread out.) Staff was nice, always someone at “front desk” table. They even exchanged a Scottish £5 note for a British note that we had received in London during our trip. Problems were at check-in/check-out. At least 3-4 times during our stay I asked the front desk about a taxi to Heathrow. Everyone gave same answer: £84 - flat rate, if they arrange it. They also wouldn’t make a reservation, said that we should let front desk know 10 minutes before we need it. Go to check out and order it. While checking out, told for first time that there was an expense for my child at the breakfast buffet. We were told at checkin that breakfast was included in room due to Bonvoy status. Never received a bill/check at breakfast either. As soon as balked at the charge the manager waived it. Finish checkout and taxi arrives. Front desk employee goes to talk to him before we get in vehicle. Driver does not know where we are going. We tell him Heathrow. On the way to airport, he stops for gas! While stopped for gas, the meter is running! Don’t think much about it because it’s supposed to be a flat rate. Get to airport and he says the fee is almost £100! What kind of operation is this? (We even have the receipt.) While at airport I use the Bonvoy app chat section to complain, and no one ever responds. Went from great stay to leaving a bad taste in our mouths. Will look elsewhere next time as I can’t trust this hotel in the future.",3,2022,09,20
134,Super service and warm design,"We had a truly pleasant stay at Bankside when guesting friends’ wedding in London. The atmosphere, rooms and restaurant facilities were really great, safeguarded by constant on-toes service-minded staff. All from reception, waiters, house-keeping, consierge, etc. 
We were happy guests and wish to come back soon again.",5,2022,09,19
134,Great visit,"We stayed for 6 nights and had a beautiful visit.   Rooms was very nice and clean.  Breakfast was great.  Especially the cappuccino.    The Bartender, Benson, was the best.    We told multiple people about his drink making skills.   Excellent Scottish Coffee!   Front desk staff was great also!   Perfect location.",5,2022,09,16
134,My new London regular,"Really really like the Bankside hotel.  Great location to access both St. Pauls and the western side of the financial district as well as Borough market. Not perfect in terms of tube stops but not bad either.  

Hotel itself is very very clean and daily housekeeping did a really nice job. Has a minimalist Scandinavian feel. Bathroom is modern looking and decent sized, but nothing really over the top.

Restaurant/bar was a highlight. Breakfast was freshly cooked and there were both stations and a la carte options.  It was a “real” restaurant and bar - not a sad hotel version of a restaurant that you sometimes get.  

Staff was very nice and friendly. I had an issue with my passport and they jumped into action. Was very much appreciated.  

5* in terms of value and worthy of “Autograph collection” label.    Cool and trendy vibe although a slight step down in luxury from a Ritz Carlton or St Regis - but they certainly aren’t charging those prices either so not a complaint. Just framing what visitors should expect.  Appropriate for business or pleasure.  Families too esp with older kids.

134,Superb Hotel,"I stayed at the Bankside hotel to celebrate my partners’s birthday and the hotel was superb. The cleanliness, the service, the team looking after things for us was just excellent! Nothing was too much trouble and indeed my partner and I both felt relaxed and chilled after what has been a tough few years. I would recommend the Bankside hotel above all others in London for all the reasons mentioned and it is also situated in an ideal location. Well done to the Bankside Hotel!",5,2022,09,08
134,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I stayed a couple of nights at this amazing hotel to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary! Over the years we have stayed at so many different hotels all over the world. However our experience at Bankside Hotel was the best ever! From the moment we walked in we felt the friendliness of the staff. Mohamed from the front desk checked us in and as soon as he found out about our anniversary we were offered a glass of wine! We went out and came back a few hours later and were so surprised to find a bouquet of flowers, bottle of Prosecco, Chocolates and a delicious Carrot cake. We were so touched by their thoughtfulness! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The Hotel is clean, room is comfortable and the food and service was outstanding. We really enjoyed our stay there and wished we had stayed longer! We will be back soon. We would like to thank Mohamed and the rest of the team for going over and above what was expected of them. We appreciate your thoughtfulness and amazing service!",5,2022,09,06
134,Awesome hotel,"This trip is our first time in London. We stayed here for 4 nights.The staff were very welcoming gave us drink the moment we sat down. Eduardo went to the room with us  and showed us what we have in the room. There is a small refrigerator, safe ,and an espresso machine. All the staff are very helpful and nice but we specifically want  to thank Eduardo  who is so  awesome. He went above and beyond in the services he gave us. He will meet us in the door if he sees us coming and greet us. He always checks on us and check if we need anything. He recommended restaurants and showed us how to get to the places  we wanted to go. He showed us the tube station and taught us how to use the bus. He made us so comfortable and to feel like we're at home. He literally will spend time talking to us answering any questions we have, even gave us tip for Paris. The hotel is very clean and they beautifully decorated our room for our anniversary. The bed  and pillows were so comfy. We are very satisfied and happy  with the hotel! We will definitely stay there again if we had to go back to London.",5,2022,09,05
134,Visiting with Family,"Myself, my wife along with my daughter, son, daughter in law and grandson spent three nights at the Bankside on our first trip to London. We were a bit skeptical when we booked because we are use to staying at larger name hotels. This being a Marriott/Bonvoy gave us some ease. This is a mid size hotel. So you don’t have that traffic you find at the larger hotels and the cramp you might find at the smaller boutique hotels. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are perfect in size. The folks at the front,  from the reception to the gentlemen handling  your luggage and answering your questions were polite, professional and made you feel very welcomed. We had the breakfast included with our rooms and I can’t say a bad thing about that either. The selection was adequate and all the items from the coffee to the bread was fresh and of very good quality. We left there with not one bad thing to say. When we come back to London, will definitely stay there again.",5,2022,08,31
134,Ryan webb,"Stayed here after a day/night out, staff are lovely very welcoming and offering drinks on arrival.
Rooms are very clean and had plenty of teas and coffees in room , beds are very comfy one off the best nights sleep",5,2022,08,31
134,We loved it.,"We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel.  We stayed here for 3 nights out of a 17 night vacation and it was by far our favorite.  There wasn’t one thing that I could think of that would be a negative of the hotel.  The staff was amazing and made a very strong effort to care for the guests and even memorized the guests names.  This is the hotel that we will compare all others against.  We particularly liked Richard and Benson, two of the staff members.  They were amazing.",5,2022,08,28
134,"Aesthetically perfect hotel, great service","This was perhaps the most aesthetically perfect hotel my partner and I have stayed at, the attention to detail is amazing. Robes so wonderful we actually bought two to take home (which I'd always viewed as a weird thing to do), the most comfortable bed I can remember ever sleeping in, luxurious towels, solid heavy water glasses, etc. Also some of the best service we've had, everyone was extraordinary, from welcoming us with prosecco while we checked in to promptly mailing to us in the States the sandals my partner had left behind. Would particularly like to single out Mohammed Hassan, but everyone we interacted with was amazing. We will definitely make this our base for future trips to London.",5,2022,08,27
134,Brilliant hotel and lovely staff,"Everything about our stay at bankside was excellent. 
The staff were warm and welcoming. The food was great and the room was lovely. A welcome retreat from a very hot weekend in London.
Plus the pillows are so comfy I wanted to take them home!",5,2022,08,26
134,Incredible Staff incredible Stay,"I cannot say enough about this property. I booked it as a honeymoon present for my daughter and son-in-law. The hotel staff responded with incredible service and made it a memorable stay. Thanks to Richard, the senior manager for providing the personal touch.",5,2022,08,24
134,Impeccable in every way.,"We booked one night at the Bankside hotel to use as a layover before our flight back to the US after visiting family in the UK. We booked two rooms for our family of 5. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and all offered a welcome beverage. In addition, our three children were made to feel just as welcome as they were each given a London souvenir.  Check in was easy, our bags were taken to our room and a gentleman (wish I’d got his name) took the time to show me a map of the area and all the sights we could see in the few hours we were in London. The rooms were spacious, immaculate and had complimentary drinks and snacks.  Both rooms had beautiful bathrooms, huge beds and luxurious lotions and shampoos (I was already a fan of Grown Alchemist products).  In the evening upon our return to the hotel, the same kind Brazilian gentleman offered us a welcome beverage again (since I’d only had water upon check in). He made my three sons delicious hot chocolate and my husband and I enjoyed a drink from the bar. He also arranged for a taxi to pick us up from the hotel in the morning for our flight, so we went to bed feeling prepared and relaxed and well taken care of.  The hotel has a very laid back, luxury vibe. The service is nothing short of impeccable. Above and beyond. We’ve been very fortunate to stay in a few luxury hotels in our years of traveling, I’d put our experience at Bankside right up there at the top. The breakfast buffet in the morning was delicious. The sausages were phenomenal! Wish we could have stayed longer and will most certainly visit again when we are next in London. Five very well earned stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️",5,2022,08,23
134,Excellent London Hotel,"My wife and I stayed for one night as we were were meeting friends in London and we were very happy with our choice. We live in Hong Kong so London is always a treat to visit. Location is excellent for the Southbank. We got a train to Blackfriars station which is located  on Blackfriars bridge itself and it was a few minutes walk from the station. It's on the side road right opposite a big pub called the Doggett's Coat and Badge ( we used the pub too and its very nice). The hotel is in easy walking distance (10-20 mins) to the National Theatre and the Royal Festival Hall. If you like street food, the Southbank food centre behind the festival hall is worth a visit. We also had dinner at Brasserie Blanc (15 min walk)  which was excellent food and service, sensibly priced and has a causal environment.
Now onto the hotel itself. We were very warmly greeted on arrival and check-in was very quick and conducted in a professional, friendly manner by a very hospitable Spanish (I think) lady. We were recognised for being Bonvoy members and we were kindly given an upgrade to a larger King room. The hotel is relatively new so everything is in good working order and general cleanliness was excellent. The room itself was big, the beds were so comfortable they were hard to leave. air conditioning was quiet and efficient, bathrooms spotlessly clean with powerful showers, soft drinks, snacks, tea and coffee were all  complimentary. The black out blinds also helped when it came to a great nights sleep   I drink a lot of water and the water stations on each floor, providing warm water or cold still/sparking water was a godsend. A large water jug is provided in-room and  we topped that up as and when needed. An excellent idea which I wish more hotels would offer. They kindly afforded us a late check out , for which we were vary grateful and the check out process was equally efficient and friendly. Simply put, the Bankside Hotel was excellent in every department and if you are searching for London hotels look no further. This is the one.",5,2022,08,15
134,Lovely hotel with nice extras!,"We had a really nice experience at this hotel. Our flight arrived at 6 a.m. from Heathrow so we were not expecting to be able to check in right away when we arrived in the morning. We were hoping to just store our bags there until check in but the staff was able to get us to our room early. It was so nice to be able to get a shower before touring London a bit to stay awake and beat jet lag.

The beds are comfortable, the showers have fabulous water pressure. In the evenings, they have a reception where you can get a complimentary glass of wine. We also liked the sparkling water dispensers in the hallway. The staff consistently went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating. One evening, when my husband ordered Uber Eats, the front desk manager offered to bring it to our room with plates and utensils after it arrived.

We would definitely stay again.",5,2022,08,10
134,Excellent,"Have just returned from a 6 night stay at this conveniently located, highly recommended  hotel where we were treated exceptionally well. 
I didn’t realize they have a little welcome reception daily (except Friday) around 5. But when I asked about it last Friday, we were promptly served a complimentary glass of wine.
The sparkling/still hallway water system was down for repairs on our floor.
Breakfast items seemed to be the same each day but they were fresh and tasty. We enjoyed Lattes and delicious Hot Chocolate.
For our early morning departure staff prepared a takeaway bog with a latte/hot chocolate.",5,2022,08,02

134,Great hotel,Excellent hotel very well located top class rooms service and everything. Had recent business trip and was delighted with everyone and everything at this fairly modern hotel. Rooms are well decorated and beds are so comfortable so a good nights sleep is assured. Bar is hip and has great atmosphere,5,2022,07,30
134,Modern amenities in a convenient location,"This hotel wowed us from check-in, providing us with some delicious chocolates as an anniversary present and offering a cute stuffed animal for our daughter to keep as gift.  The hotel decor and feel of this place is noticeably modern, noticeable not only in the unique structural elements and cheeky art incorporated throughout but also with the clustered desks and low chairs replacing the traditional stand-up check-in counters at most hotels.  

But it was the amenities that was the star of this hotel.  From the water dispensers in the hallway on every floor that dispensed cold, hot, and sparkling water, to button-activated mesh and black-out shades in the rooms, to snacks/ tea/ coffee/ water bottles/ cans in the room that are replenished daily, the hotel was equipped with all of the convenience that a modern traveler could ask for.  

Although the breakfast buffet offerings remained the same day to day, there was enough variety to keep the whole family satisfied for a 4 nights' stay.  I especially liked the coffee and baked goods offering, as well as the hash browns and yogurt.  

There was a railway union strike during our stay which necessitated using Uber/ taxi to get around, but the rides were relatively short based on the fairly close proximity of this hotel to some of the major landmarks.  There are definitely more conveniently situated hotels north of the Thames where we could have stayed, but I'm glad we chose this hotel since it was so uniquely different from where we'd stayed in the first half of our journey (Westin Paris Vendome).",5,2022,07,24
134,"This is a true 5-star hotel, in a great location.Staff is outstanding.","We stayed at this hotel when they first open and fell in love with this hotel and it’s staff. This hotel is in a great spot if you are visiting London.
It’s next to Blackfriars bridge.
We spent 12-days this time and believe me it was worth every penny.
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,07,24
134,Best hotel for business trips in the city,"-I stayed here for the first time pre-pandemic and really like this place, am staying there every time when in London for business
-the location is awesome  - at least when your meeting location is somewhere around St Paul’s as you can walk along the bank side and then take the millennial bridge into the city 
-the staff is nice, e.g. I have been offered a pint upon arrival when checking in
-the rooms are nice and new and the beds are very comfortable you will sleep well in them
-overall the hotel is living a sustainability concept which really appeals to me, for example there are Glas jugs on each floor in the hallway which you can fill up on a fountain and take into your room (instead of using plastic water bottles) or the shampoo/shower gel bottles in the shower are refillable so they don’t need to place hundreds of small plastic bottles into their rooms every day (smart!!)
-only thing that needs improvement is the kitchen, had dinner in the restaurant a few times and was so far disappointed with the quality of the food",5,2022,07,21

Lovely amenities and an A1 staff!  A special shout out to Mimi and Eduardo who went above and beyond for us (even though everyone does).  You are always warmly greeted by the staff when walk back in from the days activities.  Loved the great location, it was close to everything (London Eye, restaurants, Big Ben).  I loved the fact that is was a smaller hotel and felt more like a ""boutique"" hotel.   They definitely made us feel special during our entire stay.",5,2022,07,10
134,Hotel that made with love,"The hotel with artistic, modern, beautiful design, where every detail is special! 
Lovely, beautiful, joyful people met us upon arrival and looked after us throughout the stay!  Thank you Soyful, Richard, Diana, Alina, Aida, Viktoria, James and Elis for making me and my friend very welcome at the Bankside hotel! 
Everything is made with love, care and fun here, to make your guests feel like home! After a long day exploring London, all you need is the perfectly comfortable bed that makes you feel rested and relaxed next day. Beautiful clean bedrooms, water fountains in the corridors, fun vending machines with necessary items like sparkling pants and emergency engagement rings…😜 And the final touch is the artist in residence, who is happy to share his experience how to create a contemporary art!

The hotel is beautiful and have immaculate rooms. Most luxurious and comfortable bed and some lovely furnishings to the room. Absolutely love artworks that you can find all over the hotel.

Always greeted with a warm welcome the minute you step into the reception , the staff go above and beyond to make you feel special , lots of lovely touches as the staff were aware it was my birthday . 
The rooms and communal areas in this hotel are fabulous , spotlessly clean and have everything you could possibly need . The bed and bedding are so comfy always guaranteed a great night sleep . 
Very extensive buffet style breakfast beautifully presented . 
Excellent location , can’t wait to come back again . Thank you Bankside .",5,2022,06,30
134,"Beautiful hotel in quiet neighborhood, but close to the Tube","The staff and service at the Bankside was what really stood out. We arrived in London from the States, and were exhausted from our flight with a 3 hour delay. We were warmly welcomed at the Bankside, given seats and offered water or a drink to check in. Our room wasn't ready, so they took our luggage, and we asked where to get SIM cards for our phones. They gave us exact walking instructions, and when we returned, our bags were already in our room. One of the super-friendly staff took us to our room, and showed us how to work the window shades, the A/C, etc. We were in a double queen room, which was large for European standards. It was spotless, and we had a welcome gift of macarons and chocolates. There were also cans of water, tea and coffee, bags of popcorn and chocolates included with the room, plus a coffee maker and refrigerator. There was a small grocery store across the street and Gail's bakery just downstairs. The bathroom was small, but well appointed with luxury towels, a rainfall shower head, and bath products. The beds were very comfortable. We asked if we could have bowls for some of the groceries we bought, and the staff immediately went and got 3 ceramic bowls from the restaurant for us to use the rest of our stay. We overlooked an overground train line, but the room was very quiet. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, but close to several Tube stations. We could also walk to several tourist attractions, which was convenient. Whenever we arrived or left for the day, the staff greeted us warmly. It was a wonderful place to stay for our time in London.",5,2022,06,23
134,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel got everything right and that’s coming from a very experienced traveler who’s very picky. The room was large and the bed was heavenly, with a feather pillow. Everything was in the right place, modern, clean, etc , etc. Nothing missing. 

A huge buffet breakfast was included. Everything was delicious. The service was especially good. Kudos to Tomas. He couldn’t have been more welcoming. 

The hotel is near the Thames, but on the wrong side of the bridge, making it a little inconvenient.  But that little inconvenience is worth staying at this hotel. 

One more thing. The staff was super. Every single person we encountered was friendly and helpful, to a person.",5,2022,06,06
134,Close To Perfect,"I've been looking for this hotel. Been coming to London for 20+ years. I'm a Marriott guy so I try and stay at a Bonvoy property. 

Firstly, the location is just perfect. You're in walking distance to the best parts of town. 

Secondly, the staff are off the chain professional without being over the top. Soon as I got out of the car, someone greeted me, asked me how my trip was, reception was casual (loved the lobby and lounge room feel). 

It just didnt feel like you were checking into a hotel. They asked me if I needed anything - and I casually said ""I'd love an espresso"". Seconds later someone brings me a espresso. 

They just nail the attention to detail. Loved the room, the tech in the room, the cleanliness of the room and all the amenities. This is the standard that all business hotels should strive for. 

When my ride didnt show up for my trip back to Heathrow, the front desk team literally had a car on the doorstep within 5 mins.

I only ate at the bar - but the food and service was excellent and the menu was refreshingly unpretentious. 

I cant wait to come back...",5,2022,06,06
134,Flawless.,"Exactly what one expects for a luxury boutique hotel at this price point. From check in onward, every possible need has been anticipated and met.

Reception and concierge are combined, so the check-in process feels very unique. While checking me in, the staff were asking my interests and checking on tours. 

I was led to an absolutely beautiful and immaculate room on the top floor. Everything in the room is automated and integrated—lighting, blinds, etc. Fit and finish are high end and gorgeous. Housekeeping is exceptional. Location is in the heart of all London’s attractions.

This is definitely the place to stay if you’re looking for a top-tier, unique experience in London. Perfect for the solo traveler or a perfect hotel for a romantic getaway.",5,2022,06,03
134,Favorite hotel in London,"Fabulous hotel. Feels brand new and top of the line amenities across the board. Loved the free carafes and sparkling water dispenser on each floor. Room was beautifully apportioned, as were the lounges and terrace. Staff went above and beyond - when they saw us coming in with takeout, they immediately asked if we needed cutlery and sent it right up. Plus a great location on the bankside. Our new favorite in London.",5,2022,06,02
134,Excellent Hotel.,"This is an excellent facility and within easy reach of places your likely to visit.

It was raining when we arrived, but the gentlemen at the concierge got us an umbrella as we were heading straight out.

He also took the time to show us where everything was, including the exec lounge.  

It was all excellent.  

Thank you - its been hard getting back to travelling post covid, this experience reminds us that we all like to go on adventures, and that we have missed travelling.",5,2022,06,01
134,Loved our stay!,"Spent 6 nights at the Bankside Hotel.   Great location and close to two different Tube stations.   We also enjoyed being so close to the riverfront walkway.   The staff was very helpful, particularly with my 80+ year old parents who joined us for the last two nights.  LOVED the water on tap  and all the amenities in the room.  Had breakfast every morning and dinner twice at the Art Table restaurant.   The street outside the hotel was very breezy - the only downside of our entire visit.",5,2022,05,19
134,Best hotel in London.,"Brilliant hotel. All of the staff from the front desk to the people working in the restaurant are so friendly.
Great location. Plenty of good restaurants and pubs close by.
Hotel is modern and comfortable. Beds are great, big nice shower. Nesspresso makers in rooms
Will definitely return and reccomend. Thank you for wonderful stay.",5,2022,05,16
134,Great place to stay in London,I stay at a lot of Marriott properties and found this to be one of my more enjoyable stays. The staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable. The room was nice and reasonably spacious. I like the way they refilled the waters as well as all included products. I also found to me the unique water service near the elevators to be a great addition. I like refilling a lot of water bottles.What I used of the restaurant I found the food to be very good. I thought it was very well located for my needs. I really enjoyed being located very near the Thames river. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in London.,5,2022,05,08
134,Wonderful Hotel,"My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable, have adjustable ac, and the bathrooms are nice. The curtains/shades are not 100% blackout though so if you need complete darkness to sleep then you will not be satisfied. The breakfast is good, I loved the scrambled eggs. Allergy info is clearly posted on buffet items. We will be back here next time we're in London for sure.",5,2022,05,06
134,Great stay with amazing hospitality,"We were at Bankside hotel in April and were wonderfully treated by the full staff. the checkin was done excellently by Soyful, who took great care in getting us what we were looking for in a hotel. Inviting us to wine hour (can recommend!!), and explaining the various amenities of the hotel and room. 

would highly recommend staying at this beautiful hotel, with great service all round!",5,2022,05,04
134,Loved this hotel!,Our room was clean and comfortable. The beds were fabulous. The bathroom was luxurious and clean. The food and service were great too. The front desk wowed my kids with a toy upon arrival. My son loved his mini cooper and my daughter loved the slinky. The location was convenient and a stone's throw from the train station and close to the tube too.  Soyful went above and beyond to make our stay nice!,5,2022,05,01
134,"Nice location, great staff, modern hotel","The hotel is modern, is in a nice location and the staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.
I upgraded to a larger room and happy I did as the room was a comfortable size but more of what I would have expected as a base sized room.
It's located close to the Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe and in walking distance of the City. ",4,2022,05,01
134,Amazing!,"I stayed here with a friend while we visited London for a few days. It was perfectly located just opposite the train station and a few mins walk from the Tube. It is a stunningly beautiful hotel and within walking distance of the Tate Modern and numerous restaurants. I really enjoyed my stay, the staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. Will definitely be back.",5,2022,04,27
134,Excellent location & fabulous staff,"Second time I have stayed at Bankside and it is truly a next level experience - even the hand soap smells amazing. From check in to check out the staff cannot do enough to help you and always with a smile on their faces. The hotel itself is spacious, modern, and spotlessly clean. There is an excellent buffet style breakfast with something for everyone.",5,2022,04,23
134,Stellar stay at Bankside,"We stayed at Bankside for three nights. From beginning to end - everything was excellent. We were taken care of by great staff, from all the receptionists to F&B and Housekeeping. Especially Soyful made sure all details were in place and his personal approach made us feel right at home. The location is AAA, with trains one minute away and all sightseeing available within walking distance. We would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,04,23
134,One of the best,"From the moment you walk in to the lobby area you know you’re going to have a great stay.  I’ve been fortunate enough to have stayed in some pretty amazing hotels across the globe but this is one of my favourites.  Why? No. 1 reason has to be the staff. I love the reception set up where they all sit as a grand table and whilst you’re checking in you feel like one of the gang,  My daughter and I had room 508 which was a lovely corner room.  Most luxurious and comfortable bed and some lovely furnishings to the room.  We ordered breakfast in bed from the room tablet and it was delivered hot and accurate to order on pretty swift timing.  Totally loved this hotel.  We deserved 5 stars!",5,2022,04,10
134,Truly a gem!,"Truly can’t say enough about this beautiful hotel and the people who work there. We visited for 7 nights and it was the first time ever that we’ve wanted to stay in a hotel longer! Normally, by the 5th night, we’re eager to get back home to our own beds, but this place is really a gem. 
We’re a family of 5 with 3 kids (14, 13, 11) and had two connecting rooms. The rooms were lovely, modern and comfortable. And for London, very spacious! We arrived at the hotel after a long (delayed) flight and we’re greeted even before getting out of the car by the loveliest two men who helped with our luggage. Every single hotel employee we encountered were just so kind and friendly. The breakfast every morning was delicious - a huge variety, from eggs, hash browns, sausage, cereal, fruit, yogurt, meats and cheeses, pastries. So good! I wish I had gotten the names of the wonderful servers that we saw every morning who made an effort to talk to us, smile and remembered our tea/coffee preference. 
We were a bit hesitant to book a hotel on the “other side” of the Thames, as we’ve always stayed in the Kensington area, but we were so close to the Underground (Blackfriar’s is only a 5 minute walk across the bridge, and it’s a nice, calm, clean station) and we loved the area we were in. 
Favorite “cool” feature of the hotel - the water station outside of the elevator, with glass bottles we could fill with water for our room. So clever and convenient! 
Wish we could give this hotel more than 5 stars. One of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in!",5,2022,04,06
134,Wonderful anniversary,"Staying here made our 4th wedding anniversary extra special! Thank you to all the amazing staff!! Thank you especially to Soyful and Richard for making our stay amazing! The poem on the card was so beautiful, we’ve taken it back to Canada with us!
When we’re back in London, we’ll be staying again!
Thanks so much!
Candice & Christian",5,2022,04,05
134,YOU MUST STAY HERE!!,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The front desk staff are so helpful and go over the top to make sure you have everything you need. Can not recommend this hotel enough. Will definitely be coming back. Great location! Short walk to Blackfriars tube station.,5,2022,04,03
134,This Place is a Gem,"Just an amazing property from top to bottom.  Just returned from a 3-day business trip and this will be where I stay from now on in London.  Exceptional service, great attention to detail, cool vibe.  The rooms are certainly not over the top (with small bathrooms) but this hotel is really about the staff and level of service.   Top notch in all respects, and in a great location.",5,2022,03,25
134,10/10 Hotel,"We had a wonderful and we really enjoyed everything about the hotel. 
The location is great, the hotel is superbly furnished and the style shows exceptionally good taste. The staff was extremely courteous and incredibly personable.",5,2022,03,23
134,Just beautiful!,"Just beautiful! We had the most wonderful weekend. The only bad thing about out stay was that we had to leave and go back home at the end. There was not one member of staff that didn‘t make us feel at home and welcome. Reception, Housekeeping, Bar and Restaurant, everyone really enjoyed what they where doing and we loved out time. You wont find a place like this a anywhere else. We cant wait to come back.
Love x",5,2022,03,22
134,Restaurant review,"I rarely leave reviews but we received such kind, attentive service from Tamas in the restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed a very tasty lunch. Very impressed how he remembered what we had ordered from one day to the next and always brought a welcoming word! Great food, nice atmosphere and excellent service. Highly recommend!",5,2022,03,09
134,Great time in the heart of london,"I had a great time staying at the Bankside hotel last week, the hotel was lovely, great location by the river. The rooms were clean and staff were helpful. James on the front desk was great, he recommended some great restaurants and knew his way around london. Will be staying again",5,2022,03,03
134,Best Hotel in London!,"Had an amazing weekend with my gf for her birthday. The staff made a huge effort to make the stay extra special, they filled the room with balloons and even made a handmade birthday card! James on reception was very helpful and gave us some great recommendations of things to do and the best places to eat. The room was perfect and the art throughout was amazing! I can't wait till my next stay.",5,2022,03,03
134,Best hotel staff EVER,"Best service I’ve ever experienced from a hotel! The staff are a testament to the hotel and Marriott group. Looked after our party and ensured we had a perfect stay. So friendly, hospitable and make you feel like family. Will always be my go-to hotel when in London ❤️",5,2022,03,01
134,We had the best hotel stay that I have had in ages!,"I would like to rate this hotel 10/10.

 I never normally write reviews but on this occasion it would feel wrong not to.  My husband took me to this hotel as a romantic break and I could not fault it. The staff were so genuinely friendly, helpful and kind. The rooms are really comfortable with lots of nice tea and coffee (we also appreciated the free minerals water taps on each floor). The best was possibly one of the most comfortable I have ever slept The restaurant it great and the breakfast was so delicious.   I really love this hotel and I cant wait until we go and stay there again.",5,2022,02,21
134,Perfect stay at Bankside - can’t wait to go back,"Just stayed with a friend at Bankside for a birthday weekend in London and we honestly couldn’t have asked for a more perfect stay. The hotel is beautiful and our room was lovely - we had high expectations after reading the reviews but it was still somehow even better than we’d imagined.

The staff were so friendly and accomodating - Soyful at reception went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and make sure everything was perfect for our stay, and the other staff members we met around the hotel were just as lovely. The service at the bar and for breakfast in the morning was 10/10 - we both had the avocado on toast with poached eggs and they were delicious.

Can’t fault this hotel or it’s lovely staff - thank you Bankside for a 5* weekend. We’ll definitely be going back very soon!",5,2022,01,30
134,Excellent Hotel and Great Customer Service,"We stayed here for a long weekend after reading positive reviews.

Cannot fault this lovely hotel at all. 

The staff were welcoming, friendly, and go the extra mile.

The rooms are clean, quiet and stylish.

The location is an easy walk to many London hot spots - Southbank, Covent Garden, Westminster.

The restaurant food was delicious (Fish and Chips) and reasonably priced.

We'd happily stay again on our next visit.",5,2022,01,24
134,Weekend stay,"From the moment we arrived in the early afternoon the reception team set the tone for the weekend, the smiles and friendly welcome made us feel at home.
The hotel is unique and superb throughout, spotlessly clean everywhere, the bar and restaurant are great spaces and most comfortable, our room 407 was superb, great space, huge shower room and commanding views over St Paul’s and the city. 
What makes this hotel a cut above the rest are the staff, attentive, smiling, professional in every way
All in all a superb weekend in a perfect hotel.",5,2021,12,13
134,"Incredible team, fantastic environment - my favourite in London","This place is where I want to be when I am in London. The staff is so kind and genuine, making you feel safe and at ease. The design of the rooms is spacious and practical, the architects must have worked closely with the operations team to reach such a level of comfort.
The feeling of being in an art gallery is there and having a latte in the lounge is so cozy. I definitely recommend this place for romantic trips, for work or leisure purposes. Fantastic front office team, thank you to Soyful, Richard, Aida and Viktoria for their warm welcome.",5,2021,12,09
134,Yet again Fabulous,"After lots of, unavoidable, cancelations we finally got our weekend in London staying at one of our favourite hotels.  It was so nice to see that after all the closures and problems this place is still as fantastic as before the pandemic.  We had a wonderful room that was so comfortable and spacious.  Every little details thought of from the slippers to the tea cups.  Extra clean with bacterial wipes provided if you so wish to use.  And the staff, well second to none.  We were struggle to get to the hotel and then park due to so many road closures as there was a parade we didnt know about.  We rang the hotel when we were close as couldnt physically get to any of the car parks we had found.  They directed us to them and then by luck found us a spot outside and stood there till we managed to turn around and get to them.  It was fantastic.  Check was a smooth as always and they advised us re their breakfast offers for the next morning.  We all decided to book and what a great decision.  It was excellent in quality, quantity and again service.  We also had a night cap in the bar when we came home the night before and again the staff were impeccable.

We had invited some friends to come with us this time and you always worry that its up to the standard that is was before.  They assured us that they also would return without question as the best they had stayed in in London.  PHEW!!

Its not the cheapest hotel but by far the best value for money in regards to what you get.  Some more expensive hotels can feel quite stuffy or business like but this one is most definitely not either.

We cant wait to return again next year.

Thank you to all at the BANKSIDE.",5,2021,12,08
134,Wonderful Team,"My wife and I stayed in Bankside to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. 

We were blown away from the moment we entered the hotel. 

We were a little lost so a blonde chap approached us and helped us into the hotel. The hotel has its in scent which is very calming as you enter. 

We were greeted up Aida and Sara who effortlessly made us feel comfortable and when we told them it’s our Anniversary, Richard suddenly appeared with two glasses of champagne. My wife was just blown away. 

We stayed in a spacious room overlooking the bridge. The room is a good size for London and has everything you could possibly need for a short trip away from home. 

The breakfast offering is perfect and the team especially Jamie are very warm. We didn’t have dinner there as we had plans. 

This hotel is very different in terms of style and staff. It’s very arty and the staff feel like your friends and seem happy to be working there. Top marks to the GM there. 

We shall be back and thank you for a great stay!",5,2021,12,05
134,Bankside Hotel is an Amazing Hotel in London,"This is an amazing hotel. It was very comfortable for my stay in London. The front desk staff were very nice. Room was always very clean. As a gold Bonvoy member, I got upgraded to a Spacious room which was awesome. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2021,12,04
134,Fantastic 50th celebration,Fantastic stay for my dads 50th birthday. The manager and team couldn’t do enough to make it a special evening for my family. The atmosphere and location was perfect -we look forward to staying again soon- thanks again.,5,2021,12,03
134,Great experience Bankside,"Lovely hotel across the Thames in Bankside. We were a family of four in one room with two beds. Not a lot of extra space, but very well done. The beds were extremely comfortable, the amenities nice, they had a water bar on each floor. The staff was very friendly. Especially Victoria! Coffee bar in the lobby and excellent cocktails at the bar in the restaurant. There is a Gail‘s coffee shop in the back of the building and a pharmacy across the street if you need to get your Covid test for your flight.We walked into town and also took the tube, which is quite close by.",5,2021,12,01
134,Fantastic Stay,"Upon entering the Bankside you are greeted by friendly staff who make you feel at home. We were offered coffee and help with our bags. The scent that is throughout the vents in the lobby was amazing, would love to know where to find that. Lobby is bright modern and beautiful!

Rooms were spacious and bed was extremely comfortable. Usually my stays in Europe are on small rock hard uncomfortable beds. These made it hard for me to get up in the morning they were so great!

Breakfast was full of options and delicious, plenty of pastries and warm buffet options. Also beautiful comfortable and modern decor!

Water fountains on your room floor came in handy to refill and reduce plastic waste, loved this!

Location was right next to the Blackfriar underground line. Plenty of sights to see right by the hotel, 15-25 min walk to the tower bridge, covent garden, London eye and Westminster bridge.

Each member of the staff was beyond helpful and went out of their way to make me feel at home and comfortable. 

Highly recommend staying here, would absolutely stay here again. Thanks for such a great experience!",5,2021,12,01
134,Loved the Bankside Autograph Hotel!,"This was our 3rd London Hotel on this trip and by far the very best! Beautiful modern hotel in Southwark and close to Blackfriars Bridge. 

Everything was new and wonderful, everyone was so kind and helpful. Especially Richard and Aurora. They went out of their way to make sure we had all that we needed. 
We will most certainly return to stay here next time.",5,2021,11,30
134,Amazing experience!!!!!,"WOW...What an amazing stay we just had.  The staff is just outstanding and made us feel so welcome we didn't want to leave...Always used our names and made us feel so special. The room was fabulous, bed super comfortable and the view amazing.
We can't wait to come back.
Thank you to all the staff.",5,2021,11,29
134,"Expensive, but kinda worth it.","Stayed here for work, otherwise it was too expensive for my taste.  I debated on giving it four stars, but after we switched hotels, it was definitely five stars.  

Let me first say the service was exceptional.  Everything from the initial greeting and check-in to the promptness of the service (we requested ice and other items).  If it were not for the staff, I would have given this four stars. 

The rooms were nice, shower was a walk-in, loved it.  Very Eco friendly hotel.  The only thing disappointing was the restaurant.  It wasn't my style and breakfast was expensive.  You would think that some sort of breakfast would be included.   But the service in the restaurant was also exceptional. 

If you can afford it, stay here.  Totally worth it.",5,2021,11,28
134,Beautiful Hotel in Excellent Location,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
Super relaxed atmosphere, amazing decor, lovely gym space. The room was modern and comfortable and the art is fun and different! The staff are so helpful! 

Great location for south bank and young Vic theatre!",5,2021,11,26
134,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel with perfect location. I stay with my boyfriend for the weekend and it was the best stay ever. The staff at the reception were attentive, lovely and very professional, thank you to the whole team. We will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2021,11,26
134,Made to feel special,"Stayed here for two of my birthdays now and will definitely be staying again for more! All of the staff were so welcoming and the front of house staff went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. Nothing was too much for them and they are super friendly (but not in your face) which I love!
I highly recommend this hotel and the restaurant, no need to go out for dinner! The chorizo croquets are to die for!! In room dining was great too, the food was delicious and hot and service from all staff was impeccable. I seriously can’t recommend this hotel enough. The views of London are lovely no matter which room you’re in and Southbank is on the doorstep! Looking forward to my next stay!",5,2021,11,21
134,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel with a very nice decoration. Hotel not so big.
Very good place in Bankside, city center accessible very quickly.
Service is very good with all needed.
The breakfast and the food at the restaurant was tasty and very original.
I will come back for sure.

134,Perfection,"The bankside hotel is wonderful.  Amazing location, quiet surrounding environment, close to so many things; and the staff is amazing.  Diana especially made us feel like the ultimate guests.  I stay at Marriotts quite often but this trip was quite special.  Thank you, Diana.",5,2021,11,20
134,exceptional!!,"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice, easy and comfortable Bankside Autograph hotel was. 

Every detail was exceptional and they thought of everything to make the stay as quiet, peaceful and pleasant as possible.  The staff is also exceptional - not fussy - just cool, nice and accommodating.

I had not traveled for several months and then started traveling again - due to staffing shortages etc etc most hotels do not have the same service they once had.  Bankside service exceeds all expectations and was so nice to return to the hotel each day.

I was a bit concerned about the location - but it is actually perfectly situated in a cool area near the Tate Modern OxO Tower and across bridges from downtown.  That was really nice because I was able to walk everyday and evening across the bridges providing splendid views.

The food was also excellent -  the restaurant was casual and comfortable.    Housekeeping was also EXCELLENT!

Best hotel I have stayed in - in a very long time.  Thanks to all who made the stay so pleasant.",5,2021,11,18
134,Lovely visit to amazing laid back hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my wife's birthday. From the moment of check in service was amazing and staff very friendly and also approachable. 

Rooms were very nice and bar was great for snacks and drinks. Did not eat in the restaurant but seemed busy with both guests and walk ins

Would 100% stay again if we are in the area",5,2021,11,14
134,Birthday celebrations,"Stayed here for 2 nights for my birthday with my husband and it is one of the nicest hotels I e stayed in.

We were greeted at the front door by a porter who took out cases from us to reception and we were given complimentary drinks whilst we were checked in.

The hotel has some lovely little touches that just make it that extra bit special. 

Rooms are spacious and again the little touches extend to the rooms with complimentary mineral water, popcorn, chocolate and an extensive supply of different teas, with a Nespresso machine and assorted coffee pods. There is also glass jugs for sparkling and still iced water available from the dispensers on each floor of the hotel, which is also complimentary for guests. 
The rooms are very comfortable and have dressing gowns and slippers in the wardrobes for that extra comfort. 

The hotel is also ideally located a short walk from London's bustling South bank with various bars cafes and restaurants as well as major tourist attractions such as the the dungeon, sea life centre and the London Eye. 

We had a lovely weekend and will definitely visit again.",5,2021,11,14
134,Sarah is so helpful,"My day was just all over the place, I thought it wouldn’t get any better, my flight was delayed for hours and I had to get my business partners checked into the hotel before me. Sarah made everything so easy! This is my second time staying at the bankside hotel and I love everything about it from the staff to the elegance! 10/10 recommended!",5,2021,11,12
134,Best home from home in London,"The moment you walk in to Bankside Hotel you know you're going to be well looked after. It's managed to convey a relaxed but extremely welcoming atmosphere which immediately puts you at ease. This is the over riding feeling throughout the stay. Couple this with artwork everywhere you look that makes you smile and what's not to like? We've stayed here three times now over the last three years and each time we had the same very positive impression. Rooms are a good size well equiped and comfortable. Being set back from Blackfriars Road you're not affected by street noise. It's location close to Blackfriars Staion makes it ideal for 
 getting to and travelling about London. We prefer to walk- especially along South Bank (East and West)- just a great way to see London at its most vibrant.",5,2021,11,09
134,"Amazing hotel, location and service!","We stayed here at Bankside Hotel for a birthday celebration with 2 young children aged 6 and 4. The staff could not have been more welcoming and reassuring of having the children in the hotel. The rooms were very spacious for a family of 4 and absolutely spotless. The beds were the best I have stayed in! The room was decorated with balloons and also a small cuddly toy for each of the children on the bed. The breakfast had a great selection of continental and hot breakfast. The hotel is located perfectly for the Southbank location and also the theatres, which we were in London for. It was a short taxi drive from Covent Garden but also very walkable (we had the children after an evening show). Nothing was too much for the staff. 
We have definitely found the go to hotel for a trip to London as a family or couple, we will be back!",5,2021,11,08
134,I’m never staying anywhere else in London,"We felt at home from the very second we entered the hotel. The hotel itself is very artsy and modern, the breakfast is amazing and the rooms were elegant yet cozy. However, what made our stay unique was undoubtedly the incredible staff. Everybody just seems eager to be working there. You can tell the working environment is good by how genuinly nice the staff treats you. 10/10, would recommend.",5,2021,11,06
134,Great base for visiting London,This hotel delivered everything we wanted for our two day visit to London. The welcome and check in experience was great with he staff friendly and helpful. Our room was great and the bed really comfortable. The hotel is well placed for visiting central London being a short walk from Covent Garden to the North and Borough Market to the East. Breakfast was great and again all of the staff were friendly and helpful.,5,2021,11,05
134,Favourite hotel in London,"Where to start with this amazing hotel !! From the minute you walk through the doors you are made to feel welcome absolutely nothing is too much trouble for the staff . Welcoming , friendly and efficient . It was a special occasion and the staff went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was just that ! 
The style and decor is amazing , the rooms are superbly furnished with all and more you could need . 
Beds are probably the most comfortable I’ve slept in , beautiful bedding . 
Breakfast was delicious, lots of choice and very helpful friendly staff . 
Fabulous location for getting around London . 
Thank you Bankside for another fabulous stay , we WILL be back .",5,2021,11,03
134,Probably the best hotel experience you can have in London.,"I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels in London. Some were good, some were bad, some were okay. But the Bankside Hotel is definitely something else. Let’s call it excellent. They have absolutely ruined all of the other hotels in London for me.

I’ve stayed there for a very special occasion : seeing my partner whom I hadn’t seen in a long long time because of the US travelban. I had  emailed the hotel to let them know that we might arrive at different times and explained a bit the situation. 

What a surprise when I got there. First of all, Raquel made the check in super smooth and she was a real delight. We were assigned a very very nice hotel room on an upper floor, and they had arranged a very nice decoration for my partner and I. It felt so so special and I can’t thank them enough for that.
My partner and I were truly moved by so much kindness and preparation for our little reunion. We are so so thankful for everything they did for us, and we will always cherish the memories made at the Bankside hotel.

Apart from that super lovely special attention, the whole team from the Bankside was an absolutely delight ! If you are looking for the true heart of hospitality, it’s at the Bankside hotel where you will find it.
We had a bit of a chat with two other desk clerks, who were super friendly and full of good advice, same for the people at the bar and room service. 

The location of the hotel is just perfect. We took some very nice strolls by the River Thames, some very affordable pubs and food options are near by, and the tube access is very close too. You can very easily walk to the Tower of London and Big Ben, and the Globe is just a few meters away.

The amenities in the room are just what you expect from a great 5* hotel in London. And I have to give a special shout out to the bathrobes which we purchased ( I absolutely fell in love with mine !).
We had a very very nice king bed on which we slept heavenly.

I can’t say I’ve ever felt more at home in any hotel I’ve stayed at in my life. The Bankside experience was what turned a very nice and romantic reunion into a memory like no other we will never forgot. I keep telling all of my friends to go there when they visit London !
My partner has told me that it will be for sure our home away from home whenever we will be in London, and honestly, I can’t wait to go back.

Bankside hotel staff members, if you’re reading this, thank you so so much for the incredible stay. I wish more hotels would offer your level of professionalism, friendliness, comfort and attention to detail.

We already can’t wait to be back ! Thank you again, Merci !",5,2021,11,01
134,Exceptional service is king at the Bankside Hotel in London! Great location too!,"My wife and I just completed an 8-night stay at the Bankside Hotel and had one of the, if not the best, overall experience at any hotel we've ever stayed at. The overall high level of attentiveness and service they provided was second-to-none. 
We are frequent travelers and know when we see a gem - the team at Bankside along with the overall uniqueness (love the artful theme - you can read about that on their website) and quality of the hotel, is unmatched! We were upgraded to a suite (room 342) and absolutely loved the well appointed space, the incredibly comfortable bed and walk-in shower. Although we mostly ate out of the hotel, we did enjoy a breakfast, a dinner and a few afternoon drinks there and thought the food was high quality with an affordable price and exceptional service. From check-in through to check-out, the high level of service and professionalism and friendliness they provided to us throughout our stay was simply amazing and appreciated. Whether greeting us in the morning or assisting with reservations for dinner or to attend a West End musical, Soyful and every member of his team were there to greet us and helped to make our trip to London one of pure bliss. And finally, the hotel is located near the Thames and the perfect location to get around to other parts of the city - whether by walking, taxi or the tube - the convenient location was superb.  The next time we visit London, we already know where we will stay.",5,2021,10,31
134,Perfect hotel designed with love!,"I wish I could score this hotel more than five stars. We had the most wonderful 6-night stay at this warm and quirky hotel. The staff were all amazing from start to finish. They made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to make our stay special. We loved everything about the hotel, from the comfy bed, to the beautifully appointed bathroom, to the generous amenities. Most of all, we loved the hand-picked furniture in the rooms and the beautiful chairs in the mezzanine lounge. This hotel has bags of personality and has clearly been designed with love! - make sure to check out the vending machines on every floor stocked with champagne, emergency engagement rings and sparkly pants!",5,2021,10,31
134,Top Notch Hotel in a Convenient Central Location,"Let’s start with the superficial: the hotel is amazing..it is brand new and beautifully decorated and wonderfully appointed. And now for the staff…they are simply top notch! From the greeting upon check in to room service and housekeeping, could not get a better experience. The location in the Southbank is central to everything and the Tube is a short walk. Another tip, there is a pharmacy next to the hotel that provides rapid Covid tests for travel, not the cheapest but convenient for in and out.",5,2021,10,27
134,Amazing hotel in London,"I had the most lovely stay at Bankside.
I contacted them prior check in to inform it was my girlfriend’s birthday and they went above and beyond to make it special!
Victoria at front desk was a star. Super friendly and genuinely nice. Her check-in process was smooth, she gave me good tips about the area and where to go for dinner, walked me to the elevator, explained me about the fantastic wooden keys and was very kind offering me a welcome drink.
My girlfriend and I were over the moon with the upgrade and the lovely amenities in the room – pink balloons, flowers, birthday card and a delicious cake! It really made our stay extra extra special. We absolutely loved it!
The breakfast was amazing as well. The hostess and waiters were nice and efficient. I loved the caramel muffin (regretting not taking a few to go LOL).
The property is gorgeous! I love the pieces of art. The room was so cosy and comfortable. What a smart idea to have a charming water station in the corridor – very useful! And the vending machine is a highlight! I ended up not buying anything, but I was amazed with the great selection of products. All very handful (and funny)!
It brings me so much joy to find such good products in London! Congratulations for your hotel and service!
Thank you very much for taking such good care of us in this special occasion.
I look forward to experience it again in the future.",5,2021,10,25
134,My absolute favorite London hotel!,"After a 20 months hiatus due to Covid, I was (finally) back at my absolute favorite London hotel.  I can’t say enough good things about the hospitality at the Bankside. The Front of House Team is the best in the industry. Not only did each one of the staff address me personally during my trip, but I was greeted with beautiful flowers, chocolates, wine, and personalized cards in my hotel room to welcome me back. And as if the wonderful, modern hotel accommodations are not enough, my dining experience at the Art Yard was equally impressive. The menu is fresh and creative and the restaurant staff is equally awesome. Thank you Soyful, Richard, Diana, Alina, Aurora, Raquel, Elis, Aida, Sara, James, Amil, Stefany, Viktoria, Manuel, and the entire Bankside team for a memorable first return to London. I will be back next month! #WhereIBelong",5,2021,10,23
134,Excellent stay in a wonderful hotel with amazing staff!,"Stayed for one night earlier this week on a work trip. From the moment you enter the hotel, there is lovely welcoming and relaxed feel. Staff are friendly and helpful check in was an easy process. 

The rooms and hotel design are modern and at a very high standard. Would happily stay here again on my next visit to London.",5,2021,10,22
134,A Super Wonderful Hotel Experience,"My wife and I stayed at the Autograph Bankside Hotel several times in September and October. The hotel is superb in every dimension I can think of.  The staff is at the top of the list for us. 

We got our first hint when our taxi from the airport arrived and someone from the hotel was there to meet the cab. As he opened our door he greeted us by name.  I still don’t know how they knew.

The people at reception are amazing: helpful, knowledgable and extremely pleasant.  They clearly could not do enough to make every aspect of our stay wonderful.   For example, on our return visits they always had the same room for us — just because we liked it a lot. 

As we began our second stay at the hotel I discovered that I had left my backpack (with all our valuables) on our train from Scotland.   The staff made some calls and got us a taxi back to Paddington Station.  Our backpack was ready and waiting.  Amazing.

The Bankside has contemporary decorating and an informal style.  The rooms have a slightly minimalist--but not spare--feel and are extremely well-designed and comfortable The hotel has wonderful decorating and is filled with art.  

If you're looking for a beautiful, conveniently-located hotel with impeccable customer service, you'll love the Bankside.",5,2021,10,17
134,Incredible Hotel! One Of London's Best!,"I just finished a 3-night stay at the Bankside and I was thoroughly impressed from the moment I arrived until the moment I checked out. Incredible rooms, staff and facilities.  I can't wait to stay again.

I am a loyal Marriott Bonvoy member (Titanium) and love trying the brand's different Autograph Collection properties. This one stood out to me, above the others in London, due to the modern and sophisticated style in the photos. I was not disappointed ! The hotel is absolutely gorgeous! There is nice, chill music throughout the lobby and a real nice energy from the friendly staff. They always say hello and give a smile. When I arrived with my bags, they quickly spotted me and whisked me into the reception area for check in. The rooms are modern, tech-friendly spaces to relax from a long day. I loved being able to order room service from the bedside device. Beds are comfortable and the bathroom was just perfect! Rooms were made everyday by a hardworking crew. Aside from the rooms, the hotel also has a fitness center that's 24-hours and a restaurant that offers breakfast and dinner. 

The hotel is located in South Bank, in a newly-developed area. It's right across from the train station and literally a 5 minute walk over a bridge into the heart of the city. There is also plenty to eat, drink and enjoy on the hotel side. The hotel is only 5 floors and surrounded by buildings, but I did manage to have a very slight view of the gorgeous London skyline which glowed at night.

This is going to become my regular hotel in the city, after this stay. There is not one flaw I found here and I can't recommend it enough to perspective visitors.",5,2021,10,15
134,"Incredible hotel with superb, friendly and professional front of house team.",This is the best hotel I have stayed in in London. The front of house team were so welcoming and went above and beyond to make my stay perfect. The beds are so comfortable and it is the ideal place to unwind after a day of exploring the city. I could not recommend Bankside hotel enough!,5,2021,10,13

Would definitely return!",5,2021,10,12
134,Fab hotel,"This is by far the best hotel we've stayed at in London. We look forward to being able to go back.
The South Bank location near to Blackfriars train station makes it easy to get to and the main attractions are within walking distance. Comfortable beds and excellent friendly staff make it a great experience.",5,2021,10,09
134,Perfectly Special,"Our stay at the Hotel was totally excellent. Not only are the facilities beautiful, spacious, comfortables and cleans, but the most important thing the hotel has is its staff. Each and every one of them was an important part at any time of the day. Everyone's kindness was so special that we felt like they were lifelong friends. Aida, Sara, Raquel, Soyful and Richard at the reception were our face in and out of the Hotel which made the day much more fun and welcoming. Also the restaurant staff was very special in each of our meals. In conclusion, if I could give you more stars, we could send you more than 100. Thank you very much for your great kindness and attention.
Cesar and Gaby",5,2021,10,06
134,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location in London’s Southbank.  Friendly approachable staff and a quality room and decor, what more could you ask for?  We had cocktails in the evening and couldn’t decide which ones to pick from the menu, so the barman surprised us and wow what a great choice he made.  We will definitely be returning to stay at The Bankside.",5,2021,10,04
134,The Best!,"We visit London frequently and have have found our spot at the Bankside. The location is perfect- right at the Blackfriars Bridge, near the Globe and Tate as well as all the South Bank attractions. It is easy to get over to the North Back as well. The hotel is modern, comfortable, luxurious bedding and linens, The breakfast was delicious with a great variety to satisfy anyone from anywhere in the world with any taste. The staff was incredibly friendly, professional and helpful. The best were the colored pencils and paper in the room for us to color. It was so much fun. We will definitely return visit after visit.",5,2021,10,03
134,Excellent stay and wonderful hotel,"We stayed for 1 night to celebrate my wife's birthday ànd to visit the theatre. Check in was smooth and efficient and welcoming. When we got to the room, there was a birthday card and cake for my wife and the bed had been very nicely dressed. 

We had booked a modest double king, and the room was excellent from the bathroom to the size and comfort of the bed. We haven't stayed anywhere for a long while where the bed was so large and comfy.A good nights sleep was had.

The room has electronic blinds and there is a portable tablet with all the hotel info on as well as info on the area.

The artwork throughout the hotel is eclectic. 

We haven't stayed in this area for a while but travelling by public transport was easy.

We ate  in the hotel restaurant and would recommend this.

Bar service late at night was slow but they were busy.

All in all, we would recommend this hotel. ",5,2021,10,03
134,Great individual styled hotel and great location,"Excellent location if travelling into London Blackfriars.
Great access to south bank and entertainment locations north of the river.
Staff at reception right mix of service and informality.
Rooms great view of river and really liked the design - modern quirky and definitely not generic.
Would definitely stay again.
Only challenge is if you want to get a black taxi, not easy to flag one down from the south side, so either use Uber or pre-order",5,2021,09,25
134,Lovely night for our anniversary,"We recently stayed for one night and had a lovely experience. Was looking for a hotel reasonably close to the Shard as that is where we were going for dinner. The staff are all really friendly and very helpful. Especially the Spanish girls who were on the front desk (who my wife thought were Swedish) they are so friendly and I could have sat there and chatted with them all day! The personal touches as it was our anniversary were lovely. Breakfast was really nice, so was the room and it's a great location. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in that part of London look no further.",5,2021,09,22
134,The staff are the notible quality at Bankside,"We stayed for a week from Tuesday to Tuesday in room 440. We had a lovely time. 
Very friendly staff who worked tirelessly to make our stay a pleasant one. Very generous with the complimentary items. A big thank you to the house keeping team for providing us with enough coffee for our stay. 

We would definitely stay again. 

David.",5,2021,09,21
134,Marriott Bankside has it all.,"Stayed for 5 nights after leaving Marriott Grosvenor square early.
Was a little nervous but read good reviews.
Bankside is a beautiful property.
Located right in the middle of a very cool area with so much to see and do on your doorstep.
All the staff are highly professional and friendly.
What a total difference to our previous hotel.
We had the most amazing 5 nights in a beautiful room in a well thought out genuine cool/chic 5 star hotel.
Thank you so much for everything!",5,2021,09,14
134,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"We stayed for one night but could easily have stayed longer, the room is modern, spacious and comfortable with good quality amenities. The bed was huge and very comfy, the shower was heaven! The hotel is in a fairly quiet area, we heard no traffic or noise from other guests during our stay (Saturday night). The hotel clearly has high standards but does not feel pretentious. They take cleanliness very seriously, everything was spotless. We had a small issue with the coffee machine not working and were sent complimentary hot drinks/pastries via room service within minutes  which was a really nice touch. We parked very close by on the street which was free during our stay. The staff are very polite, welcoming and attentive without being pushy. We would return here again and will recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay slightly outside of the hustle and bustle. Walking to the West End took less than 30 minutes, there is a small Waitrose round the corner and a couple of pubs. We did not eat in the ArtYard restaurant (attached) as we had theatre plans but we did enjoy a night cap of some very nice wine which came recommended by the front of house.",5,2021,09,13
134,Classy Hotel and must go and stay when in london,"We have just come back from our amazing weekend at bankside,

Can't tell you how amazing all the staff were to us all, taking the time to speak to us and making us feel welcome and at home,

Special thank you to everyone at bankside, many hotels should learn from you all on how to treat customers, all the staff went out of their way to make us feel so special,

A special thank you to soyful and all his reception staff (Diana) and the bar/restaurant staff,

Everything was faultless and stress free, we came away feeling like we've had a very chilled and relaxing break,

We didn't want to come away,

Hopefully we will be back again very soon",5,2021,09,12
134,Consistently high standards,"Consistently excellent. Stay here regularly while working in London. Lovely service, super, well trained staff. Comfy well decorated rooms, good breakfast. Very spacious meeting rooms and helpful staff to ensure you have everything you need. I would highly recommend.",5,2021,09,10
134,Birthday weekend stay,"Wonderful hotel with funky rooms and hotel decor. The staff were fantastic and made our stay enjoyable recommending places to eat and very attentive. Welcome coffee when we booked in and was offered on booking out whilst waiting for our taxi. Room was an ample king with very comfy bed and lovely shower, gorgeous toiletries and dressing gowns and slippers supplied too. Room service breakfast was delicious. Very convenient for walking by the river and South Bank. Will stay again and would recommend highly!",5,2021,09,06
134,"Classy Hotel, quality rooms and terrific staff","Overnight stay for our anniversary and truly wowed by this new place. Location is fantastic, the welcome at reception  more like friends ushering you into their home (thank you Richard and Victoria). The rooms are elegant, funky and timeless with quality fittings and attention to detail.....and the bathroom toiletries really lovely. The design on the whole place is clever, effortless and like no other hotel we have stayed in. Many thanks to the team...we will return.",5,2021,08,30
134,Will stay here again,"Excellent hotel. Clean, well decorated with modern but functional touches. Great staff - very helpful with anything we needed and very outgoing. Convenient location. Did not have much expectation but will definitely stay there again. Great find.",5,2021,08,23
134,One of the very best,"The staff and service at this hotel are fantastic. So welcoming and friendly. They made a family weekend superb. Its all the little extras and thoughtful touches of luxury that set this hotel apart - amazing coffee in the room, beautiful bathroom products and personalised welcome cards. Cant wait to come back. Thank you!",5,2021,08,22
134,Exceptional,"The moment you arrive you feel important. We hadn't even checked in before we were offered a complimentary drink and given a 5 star treatment. The room had complimentary snacks and drinks. We really liked their complementary cans of water instead of one use plastic bottles. The room was really comfortable and the breakfast area and food was amazing. Again, very attentive staff. Check in and out takes seconds and we were offered complimentary water when we picked our bags up after a day not sightseeing. Also, we loved the deco and arty feel to this hotel. They do things differently and I left feeling inspired. It is not cheap (but not mega expensive either) and we have not experienced this level of service in a long time.",5,2021,08,22
134,The Gem of Southbank,"I have never experienced this level of amazing service in my life! I have worked for a luxury hotel in the heart of the city for the past 6 years, and until now I have not experienced the sort of high end service which I am used to providing others. The staff at Bankside are friendly, approachable and professional. They make you feel welcome and go to great lengths to make sure you get what you need.

This was my second stay at the hotel and I intend on returning for a third time. The rooms gorgeously decorated to reflect the hotel’s boutique qualities while committing to their love of modernism and artistic culture synonymous with Southbank. The reception staff were helpful in fulfilling requests and did so promptly. The restaurant staff know their products well and make you feel very well taken care off. The cocktails and bar nibbles are stunning!

I was celebrating with friends, having just received my university results. The reception staff organised a complimentary bottle of Prosecco to my room, along with a card they had hand decorated themselves.

I only wish the staff had name badges, as I’m often terrible at catching names. I would have loved to have been able to mention all the staff by name in this review because they are that amazing.

Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! Looking forward to the next",5,2021,08,15
134,Wow!,Where do I start?! 5 stars does not seem enough! We were absolutely blown away by everything and everyone! Genuinely the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in with the most amazing staff and top notch food. Thank you guys for going above and beyond. Special thanks to Sarah on reception for the most beautifully hand drawn envelope and personal card. We will definitely be back.,5,2021,08,13
134,"Great service, room and location","Having our trip abroad cancelled due to COVID we decided to treat ourselves to a few nights in a luxury hotel and spend a few days in London instead. We chose the hotel based on its location and lovely rooms. On arrival we received the warmest welcome and were offered an upgraded room (we stayed mid week) which was lovely. 

The room itself was spacious and full of nice little touches like complimentary snacks, water and a covid safety kit with mask and hand sanitiser etc. The toiletries were good quality as were the Egyptian cotton bed sheets. In the hallway there was access to still and sparkling water on tap as well as ice. The only negative re the room was the view as the hotel is surrounded by buildings on each side so the view from our room was directly into a building opposite so it didn’t feel very private but black out blinds resolved that. 

We had a few drinks at the bar and again the service was great and staff very friendly and welcoming. 

The hotels location is great in respect of walking access to the train, tube and tourist attractions such as London eye, sea life aquarium, oxo tower, London dungeon, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and access to river cruises. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again and recommend it.",5,2021,08,13
134,Best stay Ever,"I'm here now at Bankside hotel with my wife of 10yrs . We wanted to celebrate our 10th Anniversary so we chose this beautiful hotel for a short break weekend.
The staff are all absolutely amazing and attentive.
They surprised us with complimentary champagne and a saucer of delicious sweet treats.
Everything is spotless and beautifully decorated.
Will definitely be returning.I want to thank all the staff at Bankside hotel for making our Anniversary weekend feel that exstra special.",5,2021,08,07
134,Excellent all round,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is well located, a short walk to Tate Modern or across Blackfriars bridge into the city. It’s 10 mins walk to Waterloo station too.

Staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. The food and beverage here is very high quality and we really liked the bar menu with lots of choice and excellent service.  

The hotel’s sustainability initiatives are particularly impressive..you won’t find any single use plastics here! 

Room was very comfortable. The only thing I felt was missing was a shaving mirror in the bathroom. 

A great stay- we will return!",5,2021,08,01
134,Very stylish and comfortable,"We stayed here for a long weekend in town and it was a great location for us to wander around the bits of London we wanted to see (Shard, Southbank & Tate Modern primarily). It's a very stylish, comfortable and friendly hotel that we'd definitely return to if we need to be on the Southbank again.",5,2021,07,30
134,Hen weekend in Bankside,"I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. I booked two rooms for a group of friends for my sisters hen weekend. I spoke to the hotel in advance who offered to decorate the rooms with balloons etc for us. We arrived to the most beautiful, thoughtful and personalised decor with cake and fizz too! The staff went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. The location is amazing, some rooms with fantastic views and the rooms/facilities offer everything a 5* hotel should. A real touch of luxury. I will 100% be coming back here for business and leisure. Thank you to all the staff once again xxx",5,2021,07,25
134,Hidden Gem,"I stumbled upon this hotel online by accident. It is superbly located next door the boomerang, 5 minutes walk from Blackfriars station and only 50 metres from the river.

We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a slightly larger room. The room was lovely, with a sofa, desk, fridge and the ubiquitous tea and coffee making facilities. 

Bathroom was spotlessly clean with a large walk in shower (no bath)

The hotel was very quiet throughout. However the staff were extremely friendly and always willing to help. 

Breakfast was included and very nice.

This is a hidden gem of a hotel and a perfect base for exploring the south bank of the Thames being ideally located halfway between the London Eye and London Bridge",5,2021,07,23
134,One night in Bankside,"We booked a night’s stay as the country had come out of Lockdown. The Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was clean and location was just right. Recommend highly.  I hope things start to pick up in London - it was very quiet for this time of year.",5,2021,07,23
134,Not to be missed,"Wow! I loved it, start to finish. 5 stars is not nearly enough! The hotel was absolutely stunning and art-theme was consistent everywhere throughout. I adored the little details, like wooden keys for the rooms, the decorated cups from the silkeborg museum and the ""painter box"" with cardboards to replace the boring notebook. Super comfy bed, perfectly clean room and the toiletries are so good too! The staff was so kind and friendly. Very well done guys!",5,2021,07,18
134,5 stars isn’t enough of a rating!,"Always a top level experience at bankside. Beautiful hotel complimented by the most attentive and caring staff who cater to your every need.

134,Great hotel and location,"We stayed at the bankside hotel for 2 nights in June to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and from the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome with the friendly staff at the front desk. The rooms were very comfortable with bathrobe and slippers along with great sized toiletries to use, including shampoo and conditioner. Not the small type you normally get. I loved in the corridors of the rooms the ice and water stations, little touches like this I just love.  And not just still water, sparkling too. The hotel had popped a lovely cake in the room and added some balloons, it just made it so special. One of the evenings we had dinner in the restaurant and the food was great, although was quiet, but given the situation with COVID I believe it was due to that. Food was great at breakfast too, avocado on toast was my favourite. Hotel is located perfectly to explore the South Bank and a short walk to borough market. Thanks for a lovely stay and hope to return one day.",5,2021,07,11
134,Perfect stay,"This hotel is just perfect! I visit London frequently and I have to say this has quickly become a firm favourite having visited last week for the first time- so much so we’ve changed our plans this weekend to stay again!

134,Birthday Trip,"This has to be one of the best hotels i have every stayed at in the UK, i am not much of a review writer however i felt that this review was a must. The service from start to finish was excellent, i booked an overnight stay for my husband and I for his 30th birthday, the staff were kind enough to leave him a lovely card, some balloons and cake in the room, which was also an upgraded room to the one i originally booked! I also asked if we could have late checkout which was also given as an additional complimentary thing.",5,2021,06,29
134,Wonderful hotel and location ,"Stayed at the Bankside Hotel over the bank holiday weekend with our 2 children. Hotel was absolutely lovely - great service from staff, nice clean and large room with a proper bed for the girls (most places seems to have sofa beds which aren’t great for sleeping) and nice bar and restaurant.

Location was perfect - a little off the main track but such a short walk to south bank.  Will definitely use this hotel again.",5,2021,06,27
134,Amazing Stay Here,"I travel widely with work and usually stay with IHG but had enough Marriott points book this hotel for a weekend break. I can’t recommend this hotel enough - from the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The hotel decor was stylish and quirky and it was really nice for me to stay in a hotel that didn’t feel part of a chain. The location near to Blackfriars Bridge was perfect for our evening stroll along the south bank of the Thames. ‘Couldn’t fault the bedroom (spotlessly clean, quiet, beautifully comfy bed) or breakfast - 10/10",5,2021,06,15
134,"Fabulous hotel, great staff....if in doubt just book!","Stayed at this hotel on Friday night and what a fabulous place.

134,Amazing stay,"I decided to surprise my husband for a night at The Bankside for his birthday (with our young kids) as soon as we arrived both Sara and Diana made us feel at ease, we had such a long day and were extremely tired and they really took away all of that tiredness. They were extremely kind showering the kids with soft toys, offering us help and really really helped my husband with finding a good parking spot. I then told them it’s his birthday and Diana  brought drinks up straight away for us to celebrate. All I can say is they went above and beyond for us. The beds themselves were like sleeping on clouds. Clean rooms and lots of amenities. They also provided pretty impressive covid kits on both beds. 

We left wanting to come back and we will definitely will be coming back one day! Thank you for the hospitality",5,2021,06,06
134,"O M G fantastic hotel, staff, facilities, food, drink just amazing!!","My husband and I had a phenomenal 2 night break as the Bankside hotel and everything about it is phenomenal, the super warm welcome at Reception, what a fantastic team they are, to the room, bar and restaurant service, thank you Jasper and crew, gorgeous tasty food.

134,An incredible stay,"As key workers throughout the COVID-crisis, my boyfriend and I were hanging by a thread by October. We were hoping for a break to rest our weary bones and to just enjoy treating ourselves a little. What we weren't expecting to find was the most incredible five days in sumptuous elegance, where staff go above and beyond. We can't stress enough how fabulous Bankside is - from the beautiful lobby and incredible bar to the spacious, comfortable rooms; the linens with such a high thread count, you feel like you're floating!
 The extra little touches were everything: the complimentary hand sanitiser and face mask were very much appreciated, as was the wine hour in the evenings!
However, the kindness of the hotel staff, who really go above and beyond for their guests, made our visit. They endeavoured to make us feel pampered, relaxed and totally at ease. From the room upgrade, to the  hot chocolate sent up to our rooms after arriving from sight-seeing completely soaked from the rain, it is the team at Bankside who create the welcoming and unforgettable experience. 
Needless to say, my boyfriend and I left refreshed and extremely happy, ready to head back into the fray. Thank you Bankside, we shall be back!",5,2020,11,08
134,Wonderful stay before LD no.2💛,"We booked last minute as a last blow out before the second lockdown. From arrival the staff were amazing, it makes such a difference when the staff are really warm and welcoming.

The rooms have been finished to a high standard, it was spotless and comfortable. 

The breakfast was amazing, great service and a lovely atmosphere throughout. 

We will be back, thanks Bankside. X",5,2020,11,05
134,Another amazing stay,"Returned for my second stay at this hotel since it opened and decided to treat myself to an upgrade to a spacious suite. Margo in the reservations team couldn’t have been friendlier or more helpful. The whole hotel is decorated to a extremely high standard and the spacious suite is no different - it’s incredible. The best part of the room is definitely the view over St Pauls and the city from all 3 windows. 

Other than the decor, the other stand out feature of the Bankside Hotel are it’s staff. All of them are amazing, smiley and always happy to help! Aurora on the front desk was always on hand throughout our stay. Cocktails in the bar and breakfast each morning were equally as great.

Looking forward to getting booked in again in the future. ",5,2020,11,03
134,Last minute - Wow,"We decided last minute (Friday) to have a Saturday night in London and booked into the Bankside Hotel, it was outstanding, classy furnishings and finishing touches throughout. The staff on reception, were ao welcoming ans this was repeated wherever we went from house keeping to the team in the restaurant for whom nothing was too much. Whilst not as lively and rumbustuous as its oppulent noisy neighbour it oozes class on a quieter scale.
We really look forward to seeing you again.",5,2020,11,03
134,Anniversary stay,"We spent one wonderful night at this beautiful Hotel. Such a friendly welcome from the staff were amazing . Right from the check in which was easy and super efficient to the staff in the bar, restaurant. The decor is stunning and modern, the Team have put lots of guidelines in place to ensure everyone’s safety during the COVID situation. Rooms are spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. Breakfast was amazing . Bankside is in such a great location, but also nice and quiet. Thank you to all the Team for making our long awaited break such a treat. We will be back!

A Special thank you to Soyful who always goes over and beyond to make us feel welcome,

Take Care Bankside",5,2020,11,01
134,Perfect hotel for City & Southbank,"We decided to book a night away with our children in London during half-term.  Given the current situation, there are a lot of very good deals out there.  Ultimately we elected to go with the Bankside and were not disappointed.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Waterloo and is tucked behind Blackfriars Bridge Road, so avoids a lot of the traffic noise, but is still in a great location.  It's only 5 stories, so is not one of these massive, impersonal places - although it lacked a swimming pool (to our kids' disappointment) it made up for it in many other ways.  Check-in was smooth, painless and friendly - my son was able to practise his beginners' Spanish with Aurora who immediately offered us coffee or tea and could not have been more welcoming.  We were in a hurry as we had a booking to climb the O2 that afternoon, so headed straight up to our rooms to dump our bags.  
The advantage of the Bankside is not just its relatively small size, but it is only 2 years old, so it absolutely soundproofed.  Our rooms were connected by inter-connecting doors, and were of a very good size for a London hotel.  Fixtures and fittings are all modern, high quality and functional.  Complimentary Nespresso, tea, popcorn and water as well as a small bar of chocolate - our kids were immediately impressed!  
The beds were King Size and the mattresses firm, but not overly so, and the walk-in shower was not at all cramped.  Overall, I could not fault the rooms at all.
We had decided to pay extra for breakfast to save time in the morning - the service was excellent, and the choice more than adequate to set you up for the day (to the extent that neither my wife or I ate lunch).  A couple of small niggles - the coffee was lukewarm and our younger son's fried eggs were a bit over-cooked - but these took only a minor shine off what was a wonderful experience.
Would we stay at the Bankside again, for business or pleasure? Abolutely!  Would we recommend it to others?  Again, absolutely!  With Borough Market just down the road, and the City within a stone's throw over Blackfriars Bridge, it's got something for everyone.",5,2020,11,01
134,Super great value and a funky hotel in great location.,"Really comfy modern cool vibe.  Lots of little quirky things like water fountains at end of each corridor so you can help yourself to normal or fizzy water, coffee machine in room, mini bar in corridor with glasses and ice buckets etc, really well thought out, with cute gym too.  Strong interent which was great. 

We had a lovely 2 day stay, only issue was the shower water pressure was not strong.

Location superb with cool bars and restaurants walking distance!

Definitely recommend for business, couples and families!",4,2020,10,31
134,Loved it!,"From the moment we checked in until we left, the staff was superb. Friendly, efficient and nothing was too much trouble. Very comfortable and stylish room and room service offered at no extra charge at the moment. ",5,2020,10,28
134,Exceptional service and memorable stay,"I spent the weekend at the hotel for my birthday and was very impressed by the hospitality. The staff gave me a birthday card and wrote a sincere message. My room was upgraded. Despite having to move rooms twice due to faults in each room, I was still very pleased by the service overall. Providing a complimentary dinner for two for the hassle was exceptional. The room was clean and spacious. The toiletries were of excellent quality. I appreciated the facility by the corridor to get filtered water. Late check out was extremely flexible and I was still offered tea and coffee to go. I will have to find another excuse to return. I would rate this property six stars if I could. Happy second anniversary to the hotel.",5,2020,10,25
134,Superb hotelexperience!,"We spent a splendid weekend in this wonderful hotel. Beautiful art, cosy atmosphere. Above all the amazing service of Alice, Victoria, Aurora and all the professional members of the staff made this weekend  truly unforgettable. That handwritten birthdaycard nailed it! Would love to go back again.",5,2020,10,25
134,Outstanding staff,"Lovely hotel, great rooms, but it was the wonderful people who made our stay so very special.  Particular thanks to the reception staff, who were outstanding, and a hug to Alice who, when she found out it was my son's 18th, sneaked a gift and card into his room.  Staying with you made his birthday particularly special.  We will definitely visit you again.",5,2020,10,19
134,Michael ,"Really enjoyed our stay at this immaculate hotel. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Excellent location for the local attractions. The rooms were modern and really comfortable. Drinks in bar were very good. Originally booked for 1 night , but ended up staying for 2. Breakfast was superb. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2020,10,14
134,Perfect Stay!,"We had such a lovely stay at Bankside at the beginning of the month. Upon entrance I immediately felt at ease with the lovely staff, you could tell they were smiling even beneath their face masks! The measurements in place to protect us (and them) from the current global pandemic were amazing. They managed to strike a really great balance between having all the necessary measures in place but also managing to keep them quite subtle so it didn't ruin the atmosphere at all. It was a much needed break and felt like a safe oasis away from whats going on these days! 
Not only all of that but the breakfast was amazing, huge spread and limitless tea & coffee, and the whole hotel was completely spotless. Thanks so much for having us, we'll be back!",5,2020,10,11
134,Excellent Hotel and professional staff,"We had the most wonderful weekend in this hotel. Rooms, the staff and bfast were just outstanding. Every member of staff made us feel so welcome and they truly are 1 of the hotel's best assets. Looking forward to staying here again. Thank you so much.",5,2020,10,11
134,"One amazing hotel, one amazing weekend","From the moment I was greeted by Richard and his colleague at Bankside, I knew we’d made the right decision to stay there.  The staff could not do more for us, but most importantly, all communication and help was given with such positivity and a smile (albeit behind masks, but eyes were smiling!). 

In terms of the current Covid situation, we felt very safe at the hotel. Masks were worn in all communal areas and by all the staff we saw, there are hand sanitiser stations throughout the hotel and we received a safety pack in our rooms. This made such a difference to our stay. 

Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed just sitting and taking in the view. The hotel is in a fantastic position for exploring the Southbank and I would not hesitate to return. Thank you also to James earlier in the week, who assisted with my questions concerning our booking. The hotel management should be very proud of their team.",5,2020,10,11
134,Relaxation along the River,"What a lovely stay we had in early October. 

We were welcomed with a huge smile from Aida who was polite and courteous putting us at ease from the moment we arrived. The room was beautiful and spotless upon entering, with lovely touches like a tablet to use during your stay and fancy electric blackout curtains which made for a great nights sleep.
We made use of the bar and restaurant which was very good, Rowell from the bar was recommending drinks for us depending on our preferences and they all went down a treat including his twist on an espresso martini on the menu which was lovely. We moved to the restaurant and had a great array of food and wine.

Overall it was a great stay, the hotel was spotless cleanliness wise and we enjoyed that there were subtle procedures in place for the current pandemic but this was not in your face which made for a much more relaxing and authentic stay. 

We even had the pleasure of meeting Hotel Manager Murray Scott, who was very visible to all and it was clear for all to see where the wonderful service from his team come from with his open and positive demeanour. 

Well Done Team Bankside! ",5,2020,10,11
134,Birthday Extravaganza ,"I would give a 6 star review if I could !!!

This hotel oozes luxury and serenity from the moment you step foot in the lobby. 

We visited for my partner’s birthday and I can honestly say every single member of the team at Bankside made our stay memorable. 

I want to especially thank Aurora and Alice who helped me put together a birthday surprise for my partner. As I am not based in London I was a little apprehensive organising everything but Aurora and Alice had everything managed, they even wrote a birthday card, decorated our room with birthday balloons and provided some delightful sweet treats! 

The style and decor of the hotel is just sImply BEAUTIFUL. 

Breakfast was delicious, as were drinks in the bar. The room itself is a great size, again, beautiful decor, great shower and has everything you may want or need amenities-wise.

I wish I had noted everybody’s name but it is definitely the team at Bankside that sets this hotel apart. I work in the luxury hotel sector myself and I know at the moment how difficult it is in the current climate. 
We could tell the team reallyyyy care and really have a zest for what they do! 

Thank you so much for making our trip perfect in every way x

134,Unforgettable Experience,"The Bankside Hotel helped create an unforgettable experience for us as we celebrated a proposal and an engagement! I just wanted to note that the staff went above and beyond to make us feel so special during our stay. The hotel itself is really hip and unique. It is also very accessible to the sights of London and public transportation. We dined in for breakfast, which was delicious. Thanks again - we cannot wait to return someday soon.",5,2020,03,16
134,Amazing location and lovely hotel,"Mid-century modern elegance with contemporary design and esthetics. Absolutely beautiful  hotel with well-outfitted rooms filled with just the perfect blend of technology and thoughtful touches. Loved the sparkling and still water stations in the hallways, onsite fitness center with Peloton bike, fantastic location right near the Tate Modern and London Eye and riverfront. Friendly staff, lovely breakfast options, and just top-notch quality all the way around.",5,2020,03,06
134,The best hotel I’ve stayed at in London ,"Checked in for 4 nights, room was ready early in the morning and which was extremely appreciated. Room was well designed and modern but at the same time was quirky. Was given some amenities with fruit and a hand written card. This hotel knows how to make you feel special but also knows how to get the basics right. Would definitely come stay here again, keep it up!",5,2020,03,06
134,Amazing stay on the South Bank,"The Bankside hotel is a modern, design-centric hotel right between the London Eye and Tate Modern, with amazing food, drinks, and attractions in-between. Gorgeous rooms and incredibly friendly staff make this hotel a true gem.",5,2020,03,02
134,Lovely modern hotel with lots of little touches,"It’s not often a hotel on tripadvisor has 5/5 & I was intrigued to see what the fuss was about. It definitely didn’t disappoint! I stayed here with my husband for a night, the price was very reasonable & the location is perfect for waterloo station, southbank & tube lines. A week or so before our stay, I received an email asking if there were any requests for our stay, which I thought was a nice touch. We arrived before check in & there was a room available, which was great! We were offered tea & coffee at check in & there are biscuits available on the front desk. The staff were so friendly & helpful, made us feel right at home! It was a rainy day & there were umbrellas & ponchos available for us to use if we needed. The decor at the hotel is really quirky & arty. On the way up to our room, we saw a vending machine where you can buy alcohol as well as novelty items like an emergency engagement ring! The room was lovely, really modern with lots of useful technology like a tablet, automatics blinds & electronic do not disturb signs. The bathroom was amazing with a huge shower! All the usual toiletries were provided & smelt lovely. There were free waters in the room but also a cold, hot & sparkling water tap in the corridor. There was a safe in the room & robes & slippers. The bed was sooo comfy! Was very difficult to get out of it the next day! What was an extra nice touch was that the staff left a goody bag in the room with some pampering treats as I’d mentioned I was pregnant. Definitely made me smile & shows their attention to detail. The only downside was that we were near the lift so could here that throughout the night. I had brought ear plugs though so it didn’t bother me. Would 100% stay here again, had a lovely stay. ",5,2020,03,02
134,Great Stay,"Fabulous location, great service and spacious rooms.  
The breakfast was delicious, the bartender made a mean martini and always felt very welcomed.  Would definitely stay again on our next trip to London.",5,2020,02,29
134,My second Home in London,"It was very weird to me to chose to stay in the hotel when we have apartment in the city centre of London. My fiance (who's actually lives in London) offered to check Bankside AC next to Tate Modern. At first I thought it has luck of English style but once checked in we both fell in love with this particular place. It is a true contemporary English hotel. Ultimate luxury (bathroom from top to bottom), bed which impossible to leave, scent of the hotel, style... this hotel is reflection of us, this is who we are, our lifestyle. We truly enjoyed our stay first in December and then it was my choice when I came back to London in Jan. There is no doubt that we will come back again and again.
Special thank you to Anath from front office team, she was absolutely stunning asset of that hotel and on my second stay extended to me a very warm welcome back, she remembered us and treated as part of the family. This is amazing feeling of heartfelt hospitality makes us to come and pay for the stay in the hotel while living in the city which for me still a crazy idea.
PS I'm in love with Grown Alchemist. True love!",5,2020,02,26
134,Pleasant Stay,"It’s ok, although in my opinion not as fantastic as the other reviews might suggest. Limited Platinum recognition - free breakfast only. I got a room upgrade, which the receptionist described as fantastic, but actually the room felt to me more like a Four-Points room. And the “view” was of a humdrum street and overlooked by an office block which necessitated keeping the blind down for privacy.
Good and friendly service, although I thought it was sometimes a little over the top - particularly when you just want to get to the room, rather than listen to a description of the hotel services in exquisite detail. 
Breakfast was good - not a huge selection, but what they offered was good quality. Small gym with brand new equipment, including a Peloton which was fun to try out. 
Pleasant enough for a night or two, although Platinum members can do better elsewhere in London for a similar room rate. ",4,2020,02,22
134,"Lovely hotel, lots of nice touches, great location","Hotel feels brand new, is super clean, and has a modern decor. There are lots of nice touches - three kinds of water tapped in on each floor with self serve carafes, the staff goes out of their way to help with everything, substantial buffet breakfast spread, nice open bathrooms, motorized blackout and filter shades, etc... Located just south of the river in the more recently developed arts district, it is a short walk to the Tate, Globe, Borough Market, Eye, St. Paul's, etc.... and close to lots of transportation to anywhere in London. We traveled with a teenager and would return as a couple too.",5,2020,02,20
134,Wonderful hotel,We have stayed here a few times now and we always have a wonderful stay. The front of house team especially Raquel and Alice are extremely friendly  and the moment you walk into the foyer you can't help but feel relaxed in the unique stylish setting of this hotel. Soyful the front of house manager has been there everytime we've stayed and always ensures  extremely high standards and a relaxing stay. I strongly recommend this hotel and will definitely keep visiting. ,5,2020,02,16
134,Great London Hotel,"I've come to London for business about two to three times per year and this time I tried a new location and a new hotel.  The Bankside Autograph Collection Hotel isn't as close to a Tube stop as others (closest is Blackfriars across the river), but the hotel makes up for the extra five minute walk.  Very modern, ample space in their basic rooms, great in room amenities, and the coolest feature is that there are self serve water taps in the hallway that dispense cold still, regular still, or sparkling water - very cool!  This location is also great for those that want to visit the Tate Modern or Shakespeare Globe or St. Paul's Cathedral.  Plenty of restaurants nearby and only a block from the Thames.  You will definitely be happy with this hotel choice!  I'll definitely be back!",5,2020,02,13
134,Best stay in London,"I travel to London frequently for work and pleasure and tend to stay in Marriott hotels due to the loyalty program (Platinum member).  I decided to try this hotel for a recent 3 day trip and I must say it's the best hotel I've stayed in while in London.  Location is great, just a short walk to two tube stations (Blackfriars or Southwark) and great local ammenities (there's a Waitrose (supermarket) and a Superdrug (Pharmacy) just round the corner).  

The service for this hotel was outstanding.  Abiout a week before my arrival, I got an email from the hotel saying they were looking forward to my stay and if I needed anything to reach out.  I requested extra tea/coffee for the room as well as local restautant recommendations.  For the restaurants, I got a lovely follow up email from Alice with great suggestions.  

On arrival day when checking in, I was greated warmly by the doorman and reception.  The gentleman who checked me in was pleasant and friendly (can't remember his name though, sorry!).  While he was checking me in, Alice popped over to say hello.  The fact that she remembered our interaction and wanted to welcome me personally is why this hotel's service is top notch.  I got upgraded to a bigger room and got free breakfast - win!

The room was great, bed was massive and extremely comfy.  The art design is very modern and room furnishings and finishing was great.  Bathroom was bright and clean with a great shower.  The room had electric blinds (both black out and regular) which helped with a great night sleep.  

The room looked out into a central courtyard and I'd say that's probably the only thing people may not like about the hotel, is the view.  The hotel is tucked away behind a couple of large buildings so there's not much to look at, but that doesn't both me since you're out and about viewing London anyway.  The benefit to being tucked away is that considering you're in central London, it was very quiet with no night time noise or road traffic.

I used the gym one of the mornings and have decent equipment to ensure you get a good workout completed.

I'll be back in London over the next few months and this will become my default place to stay.  The service, facilities, friendliness of the staff, and the quality of the rooms for the price is hard to beat in central London.

Thanks again to Alice and the rest of the crew.",5,2020,02,11
134,"Lovely hotel, great location","Beautiful hotel, tucked away just off the riverside. Very quiet and had the best night's sleep in a very long while. Super comfy and lovely quirky personal touches to make you feel welcome. Ideal location for sightseeing along the Southbank.",5,2020,02,10
134,Excellent hotel in a great locaion,"Really liked this hotel.   Stylish rooms and common areas, very comfortable and bed, nice sized rooms.   The overall 'vibe' combines elegance and 'cool' but not too much of either one.   It seems a bit like a med/large boutique hotel and has all the services you'd expect including a pretty good gym onsite.    Great location near the Tate various metro/light rail w/in easy walk.    Overall quality for the rates are reasonable for London and now it's part of 'Marriott' so points/status also apply.   Will definitely stay here again.",5,2020,02,08
134,A hidden gem,It’s the fourth time I stay at Bankside and I really love it. The hotel is in a great location for both business trips and city breaks. The bed and pillows are prob the most comfortable I’ve ever tried! The sleek design is topped off by friendly and helpful staff; shout out to Diana who took excellent care of us ;-) Strongly recommend.,5,2020,02,04

134,Fab location,"Stayed here for 1 night to celebrate hubby's birthday. The room was spacious, bed very comfy and there were enough hangers in the wardrobe 😂. Got a decent view of St Paul's too. Decent coffee/tea making facilities and in the hall a water fountain with jugs and glasses, which was, a nice touch. We were really impressed with the peloton bike in the gym. We were offered wine to celebrate hubby's birthday which we never received but hey ho had a good time anyway. The staff were perfectly polite and helpful checking in and out.",4,2020,02,03

Eclectic look with much modern art.  Decently appointed rooms.  Good restaurant.  OUTSTANDING STAFF.  Not much more to ask for.  (Prices were not unreasonable for location, quality, and London.)",5,2020,01,26
134,Great Hotel!,We were there for a week in October 2019.  Our room was spacious and very clean.  The staff was exceptional and would go out of there way to make sure that we had a pleasant stay.  Their restaurant was amazing.  The food was delicious!  I have a dairy allergy and the restaurant staff made sure every day that I had my food prepared to suit my needs. The manager even left one morning to go to a local grocery to purchase almond milk and non-dairy butter for my breakfast!  We highly recommend this hotel!,5,2020,01,21

134,Excellent hotel with great staff,"This hotel is now a Marriott property and is called the ""Bankside Hotel Autograph Collection"". The hotel is modern, very clean, and the rooms are spacious. The staff is very attentive, the service excellent, and the overall ""feel"" of the hotel is inviting and comfortable. I was warmly greeted when I arrived (which was early morning from the US), was offered a drink of my choice, and even escorted to my room. The rooms are well decorated with a quality feel to them. The bathroom I had was large enough and the linens good. My only negative comment about the bathroom would be that the step up and into the tub/shower was pretty tall. I am in good physical shape, but the stepping out of the shower can be a tad precarious. There are no grab handles - I would attend to this problem if I were the hotel manager. The on-site restaurant is pretty good. I ate breakfast and dinner there on a couple of occasions and the food was tasty and well prepared. There is a breakfast buffet and a al carte options. The bartenders at the bar are also pretty good. One minor criticism (which is honestly common in many UK/EU restaurants) is that the server was too slow to come back around and check on the progress of the meal. Still, my overall impression of the hotel is that it's very well run, has great staff, and has good facilities and services. There is a gym facility in the basement for those desiring to burn off some stress or calories. I was there on business and if your business takes you to the Bankside area, I highly recommend it.",5,2020,01,17
134,Exceptional service,"We loved this hotel. All Autographs we have stayed before have been traditional but this is modern. But what made it stand out was the service. Just blew us away the team really cared. Service in restaurant for dinner also excellent. Good spread for breakfast. Location was fantastic too
 In fact was one of the very best hotels we have stayed in. Highly recommend. Menu in restaurant different check you like options ",5,2020,01,12
134,"Great location, excellent servic","We stayed here as a family for almost 2 weeks, a trendy hotel, lovely touches all around, with some of the best service we’ve encountered anywhere.

We will be back!",5,2020,01,10
134,Modern hotel in Central London with amazing staff!,"What an amazing hotel! located in the heart of London on the Southbank, the Bankside Hotel is new, modern with a twist of sophistication. What's more, all of the staff members are so extremely nice, professional and helpful. Alice from the reception went above and beyond to assist me to ensure I was enjoying my staff and well taken care of. Really like the open shared check in concept vs. the traditional check in desk at other hotels. The rooms are modern, beds extremely comfortable, the bathrooms very nice. Also, the restaurant is very good. Be sure to enjoy the breakfast and have a cocktail at the bar. Awesome bar tenders. ",5,2020,01,09
134,Amazing hotel!,"This is one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in - and I travel a lot.

134,Unbelievable Amazing Positive Experience.,"From my own experience, definitely Bankside Hotel London deserve this 5 stars review. Stayed at this Hotel this past October in two occasions: The first one from October 23rd to October 26th and the second one from October 29th to October 30th. My experience was unbelievable amazing, so different in a positive way. My first impression: The building is very much brand new, the design of the building is amazing, outside, the design of this building melts right on with the surroundings of the area of the city it is located, not too toll, not too big, not too small, a modern design that inspire the traveler and the passer by to see it and enjoy the beauty that this hotel can radiate. 
This hotel is so different.  
On the inside: Man, I was blown away: The interior design of this hotel is by far the best I have seen. It is modern, at the same time classy (London Style), everywhere you look you see art work displayed, when I say everywhere I mean it,(Lobby, Restaurant, Floor Corridors, etc...), corners and other places that you see in other hotels kind of forgotten are not forgotten in this place. I can tell you: This hotel was very well thought from A to Z.
Impressed we also were with the cleanness of this place, the room service, the commodity of ordering everything from the tablet by the bed, the views from the windows, the morning breakfast with the variety of choices in food and drinks, the Portabella Mushrooms (My favorite) with cheese (Added by me).
I have stayed in many hotels during my travels and, I can't really say anything not positive from this place because truly, I did not find anything negative.
This Hotel is family friendly.
And that is what I loved the most about this place. I traveled with my family to visit this beautiful city and one of the things that made my trip great was the treatment and the respect that me and my family received from the personnel that works here, specially from Anne (I believe it's her name, it could be Ana (forgive me if I am wrong)), the young lady that helped me to plan my routes during my stay in London, please, pass her our sincere appreciation for the help received. Everybody that served us went the extra mile ensuring that we were happy. And happy we were.
What makes this hotel different from every hotel we have been?
Simply: The Front Desk, sorry, my mistake: The Front Family Table. 
When you check in a hotel you go to the FRONT DESK and do what you need to do and check in. In this hotel there is not FRONT DESK, there is a FAMILY TABLE. You go, seat down on the table like you do at home, then you check in, but you do it with the attendant sitting side by side, like if you are speaking with a friend, in fact that was the way I saw it: I spoke with a friend like a friend, and from that moment until the moment that we left the place it was just like that. I do not know who came out with this idea of the FAMILY TABLE but let me tell you, it made the difference with me and my family and if it did it with us, then definitely it did it with many other travelers. 
We fell in love with London. Such a beautiful city, full of history, diversity and beautiful people. Many places we visited, many others we couldn't. That is why we'll be back some day and when we do I hope this hotel is still there because that will be the only place in London where we will stay. 
Salutes and Blessings to all the people that work in this top of the line hotel.",5,2019,12,20
134,Bankside Hotel,"We wanted a location close to the Thames and this hotel is 1 short block away!  Newer hotel, large rooms, pleasant staff!  We were able to walk to the London Eye!  Many shops and restaurants nearby!  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,12,17
134,I have never felt so welcomed and sincerely important to the staff. Diana was phenomenal!,"My husband and I stayed at the Bankside Marriott artisan collection for six days. He was there for an awards banquet, which by the way he won. The hotel is small, clean, pretty simple. However the staff went far beyond anything I’ve received at any hotel both top of the line and middle line accommodations. It was like they had one of those experiences where they just don’t say no to anything.  I needed my hair fixed for the banquet, called down gave them an approximate time that I needed the appointment they made the appointment called me back give me walking directions. There were goodies in the room every evening. The staff cheered for us when my husband won an international award for artificial intelligence. we’ve stayed at the Grosvenor’s Square in the past which is quite fancy, And we enjoyed that thoroughly however the service and staff were just beyond anything we have ever experienced all over the world from Singapore to Hong Kong to New York and San Francisco. I highly recommend the Bankside hotel!",5,2019,12,12
134,Exceptional Front Desk Staff,Everything about this autograph collection hotel is amazingly beautiful and pleasant. We enjoyed every second of our stay. Especially the services by the front desk staff is exceptional. THANK YOU FOR THE WARM WELCOME AND ALL THE HELPFUL INFORMATION BY THE LOVELY ANATH. YOU MADE OUR STAY MEMORABLE AND UNFORGETTABLE!,5,2019,12,09
134,Absolute pleasure staying here!,"I unfortunately was only able to stay one night on a recent trip to London. The check in was easy, they were so friendly and helpful, and by the time my room was ready my bags were already up there. The room was gorgeous, comfy, up-to-date with great tech conveniences all around. Felt spoiled rotten with the in room dining (done all through tablet next to bed) and lush bed, robe, and rain shower. Plus the decor is fun and there is a liquor vending machine! All around a pure joy. Coming back to London in two weeks and I will be staying here again - very excited to spend more time in this lovely hotel",5,2019,12,05
134,"The best hotel High End, Signature hotel I have stayed in a long time","Just WOW!
From the moment you enter to moment you leave the experience is exceptional.
Staff at front desk, staff for meetings, 
The rooms are great and every detail is taken care of... details are just fantastic ( slippers / bathing robe - I want one like that at home )
Breakfast is very nice, dinner, drinks ( 2h wine open bar )
Gym is small but fine really with a Peloton bike.
The meeting rooms are fantastic and well managed by Isabella and the team. These places are very conductive to creation.
Fantastic overall experience !",5,2019,12,05
134,EXCEPTIONAL HOTEL & STAFF,"This hotel, particularly the staff, sets the standard for all other hotels to follow. The hotel is thoughtfully designed and immaculately maintained. The rooms are spacious and modern with technology that enhances the stay (electronic blackout shades are so nice). The awesome team at the hotel is what really makes this hotel special. They strike the perfect balance between five-star luxury and warm, welcoming care. It felt like we were visiting with friends, while also receiving exceptional service. Whether you have been to London multiple times or it is your first trip, the location is spectacular. It is conveniently located near multiple tube/train stations, Borough Market, Tate Modern, St. Paul's Cathedral and more. There are many restaurants nearby and it was super convenient to be steps away from a small grocery store and pharmacy. We offer our highest recommendation for Bankside Autograph. This is THE place to stay in London.",5,2019,11,30
134,30th Anniversary Trip,"I have been staying at Marriott properties for 20 years. I have never had better customer service. 

We came to England to celebrate our anniversary. I called the hotel to confirm the location as we crossed from Blackfriars Station. Alice walked out to meet us in the street and help us navigate some street construction. 

Although we had arrived early in the day Alice checked us into one of our rooms so we could freshen up and drop off our luggage. During our conversation she learned that this is our 30th anniversary trip. When the second room became available we were surprised that Alice had prepared a bottle of champagne and balloons for the occasion. 

The room service and staff were incredible. 

This has been a home away from home and we can't recommend this hotel enough. 

Thanks Alice and all.",5,2019,11,25
134,Great hotel!,We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The furnishings were very comfortable. It was in a great area and the staff was very friendly. It also had some very fun art! We stayed at another autograph hotel in a different country and we were not impressed. I was reluctant to stay at another autograph but I’m glad I was wrong. I would recommend. ,5,2019,11,24
134,Southbank Gem! ,"We visited London for 7 days in early November to celebrate our anniversary & see ATP tennis, plays, friends, tour. Could not have picked a better “home” for a week. Superb friendly staff-adorable Aroura & darling Dianna- really made us feel like family! I’ve worked hotels & stayed in many but this topped them all.
The decor is a beautiful take on mid-mod without being”too” and artfully furnished. The room was fantastic-nice touches on the robe/slippers & night light, as well as the water station in the hall with a variety of waters. I would have loved a shaving mirror/bathroom fan, but otherwise perfect room. 
Fun addition of vending machine/library by the elevators too.
We will return!!",5,2019,11,24
134,Amazing Hotel,First time came to London to celebrate our anniversary. Staff was very nice with warming sincere greeting while we checked in the hotel. Facilities were great and the room was comfortable and cleaned. Super nice atmosphere and design that were different from other luxury hotel. Highly recommendation to my friends ,5,2019,11,21
134,"Brilliant Hotel, Amazing Staff","Me and my girlfriend stayed at the hotel for 5 nights.
Since I always trying to stay at Marriott properties, this newly renovated hotel was a great choice.
I arrived at 04:00AM and was welcomed by a lovely and welcoming front desk staff.
The concierge, Nolan, was very helpful and made all the arrangements prior to my arrival so I will surprise my girlfriend.
Breakfast is sufficient and delicious.
Location is very good. Few minutes from a tube station.
Most of the times I was using the Marriott app for requesting service and they were very responsive and helpful.
This hotel became my number one choice in London.
Every experience in the hotel was five stars.
Keep up the good work :)",5,2019,11,19
134,Amazing stay! STAY HERE!,"What can I say but this place is the BEST! My first time in London & didn't really know where to stay. I'm so glad I picked Bankside. Every staff member treated us lovely. We were celebrating my daughter's 13th birthday and they surely made her feel so special.
THANK YOU THANK YOU. Rooms are heavenly and the breakfast was great. Cannot wait to come back. Aurora, James & Anna were wonderful. xx",5,2019,11,18
134,Amazing hotel ,"We stayed three nights in Bankside Hotel and everything was amazing, all the hotel and our room were very modern and nice, the location was very convenient and we loved your breakfast. Thank you so much Anna and Montana for your incredible check in and service provided, we can’t find the words to thank you for everything you do during our stay. Thank you to all the staff at the restaurant they were brilliant and their manager was incredible also, we didn’t get his name. 
Unfortunately, we have to mention that we met on our second day Dayanna the manager at the front desk and she was derogatory and unable to manage our room account, she was not nice at all and her service was poor, but the rest of our stay was incredible. 
Thank you bankside!",4,2019,11,18
134,Bankside Hotel,"Hotel was great but the staff was excellent. Especially Ann at the front desk made our 1st stay in London a delightful experience. The adjacent walk along the Thames was outstanding. Shakespeares Globe Theater, Fish and Chips and the HMS Belfast. Very memorable and historic.",5,2019,11,13
134,New Favorite,"After a 10 hr flight and 1hr-ish car ride (traffic), we were exhausted, but ready to start our honeymoon. We were greeted at the curb and got help with our bags right away. The front desk experience was great. Thanks, James! He was very polite, helpful with our questions, and gave great tips on where to go and how to get there. He even helped bring our bags up to the room. Not used to that even in the Autograph collection properties I have been to in the US. The amenities are top notch. The room was beautiful. Just a normal room but everything was great. I wish all hotels in the US did Nespresso for in room coffee. The view from the window, though not especially scenic, was still cool because of the shape of the building. Floor to ceiling windows always win me over. The bathroom, gorgeous! I didn’t use my own shampoo, conditioner, or soap the whole time. It’s often a gamble with hotel provided toiletries, but these...LOVED. The gym, great! It felt a little weird to get to, maybe because I was alone. Super clean, great equipment. Oh, the water station in the hallways, YES. So simple, but so amazing. I am constantly toting around a water bottle so those things bring me so much joy. 
The restaurant...the BREAKFAST...how can eggs, pastries, and yogurt make me so happy? Because I am American and all our food is processed to hell and back? I probably ate a dozen croissants the first morning. Not ashamed. The staff in the restaurant are top notch as well. Being jet lagged and starving in the morning, I did expect to feel happier to start my day by just having breakfasts. Between the delightful staff and amazing food, I forgot that I was stressed, cranky, and dragging my feet to get the day started. And I wish I knew the secret to the porridge I had! It’s probably not a secret, but I cooked professionally and never have I been able to make oatmeal that I actually liked. I might have to go back just to ask how they make it! 
The location is great, short walk to more than 1 tube station, across the street from a nice walk along the river. mini Waitrose market around the corner for snacks on the go. 
All around beautiful property, fantastic service, great way to start my honeymoon. 
I will gladly return to this hotel.",5,2019,11,11
134,Our new favorite hotel,"We are very glad we booked this hotel versus staying in Trafalgar Square area as we have in the past. Backside hotel is a hidden gem! It is located in Blackfriars within a 5 minute walk to Blackfriars Station proving easy access to all of London’s landmarks. The staff provide genuine exceptional customer service. Greeting you every time they encounter you (entering/leaving the hotel, entering/leaving the dining area. We want to especially acknowledge Anna(checked us in), the gentleman who brought our luggage to our room(on 11/7-around 3pm)and Piroska with her beautiful smile and service during breakfast. No one wears name badges so these are the only names we remember but every breakfast/restaurant and reception staff person we encountered was very friendly, helpful and made us feel welcomed. 

The rooms are nicely designed and the bed was very comfortable. As other reviewers have stated, each floor has a water and ice station (hydration station). The hydration station is a brilliant, we loved it! The room has a small refrigerator with bottled water replenished as used and cream provided for coffee/tea using the in-room Nespresso machine. In-room safe, iron and ironing board, lighted closet with slippers were also nice features. I loved the dual heal shower with perfect water pressure and temperature. The soap dispensers in the shower and on the bathroom sink of pleasant scent Alchemist products feel like home. The plush towels without the typical chemical hotel scent was a nice experience. I could go on and on but hopefully my pictures show the rest of our experience. I highly recommend this hotel. We look forward to our return to London and Bankside Hotel. Well done, Marriott and Bankside Hotel staff!",5,2019,11,11
134,Phenomenal hotel in London,"This past August we took a trip to London and chose to stay at the Bankside Hotel.  We booked the vacation through Costco.  No, it is not your traditional London themed hotel.  It is instead the most modern establishment we’ve ever had the chance to experience and it is an absolute winner.  In partnership with the Tate Modern, the Bankside has created a gorgeous hip environment with the most unique artwork you will see anywhere.  We were greeted immediately at their expansive front desk where you sit down to check in not stand.  Our child was given a brand-new set of miniature colored pencils, a Bankside coloring sheet and a brand-new stuffed leopard about the same size as a TY Beanie Baby. 
 Our room was furnished with a Nespresso coffee maker, a small wooden chest filled with coffees as well as Joe’s Teas and packs of gourmet popcorn in different flavors, all complementary.  There is a lighted wardrobe with robes and slippers and luxury toiletries in the bathroom.  And then there are the thick premium postcards in different styles with pictures of the art displayed around the hotel.  And the fizzy water you can get from the bar in the hall is a must to try.  
The staff is phenomenal.  They can recommend restaurants, shopping, high tea, etc.  They were great in retrieving a pair of reading glasses we left in the dining area and providing extra post cards which they mail for free.  They do a complementary wine service in the lobby, they have a stand of umbrella’s you can borrow, and the funkiest vending machines you will probably find anywhere. 
The complimentary breakfast serves bangers, bacon, roasted fresh tomatoes, roasted portobello mushrooms, croissants, fresh fruit, fresh squeezed juices, cereals, European yogurt, fresh crusty bread and other fun choices.   
Directly across the street is a small grocery store for your convenience and the hotel is easy walking distance to the Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre and tube stations and train stations.  
We highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.",5,2019,11,10
134,Add it to the top 5!,"Wow - we absolutely loved this hotel! The location is top notch, the hotel is beautiful and staff was amazing. Hydration stations on each floor (who doesn't love complimentary water!), boutique vending machine on the floors (so convenient!) and free wine in the lobby for happy hour. This hotel has definitely slid onto our top 5 hotels list, and we've been to quite a few! The AFOM (Matt I believe his name was?) was so accommodating and a pleasure to connect with. Looking forward to when we can return.",5,2019,11,07
134,"Feedback I got -  Beautiful hotel, excellent location","Excellent location - near food, walkability is good.   Beautiful hotel, excellent customer service.   Would definitely look to booking manager here again in the future.   Big plus was it was close to where business mtgs were being held.  ",5,2019,11,05
134,loved my stay,"I stayed at the Bankside for 4 nights. Initially they had me in a room on the first floor, even though my profile states that I prefer a high floor. Luckily, they were able to move me to the 5th (top) floor, which made me very happy. 

The room had features that other hotels lack, including blackout (as well as mesh) window shades, nightlights (why don't all hotels have this??), and smart door setting to allow maid service or not. The showers (both rain and regular) were great, as were the toiletries, which were in large refillable bottles. Lighting was good for a hotel room too. The bed and bedding were standard, and comfortable.

Front desk staff were friendly, but couldn't always answer my questions. Common areas, like the room, had modern and attractive decor. I chose a Southbank location since most of my activities were in this area, and found it convenient for walking and transport.",5,2019,11,04
134,Modern Hotel with super rooms,"I love this new hotel. The rooms are bigger than normal with large windows and with super comfy bed. Also nice clean bathroom, with walkin shower
The decoration is beautidul and staff very friendly.
THANKS",5,2019,11,04
134,Very good,"The Bankside impressed in most respects. It is a very good hotel.

However, I had some small issues:

1) Marriott Bonvoy elite recognition and benefits are minimum because there is no club lounge. The hotel has complimentary wine for an hour or so Monday to Thursday, which is not so great if you stay Thursday to Sunday. Also, the wine is cheap and not that good. But hey, it's free. Would be nice to see improvements in elite recognition and benefits, especially since any guest can access the wine hour. 

2) I don't appreciate being called by my first name. Hotel front desk and other guest-facing employees should address guests by Mr. or Mrs. on first interaction.

3) Was told my room had a view, but the view was a city view. Not sure if any rooms have a real view since there are so many towers around the hotel. Front desk should use more precise language when describing rooms to guests.

4) No doorman and poor signage at streets, especially with road works. Taxi drivers had issues finding the hotel. Hotel should have a doorman bellman stand at street so guests with luggage don't have to carry everything around the corner and up the stairs. What's the point of having a doorman or bellman if they only work inside the lobby?

I appreciated housekeeping, which did an excellent job. The restaurant was also very good, although I thought the service could have been more proactive. For example, no bread with dinner, no offer of coffee or tea, and I had to ask about cheese. But for a hotel restaurant the food was good.",4,2019,11,01
134,Great Hotel,"I travel about 30 weeks a year and this is without a doubt the best hotel I have stayed in. The staff were excellent and the room was very comfortable. In terms of location, you won’t get a better location in London. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and I look forward to staying here in the future.",5,2019,10,27
134,"Fun, interesting new hotel in London!","We spent two weeks at this hotel earlier this month and were delighted with it in so many ways. The location was convenient to Blackfriars tube station and to the Queen's Walk and Southbank Center with its many activities.The art and playfulness of the design and decor throughout the hotel was fun. We loved the high tech aspects and the coziness of it being a small hotel. The staff was outstanding throughout our experience at the hotel. They welcomed us by name every time we arrived, as well as when we visited the restaurant or bar. James, who was at the front desk as we were struggling to get an Uber on our last night, went out of his way to assist us and even ran up the block to locate a taxi with room for our luggage when the Uber didn't show up. We highly recommend this hotel and hope to return soon! A big thank you to all the staff for your friendly welcomes and excellent service!",5,2019,10,26
134,Amazing new property!,"Hubby and I spent 4 nights here this week. The bed was super comfy, room was perfect!  The staff were always smiling, friendly, and very helpful.  The amenities were very nice, and the breakfast was amazing.  We will make it a point to stay here again on our next London visit.  We have found our new favorite London Hotel!!",5,2019,10,26
134,Best Hotel stay ever !!,"A wonderful stay at an incredible hotel. The staff is friendly, helpful and very professional. Probably our favorite hotel anywhere. Marcarena was delightful and couldn't have been more helpful. Everything about the Bankside is top notch. We will never stay anyplace else in London..",5,2019,10,22
134,Amazing,"From Check in with Diana, to Check Out also with Diana, this hotel didn't disappoint. 
Walk through the doors and you're greeted by a friendly welcoming group of people ready to get you checked in. No intimidating reception desk, just a table with a nice chair. 
Room was really nice. Spacious, very clean and good facilities. 
The table in the room basically does everything you need. Ordering room service was very easy. 

Check out was also hassle free 

From start to finish, this was honestly a very good experience ",5,2019,10,20
134,"London's best hotel, by far.","This hotel is outstanding. It's so effortlessly chic, comfortable, friendly. In fact, the staff made us feel not only human but VIP-esque!  All the staff are super helpful and genuinely care. What's super about this place is not only its location (my favorite part of London by the Thames with some top river walks by, handy for Tate Mod, Globe etc) - but one of the best things has to be the super relaxed and stunning restaurant and bar area - really intimate with lovely music playing and a stunning menu. Nice to stay somewhere central London where you don't have to leave the hotel to have a top London restaurant experience. You don't actually realise how clever the rooms are until you've stayed there - it is so wonderfully designed, very contemporary. You can even make your own coffee in your own espresso machine and take some out (Bankside takeout cups provided) along the river for a stroll to keep your hands warm in cold weather. We took a speed boat trip on the Thames (what fun, highly recommended) which was only a short and picturesque walk from the hotel. The art collection is superb also, very inspiring and if you want to create your own, rooms have mini easels and pencils so you can make your own masterpiece.  I forgot my tights and was able to purchase some from the vending machine (along with an adjustable engagement had I chosen to!!). I honestly feel like I've found my very own home-from-home in London. When I return i will feel like I'm visiting family. Thank you Bankside for creating such a warm, welcoming, vibe.  Thank you thank you.",5,2019,10,20
134,Flawless contemporary London hotel,"I loved everything about Bankside Hotel. It is well located at the centre of many London attractions. Inside, it has great design and is packed full of art. The staff were very friendly. The bedrooms were silent and the TVs have Chromecast. Breakfast was delicious (the open omelette is recommended). Sustainable touches including filter water on each floor and refillable bathroom amenities from Australian brand Grown Alchemist. I look forward to returning!",5,2019,10,13
134,Great hotel and great location,"Great design, nice staff and great location where you can walk to many of the historical sites but also not super busy around the property. Good restaurant. Good beds. Nice gym. Really lovely stay throughout.",5,2019,10,09
134,Trendy New South Bank Hotel,"The Bankside Hotel is a trendy new hotel. The hotel staff are excellent especially Macarena. As other reviews have mentioned the rooms are modern, stylish and very comfortable. Outstanding for a London hotel.",5,2019,10,03
134,Lovely hotel!,"New, modern, comfortable, and stylish just about sums it up! 
The whole hotel exudes style, with modern decor and furnishings, from the reception area, to the bar and restaurant. My bedroom and bathroom were large, clean, bright and airy and again, were modern and stylish. All of the staff I encountered were friendly, professional, courteous and attentive and made me feel valued and welcome!
Two members of staff hosted a complimentary wine hour in the evening in the bar/lounge, which was a great touch and a welcome added bonus!
Located close enough to Waterloo Station to make getting there and exploring other areas of London easy enough. Just a stone's throw from the south bank of the Thames, with a few decent pubs and bars in the area, which are great to visit on warm summer days and evenings.
Overall, I was very impressed and will definitely return and recommend to others!",5,2019,09,23
134,5 star+++ superb!,"Can’t rate this place high enough. Absolutely outstanding and the customer service was outstanding. Allison at the reception area was the nicest host and checked in with us each and every time we walked by. Beyond impressed with all aspects from room, breakfast, staff and the decor. Highest recommendation for sure if your visiting London! Nice job to all that work there! ",5,2019,09,21
134,"We love this hotel, let’s list the greatness","1. Great service, from Alice an Nolan at the front who take care of everything. I lost my phone in transit, and they helped as much as they could.

2, Nice breakfast, paid for it included. Can get a wide variety of fruit, eggs, meat and cereals

3. Extras that are special. Free water in the hallway, either sparkling or still or warm. Such a great idea.

4. Location! 4 minute walk to either Blackfriars or Southwark. We walked and used the tube for most of our stay. Also close to Borough market, the Tate Modern and St Paul’s.

5. Helpful beyond my expectations. I must have emailed Alice or Nolan 15 times over 4 weeks to ask questions about Uber vs black cab, dress code for the theater, to suggestions to visit attractions.

If I ever come back, I would stay here again.
Thanks for a great time.",5,2019,09,18
134,Perfect for work & luxury ,"Love staying in this hotel, I travel a lot for work and this hotel has everything I need to feel at home. Location is great for still getting out and about after work. The hotel is right next to a rebel gym which I love ad it’s a 30 second walk to make a class in the morning or evening. The entry level room is small but one up from it is gorgeous. ",5,2019,09,17
134,A gem of a hotel in a great location,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights recently. It is a bit difficult to find when you take an Uber from the airport since the exterior of the hotel is a bit misleading. The location is superb, very close to Tate Modern. The rooms are fairly spacious and and there are some quirky and odd touches to keep one amused. The A/C was way too cold but Ms Diana from the reception was kind enough to provide a room heater since the A/C control seemed to be misbehaving. A water station in each floor (see photo) is such a novel and useful idea; this dispenses cool and warm still water and sparkling water from 3 different taps. An electronic vending machine (see photograph) is another quirky idea, sure to bring out a smile on your faces. We were not very impressed with the hotel breakfast but many other options are available nearby, including a Pret a Manger. In addition, there is a Waitrose market just behind the hotel. There are many restaurants and pubs in the area.  The service is excellent and the staff are friendly. Overall, this gem offers absolute value for money.",5,2019,09,11
134,LOVEDDDD everything about the Bankside!,"Spent 4 nights at the Bankside and it truly could not have been better. The hotel is spectacular, as is the location, and the service is outstanding. 12 out of 10 stars easily! Everyone was such a joy to interact with – from Macarena at check-in to the lovely Diana on night-shift who was just as bright and bubbly at 11pm as she was at 6am (I seriously don’t know how she does it!). Alice, the concierge, was a tremendous help with perfect recommendations, even before I arrived (thank you so much, Alice!!). The GM, Soyful Alam, was a tremendous help, too. The included breakfast was also great. I wish I could take this hotel and the staff with me on every trip! I recommend this hotel 200%!! Absolutely everything was perfect, and the beds are sooooo comfy!! I always read but rarely write reviews, but I am compelled to because the Bankside is that good, I would be ashamed not to. It’s the least I can do for such an amazing staff. I switched hotels 1 week before my trip, paying twice the price of the original hotel I booked – and it was worth every penny, and more. I hope to be back very soon and will tell everyone I know travelling to London, that they will be very lucky indeed, to stay at the Bankside! ",5,2019,09,08
134,Fantastic hotel,"Having stayed in London many times, this hotel was definitely the best yet. I wanted somewhere a bit different and special for my husbands birthday. This hotel totally ticked every box and more.  It was a lot easier to find then I thought, literally just off Blackfriars Bridge. We had to look twice to make sure it was our hotel as there was none of the usual high countered check in desk but a very relaxed , yet professional desk with with comfy chairs and settees.  We had upgraded our to a starter suite and oh WOW it was well worth it. The attention to detail and quirky yet luxurious interior was outstanding.  I loved the drinks area and variety , the colouring pencils on the desk, the amazing slippers ( non of the usual towelling ones) and the very unusual art in the room.  Not forgetting the electric privacy nets and blackout blinds. Don’t think I have ever taken any notice of the the wall art before.  We had to change and leave quite quickly after checkin but when we returned later that nights there was a lovely surprise of wine and biscuits as a birthday welcome.  The turn down service had been and left some very cute chocolates on our pillows I. The shape of pencils to keep the theme flowing.  We had breakfast in our room the next day.  This was easily ordered via the tablet that was provided that also covered all other aspects of the hotel and contacts.  The Breakfast was completely as ordered and right on time. It was fantastic and served to our table in the room.  As we had a busy day we checked out , grabbed a coffee from the small serving area downstairs and left.  We didn’t want to leave as again the staff were so welcoming as when we arrived.  In fact every staff member we came into contact with throughout the hotel we so welcoming.  The water station on each floor is also something to note. On tap, with ice and jugs next to so you can fill up whenever needed.  The innovative vending machine also had glasses etc next to it to make things more pleasant to use.  Overall this is a wonderful hotel and can’t wait to stay again.  Total luxury in every way but in a relaxed and welcoming way.",5,2019,09,08
134,Wonderful Location for this Hotel Gem,"Stayed here three nights before we sailed on our cruise leaving from Tower Bridge pier. The location near the Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe Theater was outstanding. Much more fun than staying in the usual areas close to Parliament, Picadllly, and Mayfair. Rooms are nicely sized and new. Great place from which to walk across London’s marvelous bridges, including the lovely Millennium. Will stay there on our next London visit. ",5,2019,09,07
134,Amazing service and great hotel,"Visited London for couple of days in Aug and found this gem of hotel that is part of Marriott Autograph collection. It is different - starting with Lobby area - it is a newer hotel but is the people, level of service that sets it apart from run of the mill hotels. Rooms are ultra modern and baths with rain shower! The location is walking distance to London eye and loads of restaurants on water plus an easy walk from Blackfriars station. Highly recommended!!",5,2019,09,07
134,Sparkling water on tap and sparkly underpants from a vending machine ;),"We LOVED this hotel. What a fantastic welcome to London! From check-in to check-out, amazing service, wonderful little welcoming touches, clean, quiet, roomy (by London standards!) and we absolutely loved the location! We were able to take the train from Heathrow no problem and rode the tube everywhere. I was afraid that such a stylish hotel wouldn't be family friendly, but upon arrival they presented my seven year old son with a set of colored pencils, a toy car and a map to color. He was over the moon! My husband loved the sparkling water on tap, I loved the generous in-room coffee and tea set-up, and we all loved the amusing vending machine selection, which is just the kind of cheeky, oh-so-British humor we would expect from such a cool hotel! We were able to find food for our kiddo just steps away at the Tesco To Go, and my husband and I loved the toad-in the-hole at the Blackfriars pub across from the Tube station. My husband needed adaptors to work in our room and the hotel very kindly provided them, free of charge. Plus, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the gorgeous Thames River and River Walk, Borough Market , all just steps away -- we could've stayed forever. We will see you again, Bankside! xx",5,2019,09,04
134,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Stay!","The only time I leave reviews are when my expectations are exceeded! In other words, if the place was ""as expected"" based on what others already said, I don't see the point of leaving another review that sets the same expectations.
For this one, I HAVE to leave a review because... Common'....when EVERYONE is so helpful, accommodating and genuinely nice and the stay is EXCELLENT - well that's the least I can do. 
From the minute we arrived, we felt taken care of. The hotel itself is new, super comfortable, super clean, great details, hip and modern and in a great part of London. We were there for 8 nights. I originally hesitated about staying in one hotel for our entire London vacation but it was actually the best thing we did! We felt at home after the first 24 hours. Literally everyone on staff greeted us every day with a smile on their face. 
I am in the service/hospitality industry as well and I can always tell when service is genuine or forced.  It is definitely genuine there all day even day! Macarena and Danielle - thank you for everything - we had a blast! We will definitely be back soon! I miss this place already...",5,2019,09,01
134,Great Hotel with Amazing Service!,"Amazing and highly recommend! From the moment my family of 4 arrived jet lagged from the US, the hotel staff was extremely accommodating, especially Alyssa and Macarena! We arrived at 9am and knowing our room would not be ready until 3PM they provided us with a room to rest in and keep our bags until our room was ready for check in. The hotel is brand new and the room was very modern and kept extremely clean by the great housekeeping staff! They even folded my clothes which I could not believe. The food at the restaurant was also delicious and had a great little patio outside where we were able to enjoy a nice cocktail and cigar at night. Bruno’s service at the restaurant was also very good. The location was perfect to be able to see all of the great things London has to offer and also have a sense of privacy. Walking distance to great restaurants along the River Thames! As a titanium member with Marriott I’ve stayed at many of their properties and the service here was top of the line and the hotel was great! Highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on vacation or for business.

134,Very nice new hotel,"I had high expectations given all the reviews. For the most part, these were met or exceeded. We stayed for 6 nights in August- two adults and a toddler. 

In general, I wouldn’t recommend this place for those with toddlers. They were very accommodating (brought us a portable crib, baby towel with hood, gave him a cute toy at check in). However the modern furniture in the room is not super toddler friendly. The nightstands appear to be made of stone so we constantly propped pillows up over them. Bed corners also very sharp and rooms have standing showers, not tubs (we knew this and were fine with it- just flagging for any parents).

People were lovely- wine hour on weekday evenings was a pleasant and much needed surprise. We were so appreciative to be able to check in very early on our first day as well.

The water taps as everyone mentions are very convenient. The small fridge in the room is perfect- there is a Little Waitrose across the street and we bought milk and fruit for our stay. 

One downside and the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5: the restaurant staff. The breakfast buffet is delicious, but the staff is all over the place. Every morning we either experienced an issue or witnessed a nearby table with an issue. I don’t think anyone is rude, they just don’t seem to be consistent (bringing some people beverages as they are seated vs some people having to flag someone down after 15 minutes, etc). I hope they work it out- fresh bread, meats, fruit, cereals, eggs, etc make a lovely spread. 

Great location- the Southbank has lots to see and do. Very stroller friendly area along the Thames with lots of restaurants that have outdoor seating. We were able to walk to most of the main sights and a taxi or Uber was reasonably priced. Hotel is still new so most drivers aren’t super familiar with it- they will be soon!",4,2019,08,28
134,Top Notch Posh Hotel,"My husband and I visited London for 9 days and this hotel was a perfect match for us!  
First off, the rooms are beautiful and very functional.  The layout of the rooms has been been strategically planned to create efficiency and comfort.
Secondly, the customer service is incredible!  Alice, Allyssa and Nolan were very patient and accommodating when it came to planning excursions, spas, etc.  Yuri and Julia were simply amazing in the bar/restaurant area of the hotel.  Always patient with our multiple questions. 🥺
The location is optimal; we were able to walk most places but could also access an Uber safely (without being flattened by a bicycle) within minutes.
There is no other hotel that I would consider when we return to London again.  
This is a five star hotel without the five star price tag!
",5,2019,08,27
134,Great hotel ,"Loved this hotel, very modern with lots of of beautiful art from local artist. The best part of this hotel is their employees they are all very service oriented and genuinely nice!  

Loved my stay there and will definitely come back when on London. 

Thank you for an amazing stay! 
",5,2019,08,24
134,A modern Autograph Collection,"Which is a surprise as for a long time the ""one of a kind"" brand for me is associated with soul, chic and, old... Bankside lives up to the standard as a brand new hotel through its interior design, arts, and attention to detail.  Service is great - the front desk staff was accommodating and made it obvious his/her priority is to create a happy customer. The gift shop even stocks Emergency Engagement Ring.",5,2019,08,23
134,Great stay,"We stayed here for 5 nights a few weeks ago and had a great stay.  We arrived early in the morning and were quickly greeted at the check-in desk. Our room wasn't ready yet so they stored our bags, and took extra care doing so after we told them one of the bags contained very fragile items.  Instead of leaving them in the normal place they locked them up in the office so they wouldn't get moved around and potentially broken.  Off to a great start!  When we stopped by again that afternoon we were told our bags were already up in our room, so convenient!  We had the most basic type of room with 1 king bed.  It was very spacious for being the most basic room type, we had tons of room to have our luggage all spread out everywhere without being crowded and there was a ton of space on the far side of the room with a nice chair and table to sit at.  The room itself was very modern and industrial feeling, yet cozy.  I always judge hotels based on if they pass my ""socks"" test, if I feel comfortable enough and feel that the room is clean enough that I feel good walking around in my bare feet without socks on.  Many hotels don't pass this for various reasons and this one passed with flying colors.  Super clean, super modern and nice.  I LOVED that there was a throw blanket draped over the bed, I love blankets and this is something you rarely see in a hotel.  The bathroom was lovely, bit small but super clean and new looking with an awesome shower.  My favorite part was the espresso machine that also dispensed hot water and the fancy teabags they provided...no Tetley here!  I also got a kick out of the remote control blackout shade and the fact that everything is controlled from a tablet.  The tablet has a function where you can request room service or anything you need to be brought up, which is so much more convenient than having to call down.  One night we got cake and needed forks, so we entered a request and less than 5 minutes later we had forks.  Another night I needed an extra shower cap, requested and minutes later there it was.  I even saw an option for free milk and cookies that they'd bring up but sadly I was always too full from dinner to take advantage of this.  Each floor has a water tap with still and sparkling water and ice, and there are pitchers there you can fill up and take back to your room.  This was AMAZING.  We were in London during the awful end of July heatwave (including the 2nd hottest day on record) and the cold, fresh water was such a welcome relief every time we came back, and it tasted way better than London tap water (not a fan, sorry).  The hotel itself is in a fantastic location, just a few minutes down the road from the Southwark tube station (it's about a 5 minute walk). It's basically right on the river, and you can walk along the Southbank towards the London Eye or Tower Bridge, both are within walking distance and it's a really lovely walk along the river.  Took about 10 mins to get to the Eye area and 10 to get to Borough Market, a few more for Tower Bridge.  We walked down to the Eye area almost every night as there was a fun summer festival going on there and it was so lively and exciting.  The specific street the hotel faces is very very quiet and you won't have to worry about traffic noise or anything as it sits back from the main street going over the bridge.  I think the only complaint I have is with the bathroom in our room, and even then it wasn't a major issue.  There is no makeup mirror or anything to get a closer view to put makeup on.  The vanity is so wide that you're super far from the main bathroom mirror when standing at the sink and you can't get closer to it.  There is a little handheld mirror on the dresser but the angle of it is bad for applying makeup and there's really nowhere to put it where it'd be at a good angle and you'd have good lighting.  I ended up opening the closet door (there's a full length mirror inside) and sitting on the floor in front of it to do my makeup, which kind of sucked because the hall lighting is really bad and the dim closet light goes out every few seconds so you have to keep moving to keep it on.  Not the most ideal situation but I made do and that's such a minor part of the stay that it didn't really have any effect on me.  I also didn't love that the bathroom didn't have any plugs (minus the shaver outlet) for me to plug my hair tools in.  I had to do my hair in front of the closet mirror as well.  Overall this was a really fantastic stay.  The room was great, bed was comfy, service was excellent, and the location can't be beat.",5,2019,08,20
134,Nice hotel in a quiet location,"Very convenient and reasonably priced but excellent accommodations. The blackout shades and location on a side street make this a comfortable and quiet business option in London. Front desk check in was a little bit slow and concierge only marginally helpful, but all in a very good value and solid hard product for London. Much better than the older and more expensive properties in Mayfair.",4,2019,08,18
134,New and trendsetting spot in a very good location,"Very modern and individual boutique hotel. Things in the hotel are everywhere a little bit different in comparison to a standard 5-star hotel, such as material, design, art and conceptwise (e.g. reception is just a huge modern table). For young and urban people it is just great. Perfect hospitality from either the reception as well as from the concierge - they know your name from the very beginning. Breakfast is good and more than the typical London breakfast - I recommend to book including breakfast.
Hotel is very modern and stylish and very good located for all trips. Even to the financial district it is just 5-10 minutes. I would go again.",5,2019,08,13
134,A highly Recommended Hotel,The hotel is quite new. Room is spacious and clean. It locates near Borough Maket and London Bridge. Staff at the reception were very helpful and very nice and helpful. Breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed every moment.,5,2019,08,12
134,New Hotel and close to Attractions,"The Hotel has good location, near the river and walking distance to The London Eye and others attractions. The room is clean and  modern. Alisa Cistochina, the Front Office Supervisor was very helpful. All the staffs are very friendly.  Even the room server lady smiled and greeting us when we were in the hall way. Also, they offer umbrellas or ponchos when it was raining. The Breakfast Buffet was good and had variety.",5,2019,08,11
134,Bankside,"This hotel is exceptional!  Wondered if I was in the Tate Modern!

The only issue is room service re offering an omelette for dinner. Spoke with management and offered an upgrade for my next visit. More to follow when my next return in a few weeks!",5,2019,08,10
134,Very Enjoyable Overall,"This modern/new hotel is conveniently located near to transportation, restaurants, bars, etc. The hotel team are excellent throughout, and I thank them for their very good service during our short stay. Restaurant food (breakfast and lunch for us) was very good and well priced. We very much enjoyed our stay overall at the Bankside and look forward to returning.

Why not 5 stars? - because there needs to be some type of elevator notice or warnings (or better bedroom door insulation) to try and protect guests from what I call ""hotel idiots""...  i.e. the morons who shout and laugh at the top of their voices at 1am (or later), never once considering that there might be other people trying to sleep.",4,2019,08,05
134,Do yourself a favor and stay here!,"The Bankside exceeded our expectations in every possible way! Not only is it a great location, but it  has a super cool vibe - love the 3 taps by the elevators on every floor that dispense either cold, bubbly or room temperature water (I travel with a water bottle so this was super convenient for me.) And there’s also a touch screen vending machine on each floor that dispenses not only alcohol and soft drinks, but also anything from Tom Ford sunglasses to an “emergency engagement ring”! The service was exemplary - there was always someone available in the lobby to assist us with anything we needed. 

We had a crazy problem with an outside laundry service we used (we do not recommend The Empress of Smooth launderette, despite its suspiciously good reviews!), and the manager Anna could not have been sweeter about making things right.  We will definitely be back!",5,2019,07,27
134,Excellent all around,"I travel a lot and being pleasantly surprised by hotels does not happen very often ... it helps that the hotel is new (less than 1 year?), the location great (hard to find the first time though - behind Doggett's Pub on the SW corner of Blackfriars Road and the Thames - even our black cab driver got lost), and the staff very friendly and helpful (young and obviously new at it still).

The king room was good sized and the technology great once you figured out how to use it all (it took me about 15 minutes to ChromeCast Netflix to the room TV).  The restaurant/bar was surprising active and there is a Waitrose Light right around the corner to get groceries and other items.

If you are a runner, this is a great place to stay - the Thames south bank has long running paths along the river in both directions.  The north bank also has a path but it weaves in and out of the city quite a bit.

As always, this comes at a cost - not cheap.  Surprisingly, we added 2 days to our stay but ended up booking on Expedia - why they would not match the price is beyond me.",5,2019,07,26
134,Mid-Century Vibes with Modern Amenities,"Our family has been to London about a dozen times over the past six years, first to tour colleges for my older daughter and then eventually to visit her throughout her uni career. We chose this property because of its Southbank location and easy walk to our daughter's graduation ceremony. Where have you been all this time Bankside? You were awesome. Shouts to Raquel who checked us in quickly and to Lino who delivered our bags and demonstrated how to use all of the room's technology.

The Bankside has been in operation only eight months and we are glad we chose them for this stay. Its commitment to the arts and attention to every design detail is evident in its lobby and rooms. Our standard room provided very comfortable beds, lots of plugs for phones and computers, an excellent rain shower, and good air temperature control. We also appreciated the clean and very visible water/ice station on our floor. 

The hotel's location just on the south bank of the Thames on the Blackfriars Bridge is one of my favorite things about the property. Quick access to either the south or north embankment places you in close proximity to the Tate Modern, London Eye, Millennium Bridge, the Shard, and Borough Market.  It is an easy 20-minute walk to Covent Garden and a leisurely ten minutes to three tube stops (Southwark, Blackfriars, and Waterloo).

We don't know when we might return to London now that our daughter has completed her studies, but we will definitely consider the Bankside for our next visit.",5,2019,07,24
134,"Nice, fancy and expensive","Superb location and with nicely decorated and furbished rooms. Lots of amenities. No street noice, but surprisingly noisy from the corridor - doors are definitely not sound proof.
Breakfast average and no better than in any other 4-star hotel - I would say a bit on the dull side. 
Business/meeting facilities superb. ",4,2019,07,24
134,Service not existing,"Nice building , breakfast and location but terrible service!Tried to check in at 10 pm but the reception was 
empty. Later found the only receptionist  on her phone outside and smoking.Finally in the room the fridge was empty and the phone not working. Maybe one day the management will get it running. Until then : avoid it!",1,2019,07,22
134,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the hotel on December 2018 one and a half month after the official opening.
The decoration is very modern, the room spacious, the lobby excellent.
The stuff is very friendly and kind.
We had only a minor problem, the first night after a walk we had at central London it was impossible to find a taxi(very strange for London) ,we asked for help from the hotel reception but they didn't found us a solution for returning to the hotel. I don't say that they ignored us , but the conclusion for us was a 50' walk from Leicester square to the hotel at 11.30pm in the night.
The overall experience from the hotel is very satisfying . We recommend a visit!!",5,2019,07,21
134,"Fantastic! Location, Breakfast, Staff, Service, Accommodations! ","Stayed here with my friend while visiting London. Alice, and all the staff, were top notch! From the front desk, to concierge, housekeeping to the restaurant! Not a single opportunity for improvement/complaint. 

I really liked the “hydration stations” on our floor (5th). The bathrooms have larger/communal size soaps that smell AMAZING! There is a Nespresso machine in each room with local tea and coffee options. There is local London popcorn in the room for no charge as well! The blinds are automated/electric. There are American and USB outlets in the rooms which I HIGHLY appreciated. Zero residual noise was heard in the hallway and there were a couple of families staying while we were there. 

Their English breakfast in the mornings is OVER THE TOP fantastic! So delicious! I am Platinum Elite and just short of Ambassador and breakfast was included with our stay. :) 

Nearby EATS/ Drinks that I recommend: 

The Lyaness at Sea Containers ( across the street and on Open table!) 

The Founders Arms ( down the street by Blackfriars bridge on the same side of the water- FISH AND CHIPS) 

The Anchor & Burroughs Market are also ~ 1 mile easy walking distance.  @marriottbonvoy",5,2019,07,21
134,Simply Fabulous!,"Everything was simply fabulous! The room was beautiful, the bed was so comfortable it felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. The cocktails are definitely worth a try (the seasonal Bellini was lush), and the amenities were super luxurious. The only downside was having to leave!",5,2019,07,21
134,No privacy in room - faced public terrace without one way mirror ,"First the positive. The hotel aesthetics are fantastic. Modern and sleek. Sharp. 

The negative for me was the service as an Elite member, particularly with check in and room. 

1. My room has ZERO privacy. The windows face a public outdoor terrace (see pic). So I have to keep the blind closed the entire time to guarantee privacy. I checked from outside and you can absolutely see in (i.e., windows are not one way mirrors). My choice is no sunlight or no privacy. 

For context, I’m a Gold member, lifetime Gold, and actually had just reached Platinum the day before (so I figure Bsnkside did not know this yet). I would have expected a better room than this! Especially when it costs ~300£/night!

Rm 111 for context if you want to try and avoid. 

2. Did mobile check in and arrived at 5PM (well past 3PM start time). Arrived to hotel and never got the key or room number in app. Explanation was that I needed to check in at the desk to sign papers. So.... that defeats the entire purpose of mobile check in. I’ve stayed at a lot of Marriott properties and normally, you get a key on your phone so you can head straight to the room. Any paperwork you need to sign is waiting on the room itself. Not here. So don’t count on mobile check working. 

3. The check-in is a low level table with low sitting chairs, not a counter. For someone with a back injury (like me), this is a nightmare. If you are elderly or disabled in any way, this might be tough. 

Great looks and outfittings, but not a place I’ll return to.

134,June 2019,"Can’t speak highly enough about the staff - everyone there cares about the guests and they can’t do enough to help. Restaurant fantastic, rooms very comfortable and modern.

134,Fantastic,"Staff is fantastic in all ways.  This is a newer hotel with excellent decor and design.  Restaurant is first rate.  Breakfast buffet , lunch and dinner all excellent.

134,Fantastic stay !!!,"We stayed here for 9 days in June 2019 and it was Outstanding.
Hotel : 
It is part of the Marriott Autograph Collection.
It is a very new Hotel (opened end 2018) with some Contemporary style, 
therefore extremely clean and nice.
Location : 
It is located in the South bank (below the Thames river) and close to two Underground stations (Blackfriars and Southwark 7 min north or south of hotel),
and the Bus stops are right in front, so very convenient to use with your Oyster card or the like.
We wanted to avoid the overly crowded and touristy areas (Westminster, Covent Garden), and mostly older hotels, while still benefiting from a major chain name and services.
Room :
Ample King room, 328, it was spacious. We enjoyed the mini fridge, the in-room safe placed smartly horizontally (although not big enough to fit a laptop but still convenient for everything else, camera etc) and the Ethernet wired internet access (a Major plus in my book instead of the omnipresent unsecured wireless elsewhere).
Weird thing : the electric double curtains (1 sheer and 1 dark) were acting up a few times, by going up without us pressing the buttons. We asked it to be fixed but it did not seem the Maintenance resolved before we left.
Bathroom has the regular hand shower option or the rain shower (fun to try).
For those who cannot live without it, the A/C is controlled from a LCD keypad on the wall. 
For the techy people, there is also a tablet on the night stand customized to the Hotel features, and can be used as alarm clock, for in-room food order, and other miscellaneous internet information (weather).
Food / Restaurant :
We had breakfast included in our reservation, and it is either buffet (all you can eat / help yourself) or a la carte. We chose the former (it comes with oatmeal + walnut and honey or an omelette) and the buffet choice is good : bread, fruits, charcuterie, sausages / bacon, potatoes, cereals, etc.
We dined there (Art & Yard) 1 time, and the food was good.
There are other restaurants or pubs close by, but be aware that ordering food-to-go or having a to-go box is not a common practice. Ex: the 2 closest pubs to the hotel (Mad Hatter and Dogget's) looked at us strangely and politely replied we don't do ""take-away food"".
Luckily, there are a couple of ""Pret-A-Manger"" and ""Abokado"" stores next door as well (sandwiches, soups etc pre-wrapped ready to go).
You can also try the next door local mini-mart ""Little Waitrose"".
Staff : 
This is the by far BEST part of the stay. Everybody at the Hotel was fantastic,
extremely customer oriented and friendly. From the get go, Reservation agent Sandrine, we spoke on the phone with, put a kind word to welcome us to our stay. 
When we arrived (under a rainy day), the bell person came out to help us with our luggage.
Our checking in was a breeze with Nolan (welcome after a long flight and some jet lag), and we continue to see during the rest of our stay.
Macarena and Daniel both Managers who helped us solve a small snafu during the check out.
And to finish, I cannot praise enough Alice, Head Ambassador, who helped us plan ahead some activities, attractions, restaurants (ask her about her little guide of the area and you will not be disappointed). And she got in touch regularly with us with more reservations.
The final touch is they are also multilingual, French or Spanish speaking, depending on your personal background.
In Summary a 5 stars review very well deserved and we will be back at our next opportunity.",5,2019,07,15
134,Five star experience,"The hotel at reception offers excellent customer service, help with luggage to the door of the room, brief explanation of the room and features, and then we were left alone in the quiet of the very nicely appointed room to unpack and rest after a long journey. Free quality coffee/espresso and tea offered in room. Bed, furniture, bathroom, all high quality with aesthetically pleasing decor. Hotel bar and restaurant is very good as well. Location is awesome, walkable everywhere, but quiet, off the beaten path a bit; best of both worlds. We had a wonderful time in London, can't wait to come back.",5,2019,07,13
134,The Art work and design makes this place Pop!,"The stay here was quite a treat and so was the attention to detail.  Upon arriving, we were greeted at the curb by the doorman who assisted us with our luggage.  My wife and two kids (ages 22 and 18) had 2 bags each. He would later explain to the functionality of the automatic drapes and blackout curtain in our rooms which proved to be valuable information.  We were checked in by Diana who had a lovely smile and personality to match.  My wife loved the fact that this hotel didn’t have the standard high check in counter that tired travelers tend to lean on, but instead had a large table and chairs nicely spaced that allowed us to sit and relax. 
We were asked if we wanted anything to drink and given a great verbal tour by Diana who also set up adjoining rooms for the kids.  As I looked around the lobby, I couldn’t help but notice the artwork.  It was awesome!! It carried from the lobby down the hall and into the dining area!  Just beautiful work!

Once inside the rooms, I gave it my ultraviolet light test for stains and checked for pest.  Everything passed with flying colors!  The rooms had this mix of modern technology and artistic feel.  The AC unit did emit a humming sound, however according to a sound device I use for work, it determined that it was mostly white noise, which does not create discomfort!  The view from our room wasn’t the best, however the artwork throughout made up for it.  

The food was lovely as my wife could not get enough of the shrimp salad and crème brûlée.  Breakfast was nice and the even had a few gluten free items to choose from.  My son and I also enjoyed the fitness room which had more than enough gear to use with a TV.  The internet speed also tested amazing at 361 Mbps download and 435 Mbps upload.

I will be returning to this gem of a hotel next year when my Daughter graduates from Royal Holloway and hopefully I will be able to meet the hotel manager.  They made my Family feel at home!",5,2019,07,12
134,Excellent with a final last minute snafu,"Alice is spot on professional- great check in experience.   Room was perfect.  Adrian in the bar / restaurant a stand out on knowledge, service and craft cocktails. Lunch was lovely prior to check out.  We had requested 1pm checkout (jet lag). We were awakened at 8am with a doorbell ring-  then 2 phone calls asking our room number and then hanging up.    Packed and went to pre departure meal-  go to gather luggage at 12:50pm. Key / lock deactivated.  Had to go back to reception and get another key whilst our driver is waiting for us to depart.   Our friends had an “accessible” room due to availability and could never properly flush toilet.  (This was reported and not addressed) they regaled to the lobby facilities to tend to their personal business.   We would go back however, we would expect this would not be repeated with proper feedback.  Everyone was always very nice, this was just a slight disappointment for our brief stay.   ",4,2019,07,12
134,5 STARS ⭐️! ,"One word- stunning! Wow! What an amazing hotel with the friendliest staff! We stayed two nights and it was wonderful! Hotel is immaculate and the rooms are beautiful.  Spotless rooms and comfortable beds. Great location and just a few minutes from the train station.  The staff was top notch and we wish we could of stayed longer.  I did not want to leave :)
Nolan, at check was so nice! He had a very cute personality and took great care of us.  Offered wonderful suggestions of the area and great hospitality all around. 

Macarena, the front of house manager was so sweet and went out of her way to email me recommendations for all the different cities we would be visiting in Spain! Love her and Nolan!

Don’t miss out on this gem of a property. We will be back! <3

134,This Hotel is just awesome.,"We stayed at this hotel for three days and the hotel  is just awesome.  I highly recommend this place if you are staying in London.  As soon as you walk, you get a very warm welcome and everyone there is so helpful and attentive.  This was our first time in London and they made it so pleasant.  Our room was beautiful, clean, and technology suave.    We are  definitely staying there the next time we are in  London.  Again,  I highly recommend this Hotel. ",5,2019,07,08
134,Fantastic!  The best!,"Honestly one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever stayed in.  I can’t say enough about the comfort level of this hotel.  The beds are so comfortable and the room is spacious. We traveled with our daughter, 20 and son, 10 and the room had two queen beds and plenty of room to spread out.  The bath towels were deluxe!  It was a weekend so there was a little bit of hallway noise as people returned to their rooms in the late evening, but not bad.  The staff was also exceptional. Location is fantastic—we appreciated that it was a little quieter than other areas of the city.  Maybe highlight was taps of still or sparkling water available in the public area. Absolutely perfect and I would recommend to all and hope to return!",5,2019,07,05
134,Solid hotel,"This bright, modern hotel on the south bank was very nice.  The room was spacious and user-friendly.  Free coffee, water, and snacks in the room.

Location near Blackfriar Bridge was convenient but not cute.  Close to Blackfriars tube and train stations as well as Southwark tube stop.  Also near all the touristy South Bank stuff like Tate Modern, etc.

Art Yard Restaurant was good not great.  Outdoor terrace on the 1st floor was cute and we had it all to ourselves the 2 afternoons we chilled out there for a bit.   

All in all, a good deal for nice room in a convenient location at a reasonable price - especially for Marriott loyalists.",4,2019,07,05
134,Amazing!,This hotel far exceeded our expectations. Very new clean rooms. Still and sparking water “on tap” in the hallway with kerrafes to take to the room. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Definitely will come back again!  ,5,2019,07,05
134,3 night stay and very HAPPY !,"This hotel is absolutely clean and the welcoming from the staff makes you feel like home . The reception area is nothing like other hotels which is a plus . Breakfast is amazingly delicious and they plus for us is they have water you can easy get on the hallways to take to your room . 
The room are so clean , perfect for a couple , everything new and they have tea and coffee makers in the room ( the fancy ones ) . I 100 % recommend this place and would stay here once more in the future .",5,2019,07,03
134,Excellent,"Stayed a couple of times here in June and had an excellent time. Rooms were nice and clean, staff friendly and pleasant. We had a very early check in, left for Paris for a couple of days before returning for a final night, with the hotel looking after our cases and a guitar and nothing overwhelmed them at all. Excellent, I really can’t fault them at all. Finally, for London, this place is great value for money. Only four minutes walk to two tube stations and they made the sun shine throughout our visit.",5,2019,07,03
134,Fabulous for work and family,"We're wrapping up a 10 day stay at Bankside Hotel and have been so impressed with every aspect of our stay. As background, my husband and I are here with our three elementary school aged children and this trip is a mix of fun and work for both of us. 

ROOMS: Modern, spotless and comfortable. We did have an issue with air in one of our rooms, but because we had adjoining rooms it was ok to get the cool air from the other room. The beds are so comfortable, great modern amenities, Nespresso machine in room, mini fridge to use if needed (There's a Little Waitrose store around the corner), and a small but very nicely appointed bathroom with a fabulous shower. The wi-fi worked great which was key to getting work done.

HOTEL: The staff all couldn't have been more kind and helpful. They provided great recommendations for kid friendly afternoon tea, helped with mailings and just generally greeted us in such a warm way that was always appreciated after a long day. The lobby has a great relaxed vibe and served as a great work space when needed. It's a cozy 5 story hotel and we had breakfast included in our rate which was a fantastic way to start our day (buffet style with quality items from eggs, bacon, yogurt, cereal, fruit, etc). There's not really a formal late night dining room service, but that wasn't an issue for us. 

LOCATION: It's located close to Blackfriars and Waterloo tube stops so made getting around easy. But - the nicest surprise because I wasn't familiar with this area south of the Thames - was the amazing riverfront walking path. There are so many sights (Tate Modern, Golden Hinde, London Eye) and restaurants/pubs that stretch for a few miles along the river. It was such an easy place to walk with the kids and not worry about traffic. 

I can see why my husband often chooses to stay here for work and am so happy we got to experience the Bankside Hotel.",5,2019,06,25
134,Great Place,"We stayed 3 days after leaving a cruise.  The Bankside was a great stay and just couldn't be better.  The location along side the Thames made most tourist stops reachable by Water Bus (the dock is close by).  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, especially host Alice.  The food is very good.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern.  The hi-tech room functions take a bit of study, but are soon handled and effective. The free wine event every Monday to Thursday from 5:30 to 6:30 is well attended and adds to the overall friendliness of the hotel.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else when I return to London.",5,2019,06,21
134,What a fabulous hotel experience!,"My family and I arrived very late on a Sunday night and Night Manager Daniel G. provided tired travelers immediate comfort by arranging for sandwiches and a drink when none could be found.  The great experience continued with the daytime staff, including a wonderful onsite restaurant.  Daniel G. continued the warm hospitality by helping with a business need of mine; the bartenders were also helpful with wine and spirit recommendations.

I could not be more impressed with this hotel; a definite A+ rating for all who come to London.",5,2019,06,19
134,Best hotel experience in London,"I’ve lived in London and since I moved out I have visited many times always staying at hotels, but this was really something different. It is trully a 5 star experience, from check in to (even after) check out. 
The staff is so professional and friendly. We were offered complimentary drinks at the bar while our room was being prepared. 
The rooms are bigger than any regular room hotel in London.... as big as you’d expect a room at Vegas. All brand new, gorgeously decorated. 
Thankfully they dont limit the A/C at nights as they do in most hotels in Ldn because there are thermostats with full control in the rooms.
Sparkling water taps on each floor!!! We were really impressed and happy with this!
The internet is also perfect... VoIP calls can be made without a hiccup (also difficult in all other hotels). 
The whole vibe is artsy and cool, but not trying too hard. I’m so glad we found this hotel as it will become our future choice for all our future London visits.

Other cool things:
- fun + helpful vending machines (they even have an engagement ring!)
- great pillows
- amazing art and general interiors throughout the hotel 
- 100% walkable location to awesome sights 
- the soap/shampoo range smells amazing!",5,2019,06,10
134,Wonderful hotel ,"This hotel happens to be in a great spot for just about everything in London.
We are SPG card holders so we got an upgrade.
Upgrade is equal to what you would expect in the States.
This hotel’s staff was great, and we are coming back in June to stay here again.",5,2019,06,10
134,Cracking weekend,"We stayed at the hotel with two other couples, we booked in lunchtime Saturday and dropped bags, went out for lunch and the afternoon, back in the evening to prepare for the night ahead. The rooms very comfortable, tea/coffee, TV, spacious bed, water on tap in the corridors, vending in the lift lobby with an array of gifts from bottles of drink to sparkly pants and and adjustable engagement ring. Beds are the best and shower the biggest! After the night out a welcome full English breakfast the morning after. I can’t recommend the hotel enough, a sharply fitted modern hotel, you can’t help but love the place with its own distinctive smell to all the fixtures and fittings and lovely staff. Superb! ",5,2019,06,10
134,TRULY EXCEPTIONAL!,"During my trip to London, I had the opportunity to stay at the Bankside Hotel. One word: WOW! Everything from the moment I checked in with Nolan (who was amazing and remembered my name my entire stay), to the room (highly recommend the Ample King), to the awesome and personable bar staff at the hotel bar (shout out especially to the bartenders-they made me feel welcome and important and rate as 10/10 bartenders!).
The hotel is out of the craziness of London, which I found nice. I learned how to use the tube and there are two stations near the hotel. It is a modern/chic hotel. I couldn’t have been more pleased with my stay here! I will DEFINITELY be staying here when I come back. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",5,2019,06,10
134,Excellent Staff,"We stayed in room 227 and found it comfortable and well appointed. The hotel was clean and beautiful decorated in an understated way. The daily coffee and tea setup was very nice. The staff was the highlight of the property. The managers to the cleaning staff were always willing to help with anything large or small. 
We like the fact that basically across the street and you were on the river with many dinning options. The Brough Market was just a short walk with even more options.",5,2019,06,07
134,5 star classy hotel,"My husband I stayed here for only one night but this hotel left a great impression on us. Location is amazing! It is near walking distance to a lot of attractions/public transport.
The lobby is wonderful and inviting. I like that check in is a sit down desk. Everyone is so nice and friendly. We checked in using a Marriott discount. We only stayed here for a night to meet a friend. The water dispensers on each floor is much appreciated! Too bad I didn't get to take a picture of them.
Very classy room with mid-century modern vibe. Nespresso coffee maker is a lifesaver. We checked out early to catch the eurostar to france. The uber ride to the station was fast.",5,2019,06,06
134,Feel like a VIP,"From the minute you walk in, you sense how different this hotel is.  No typical check in counters here; rather low lying free form tables .  Behind them the most
hospitable employees greet you warmly.  We were quickly checked in and told that
wine would be served in the pre dinner hour, shortly.
Maquerena showed us to our room and pointed out special features not seen in
most hotels.  She wished us well and left us to enjoy the large, lovely room.
The next morning we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast. buffet.  Although it's pricey at
the usual rate of about 20GBP, the ambiance was relaxing and the food quality
above average.  I was especially impressed by the breads and pastries.
The only drawback for me was the modern shade/blind dual system.  It takes a bit of time to get used to operating the see through shade and black out shade.
The negative is, in the morning, I could not open the shade just a bit to get some light without waking my husband.  When you press the button it is quite
noisy and moves quickly letting in too much light.

Anyway, loved the hotel and employees, especially Maquerena and Alissa who
were so helpful.  
Blackfriars train station is nearby with good access to Gatwick.  Also, were able to buy Oyster cards there to use for discounted bus and subway access.
Several restuarants are near as well as Tate Modern museum.",5,2019,06,01
134,"Brilliant Hotel, excellent service.","Myself and my husband had the pleasure of staying in Bankside Hotel for three nights, the hotel was very clean, modern and extremely comfortable. We found the staff not only curtious and helpful but very attentive and friendly, they never missed an opportunity to greet us with a smile. The location we found excellent, a short walk to the South Bank where central London was easily accessible. Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2019,05,25
134,Lovely Hotel,"Hotel was easy to find with a nearby supermarket. Greeted by the friendly staffs upon arrival and our check-in was quick and seamless. 

The room was very clean but a little tight for the 4 of us especially with big luggage. Water pressure was good and I love the lotion provided since the weather was pretty dry.

I’ve also enjoyed the tv in the room and I would say it a tech savvy room. We are able to cast video from our phone and Netflix available for us. Love it and the experience!

Location wise is not as ideal as other more prime location but the subway is just a 5-10mins walk and transport are very accessible in London so wasn’t a big issue.",4,2019,05,24
134,"Great new, clean hotel and super find of a restaurant","This is now a Marriott hotel.  It seems to have been independent prior.  It has a ""mid-century"" style that is unique but fresh.  It works nearly everyplace except maybe the lobby, which feels a bit like you stumbled into someone's big living room. But while the rooms aren't huge, they are fairly typical for London size but with everything fresh - great big towels, some of the best robes, updated fixtures, etc.  It is a great location next to Blackfriar bridge/station.  Lots within only a stop or two on the Tube.  The restaurant is really quite good.  Unique approaches to dishes without being too funky.  I am not sure how you would discover the restaurant as they aren't listed on Yelp or other.  I ate there both nights, which is saying something in a city like London with all the great places to eat.  Only cons are the small gym and no other spa like services/facilities, and I had some street noise that woke me up too early.  Breakfast buffet is good quality but could use a few more selections, but nothing to complain about when it is included in the rate.  I will definitely be back.  Marriott status was acknowledged, but didn't get us much.",5,2019,05,23
134,Fabulous hotel,"Just had our second stay at this hotel and it’s simply faultless . The style and design is very tasteful. What sets this hotel apart from others is the staff , can’t do enough for you to make your stay comfortable,  a big thank you to Richard on reception !!",5,2019,05,22
134,Great Hotel With Amazing Service,"The hotel has only been open for 7 months and is a refreshing modern small hotel.  But as nice as the hotel is it is the service that shines.  I have stayed in a number of famous 5 star hotels in London which do not have the same level of personalized service.

The other thing which is noteworthy is the hotel was clearly designed and managed to reduce waste.

The food is also great, with the last order being taken at 10:15 PM which is great for a . late arrival.

With respect to the location it is perfectly suited for The City; it is also a block and a half from both the Black Friars and the Southwark tube stations so all all of London is only a couple of stops away.",5,2019,05,22
134,Exceeded expectations,"Stayed here for a night and left very impressed.
Polite and efficient check in. Staff all very courteous and helpful .
Lovely and new, modern design with hints of classic that keeps it from being too cold and austere.
Mattress very comfortable, good sound proofing so didn’t notice busy London outside, great blackout blinds, and foam pillows to order. Great nights’ sleep. 
Loved the extra touches:
-Water dispenser of fizzy or still in the corridors
-Mini bar gone and replaced with a funky vending machine that sells your regular mini bar items as well as sparkly pants or an emergency engagement ring.
-Nespresso coffee machine in the room, with cups or takeaway cups if you want to take one with you too.

We didn’t have breakfast in the restaurant, but got a great coffee, pastry and yoghurt to go from the quick bar area, (and reasonably priced too) which is great if you don’t want to have a big breakfast.

Super location for getting into london and proximity to Waterloo station. 

Would recommend and we shall definitely be back. 
",5,2019,05,19
134,Amazing hotel equally matched by hotel staff,"First of all, Nolan is great! From the moment you walk-in, he makes you feel at home. The hotel is nicely renovated and includes sparking water, filtered water, and vending machines on each floor to meet all your liquor needs. 

Metro station is a short 5-8 minute walk from hotel and gives you access to all the main attractions easily. Don't think twice and book hoe",5,2019,05,19
134,Hidden Gem in London,The hotel is in a great location but not one I had ever thought of before. We loved it the hotel it’s self is physically beautiful and the staff is so sweet and attentive. Also the room we book was the smallest offered I can only imagine we were upgraded as it was very spacious for any city and huge for London standards. When we are back in London this hotel will certainly be a top choice. ,5,2019,05,18
134,High-end Boutique Hotel with BEST SERVICE in London by Thames River,"I am a Marriott Titanium elite member.  I travel all over the world.  This is a true 5-star hotel - not too opulent or over the top.  The service from Diana and Richard (day manager) was amazing.  There was a small mishap, and they RESOLVED it to exceed expectations.  The location is in the financial district, by the Thames River, so it is NOT at the heart of everything, but London is a BIG city, and this is close to some major tourist attractions, and at the same time, a little quieter.  

# High-End Boutique Hotel with BEST SERVICE in London by Thames River",5,2019,05,06
134,Nice!,This is a very nice and modern hotel. It’s across the street from Blackfriars train station which has direct trains to and from airport as well as getting around London. Their bar scene has a nice ambiance. And the drinks were good. They actually have a mixologist versus an average bar tender. The rooms have nice views and amenities. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2019,05,06
134,5-Star stay in a 4-Star Hotel,"This was our first stay at the Bankside Hotel by Marriott’s Autograph Collection, we stayed for five nights.  We had previously stayed in several of Marriott’s Autograph Collection and were prepared to be surprised.  We were not disappointed.
The Bankside is perfectly situated just on the south side of Blackfriars Bridge in central London.  Just a short walk cross the bridge to the tube, or when the weather is nice a longer walk takes you right into the center of Westminster, the London Eye, and so many of London’s fabulous places.
The hotel itself is brand new.  Over five floors, it is living up to the Autograph Collection’s theme of unusual luxury hotels.  The theme of the hotel is ‘anything, anytime’, as we found out.  The reception staff, everyone we met, could not have been nicer or more helpful.  The Hotel only has a limited menu in it’s restaurant, but we had no problems getting excellent eggs benedict, or salmon salad at 2:00 at any hour of the day.  The interior is modern, with an artist’s touch.  It has work spaces for resident artists and many features we had not seen in other hotels. 
Among the many good ideas is a water fountain on each floor where free still, or sparking, water is available for self-serve right from the tab.  The Bar-vending machine is another great idea.  No matter what time, just a short walk to the elevator and there is a little library area together with a vending machine that serves champagne, wine, and many other drinks and ‘mature’ items.  If there is ever need for help, staff have gone out of their way to accommodate our requests.
Our room was terrific.   Having said that, we also stayed at the ‘biggest suite’ (#442), at the end of the hotel with 180 degree views through floor to ceiling windows.  There was ample space to lounge in the living room, generous closet space, and no fewer than four TVs – two of which built into the his-and-her bathroom mirrors.  The bathroom was a good size, although the shower was a bit of a squeeze.  The freestanding bathtub at the center of the bathroom was comfortable for one, but not two. 
The reason for giving the hotel only 4 stars is the lack of some of the facilities one would expect from a 5 star hotel.  There is no pool or spa in the building, although arrangements with a local spa can be made for massages.  The limited food choices were another drawback.  For an area that does not have many late-night eating options, this was a constraint for travelers coming from the US and getting hungry well past closing time.  Considering that we were in the largest available room, it was certainly comfortable, but not always as spacious as one would expect.  One unfortunate aspect is that the hotel is surrounded by other buildings that are higher, or least as high.  From the second highest floor, St. Paul’s cathedral was tantalizingly close, but no amount of head-twisting allowed for a view from our end of the hotel.  
Our stay was fabulous, despite the missing amenities. In the end, what counted for us was the hospitality and warmth of everyone who worked there.
A definite go-to destination in London for future visits.",4,2019,05,01
134,Fan blooming tastic,My husband Tom and I were in London for 2 nights and stayed at the bankside hotel. The minute we walked into the hotel we felt welcomed and a fabulous relaxed atmosphere with fabulous decor. The staff are all very friendly and very professional. We enjoyed the wine hour and chatting to Alice a member of staff. We will return to stay here and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! ,5,2019,04,28
134,Impressed!,"We used our SPG points to book a stay here sight unseen, and were quite impressed.

Pros: the property is 6 months old and brand new. The front desk and concierge service is world class. Everyone was over-the-top helpful. They knew my name before I checked in and had everything ready. The location is an easy walk to the “Hop on hop off” bus stops.

The hotel has the most modern amenities available. A personalized tablet to contact housekeeping or order services without having to call. A big electronic vending machine in the lobby that dispenses liquor and fun adult products. Nice touches: art supplies in your room, an eco-friendly water filling station in the hallway, Nespresso and tea in your room. Eco-friendly toiletries in large pump containers and not single-use plastic sizes. Huge, comfortable room. The lounge and restaurant appear to be extremely popular.

I could rave all day about the artwork! 

Cons: The aforementioned popular restaurant is also LOUD after 5pm, and the lobby is full of exuberant trendy people spilling out from the bar. It is adjacent to the lobby, so that gets loud, too. (You can’t hear it from inside your room, at least.) A minor quirk: there is no outlet for the blow drier in the bathroom, so you have to dry your hair by the window. Odd. (You can only plug a shaver in in the bathroom.)

Restaurant food was good, but nothing outstanding. Limited menu. If the food could catch up to the quality of the bartending...... Dinner service was much better than breakfast. The first day our breakfast server announced that she was very sick and working anyway (yay! I have a reduced immune system, so I was none too happy about getting her germs...) and the 2nd day we had to get up and go find someone to get coffee and water refills after 30 minutes. They pretty much forgot us the 2nd day, although we were the closest table to the hostess station.

",5,2019,04,27
134,Significantly overpriced,"The Bankside is a modern, chic hotel well situated for access to all parts of southern and central London. The beds are comfortable, the rooms have everything you need, the bathroom has pleasant toiletries, there are plenty of social areas, the bar and restaurant are enjoyable areas and the staff are excellent.
However, there are a number of things that are not so good. Our room looked directly into nearby apartments. There was a lot of noise from the road. One of the blinds didn't work. There was a constant high pitched vibration from the air conditioning. The controls for the shower had been fitted the wrong way round i.e. they controlled the opposite shower to what it indicates. The water pressure in the shower was poor. The bedroom ceiling is probably 'urban chic' but looks unfinished. Breakfast is not included.
We have had a pleasant stay and, at the half the price, I would have been very happy. However, for these prices, I expect perfection and a lot more for my money. It will not be on my 'return to' list.",3,2019,04,27
134,Amazing love atmosphere,"Daniel and Alex and every one human being who works at the hotel were helpful loving and kind. I enjoyed my stay, there was just abundance of human connection and love. I definitely recommend anyone to experience human connect this hotel has to offer.",5,2019,04,24
134,Perfect End,"Bankside Hotel has been amazing in all aspect...from the check-in, breakfast, housekeeping, staff, and the check- out, nothing but great things to say about this hotel. Yes, it's brand new, but the staff with their friendly and welcoming disposition has made our London trip very enjoyable. Bankside Hotel is our 3rd hotel during our 2 weeks Europe trip. The hotel is modern yet inviting, incredibly clean, and comfortable. There's construction going on outside, but it's not an inconvenience. Location is amazing and there are 2 tube stations nearby. The closest is Blackfriars and Southwark. London eye, westminster abbey, Big Ben is about 0.7 miles walk. Everything else, you can take the tube. There are a lot of restaurants and bars around the area too. Again, thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if I come back to London, Bankside Hotel will be my first choice!",5,2019,04,20
134,A perfect stay at the Bankside,"This could be our new favorite hotel in London! We will definitely stay again next time we visit.

LOCATION - The Bankside is the perfect choice if you want easy access to all of the city's attractions without being in the middle of the more touristy areas. It is tucked down a small side street just a minute's walk away from the river, and a few minutes from the ""Queen's Walk"" which runs alongside the river and is dotted with food trucks, an outdoor book market, and various London landmarks including the National Theatre. You're also within very easy access of several tube stations that connect you with all that London has to offer, while still giving you a peaceful base to come back to at the end of the day.

ROOMS - The rooms are gorgeous, modern, clean, and ""industrial chic."" The Ample King was even more spacious and nicer than the pictures. The whole room felt light, airy, and cozy. We enjoyed the powerful shower and luxury shampoo/conditioner.

SERVICE - Everyone we interacted with could not have been any kinder or more welcoming, and they really made us feel right at home.",5,2019,04,18
134,This feels like a true 5 star hotel ,"This brand new property is immaculate with a lot of interesting design elements.  I like the “lobby, check in area” which amounts to an open table with staff rather then a desk / kiosk.  I also ate at the hotel which you could do a lot worse if you were trying to find a late night option.  I’d encourage anyone to read about Nordic design theme throughout the hotel.  And while there are hotels in London that may feel more central, it’s actually in a prime area of Blackfriars.  Your in walking distance to Tate modern, restaurants and a nice neighborhood and the Blackfriars tube station.  

My room was fantastic.  Absolutely huge.  

The bottom line:  this hotel has a rare combination of feeling both corporate and boutique - a real plus for Marriott work travel or a weekend as a tourist.   ",5,2019,04,07
134,Short stay but very sweet,"We checked into the Bankside Hotel just for the night and cannot speak highly enough about it.  Friendly service from the moment we checked in, slick modern rooms adorned with interesting artwork and price wise it's extremely competitive compared to less nice hotels just over the side of the river.  A great option if you want to stay close to the London CBD.",5,2019,04,02
134,Perfect stay,"My boyfriend and I recently spent 3 nights at the Bankside. We loved the hotel, the location and the staff. Lobby and rooms are very stylish and modern. Staff is so accommodating and caring. They take hospitality to another level. I loved the location of the hotel, a newer area which is convenient and quiet. I cannot say enough good things about this property. You will be delighted with your stay.",5,2019,03,26
134,A Brilliant Find!,"We spent hours on Tripadvisor before our holiday trying to find a unique hotel for our tenth trip to London. Those hours spent on the computer were worth it, since we found the perfect place when discovering Bankside Hotel!

We stayed at Bankside Hotel for six nights. The area was already familiar to us and we found it very convenient and vibrant. Two tube stations – Blackfriars and Southwark – are very close. When arriving at Bankside Hotel, we instantly noticed the chic, inspiring but also cosy decor of the reception area. We were met with such warmth and professionalism at the reception.

We had a Modest King room, which is one of the smallest categories but we still found it spacious enough for our six-night stay. There was a lot of storage space for our stuff both in the room itself, as well as in the bathroom. The view was lovely and the room felt surprisingly quiet, which was hugely appreciated since I’m a light sleeper. One of the best features of the room was the bed, which I would rate as the most comfortable I have encountered in London! We also loved the bed linens and towels! The room was immaculately clean every day.

So thank you, Bankside Hotel, for making us feel like home and for ensuring that we had such a wonderful time during our holiday! We would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for a unique hotel in London. We hope to return very soon!",5,2019,03,17
134,"Smart, modern, very friendly.","This is a smart and modern hotel with a touch of luxury, despite the awful bare concrete ceilings in the bedrooms. But what made it such a pleasure during my trip was the great staff - friendly, extremely welcoming and helpful. Good breakfast as well.",5,2019,03,14
134,Fantastic hotel ,"Staying for one night on a business trip. The staff at this hotel are simply amazing and go above and beyond. They are so friendly and helpful- particularly lovely Diana the night manager (so professional, friendly and very helpful) and Nicolo Civello the head bartender who was very knowledgeable, professional and a great asset to the hotel. We are really impressed with both of them and we travel regularly for work to London and stay in hotels. We arrived early today from a transatlantic flight and I called ahead to ask if it was possible for an early room. The reception were so helpful on the telephone prior to arrival and when we arrived they had noted it on our booking as we had our room early. Check in was easy and bags sent up. The room is gorgeous, the bed is so comfy and room large spotlessly clean and modern. The bathroom is gorgeous with plump towels and spa quality shower and soaps/lotions etc. Really very impressed-so much so, we will come back in our own time if we want a lovely place to stay in London. Well done Bankside hotel we will be back! ",5,2019,03,05
134,Nice hotel in a good location.,"Part of the Autograph Collection, this hotel has its own personality focusing on art in various form. 
The lobby and check in desk is not what you normally experience in other hotels. It is very minimalistic in a modern way with just and it is more like coming into someone’s living room. 
The room was very cosy and elegant. We appreciated the very comfortable bed with good support pillows. 
The breakfast buffet was nice but we missed baked beans!
The hotel is located very conveniently to the National Theatre and the Southbank Centre. We have walked across the Waterloo Bridge to the Savoy in the evening which is a nice pleasant walk with beautiful views of many London’s landmarks incl. the St. Paul’s cathedral.",4,2019,03,05
134,Really nice hotel which only needs small improvements to be perfect,"The Bankside hotel seems to be brand new. At least the interior looks like it is. The hotel is not decorated and furnished like hundred other Marriotts, although it belongs to Marriott. It looks like a boutique hotel! The rooms are a bit small but tastefully decorated. You will not find the standard white towel, but they are brown and grey and fluffy. The bed was very good. The entire room was very clean. The hotel staff is very helpful. 

We only used the restaurant for breakfast. The food as such was good, but the service seems like it is still practicing how to properly interact with the kitchen. It was not easy to get the orders to the table in time like we ordered them. But this can be improved easily. 

By the way, the entrance of the hotel is not on Blackfriars Rd but on Upper Ground, just around the corner. ",4,2019,03,02
134,Good Hotel,"Nice Hotel. Staff was great. Everything was new. I got the ample king, so it was a normal size (U.S. standards) with a small sofa in addition to the bed. The rooms were very modern with a clean look to it.",5,2019,02,28
134,"FABULOUS property, well appointed, simply stunning","What a pleasant stay at Bankside hotel. The room was large, decor was simply stunning, bathroom bit on the small side, but it was adequate, again the decor stunning. Even the architecture is stunning!

Ordered room service, burger cooked to my preference, ordered the gin cocktail, way too strong, I had to request some tonic to tone it down.

Staff very attentive, professional and welcoming. Highly recommend.",5,2019,02,19
134,"Love, love, love this hotel!!!","My girlfriend and I have had the pleasure of staying here three times now. The rooms are spacious, the beds are massive and so comfy and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. 

Macarena, the assistant front of house manager checked my girlfriend and I in. Asked us what was the reason for our stay, which was for my birthday. The booking was made under my girlfriends name, there was no way Macarena knew my name other than hearing my girlfriend say my name but never the less that evening I received a personalised birthday card, bottle of Prosecco and a few treats to the room. So, for that I would like to thank you very much Macarena, your attentiveness and diligence meant our stay started off perfectly. 

The location is perfect, a 6 minute walk north is Blackfriars underground and a 6 minute walk south is Southwark underground. Shakespeare Globe, Borough Market, HMS Belfast, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, London Eye, Westminster etc, all within walking distance. 

I love this hotel, I can't wait to come back! Incredible hotel in an incredible city.",5,2019,02,15
134,Excellent choice,"Top new hotel from Marriot’s Authograph collection. Excellent choice when you stay at the south bank. Trendy, comfortable, great smiley crew. Best of the new in the business friendly boutique hotel type. Well done",5,2019,02,13
134,"New hotel - great rooms, good location","I travel to London 1 week every month and this is my new favorite London hotel.  I've now stayed there twice.  The rooms are great - clean, modern, and comfortable.  Breakfast is nicer than the average British full breakfast and service was very attentive.  The location is good, but not great.  It's a short trip to lots of different locations, but nothing in the immediate area of the hotel.  I ended up taking the 8 min walk across the Thames to catch the Circle and District Line Underground to get around.  From there you can quickly go to the West End or City Center.  I'll definitely be back.",5,2019,02,12
134,New favourite hotel!,"I’m here at the moment, the third time in the last 3 weeks that I’ve stayed. It truly feels like a home from home, in a way that is rare in a hotel. The staff are wonderful; polite, warm, welcoming and friendly. Nick at the bar is superb. The rooms are so comfortable and well equipped. Little touches such as sit down check in, bedside usb charger, and water carafes in the hall, really make a difference to the stay. I’m already booked in for the next few stays too, and can’t see me staying anywhere else when I’m in London. Thank you for putting together such a fantastic product!  Oh, and thank you for the room upgrade this time :)",5,2019,02,07
134,NEW PROPERTY - GOOD LOCATION BUT TEETHING PROBLEMS,"Have Stayed  TWICE in Dec.18 - FIRST TIME FOR CHRISTMAS PARTY with staff, Room Upgrade was given But was more Suitable for less able  person & the Shower wasn't  suitable & the room had A PILLAR obstructing the TV.
Second time stayed for 5 days & NO UPGRADE  was given even though  I am PLATINUM ELITE MEMBER. Breakfast IS GOOD but can be trying if the Restaurant  is  FULL. Food isn't REPLENISHED on time & had to wait For Basic Stuff like Bread , Bacon, Eggs, Juice, etc. 
Restaurant food  is GOOD for LUNCH/ DINNER. Chef has got Talent BUT the staffing at times Can be Erratic . As the Hotel is New- Hope next  time the Service levels will be  More Tuned to Demand.
Fitness room is very packed , No sunlight & is very isolated. 
Electric Curtain can be  Problematic at times!!",3,2019,01,27
134,First Class,Loving the design and image. Loving the bar and the fabulous service and advice on the drinks. The food in the restaurant was first class the aubergine with a lightly curried aioli was superb Just loved the place period. ,5,2019,01,27
134,Fantastic experience,"We stayed at Bankside Autograph Collection for an extended weekend. Our very early arrival was not an issue - the highly service minded, professional and friendly staff managed to get a room ready for us to check in within the hour. 

Our modest king room offered a high level of comfort - great bed, well cleaned, complimentary water bottles and all the modern technology we could ask for (usb outlets next to the bed, iPad to order room service, chromecast, free WiFi...)

High quality breakfast started off every day great - both a small size buffet and a la carte was available. We didn’t find time to try the restaurant for dinner but from the looks of it - it would have been great.

The only downside to this hotel would be the location - the surroundings did not offer as much as we hoped for, but there was a few nice restaurants nearby, and a nice walk along the river. Southwark tube station was 5-7 minutes away by foot - so we easily managed to go where we wanted.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going for a couples weekend or travelling with friends. Especially thanks to the very friendly and welcoming staff.",5,2019,01,27
134,Gorgeous hotel,"Have already stayed 3 times and returning again soon.  Great sized rooms, huge comfy beds, fridge that you can put your own bits & pieces in.  Super quiet, even has a complimentary water fountain in the hallways for fresh cold or sparkling water.  Lots of special little touches and unique furnishings and art. Staff are helpful and welcoming and go out of their way to help.  Would highly recommend for business or pleasure.",5,2019,01,26
134,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel. It’s brand new, modern, and a beautiful design. The rooms are very comfortable as is the bed. There’s a water tap on the floor to fill a pitcher to bring back to your room which is a great touch. The staff is so friendly and nice and helped answer any questions I had. Good location near Shakespeare’s Globe and right by a bus stop and underground station.",5,2019,01,23
134,Southbank night,"Stayed one night in this flawless and brand new hotel, really liked the decoration and services they provide, all the staff was really great, starting by the receptionist that helped me with the checking as I lost my credit card, she quickly brought the manager and they helped me to sort out the problem, after 5 minutes I was already in my room, night team very helpful, the manager Daniel was outstanding and he brilliantly accommodated all our requirements, so with all of this, room and premises I would give 10/10",5,2019,01,18
134,Super comfort hotel in center of London,"We stayed overnight in this brand new hotel located in the business district in London and everything was perfect. 

We arrived around noon and discovered this lovely and modern lobby (we looooved the fireplace!!). The check-in is made seated (how great is that) so you can relax when you arrive at the hotel after a long way. 
The lady at the reception found us a room available because ours was not readdy yet. She found the perfect room with two queen size beds Inside. 

We would like to give a special thank to Armado (sorry if misspelled) who provided us an incredible service. He showed us the way to our room and explained us everything Inside. he was also great on our leaving day with providing train explications and we felt like he enjoys his job. 

The rooms are great, very modern, with all the amenities you need (coffee, minibar, iPad, safe, a laaaarge luggage rack, performing hair dryer) and the beds are like cloud Dreams. 

We spend most of our time outside so we were not able to try the restaurant or the wine tasting in the evening but we tried the breakfast. You can either choose buffet or a la carte. The buffet was good with quality products. Beautiful decoration in the restaurant area. 
Maybe you should provide larger glasses for juice because we had to take 3 to have enough juice and also the spoons are not fitting in the yoghurt pot, but these are just détails. 
Also, I started choking because of a salmon piece (even my friend did not notice haha) but one of the manager (I guess?) ran to give me some water. This was one of the nicest thing i ever received, i felt really blessed so thank you again. 

Check-out was fast and easy. Great weekend in this lovely hotel.",5,2019,01,17
134,Dazzled!,"We lots to say!

We loved everything right from the entrance sign light on the walk way!  The lobby associates in their tweed coats were ready and at attention to greet us and help with our bags.  They and desk staff were welcoming  and they brought us water and we could sit down !!! No queues, no standing after an exhausting trip overseas, we waited briefly in a lounge and felt certain we would be cared for. 

We were cared for!

As we were checked in we took the opportunity to ask questions about New Year’s Eve a activities and celebrations.  The male associate that checked us in had aa great deal of helpful suggestions and info and was very prepared for such questions. Very important and a solid A+ for him.  

The front desk team continued to be super helpful and available at all hours and always gracious and attentive. 

The room: size was very good. Amenities so perfect! Loved the coffee machine and the real cream.     Lots of outlets for charging.  We did make use of the room iPad but couldn’t open attachments which made it hard to look at some sightseeing websites.

The sparkling water station sealed the deal for me!  Whoever came up with that idea should get a pay rise. Also like the vending machine idea as travellers want things at all hours and we got a beautiful bottle of wine from St Emilion (we’ve been there) after we had arrived home from a play.  

Thrilled with counter space in bathroom, lack of tiny bottles of products, tall shower for tall people, and wardrobe mirror. 

Big CON: no makeup or “contact lens putting in” mirror!! (Small mirror with light we can use close up ). 

Loved that there were robes !!! Great for people who pack light.  Also loved the good quality towels. 

Overall we were super impressed with the Autograph London!!  
Did I mention the amazing location!?!
We would visit again.",5,2019,01,15
134,Unique Hotel in Central London,"This hotel is great! It has everything you need to feel at home. It is brand new, rooms are modern and clean. What can i say about the staff? They are so charming and welcoming! Daniel and Diane are great! they helped me from the moment of the reservation to the moment i checked out! 
Thank you!",5,2019,01,11
134,Disappointing,"Brand new hotel, but couple things were amiss:

1. Checkin process took very long. I think the front desk staff works really hard, but putting them in that awkward table isn’t helpful. You need a taller table to give them a barrier to everyone running up. They were all made to bring our luggage up and show rooms, which isn’t usually their job. I felt they were over worked and unfocused.

2. Curtains broke and fell down in our room. There were neon lights outside our window that kept us up. Alex did a great job of trying to help but the hotel literally had no one else at the front desk or even a porter. Pretty unacceptable that curtains should come crashing down in the middle of the nigt at a brand new hotel. We were not compensated for all the trouble and was honestly not fair to stick us in a room like that. Other hotel person who was his manager called it a minor issue and dismissed us. When you spend $2k on rooms you expect the basic things like curtains to be working.

3. Called several times during my stay to the front desk to ask questions. No one picked up—never had this experience at any hotel before.

Stayed our last night at the kimpton fitzroy which is also new, and they had it together. I would not recommend staying at bankside again. I spent $2000 on two rooms, with one being very unsatisfactory for our stay.",3,2019,01,05
134,Faultless Stay,"As we were visiting Southbank Centre on the Fri evening we chose here as our base for 2 nights and a enjoyed a very comfortable stay. The room was well appointed and tastefully decorated and included a coffee machine and fridge as well as large wall mounted TV. Large comfortable bed and bathroom had a double walk-in shower with both waterfall and handheld options. Large towels and good quality supply of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel was a big tick. With modern digital door locks the external display could be used to indicate if you were ready for the room to be serviced. Situated a couple of mins walk from Blackfriars Bridge it provides easy access to the Southbank walk area and there is a Waitrose located a couple of minutes walk around the corner for any supplies required. We parked a few minutes walk away as there is no parking at the hotel although there are a couple of bays to drop off. The car park we used can be pre-booked, although it is below ground and unless you walk back through the vehicle entrance there are a couple of small flights of stairs to negotiate. Great stay and would happily return again. As we had already arranged our itinerary we didn't have the opportunity to eat at the hotel.",5,2019,01,05
134,Fantastic New year stay at lovely hotel,Great new hotel just off Blackfriars bridge so very convenient. Love the mid century  styling and the room was superbly equipped. Best of all the welcome from the staff who were super attentive and charming.,5,2019,01,01
134,Very friendly staff and excellent service,"We had a short stay at this hotel. Everything (room, location, service) was perfect. Spacious and well decorated rooms. Convenient location (short walk from train station). Very nice restaurant. Super friendly staff, especially Alex (who works at nights), he went above and beyond trying to meet our needs.",5,2018,12,31
134,"Mod Luxe, Great Location + ervice","Excellent stay! Impeccable accommodations,  amazing staff and convenient location near the Blackfriars tube stop. First off, the hotel staff is personable, fun, professional and willing to assist with any inquiry whether it’s a restaurant recommendation or additional pillow. The lounge/bar is a chill, aesthetically pleasing hangout with great bartenders and cocktails. Hotel is brand new and decorated in a comfortable, modern mid century style. Amazing art collection and sitting area. Guest rooms are functional with an ample selection of Nespresso. Restaurant has a great menu with creative and classic dishes. Definitely try the chips, absolutely amazing. There are convenient water stations (still and sparkling) located on each floor along with a touchscreen vending machine called the “bankside boutique” if one would like to indulge. Located a block from the River Thames and a short walk to the Tate Modern, Southbank Centre, St. Paul’s Cathedral, Shakespeares Globe and London Eye. I’m a Marriott Platinum Elite member and debated on what London property to stay at and was beyond elated with my choice. There were limited reviews since the property is new and I made the right choice in booking this property versus the other Autograph/Marriott options. London is expensive and the Bankside was worth every penny and I will book this hotel for all future visits. The location, people and accommodations are all equal at five stars. Hands down, one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at across the globe. Enjoy!",5,2018,12,28
134,Fantastic Brand New Hotel in an Awesome Location,"My wife and I stayed here in the middle of December for 4 nights and we had a great stay. It's a new hotel with great and modern rooms. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are great as well. The location is right at the foot of the BlackFriars bridge and is easy walking distance to a huge amount of great sights. There are several restaurants and shops in the area as well. I'd definitely stay here again and highly recommend the hotel. The only negative was that there was some construction happening outside the building while we were there and the noise of the work and the shouting of the work crew was noticeable.  Not the hotel's fault, and won't be an issue when the work is done.",5,2018,12,20
134,do not recommed this hotel,"I stayed two night at the hotel. when we arrived, it spend us 30 mins to finish the check in.  We accidentally dumped the  food on the carpet, and the hoursekeeper cleaned it up the next day, but the hotel still charged us 250 pounds after we checked out and didn't give back the 50 pound deposit we had brushed. I won't choose this hotel next time and don't recommed it.",1,2018,12,18
134,"New, modern, and accessible to everywhere ","Our third time in London and decided on Bankside Hotel.  We are so pleased with the decision.

Opened in October 2018, located near Blackfriar’s bridge on the south bank between Blackfriar and Southwalk Tube stations.  Walking distance to Tate Modern, Shakespeare Globe Theatre, St. Paul’s Cathedral, Borough Market, London Eye, and London Bridge.

Right next to the hotel is a Waitrose for those wanting items for their room or while on the go touring the city.  Just under the Blackfriars bridge heading towards London Bridge is a Starbucks.

Hotel is a £20 taxi from Paddington Station as we took the Heathrow Express Train from the airport to Paddington.  The overall cost was a fraction of the cost as opposed to taking a taxi directly from the airport.  

The Bankside team welcomed us with open arms.  Greeter assisted with the luggage and escorted us to the front desk.  Katerina at reception checked us in as we had two separate rooms, one for my spouse and I, the other for our two children.  Katerina provided us a connecting room which was a bonus.  Even though we arrived at 8am, and were staying for three days, management graciously allowed us to have breakfast which technically was included in our rate for the next day.  It was really appreciated.

Our room was 508 which is a corner suite.  Connecting room for our children was room 506.  5th floor is the top floor for the hotel.  Spacious, with a seating area.  Plenty of storage space, HD TV with Sky, CNN, BBC, and Food Network to name a few.  Comfortable linens and pillows, and well equipped bathroom with both a rain shower and hand held.  Each floor has a water station to fill a pitcher of water for your convenience, even provide glasses.  There is also high tech vending machines near the elevator.  Oh and WiFi is very easy to connect on multiple devices available throughout the hotel free of charge.  

Our room rate included breakfast which is buffet style.  You can also order from a menu however depending on your order there may be a surcharge.  Breakfast includes espresso, cappuccino, hot chocolate, tea, and regular coffee all made to order.  Items included in the breakfast is quite extensive, fruit, yogurt, artisanal breads, croissants of different varieties, deli, cheeses, butter, jams, cereal, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, black pudding, and freshly squeezed fruit juices.  Great way to start the day.  On our second day the lovely lady serving us the previous day ordered our cappuccino’s before we even asked.  Now that’s phenomenal service!

Hotel has an added touch of class, wine hour from 5:30-6:30pm.  On our first night it was 6:35pm and we asked how it worked.  Katerina graciously indicated we missed it for the night however she asked us to make ourselves comfortable and asked our preference of wine, she came back with two glasses of Chardonnay with snacks.  It was so appreciated.

Lastly we were supposed to checkout at 4am and asked Katerina the day before to arrange for a taxi.  Less than an hour afterwards in my email Inbox was an email from her confirming the details.  Once again Katerina providing exceptional service!

To conclude, hotel is new and worth every moment so don’t hesitate to give it a try, the team and overall experience will not disappoint - enjoy!",5,2018,12,16
134,Didn’t miss a beat,"Newly opened but operated very smoothly.

I will return. ",5,2018,12,07

134,5 Stars for Housekeeping and Reception/Concierge Team,"Lovely people, great property and thank you for the upgrade!   One can't imagine the hotel is only open a few weeks - all run like clockwork.  Applause to housekeeping the whole thing was squeaky clean from lobby to room to restaurant...",5,2018,12,05
134,What a great hotel,Booked this hotel because of the pictures on the Marriott site. Wasn't aware it has been open on 6 weeks! The staff was terrific and overall service amazing! And I loved the location! We will be back!,5,2018,12,01
134,Amazing addition to Bankside area,"My Partner and I stayed here for four nights and loved the hotel!  The property is very well managed and the decor is very modern and clean - lots of great curated touches.  The filtered (both flat and sparkling) water on each floor was a welcomed addition. 

The linens and bedding were superior and the hotel had all of the modern amenities one needs while traveling. 

Close to Anchor and Hope for dinner, Caravan for Breakfast and both the Blackfriars and Southwark Tube stations.  Highly recommend!",5,2018,11,26
134,Excellent new hotel near Tate Modern,"This hotel is part of the Marriott Autograph Hotel chain - very modern design hotel with a comfy feel. Excellent customer service, nice bar and resturant, and a mezzanine lounge for working or hanging out. Rooms are not extraordinarily big, but just right for a weekend break. Can’t beat location at Blackfriars Bridge next to Tate Modern and minutes to Southbank Centre and National Theatre.",5,2018,11,25
134,Superb Hotel with Amazing Staff!!! ,"Stayed in the Bankside Hotel for 2 nights in early November 2018. It was the last couple days of our trip and we got a good rate. I had no idea the hotel had only just been open 3 weeks prior. 

A friend and I travelled there for the first time from Toronto Canada. The staff was very inviting and warm. We had a wine hour with complimentary red/wine that night (so we were off to an even greater start). The decor was amazing and kept clean to the highest standards. Our room was amazing. 

The staff continued to go over and above with each and every request. I only have positives to say about this hotel. The location was great just steps away from Blackfriars Tube and Borough Market! 

The hotel itself, amenities and staff all get an A++. The Front of House Manager Soyful Alam was just amazing and was instrumental in helping to solve a travel concern (non-hotel related). 

All and all this was a great first experience to London.. Go here! Stay here!!!",5,2018,11,10
134,"Brand new, great location, improvement needed","I was excited to stay at this hotel as I love the autograph product. 

Good: I love the keycards made of paper, fantastic and recyclable, no more feeling guilty for those plastic keys we end up throwing away. 

I am vegan and the chef prepared the most delicious oatmeal with oat milk and blueberries. I love that a la cart menu was not extra expensive like on other places.

The bed is very comfortable.

This location can’t be beat if you like to walk to most places! Also, 2 tube stops are close. 

Service is great. 

Bad: I did not care for the views, I was across from the residences building and it is just uncomfortable. I didn’t like the fake wooden floors. There is a new car smell. I wish they would’ve curated those little details and used more natural ingredients.

Ugly: the toiletries are in a family size and that is just not hygienic, but I get that they’re trying to be green. I can leave with it. My problem was the lotion... it comes out a little blue and I think it’s making a reAction with the coper container. I suggest bringing your own toiletries.

It didn’t make sense to me that so much effort is put into being green,  but they still use boxes for every amenity and wrap the qtips and cotton in plastic bags... It made me feel so guilty I just didn’t use that. 

I didn’t like that the towels at blue or gray... it makes me feel like they’re not clean. 

Can be improved? One of the most disappointing things was the lobby... so disconnected. It just doesn’t flow. You enter into a small reception and if not paying attention you miss the bar and restaurant. I’m hopeful that they will switch the entry to the entrance wAy they’re still working on.

Location is wrong... it is on the side of the address listed. So hopefully that means they’re switching the lobby to the future door in the pathway under construction.

134,"Glamorous, comfortable and stylish hotel with excellent service","We had a night away from the kids on a Thursday night and the hotel met all our expectations. Super comfortable bed, gorgeous deep bath and great shower, and 180 degree view with floor to ceiling windows. It felt fun, chic and glamorous and was just what we needed for a short break from home.

I love the area and we wandered out for a walk along the river and came back for a drink at the fun bar.",5,2018,11,07
134,Royal Treatment in brand new hotel,"I typically stay at the Threadneedle AC hotel but I decided to try this instead. If you like new, modern, and chic, this is the place. The service was outstanding too with staff remembering your name.

The hotel was opened in October 2018 so everything is brand new and functional. There is a simple restaurant with bar in the lobby with reasonable priced options and something for everyone. The breakfast buffet is very adequate too.

The rooms are smartly organized with ample lighting that’s easy to operate and decent size bathroom and counter area. The showers have both rain shower and hand held showers.

The gym is adequate with cardio and weights. I highly recommend Bankside if you need to stay in this area.",5,2018,11,07
134,Amazing Experience,"From the extremely welcoming and helpful staff that greeted us to the really hip and artful vibe, the Bankside was a delightful find. We stayed in a spotless, spacious suite that had all of the modern amenities and some. Little touches like turndown service with nightly treats and comfy robes and slippers heightened the experience. The location at the foot of the Blackfriars Bridge near the Tate Modern and Borough Market on the South bank near the Southwark and Blackfriars tube stops makes this hotels location prime. Also, if you are interested in exercise, the hotel is on the cycling highway and great running areas along the bank side as well as a well equipped gym. We would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning on our next trip to London.",5,2018,11,06

134,Remarkable Hotel & Restaurant- perfect for a London shorttrip for Genießer!,"
Wow- what a beautiful Design-Hotel and amazing place! New & cool, full of individually interior. Every furniture is choosen with so much taste- it is an inspiration like a livingagazin to walk through the rooms. We slept like angles in our fantastic bed and savored the panoramic view out of all the suite windows. Bathroom is without words- luxury with two washbowls, freestanding bath, two TVs including in the mirrors. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous, the best we met ever in London! No Matter if you need help of Diana or Richard, Alex from the Reception or you like to have an individual Gin cocktail of charming Emanuel, all employees were remarkable kindly. The art of local artists at the walls or the fireplace in the lobby, the small coffeebar, the water dispenser in the floor- there is so much especially to discover. Restaurant is beautiful designed and just recommendable including the fantastic desserts which are a taste festival. Try the value vending machine at the floors is unique crazy. You are looking for an spontaneous engagement ring, a love package, glam shorts or gin- you can buy it directly for your private fun. 5 Stars for this place to be and thank you for this perfect wedding anniversary surprise! Surrounding is good to discover London. A small supermarket, the Themse, Restaurants everything is near by. #whereyoubelong Wir können das Hotel für jeden, der auf der Suche nach einem besonderen Hotel für eine Londonreise ist zu 100 Prozent empfehlen.",5,2018,10,26

134,Great hotel in perfect location,We chose this hotel for the good reviews and we were definitely not disappointed! The reception was very warm and the staff were always helpful. The room was spacious and very clean. Even the bath towels could be practically hung up. Although the hotel is very centrally located you are not bothered by the big city noise. The breakfast buffet is very rich and appetizing. We definitely recommend the hotel!,5,2024,08,17

Teníamos una habitación espaciosa y muy cómoda! Contaba con cada pequeño detalle, cafetera nespresso, zapatillas, albornoces, secador, plancha para la ropa…Todo de 10 con una limpieza impecable!
