121,Comfortable Stay,"My stay was made unforgettable by the exceptional hospitality of the bar team. From Sourav to Parang and the rest of the staff, everyone went above and beyond to ensure I had a comfortable experience.
The rooms were comfortable and thoughtfully designed, providing a relaxing feel .
I also enjoyed delicious breakfasts served efficiently by a friendly team.",4,2024,10,19
121,"First Stay at St. James Court, but Definitely Not Our Last!","For someone who only stayed in London for 24 hours, I have enough good memories from St. James Court/ TAJ to last a lifetime!  Let’s start with the location, which is nothing short of perfect- Close to everywhere you want to visit including Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, The Eye, Hyde Park, Mayfair, and Buckingham Palace!  We were able to walk to the changing of the guard and didn’t need to fight traffic!  Once inside, you will be floored by the architectural elegance and EXCEPTIONAL customer service that the TAJ offers its guests.  While we were being checked in by Bashir and Anuja at reception (who were both so welcoming and informative), we were approached by the manager who presented us with a scroll printed with the exciting news that I had won the “Guest of the Day”!  After a disastrous flight and stressful start to our trip, it couldn’t have been more appreciated!  We were upgraded to a STUNNINGLY remodeled king room and given 2 welcome beverages, along with an array of additional perks and discounts.  Once in the room we were in awe- Luxury linens, large TV, cookies and chocolates, soft robes/ slippers, convenient mini-fridge, complimentary waters, and a gorgeous view of the lush, colorful courtyard.  The bathroom was like a spa retreat with high end products, soothing lighting, built-in speakers, huge shower, and the best part- A towel warmer :)  It was amazing to wrap yourself in a cozy, warm towel after showering off a hectic day of travel!  We decided to dine at TH@T51 for dinner which didn’t disappoint- The cocktails were masterfully made and delicious.  The menu offered many unusual and appealing choices, and though we ordered fish and chips (I mean, we HAD to- Afterall, its London! LOL), it was the fanciest, most gourmet meal you could imagine!  After dinner, we strolled the beautiful courtyard and relaxed by the fountain with a glass of wine.  After a glorious night’s sleep (super quiet), we enjoyed their fantastic breakfast buffet.  I know some other folks left less-than-stellar reviews in this area, but we LOVED IT. There was about a four-minute wait to be seated and then so much to choose from!  You could custom order one hot egg dish and one Indian dish (that was our favorite part) in addition to the trays of meats, cheeses, fruits, potatoes, breads, juice bar, and pastries.  Unlike many other breakfast buffets included with hotel stays, this one was positively delectable- From the luscious chocolate croissants to the tempting stuffed omelets, each dish we tried was better than the next!  I wish we had more time here to explore the lavish spa, enjoy high tea, and other amenities that the TAJ has to offer, however we were off to our cruise right after breakfast.  I hope that we will have the opportunity to stay at this lovely establishment again in the future and can’t say enough great things about the ambience, stellar service, and fantastic location of St. James Court!",5,2022,09,03
121,Amazing experience,Centrally located. Good breakfast for indian taste. Old heritage property. The service at Taj property is amazing and it was great here too. There are couple of tube stations nearby and bus stops. Easy to go around in public transports. Highly recommended,5,2024,10,18
121,A fantastic experience,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic! The location, the standard of rooms, food and the kind staff. The venue itself is stunning, Top level customer service experienced from all staff at the hotel. Plenty of breakfast and dinner options.",5,2024,10,17
121,Had a memorable stay at Taj London,"We had a memorable stay in the Hotel. The location is a few metres away from the Buckingham Palace and also there is an underground station nearby. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The quality of food , service and hygiene and hospitality are by any standards very high. The staff is trained and was caring. We would love to come and stay again in this hotel.",5,2024,10,13
121,Nice choice of Hotel for 1st time visit to London,Very convenient location and helpful staff.  Had never been to London before so took a chance on this hotel.  Very close to Buckingham Palace and other touristy places. Clean and safe hotel in good safe location.  Spa was clean and nice as well.,5,2024,10,13
121,Amazing experience,"Great warmth of Indian hospitality and service enjoyed my time though very short stay wish to come back with family 
Food was amazing so was service
I like the Tajness of this place had honoured early checkout with takeaway as well to the room.",5,2024,10,11
121,"Excellent location, luxury stay, good value","Great location and delivers on luxury and service. The welcome and checkin was pleasant with a warm welcome from staff right from the front door to the porter who assisted us to our room.  The hotel has a great ambiance.  We were shown to our room on the 5th floor. The room was large with room to move. The presentation of the room was excellent. Modern amenities and fantastic lighting.  The decor was charming. The bathroom was large with modern fixtures including a towel warmer. The towels and linen were good quality. The bathroom and bedroom were very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. 
Breakfast was busy but staff kept it moving with food at the buffet topped up and the food was hot. The selection of food was good from fresh fruit to hot dishes. Checkout was efficient. There was Indian and western food available.  The doorman Leo was so helpful and pleasant with every interaction. Thank you Leo for your assistance and recommendations much appreciated. We will be back. We considered this hotel stay good value .",5,2024,10,09
121,Awesome hotel,"Rooms are spacious and the breakfast awesome. Close to tube ,Buckingham palace and public transport.  Staff and service superb.  Breakfast was so authentic.   Felt like a combination of Europe and India.  Chai tea, dosa and curry for breakfast. Shankara and Therasha were absolutely so hospital and marvelous.  Recommended anytime.",5,2024,10,09
121,Great place to stay.,"Great location, very clean, very friendly and helpful.  Food was excellent.  The location was amazing.  We walked to the majority of our attractions.  Close to the tube.  Friendly staff, they were happy to help with everything we asked for. I would recommend this to anyone.",5,2024,10,07
121,Wonderful,"Amazing hotel, wonderful service , lovely friend staff. The bedding was just how we like it thick cotton crisp sheets , proper bedding.every thing you need for a wonderful weekend away, every left a foot bowl in the room with salts and rose petals for our tired feet after exploring london",5,2024,10,07
121,Good location,The hotel was clean and in a good location.The thing only I could not  sleep at whole night in all the days of my stay as i felt there were some sounds in the room and one day I heard a light opened and saw a more bright in the room and got scared and couldn't sleep the full night.I have a gut feeling this hotel is haunted.,3,2024,10,05
121,Just One Elevator,"The hotel staff is awesome! extremely polite, prompt service, and helpful! For them, we'd give 6 stars! But just 1 guest elevator for the entire hotel is inadmissible and we heard that it's been like this for the last 7 moths. The room was good and clean, but nothing to rave about. The location is good if you want to be close to the Buckingham Palace and St. James Park.",3,2024,10,04
121,A very mixed review.,"Wonderful service and clean rooms. Very nice amenities with electric teapots, oversized towels, and good beds...definitely luxury in the rooms that are renovated. The front desk people and waitstaff were very good as were the valets. They were really very polite and kind. The hotel is in a very nice location if you want to visit Buckingham with several pubs and restaurants within easy walking distance.

The design of the hotel consists of four mostly separate buildings that are better able to access through an outdoor courtyard vs. a dizzying maze of connected hallways. Although it is historical, over 100 years old, and made of lovely red brick, it can be confusing and a little frustrating to navigate. It is not totally renovated and quite a bit  of it is in dated condition. When we arrived to get to our room, we saw used and stained mattresses leaning up against the wall in several of the hallways. This was disconcerting and unsightly. They were gone the next day....but still. In a luxury hotel?

Also the breakfast buffet is unfortunate. You can't get anything a la carte. Not even a piece of toast. It is the buffet, which is very heavily leaning towards Indian cuisine, or nothing. The hotel is owned by an Indian company and the clientele and workers are almost all of Indian descent, so I understand the food choices, but if you just want something light, you can't get it. You have to buy the buffet deal.",3,2024,10,01
121,"Excellent Location, Inconsistent Service—Improved After Complaints","As a long-stay guest, the hotel's prime location was a major plus, providing easy access to nearby attractions and amenities, making my stay quite convenient. However, the service was a mixed bag. Initially, the front office staff were inattentive and often slow to respond to requests, which was frustrating. It felt like basic guest needs were not a priority.

After raising a formal complaint, the service did improve significantly, and the staff became more responsive. Restaurant service (including BF) stepped up their efforts after nudging, making the rest of my stay more comfortable. While the location is fantastic, I would advise the hotel to invest in better front office training, restaurant staff training to create a more consistent experience from the start in order to do justice to Taj brand. It’s worth noting that a short-stay guest might not notice or bother to complain, but since I was there for two weeks with three rooms, I was able to clearly feel the deficiencies in service vis-a-vis other Taj properties in India and Dubai. Shalini and Urmi took immediate remedial action following my complaint, which greatly improved the experience and was very much appreciated.",3,2024,10,01
121,Pathetic services. Totally not expected from Taj group of Hotels.,"The staff is anything but proactive and courteous. 
If we ask them for certain stuff they are unable to provide anything with room service. The breakfast served is the same everyday and one has to literally wait in long queue to collect one’s order and then eat 
Not a feature of the luxurious lineage of Taj
They lost our personal belongings 
No Ironing board etc placed in the  room 
Staff was unpleasant 
Except the concierge from the duty manager to the bellboy everyone one was rude and arrogant 
No body to held us without luggage also 
No airport pick up or drop services to Platinum",2,2024,09,30
121,Wonderful stay at St James Court,Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The staff was all friendly and helpful. Daily breakfast buffet was excellent and the service was exceptional. The garden courtyard is gorgeous. Concierge was extremely helpful in giving guidance on travel and visitor recommendations. ,5,2024,09,30
121,A Dharamshala Experience,"I had the most  harrowing experience connecting with the property - I was trying to speak to the hotel for knowing wether I would get a room with a health faucet - I was first told by the operator that there were no rooms with a health faucet - then on my subsequent rechecks I was told it was possible but only the duty manager could confirm - it was just impossible to connect with the duty manager - the platinum help desk said it was not possible to get a room with health faucet. 
When I reached the hotel - I had the misfortune to start my stay meeting Geetika - who was the most unwelcoming  and rude front office person I have ever met at Taj hotel - almost making me file why we Indians come to England and we should go back to India - I then asked for speaking to the duty manager and I was introduced to Rujuta (who I must say was very sweet, but not efficient) - she confirmed that she had my request for a room with a health faucet, but had not made arrangements for it in the room allotted - she said that she could try the next day if I was willing to shift my room. I also asked her whether I could be upgraded given the amount I stay with Taj - she told me that she had already upgraded me from a room with two single bed to a room with a king bed and no further upgrade was possible (which is something I have never heard Taj tell me in all these years). The next day I was told that they had arranged for a health faucet in another room and I could change, to which I agreed. Besides the fact that in the shifting I lost my adapter and shaving razor, I was utterly displeased to see that there was a bathtub in the bathroom - I therefore had to choose between having to shower standing uncomfortaby in a tub and a health faucet. For hygiene reasons I chose the later, only to find that the health faucet was a damp squib. 
My ordeal doesn't end there, the breakfast is next level crap - it's the same every day - the restaurant is over crowded and felt like I was sitting in some Udupi restaurant in Mumbai. 
Generally this is my worst experience with a Taj property - while I can understand the inherent limitations the property and its designs - the service experience was the worst ever. 
The only service I liked was that of the concierge - the team was very knowledgeable and helpful - that is the only thing that felt like Taj.",1,2024,09,29
121,A memorable stay.,"A very classy, humble and marvelous place to stay. Plenty of cafes and restaurants around. Enjoyed every moment of my stay.  Very close and walkable distance to Buckingham palace and Parliament square.   Looking forward to my next stay. Very courteous staff.",5,2024,09,27
121,Not worth the money: uncomfortable all around.,"Overall not a good experience. Even without all the problems we encountered (e.g., hotel failing to deliver on promises, broken items in room), we would not recommend a stay here. It is expensive and not worth the money. The food options are limited and the dining area is crowded. The rooms are small (bathrooms even smaller) and, while the location is great, you can easily find somewhere better as there are many options in the area. If travelling on a budget, stay outside London as everything is triple the price in zone 1 (tourist area).",1,2024,09,27
121,"Its decent. No complains, but didn't exactly dazzle either.","To be honest, I don't have much complains. It just didn't make a mark compared to my stays in other Taj properties. I've got a little used to the staff going above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I just didn't feel the same at St. James. 

- Check In: We ended arriving early (around 10 AM) after a 7 hour long flight. We weren't offered any welcome drinks or water. The queue for checking in wasn't organized either. Next, understandably the room wasn't ready and I was reminded of the standard check in time. (This was after I had already given a heads up of my arrival time on email) Although given that I was staying in for 6 nights, I was hoping for an exception. That being said, I was assured I'd be given a call once the room was ready, but no such thing happened. I was wandering around the property without being notified. 

- Breakfast: If you're looking for Indian breakfast, you'd be happy with the options here. Although, the breakfast gets too repetitive. There are barely 2 dishes in the buffet that changes whilst the core menu remains the same. By the 3rd day, we had exhausted the options we liked and then it was just about repeating the same. 

- Room: The rooms are spacious compared to other properties in London. That's something definitely to value at this property. 

- Lastly, the fact that only 1 elevator is working creates a havoc during peak times. I guess that's just an unfortunate timing for us.",3,2024,09,26
121,Beautiful hotel - terrible WiFi!,"We loved our room, the staff and the hotel generally, but the internet and WiFi was so bad, we couldn’t even check-in for our flight without going downstairs.

Also, only one working elevator was crazy for a hotel this size. It sometimes took quite a long time to get up to our room. When we’d leave, we just went down six flights of stairs! 

We frequently visit London and would love to stay here more, but we  generally have to work and the WiFi/internet situation was unacceptable. We twice complained, but it was never fixed. It’s a shame because, again, we really loved the hotel!",4,2024,09,25
121,Fabulous hotel in Central London,"We stayed in this beautiful Brick building with a fabulous courtyard and very convenient location close to Tube and to many major attractions within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and Parliament house etc. Has wonderful courteous staff and great breakfast and many specialty restaurants and high tea option all under one roof with in room tea an d coffee options and free placement of water and change of linen every day. This was a special treat for my birthday by my wife and the staff outdid themselves in welcoming us and decorating the room with a Happy birthday sign in the room ! I would like to mention the hotel concierge ( William (who declined to give his last name)  as one of  the best with excellent knowledge of London and attractions to visit making many suggestions to make the visits to the places of interest easy and enjoyable. You get all this for a great price. I would highly recommend  a stay at this property.",5,2024,09,25
121,All That Glitters is not Gold!,"The St. James Hotel is impeccably furnished, immaculate and has a service-oriented staff.  However, we were disappointed in our stay there.  Starting with the elevators....  One was taken out of service for upgrades.  We never saw anyone during our 5-night stay working on it.  During our time at the hotel, another elevator broke, effectively leaving one elevator off the main lobby to service 7 floors in the hotel.  This is the same elevator used by staff to transport guest luggage - and on one occasion after a lengthy wait, reporting the elevator stuck on floor 6, it was discovered that the bellman had blocked service while he delivered luggage to a guest room.  

Second, we listened and felt the rumble of the tube beneath the building starting around 6:30 am until 12:30 am.  

Last was being jolted out of bed by a fire alarm - thankfully a false alarm.

London has many choice hotels - and this would not be ours for future visits.",3,2024,09,25
121,Memorable,The feeling of the warmth of Taj Group of hotels is very much there. Very central and a walk of 15-20 minutes to the major sights of London. One of the best Hotels in this bracket. A must to stay if you are to spend the average price of any other hotel in SW1,5,2024,09,25
121,Taj in the heart of London. Royalty meets Tajness.,"Taj in the heart of London, well for a loyal supporter of the brand, it had been on my bucket list for a long time. And it did exceed the expectations and anticipations. Butlers in tails, and Taj hospitality just amazing. Location : 500m from Buckingham palace, walking distance from St James court tube station. A 2 mile radius of hotel includes all the major sites - Westminster, Parliament, Big Ben opposite end of London Eye, Trafalgar Square and the palace. All walkable. The property shares courtyard with another landmark Taj 51 Buckingham gate. The high tea at Kona, the brunch at Th@51 restaurant are the unmissable events. Exceptional staff and attention to detail is the hallmark of everything here. The architecture is spell binding and so many locations for those photos.
 Certain names of people who went out of the way to make this stay special. 
From Kona (High Tea) - Mr Anjan,  Abhi, Abhilash, Mr Kyle.
 TH@51 bar - Mr Vishal  amazing iced 51 on special request, Mr Jesvin  supervisor.
Front Desk  entire staff. Upgraded as per gold tier and some more. Kudos to the team.",5,2024,09,23
121,British luxury hotel,"This is a British luxury hotel with impeccable service, lovely rooms, many food options, including a Michellin-starred Indian restaurant. The courtyard has been a beautiful spot to have breakfast and tea. We've enjoyed walks in St. James Park -- great location. It's my new fave in London.",5,2024,09,21
121,Awful Experience - Bottom Rate Motel Experience for a Luxury Price,Absolutely awful front desk staff and stained sheets. I wouldn't stay here again if I was paid to. There was a small error in my first name on my booking and it took over two hours to get resolved at check in. The front desk staff particularly the manager was absolutely no help and very rude and offered no assistance to solve the issue. When we finally arrived in the room the sheets were stained with what looked to be menstrual blood. We were not even offered assistance with our bags to our room even considering my friend I was traveling with had recently sustained an injury. During the two hour check in process for a one night stay many other guests complained at the front desk about needing rooms to be switched out or general issues with their experience. If you want to pay for a luxury experience while receiving the service of a run down hostel this is the booking for you.,1,2024,09,20
121,Taj - The name says it all.,"Amazing experience. Top notch hospitality and comfort - a hallmark of the Taj and the Tatas. From the rooms to the food; the staff and hospitality; and the location and over all feel; this is a world class property blended with Indianness that makes one feel proud, and at home.",5,2024,09,19
121,Incredible service-luxurious accommodations,"We are now Taj Hotel clients for life!  The service is unmatched in any other hotel we have experienced.

Having never stayed in a Taj Hotel, I had no idea the level of care to expect.   From the second we arrived early-our room was ready.  Everything you expect from a 5 star hotel and more.  We experienced such a well trained and welcoming staff.  The breakfast was wonderful- buffet with hot entry options.  The tea and expresso were also included.  We selected the breakfast the first morning as I felt we would be tired from our travels.  It was such a wonderful experience, I reserved for the rest of our stay!  The room was clean and comfortable-always attended to before we returned to our room, yet we never saw them working.

Had many interactions with the staff from greeting my husband in the courtyard with an Americano to preparing for our departure-if there is 7 star service, it is The St James' Court Taj Hotel.",5,2024,09,18
121,St James Taj,"Excellent and very helpful staff - care and warmth. Superb location right next to tube and st James park / Buckingham palace.
Great to get Indian food!

Property is nice - but gets crowded & claustrophobic. Lifts need a makeover. 

Will continue to stay here.",4,2024,09,15
121,Nice,"Great hotel,  but our TV's weren't working called downstairs,  she said someone will be up right away and no one came.
The guy at the desk promised a bottle of wine and a piecof cake but nothing arrived. Breakfast was delicious and differently going again",4,2024,09,14
121,A Wonderful Experience ,"
The title gives it away. We were very impressed with the staff, accommodations and beauty of this property. Upon arrival we were upgraded by a wonderful young man who asked about our anniversary weekend.  The location, breakfast offerings and attention to detail will beckon us to return again. ",5,2024,09,13
121,The pinnacle of luxury,"From the moment you enter the lobby and are greeted, you know you are experiencing the ultimate in hospitality. I was upgraded to a suite and was very happy with every detail of it. Nothing was missing! The décor was exquisite and the bedroom was beyond comfortable. The bathroom was so luxurious! I felt like a VIP. Food was fabulous! I was only staying one night but I wish I would have had a week there! I can't say enough about the staff, impeccably professional.",5,2024,09,12
121,Luxury Stay in London,"St James Court Taj was a fantastic location - close to Buckingham Palace and a convenient Tube Station for the Circle and District lines.  There is a well-stocked convenience store next door and a nice restaurant/take-away bakery-coffee shop right across the street.  Hotel itself is gorgeous.  We were in the building on the other side of the beautiful courtyard.  Bed was comfortable.  Shower had great water pressure and fully closing doors unlike some European shower stalls.  Very quiet.  Small refrigerator, tea kettle and Nespresso machine.  Wonderful maid service each day with restocking of complimentary bottled water and Nespresso pods.  Second night we had a wonderful surprise with a metal basin of bath salts and rose petals for a foot soak waiting for us - such a treat!  Enjoyed the robes and the sauna/jacuzzi although we only got to use it once as we were often out sightseeing or at dinner and not back before it closed.  Would recommend keeping it open later than 8 pm....Overall a lovely stay and would certainly stay here again.  It was a very good value at the price we got pre-paid on Priceline - better in fact than other chain hotel options which would not have been as special.",5,2024,09,12
121,The best ever hotel in London,"Kudos to Rajat, manager, he’s doing an amazing job of looking after the entire floor and attending to the guests…
Awesome experience 
Service provider is 5 star
Highly recommended 
The best location and the staff is super helpful 
Location is very convenient",5,2024,09,11
121,"The best for service, convenience and amenities!","We had a fantastic couple of days here before we flew off to Mexico from London. Firstly, the people that work here couldn't do enough to make our stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. I want to especially mention Rajani who just added that extra customer service and friendliness to our stay. 
The convenience of walking everywhere we wanted to go, Buckingham Palace, The London Eye, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben just made our trip so much better.
The amenities available at the hotel are first class, the fully kitted out gym, steam room, sauna and relaxation pool were fabulous.
Thanks again to all the staff there for making our stopover trip amazing. We even checked out to a breakfast bag with fruit and goodies to keep us going on our onward journey as we left before breakfast on our final day.",5,2024,09,09
121,A truly taj-mazing experience !,"Gautam & Erdina were fantastic and provided service excellence, attentively with a smile! 

The Kale and Burrata chaat and papdi chaat was beautiful 😍 
Masala chai, sea bass, butter chicken, paneer skewers were delish ! 

To top it off with masala chai creme brûlée,  chocolate cake ! Wowza 

Misba & friends",5,2024,09,07
121,Effortless and welcoming,"The staff in both the hotel and the breakfast restaurant were very welcoming, professional and helpful.  The check-in and check-out was effortless.

121,"A London respite, home away from home","Amazing hotel in a great location with wonderful
Service. Have stayed in many Taj Hotels in India and always thrilled to be there.
Taj St. James does not disappoint. Staff, decor, service, included breakfast are all world- class. 
We will stay there on any future trips to London.",5,2024,09,06
121,A wonderful stay,"On arrival, all the staff were exceptionally helpful and welcoming. Sandesh, who checked us in was very kind and helpful and even had a bottle of wine and piece of cake sent to the room as it was our anniversary. The bed was comfortable with some of the best pillows I've ever had at a hotel.

Location was superb, just a ten minute walk from Parliament and five minutes in the other direction to Buckingham Palace. We got a Taxi to get there but after that simply walked everywhere as it was far faster by foot than for the taxis in the one-way systems and traffic. You could be in the centre of Leicester Square in a brisk 15 minute walk.

Breakfast the next day was superb. We were a little late down, but even then we only had to wait a couple of minutes in a nice lounge area which was furnished with pastries and orange juice. A full English was availably via buffet, but you could also order a number of other items such as omelettes via the waitresses. It was also nice to see the Indian influence as when you got to the end of the sausages and bacon etc, there were spiced rices, flatbreads and other Indian dishes which made for a delightfully interesting breakfast.",5,2024,09,06
121,Great for Westminster—Buckingham area stays,"Overall one of the best hotels in the Westminster area! Very helpful staff, Indian inspired cuisine (delicious) and comfortable rooms. The front desk is keen to help, concierge also very friendly and hand‘s on to satisfy the guests needs.",5,2024,09,06
121,Truly Exceptional,"From the moment I stepped foot in the hotel, the experience was extraordinary. I guess if you want to be pampered, visit this hotel. I am not going to stay anywhere else if I return. Will try Taj at other Countries too and I wish they are just as good as this one.",5,2024,09,05
121,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"This was a terrible experience. We were placed in a room on the 2nd floor and no one told us that there would be constant noise/rumbling from the underground train. When I mean constant, it was EVERY 2 minutes. The room was filthy, you could tell no one vacuumed the floors and the walls had marks on them. We had complained and they changed our room to a higher floor which the tvs in the new room wouldn’t stay on but that room was much cleaner thank goodness but overall I wouldn’t stay here again.",1,2024,09,05
121,Wah Taj !,"Wonderful retinue services right from arrival to departure. 
Duty manager Raunak Ghosh a true professional to deliver every single needs which makes and feel like home away home.
Chef Amarjeet have made us so comfortable when it comes to food and we have got the best food even not imagined. 

Much recommended.",5,2024,09,05
121,"Totally would recommend, near the palace","The staff, especially one in the front desk by the name of Provita, were exceptionally professional and super friendly. The room amenities were all eco friendly which included a bathrobe so you could use it in the spa equipped with heated water. Excellent",5,2024,09,04
121,Taj hospitality at its best,"The Taj hotel St James is an excellent property. The location is excellent. The service quality, staff training, F&B and all aspects are excellent and exactly what is experienced and expected across Taj hotels. Staff attending reception, Conceirge and house keeping were courteous and helpful. 
Only discomfort was the waiting for lifts as one was non functional. Hopefully it will be fixed. Excellent stay.",4,2024,09,04
121,Pleasantly Surprised!,"We were very impressed with your staff.  They were very attentive and helpful in every way.  The breakfast was excellent.  The food was delicious and fresh.  I enjoyed the Indian selections especially.  A special thanks to Justin who helped me get a forgotten bag to the airport after we had left the hotel.  We used location, reviews and pricing in deciding to book this hotel.  We couldn’t have done better.",5,2024,09,03
121,Great hospitality and food,"We stayed in Taj st James court London, for good 7days with our family. The stay was extremely comfortable, the food was delicious. We ordered from in room dining for at least 7times and there was no complaints from our side. We also enjoyed the spa service n jacuzzi. I want to really appreciate the help of Mr. Raunk, who personally catered to all our requirements. We would want to stay there again n recommend it to others.",4,2024,09,02

Great location near Buckingham Palace and Musea.",5,2024,09,01
121,Excellent service!,"This hotel is amazing! The service was very friendly and professional, the location is excellent and the facility is beautiful. We left one of our bags in the room by mistake and they were able to get it in a cab and delivered to the airport before our flight left. The porter even called to make sure we got it. What great service! Highly recommend!",5,2024,09,01
121,Fabulous experience at the Taj,We had a brilliant stay at the Taj. The entire team whether it was the front office or concierge or food and beverages was fantastic and they were always willing to help. Special mention to Geetika Verma and Ridge at the front office who were very helpful and made our first experience memorable.,5,2024,08,31
121,Tajness at London,"The warmth of Tajness is what brings me to a Taj always.
And it was very much there at London as well.
Excellent Indian breakfast and in room dining .
Although our check in experience was pretty bad , but after that they made sure everything is just great",5,2024,08,30
121,Best Hotel Experience we Have Ever Had,"You will be treated like Royalty.  Most thoughtful and caring staff we have ever experienced. Concierges, Marcus and Jack were fantastic and so were the front desk receptionists, Mona and Geetika.  We are world travelers and have never received such wonderful service as we did at the St. James Court Taj hotel.  Besides the wonderful staff, the beds, the buffet breakfast and location are fabulous.  The St. James Court Taj Hotel will make your visit to London extra special. We more thasn highly recommend it.",5,2024,08,29
121,what a great hotel!,"This was our second stay at the St. James Court Hotel and when greeted by the friendly staff at the front door on arrival, we knew this stay would be as good as the first. Our bedroom was very comfortable and quiet, so much so we slept until 9.30am on Saturday morning,  which was lovely and very late for us. We wanted for nothing in our well appointed bedroom.  We really loved having tea/coffee,  iron & board (good quality iron too!), water,  safe,  blackout curtains,  heated towel rail etc. We loved breakfast each morning,  great selection of fruits, cold cuts, hot food, food made to order etc. After a busy Saturday enjoying London, we returned to the hotel after 10pm and enjoyed a nightcap in the bar.  Really enjoyed the location of the hotel, we loved walking through St. James Park and the street the hotel is located on is quiet. The St. James Court Hotel is a well run hotel and what sets it apart from the others is the friendly team! We were looked after so well by the team and it was a lovely surprise that my wife's birthday was marked by the team - thank you!! Special thanks also to Raphael and Atharv who looked after us so well!! We love the St. James Court Hotel and hope that we return one day!",5,2024,08,25
121,Positive and Memorable.,"My hotel stay was fantastic - the room was clean and comfortable, A special thanks to the reception girl - Ms Prativa for her exceptional hospitality . the staff were friendly and accommodating, and the amenities were top-notch. Thank you to Mr Joythish for warm hospitality that made our dining experience truly special. I would recommend improving the variety of breakfast options :) and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay.",4,2024,08,22
121,Home away from Home,"It’s always been a pleasure to be at Taj and the services are becoming better and better this was my 5 visit in 18 months only one thing is they can add more Indian food options for Dinner .breakfast has always been fantastic specially for Indians though recently they have cut down the size of Indian Food option in the Breakfast ( like Samosa Upma etc there they have kept bar stool to accommodate more people for BF I guess Thank you to each and every one for taking such lovely care Thanking You 

Kind Regards 

Jatin Chande",5,2024,08,22
121,Excellent stay,"Wonderful location, staff, and amenities. The concierge is excellent and the breakfast is really good. Smriti deserves special mention in the breakfast area.

The surroundings are a bit quiet so don't expect a lot of pubs or café below the hotel. St james and Victoria station are 5 and 10 minutes on foot.

The pain points were the elevators and the shower area in the bathtub. While having a bathtub gives a luxury feeling, getting in and out can be slippery. Plus the water pressure in the shower isn't great.

The inside breakfast area can get quite crowded. Tables are placed very close to each other.

But the great people working there more than make up for these small inconveniences.",5,2024,08,22
121,Spoiled Rotten!,"We were blown away by the kindness of staff at St. James’ Court. From Rajani in Reception who kindly organised a birthday upgrade, complete with wine and cake, to Ms. Dolma, Chhani & Hidayah in the spa, who treated us with gifts, expert care & attention, to Gurmeet in the restaurant, who educated us on the finer details of Indian cuisine. We couldn’t have had a better stay anywhere else - fantastic rooms, dining, facilities, experience.",5,2024,08,21
121,I expected better,"When we arrive at the hotel the check-in was very slow. The Bellman took our luggage upon our arrival and was very slow to deliver it to the room. We had 15 minutes from the time the check-in was complete until we had to leave Room after an over overnight flight. We called and asked for the luggage to be delivered quickly. Finally I went and got it on my own it had been stored in the luggage room. That left with five minutes to unpack and refresh before we had to head out. Not a great start.

The room was spacious and comfortable, but definitely in need of a refresh. The carpet had stains. There was a stain on the couch. The walls were a bit banged up and in need of some fresh paint. 

The bathroom had a lot of issues. First off, the sink would not drain. We had somebody come in to take care of that. The tub shower had some piece of weird plate glass covering the side to keep the water from spilling out. Actually, it didn’t work well in the floor was covered in water after each shower. The towel rack in the shower was crooked and hanging down. 

We also found during our stay that one elevator was not working and the other one was obviously crowded and slow. Because of that, we usually traveled up and down the stairs which took us through the bowels of the hotel. Not really meant for guest and not really a pretty sight.

The hotel is in a good location and presents itself well from the outside and the guest reception area. This is my first time staying at a Taj hotel in frankly just expected better.",3,2024,08,20
121,Average experience,"Given it's Taj, had some real expectations, but my experience was average. Stayed for 5 nights in the Premium Sq room, so spent a fair amount of money with the hotel.

The Goods:
- We arrived around 1pm. They checked us in (instead of making us wait for the usual 3pm check in time)
- Breakfast is good: Decent spread and prompt service

The Bads:
- The AC in our room was barely working. We wasted 2 hours trying to raise complaints/waiting for someone to come fix it
- There was a kettle in the room but no plug point near the mini bar. I don't know why would you place a non UK plug kettle in the room. Again, highlighted the same twice thrice until someone came along with an extension cord
- We were out from 7 am to 5 pm and had hung the service my room tag on our door. Upon our return from a long day trip, we were astonished to find the room hadn't been serviced. Had to call twice to get the same done

To try and fix our experience, they did place wine, chocolates, etc in the room, but these don't matter. I was looking for the basics - timely cleaning of the room, AC working, Kettle in place etc, which is were Taj failed.

I didn't feel the same Taj-ness that I feel in India when I stay with Taj. Disappointed.",3,2024,08,18
121,The best in London,"Overall amazing stay from the service, to food and location. Seamless check in and check out. Many restaurant options. Very warm and loving service from all the staff in the hotel and restaurants. 
! Will surely come back and will definitely recommend to friends.",5,2024,08,18
121,Exceptional Taj Hospitality,"We had a wonderful stay at St. James' Court, Taj Hotel in London. The hospitality was exceptional, and the food was delicious. Special mention to the manager, Raunaq, who was incredibly helpful, professional, and hospitable. His attentiveness made our experience even more memorable. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a luxurious and welcoming stay in London!",5,2024,08,17
121,Taj does not disappoint. Amazing service,"Rooms and hallways are a bit tired, and there’s only one working lift, which slowed things down. But, as you’d expect from Taj, the service was absolutely fantastic—unbeatable. Faraz at check-in was awesome and really went the extra mile. After my first night, I mentioned the noise, and they sorted it out within hours by changing my room. The location is spot on—just 2 minutes from the tube and in a nice, quiet part of Westminster.",5,2024,08,17
121,Service is unreal!,"Our experience has been exceptional! Faraz at the front has been our proxy for everything from food to accommodation adjustments and he has been on the ball the whole time. Hes taken care of our group at the highest standard possible. The wine was super yummy too, thank you mate!",5,2024,08,17
121,Excepcional! Love this hotel!!!,"I am a frequent traveler, and I don't usually leave reviews about the places I visit, but this time I've decided to do so because this place truly deserves it. Its location in the city is very convenient. They offered me an upgrade to the room I had previously selected at a very reasonable price, and it was worth it. The room was spotless at all times and had all the necessary amenities. The service was exceptional, but the concierge was truly outstanding. I had an issue that needed to be resolved the next day, and they helped me immediately, ensuring everything was taken care of. From the moment you arrive, they make you feel very special. Without a doubt, this is the place I will return to when I come back to the city.",5,2024,08,16
121,"Missing Taj Culture at Taj, St. James Court - Disappointing stay","If you're considering staying at this property for its renowned ""Tajness,"" be prepared for disappointment. A significant portion of the staff seems to lack the hallmark Taj culture and service standards.
Allow me to share a few experiences that might help future guests decide whether this property meets their expectations:
1. Upon arrival, after a long and exhausting flight, we were neither offered water nor a place to sit. The staff greeted us with neither smiles nor warmth, leaving us with the impression that we were being served by new trainees rather than experienced professionals.
2. We had requested a baby crib well in advance for our six-month-old, but it was not arranged upon our arrival, despite our prior notice.
3. For the first three to four days, housekeeping provided two large bottles of water, two small bottles, and three towels. However, without any apparent reason or communication, they later decided to provide us with only two towels and four small bottles, even though there were three people in our room. There seems to be no standardization in their service.
4. The restaurant staff were far from welcoming. Orders consistently took more than 20 minutes to arrive, even when we had provided special instructions or pre-ordered breakfast. The only response we received was an informal apology, which did little to address the ongoing service issues.
Despite bringing these concerns to the attention of Mr. Rajat, the senior-most person available at the property, there was no apology or empathy, the justification we got was the “staff is new” and any improvement in service was short-lived, with things reverting to the previous subpar standards after just a couple of days.
In summary, the only real advantage of staying at this property is its location. Beyond that, don't expect the usual Taj experience.
List of the staff who warm and had a Taj Culture:
1. Mr. Raunaq
2. Mr. Samriddh
3. Mr. Pavan
4. Mr. Rupinder
5. Mr. Diago
6. Ms. Divya
7. Mr. Kunal
8. Ms. AkinoGood",1,2024,08,15
121,Stay at Taj 51 London,"It was an amazing experience staying at Taj London.
It was a fantastic experience staying at Taj Properties as always.
During my recent stay at Taj London I was amaze at the excellent services from the hotel staff.
I lost my details of Taj Membership but the Duty Manager Mr. Raunaq did his best to help me out and I was able to get my points etc.
The breakfast layout with a wide section of Asian cuisine was amazing and absolutely a delight for the pallet. Quilon and kona were equally good.",5,2024,08,14
121,A great hotel in an ideal location,"A remarkably well run and comfortable hotel just a few metres from Buckingham Palace in the heart of London

Ever helpful staff helped make the experience memorable and the bar at night was a perfect place to unwind with hot chocolate or a nightcap",5,2024,08,13
121,Excellent,Lovely hotel and great staff. Faraz welcomed us and made us feel at home. All the staff were helpful and kind. Facilities were great and the breakfast was amazing. My niece and I couldn't be happier with our stay at St. James's Court. Definitely will be coming back. ,5,2024,08,13
121,"Mixed Experience at the Taj: Great Location, but Housekeeping Needs Improvement","We recently stayed at the Taj for 7-8 nights, marking our second visit to this hotel. While the location is excellent, just a short walk from the tube station, our experience was mixed.

Upon arrival, we were initially assigned a room with dead pigeons outside the window. However, the staff promptly addressed our concern and moved us to another room, which we appreciated.

Unfortunately, the housekeeping service was below par. Despite multiple reminders, basic amenities like shower gel and lotion were only replenished after two days. Additionally, used bathrobes and slippers were not properly replaced in the bathroom but were instead packed and left in the room. To our surprise, there was no turndown service provided during our stay.

One of the main reasons we chose the Taj was for its Indian hospitality, and in that regard, we were not disappointed. The breakfast buffet, though crowded, was made enjoyable thanks to the attentive service of Hashmeet and Ibad, who served tea with a smile.

Overall, it was an average stay. While the location and the efforts of certain staff members stood out, the experience didn't match at all the exceptional hospitality we’ve come to expect from Taj hotels in India.",3,2024,08,13
121,"Best in London, Taj is taj","Best property in london to stay, staff brilliant, facilities brilliant, breakfast and food is amazing. Would not stay anywhere else ever. Taj is Taj. Location is brilliant. Pool in a hotel in london is a blessing. Sauna and steam. 

Old rooms need renovation. Lift is a slight problem.",5,2024,08,12
121,Excellent,Amazing location and very nice service. Jeff at the front desk was very helpful and breakfast attendees were also very friendly . Concierge staffs were also very polite. Though very busy hotel but they take care of all the guests very well. Definitely coming back to this hotel in future,5,2024,08,12
121,Comfort with convenience,"Our best 4 days stay in London. Every staff was friendly, courteous, and efficient. Room was clean, and spacious for us. Breakfast was fantastic with many varieties. Location was perfect. Walking distance to most of tourist attractions. Price was reasonable considering the location.",5,2024,08,11
121,Great place to stay in London.Walking distance to Buckingham Palace,"We were very pleased with the hotel, staff and service.
A beautiful courtyard is in the center of the complex.
The morning breakfast buffet had many choices.
Overall we would highly recommend the Dt.JamesTaj. 
The House of Ming next door serves delicious Chinese food.",5,2024,08,09
121,Must stay,"Top notch service, superb location n great breakfast.
The courtyard was to die for and all in-house restaurant's were top notch.
The staff was very friendly and the ambience was very good.
We were very pleased with our stay and hope to be back for a longer visit in the future.",5,2024,08,08
121,Can’t recommend this hotel to anyone,"The Taj at Buckingham Palace Road has deteriorated.  Specifically, I arrived from Los Angeles at approximately. 1pm.  The front desk told me they will have my room ready no later than 3pm.  In actuality, I was finally given access to my room at 5:30pm (and I had a business dinner at 6:30pm).  In addition to Service being poor, there was mold in the bathrooms.  Hardly worth the money they ask for their rooms.",1,2024,08,08
121,Spectacular,"From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm hospitality and exceptional service. One of the highlights of my stay was dining at the hotel's restaurant. The culinary experience was outstanding. The service was impeccable, with staff going above and beyond to ensure a delightful meal. Also, the location of the hotel is ideal, situated close to some of London's most iconic landmarks and attractions. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,06
121,Magical,"Kool comfortable and extremely warm hospitality 
Want to keep going again and again 
Location is awesome 
So very close to Buckingham Palace 
Central London 
Very warm friendly and helpful staff
The General Manager Ms. Mehernoz very kind courteous",5,2024,08,06
121,"Unhelpful staff, terrible security and room condition, dishonest cleaning staff","We made reservations for 2 with 2 beds. They gave us a king bed. We asked for a room change to 2 beds and perhaps with a bit more room The new room had a broken door molding, no plug for kettle or coffee. I left medication behind in the refrigerator and when I called to have it mailed to me they said it was not found.  Unpleasant experience",1,2024,08,05
121,Stay at Taj-51 Buckingham Gate,"I have recently visited London and stayed in Taj 51 Buckhingham Palace Courtyard must say it was wonderful property.

I would like to appericiate the staff of Taj London. Mr Raunaq Duty Manager is amazing and so helpful in taking care of its guests comfort etc.
Location of the Hotel is very central and all aminites were world class.
Looking forward for our next stay at Taj-51 Buckhingham Palace Courtyard.",5,2024,08,02
121,The Indian feeling,The warmth of Taj is felt everywhere in the property. Although our check in was very frustrating but eventually all went well. The breakfast was one of the best times of the day to be. Also the food needs a special mention. Better Indian food then India 😊,5,2024,08,01
121,So tired!,"Based on previous experience at other Taj Hotel properties, gosh this is tired and overall not at all up to what we had expected which is high.... hence my rating on this review.

I had booked a basic category room and was delighted when upon check-in (lovely staff), were up-graded to a Junior Suite. The room size / amenities are good (Nespresso, generous water bottles, Molten Brown though in very ugly cheap looking dispensers, cotton waffle dressing gowns, lovely linen, super comfy huge bed etc), but wow did it feel dated not only in terms of the decor/furniture and bathroom but all the wood is very scuffed, also noted in many areas around the hotel.  

Some areas of the hotel have been renovated including bedrooms (as I viewed from photos) so make sure you ask for one! But overall the hotel still feels tired and dated. Also feels a bit like being in a block of government flats as lots of loud movement of rubbish trolleys both in and outside the building courtyard as well as some higher floor windows seriously in need of repair/paint!

One of the lifts is closed for repair and although there are a few other dotted around, we had to wait a long time... and this was in the middle of the day, we tried 3 different lift banks!

No issues with service (welcoming and efficient) though we only experienced Reception and Bar/courtyard. However, very strange, they add an overall 5% service charge to final bill (in addition to regular service charges on F&B), which you can have taken off.",3,2024,08,01
121,"Excellent Stay: Central Location, Awesome Indian food and hospitality","Just next to the Buckingham Palace and close to St. James Park Tube station and Victoria Railway Stations, this heritage property in London is possibly the best location with easy access to Central London and other tourist areas. Rooms are quite elegantly maintained considering the its a dated/heritage property.
Service is excellent and staff warm and courteous. Being an Indian I liked the food options — possibly the best place to stay in London if you love Indian food. Both in room dining as well as the restaurant and breakfast buffet have plenty of Indian as well as Indian vegetarian options. There is also a Michelin Started Indian restaurant Quilon offering South Indian cuisine. 
Robin in the restaurant and Ridge at the check-out were extremely courteous and helpful. Checkin experience was extremely good though I forget the name of the girl on the reception. Would like  to extend thanks to  her for the fantastic room she allocated us.",5,2024,07,31
121,Disappointed,"Elevator always stuck, very small rooms, need’s updating. staff very friendly, upper management not friendly or accommodating. Had an attitude of take it or leave it. Hotel has convenient location. Concierge desk was very helpful and accommodating. Breakfast buffet underwhelming and no service at table for coffee. Had to keep getting up and walking all the way to front in order to get a refill. I was disappointed in Hotel, Front desk was very friendly, but when there was an issue with room size upper management just didn’t want to help with providing any solutions. Rooms don’t look at all like they do on website. I wouldn’t stay here again.",2,2024,07,31
121,Lovely stay at St James London,"I was in London on Business trip, the hotel is centrally located with excellent facilities for Business Meetings, good restaurants to hosts guests, and the gym and other facilities were excellent. Had a wonderful stay, the rooms are spacious, and service is excellent.
The staff led by Rafaell is super cool. Kunal at the restaurant was very helpful so did others. Over all an excellent stay and looking forward to visit soon.
Very close to Buckingham palace, so one can just step out.",5,2024,07,31
121,Great service and Beautiful Hotel,"Old world charm hotel with all the modern conveniences that your would expect from a fine Hotel. The included breakfast was wonderful and included Indian dishes.Hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace and a short cab ride to all attractions London has to offer. Room overlooking the beautiful courtyard was very accommodating with a wonderful modern high ceiling and very good HVAC system. The staff could not be more accommodating and polite in a British way. We had the King bed which was very comfortable, and our room was a good size. We will stay here again when we travel to London.",5,2024,07,30
121,Wonderful hotel in the centre of London,"When we come to London we always stay at St James Court and they look after us very well, it’s a home from home for us. Everyone is so courteous and helpful at all times. 

The hotel is in a prominent location and with the tube station only a few minutes away, one can travel to any part of London with ease. 

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for your next visit to London. 

This hotel definitely deserves a super review.",5,2024,07,26
121,Luxury at Another Level,"Stayed at Taj London at the end of June and the hospitality right from the start to the end was nothing short of exceptional. We were upgraded on check in which was a nice touch. Breakfast options were extensive with lots of Indian options. Rooms were immaculate, modern and ultra clean. Size was small (but that’s normal in Central London hotels)",5,2024,07,24
121,Not a Taj property,"Bad experience, not at  all Taj experience.  Right from waiting for lift to waiting for food at TH51 the experience was bad. Taste of food was worst. Unfortunately I hosted a dinner at TH51 it was most embarrassing for me. Time taken was 50 mins to deliver , waiter was clueless, dish was different from ordered, Taste was bad.

As an Indian I feel bad looking at how the best hotel chain in India operates in London.",2,2024,07,22
121,👍👍,"Highly recommend.

Front desk manager Mr. Raunaq was very helpful.

We had lost our phone in a taxi. He helped us with the taxi number with the help of CCTV camera.

He guided us to file a complaint against the driver.

Next day driver called himself and returned the phone.

Thank you TAJ",5,2024,07,22
121,Average for a Taj,"I am going to summarize my overall experience here. For an international hotel Taj James court is stuck in the time. I have stayed at multiple Taj but James court gave me a feeling I was in a government building, Taj in India are more international than James court. That said the night I stayed on 13th Saturday the music playing a floor below was so loud and went on till late in the night, I was staying with a kid and it was hard for me to put her to bed. Then come the unforgettable birthday surprise, fire alarms go off at 1:30 in the night and I was told it was not the first time it went off. What was troubling was there was no one or no sign to guide us on the floor to exit and some of the occupants didn't even know its a fire alarm and they need to exit. after a whole hour someone had to go to the reception and ask if its safe to go back until then no one had courtesy to tell what was happening and if its safe to head back into our rooms. I heard ppl frustrated and yelling too. Honestly I couldn't sleep the day after because I was scared if the alarms will go off again and I have to wake my kid and run after a long day. The whole purpose of staying in a premium hotel is that I could stay comfortable and sleep comfortable neither happened. Food quality was good I enjoyed but would have been nice to have different items, it's same menu all the days I stayed. Getting a decent view table was hard and it felt like some ppl can just walk in and sit on there choice of table and most have to wait, it depends on which side of the buildings you come from apparently. While most of the things were fine, the things I mentioned above would make me rethink coming back to James court or recommending to others.",3,2024,07,22
121,"Great hospitality experience(10/10) at St. James Court, London (A Taj Hotel).","We checked in at this hotel on Jul 04, 2024 and checked out on Jul 06, 2024.(We flew to London Heathrow from Detroit by Delta Airlines.
Front office staff are professional and helpful. Over all decor inside looks a bit rundown(Only one elevator was functioning)  for the kind of price we paid for 2 night stay(USD 995.00).
But the service in this hotel is extraordinarily good (10/10). Excellent spread of food, great taste,  at the buffet table and the hospitality here is superb(10/10), right from  staff Urmi, Aanchal, Divya, Milda, Deepa ( as I remember a few). Restaurant manager Mukesh Kumar was excellent too. Just felt as if we were in India and not in a foreign country. We have travelled several countries and stayed in 5 star hotels,   but never experienced this extraordinary hospitality as we had at St. James Court (A Taj Hotel). Service and food quality masked the disappointment of the interior look of the hotel.

However, I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,21
121,Taj St James Court worst ever experience,"Worst ever experience at St James Court, Taj is spoiling their reputation, entire staff too adamant & blunt, they don’t care  for their guests, breakfast also is very bad , u have limited selection & can’t take it another time, felt like they are doing some charity to their guests, zero value for money",1,2024,07,20
121,Marvellous!!,"Excellent property in the heart of London; Courteous staff, delectable cuisine for both breakfast & lunch/high-tea, and spacious rooms & a beautiful courtyard!!

I will certainly be staying here again!!",5,2024,07,20
121,Royal Stay in london,Lovely staycation at the Taj London.. It feels so nice to be connected to home in London. Super service and hospitality and lovely food. Proud of being Indian and supporting the India group of hotels during our visit to London. The rooms are so nicely done. Feels like being in a palace with lovely decor. Indian Flag hosted outside is just too good.,5,2024,07,20
121,EXCELLENT SERVICE!,"The staff are simply amazing! We were able to get an early checkin which helped a lot after a long plane trip. The front desk young lady worked really hard to find an available room and she was so happy she could get it for us (I guess we looked really tired). The concierge desk is extremely friendly and helpful with local tips for getting around and would flag us a taxi whenever we needed one. The breakfast has lots of choices and the quality was great. Not make hotels where you get a fresh omlette delivered to you without having to wait in line, and with so many fresh steaming hot Indian items like fresh idli and masala dosa, even tasty aloo parantha and chole. The staff are so welcoming and you can tell service is their number one priority. There is a lovely young gentleman named Ibad- he goes around to all the tables with a magical morning smile greeting everyone and serving fresh chai in a blue pot with a tray carrying glass cups. He got to know that my husband loves chai and upon seeing him every morning, he would run and make it fresh for him. He learned that my son liked the little glass cups so he would bring only those for him. It was something we looked forward to every morning to see his smiling face working his magic at every table. We would walk in looking for him, and if he saw us from across the restaurant, he would glow and come to us with chai and a morning greeting. We enjoyed the hotel more than we enjoyed London overall, in fact. This type of service is not something we have experienced anywhere else and is an example to hotels everywhere. We look forward to revisiting London and will only choose the Taj St. James.",5,2024,07,18
121,Subpar experience - management didn't care,"We had several problems with the rooms.  Some were eventually fixed, but others were not. Management didn't really seem to care.  It was bad enough that we didn't even bother telling them about all the issues. 

They said they would follow up but never contacted me back.  When I tried to contact them again twice - both times they asked for a good number and time to call, but then proceed to ignore me again.",1,2024,07,18

Just amazing and Royale … a perfect hotel for family with kids … u can even see some Indian celebs there lol 😂",5,2024,07,17
121,Amazing Folks at the Taj,"I just luv this Hotel. We arrived quite early and Jeff at the reception did his best
to accomodate us and by 12.00 noon gave us the keys. Not just that but my wife and myself experienced a great deal of friendliness and a desire to assist us. 

Rajani who was training at that time, must add has an outstanding tutor.

Binoy at the concierge was amazing and  guided us very accurately with our travel plans. 

Shankari and every person at the TH restaurant were just amazing.

Hats offff to the the folks Taj, it felt like home and my respect for the Tatas tripled after this visit.",5,2024,07,15

House of Ming was delectable food.",5,2024,07,14
121,Anniversary trip with my wife to see Wimbledon & F1 at Silverstone!,"We stayed at the Taj starting July 2nd 2024 for 4 nights. Upon arriving we were checked in by Raunaq Ghosh, who we found to be extremely friendly and accommodating providing key information about our stay and assisting with any of our plans. As this was our anniversary he made sure that our room was decorated with a Happy Anniversary banner, a slice of delicious cake and a nice bottle of wine. Throughout our stay Raunaq was in-touch /communicating to ensure we were more than satisfied and if we needed anything. We found Raunaq and all of the hotel staff to be super friendly and helpful. The morning breakfasts were great with a huge selection of ala carte options as well as options to order off the menu, all of the food was great. We dined in the hotel for dinner and found it to have the same great service and delicious food. We also used the gym which although a little small had a good selection of free weights, a universal machine, and several cardio options.  Having stayed in London many times my wife and I found this hotels location perfect as its within walking distance to many of the sites (i.e. Buckingham Palace, The Mall, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, London Bridge, London Eye, etc.) close proximity to the underground (2 blocks) and there are several really nice restaurants within a few minutes’ walk as well. Based on a score of 1 to 10 our overall assessment of the staff, food, room accommodation/bed/bathroom, hotel location, and the property itself would be a 10/excellent! We would score it a 12 based on Raunaq’s personal customer service that he provided to us during our stay and yes we will stay here again upon our next visit!",5,2024,07,14
121,"Not Taj standards, not at all","I have stayed here before, but never had such a terrible time.  
1. They downgraded my room, despite having paid for it to start from the night before given i was going to arrive in the morning.
2. The pigeonhole of a room given to me was completely out of line with the booking or the photos of the rooms on their website.
3. Despite complaining, they completely refused to acknowledge the issue.  I had to create a huge stir through emails and reservation, and even then, they refused to assist in helping gather my stuff and also initially asked me to move my bags.
4. I was hurt multiple times in the earlier room as the door stoppers were cramped up in the small room. 
5. Finally when they moved my stuff to the new room, on one of the days, the shelf in the cupboard fell on my foot.
6. The hotel was full to the brim, and generally, they were just not able to cope.
7. One elevator was not working, and it used to take forever to get up or down.  One night, the entire phone system and key system stopped working.
8. I had a terrible incident at the Hamptons' Bar where i was spoken to very rudely.  The manager spoke to me in an incredibly condescending tone and demeanour, told me that the cognac is a rather premium liquor, and questioned my ability to afford such a high end drink.
9. I was to come back and stay with family, which i threatened to cancel.  In a bid to make me hold that reservation, they effectively changed my room to what they called a higher category room (but which by their website's description) couldnt hold as many people as required for my family.
10. Quillon is great, but mostly everything else about this place can really be given a miss.",2,2024,07,12
121,Non transparency in billing & payment,They debited my credit card which had 5.5% charges instead of forex card without my consent & gave interconnected rooms on 2nd day instead of 1st. They incurred 5% discretionary accommodation charge & 12.5% service charge on f&b without knowledge,1,2024,07,12
121,PERFECT,"This was our second stay in this hotel but definitely not our last.love the comfortable rooms housekeeping does an awesome Job.A special mention  for Raunak at the front desk who instantly solved any issues that we had.The breakfast was excellent. Specially loved the hot dishes.The staff is very helpful.
For people who are complaining about the  elevator. The other elevator is being renovated .
Little things which make this property outstanding. We had an early morning check out they sent breakfast in our room at 5 am!!absolutely splendid. 
The free bottles of water in our room ,excellent restaurants loved the House of ming,courtyard. We would love to be back again.",5,2024,07,11
121,"Dark tiny rooms, worn out facilities, kind hospitality.","St. James Court a Taj Hotel is cheap in every sense. Our room was tiny and dark enough to put on the light at day. Elevator is definitely saturated. We asked the front desk for a room change and they said it wasn’t possible. As for the staff, they really compensate the hotel’s facilities. Everyone is very kind and dedicated, specially at the breakfast restaurant. I DO NOT recommend St. James Court for your stay in London.",3,2024,07,11
121,Lovely hotel ,All was great. F&b is slightly lacking .  Raunaq from front office was very helpful. He  made us feel comfortable and welcome. The outdoor area is very nice except the ugly butterflies. The service Otherwise excellent. House of Ming had excellent food and the service was great.,4,2024,07,10
121,Amazing stay in a amazing hotel,"From the moment we arrived we were treated as if we were the only guest there! From the doorman the the front desk folks all were so nice and polite. They truly care about our stay and wanted to please us. Everything was clean, rooms were clean and stocked with amenities including plenty of large bottles of water for each of us daily. The buffet stay breakfast was prepared with anything you could think of, the hotel gardens we were amazing to see. After 3 days we couldn’t find one thing to complain about! It’s in a great location 1/2 block from Buckingham palace.Will stay there again if we return from London.",5,2024,07,10
121,Excellent stay in London,"Excellent location. Very near to Buckingham palace and other high lights of London. Good vibes and warmth at the reception. 
Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Nice experience. 
Beds are good sized and comfortable. Proud to see tricolor flag there 🙌",5,2024,07,09
121,Taj London,"Stunning looking hotel, rooms well furnished clean lovely bathroom bedroom on the small side.Wellness centre great for adults you wouldn’t take children.
Unfortunately let down by poor service in restaurant and reception, had only one receptionist for more than 15 mins with lots of important looking personel using back office but not assisting lone receptionist with big queue.",3,2024,07,09
121,Excellent property with some cheap new additions,"Our family has stayed here twice in two years and had a very comfortable experience both times. It’s in a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to main spots through London tube as well as taxis are also easily available. Breakfast is lavish with a great spread as well you can place order for few items from the menu. Great place with kids. Beautiful outdoor courtyard for evening coffee/drinks experience. Very good food at their Chinese restaurant too. 

The cheap issues we noticed this time was that they charge 5 pounds if you want an ice bucket in your room. I just couldn’t believe a hotel charging 5 poinds for ice. They even charge if you ask for a plate or some cutlery. This issue we didn’t face last year. I travel very frequently around the world for business and have stayed in so many good properties but paying 5 pounds for ice and also for an additional cutlery or plate was shocking from Taj group of hotels. This is super cheap!!

Just mentioning this so people should be prepared to pay or maybe bring their own ice and cutlery. They don’t even have an ice machine so we could do self service.",4,2024,07,09
121,WORST HOTEL GUYS,"The only positive aspect of my stay at the Taj Hotel was the receptionist, Geetika, who was kind and helpful. Unfortunately, the rest of the experience was extremely disappointing. The service was pathetic, and the rooms were in terrible condition, with dirty linens and malfunctioning air conditioning. Geetika’s professionalism stood out in an otherwise awful experience.",1,2024,07,08
121,"True luxury, ideally located.","Beautiful suite (we were upgraded). Just around the corner from the St James Park Underground station, which made it very convenient to get to Wimbledon.  Super clean, modern toiletries provided, as well as ample water. There was a stunning courtyard with a fountain, and two bars with very polite staffs.",5,2024,07,08
121,"Great first stay, disappointing second stay","This is my second time staying at the St. James Court Taj hotel.  For reference, my first stay was in May 2023, my second stay was July 2024.  This review is in regards to my second stay.

I am disappointed in my experience this most recent stay.  I very much enjoyed my first experience here and was looking forward to bringing my family to stay here.  Only one of 2 elevators was working, so it was about a 5 minute wait anytime you needed to call the elevator.  I heard one guest mention she stayed here a few months ago and she experienced the same elevator issue then as well.  

The hotel has a great breakfast included in the room charge, but unfortunately the waiter service was inconsistent.  Our waiter the first day was fantastic.  Our waitress the second day was a bit rude when we asked for 2 items from the “European” menu.  She pointed out that we could only order one item from the European menu and one from the Indian menu.  She did not explain this before we ordered.  On the third day, I asked the waitress for a vanilla latte.  She told me I could make my coffee myself using the coffee machine at the buffet.  This was odd to me, despite seeing a full coffee menu on the main menu.  The waiters the prior days gladly brought us coffee whenever we ordered it.  We also noticed other guests had coffee brought to them from the kitchen, so I’m not sure why we were singled out.  I made my own coffee with the machine, but the coffee was not good quality and there were no syrups provided.  I don’t mind making my own coffee, but it would be nice to have all supplies provided. 

Lastly, upon checkout, I was informed there was an “optional” 5% service charge.  This was not mentioned at any time during the booking process.  Unfortunately due to our experience this time, I asked to remove the charge.  I did not feel this was earned by the hotel this stay.  I am disappointed as my first stay here was great.  I hope this is not the new normal for this hotel.",3,2024,07,08
121,Good place to stay .,All good. Well maintained property.  Front office & F&B staff & managers were very helpful. Good spread of breakfast. All Restaurants serve good food .Rooms are spacious.  Hotel is centrally located .Health club & spa is well equipped .Beautiful courtyard.,5,2024,07,07
121,DISAPPOINTED AFTERNOON TEA,"Visited the Kona today for an afternoon tea, to celebrate a 50th birthday.

Extremely disappointed, was really looking forward to our first visit here.

Firstly if visiting for the afternoon tea, note it is ONLY 90 mins long, which we were only told when seated.
Everything was VERY rushed, asked for cocktails which didn’t arrive until 25 mins into our tea.
Asked for refills of the savoury dishes, which again didn’t arrive.
If it is requested for a birthday, they will bring a slice of cake for the guest.
Whilst still awaiting and eating her food, the waiter randomly appeared with a cake slice, and put it in front of her with no warning and lit the candle.
I had a word with the waiter and manager who advised me that our time was limited, and still had 19 mins left.
His manager in turn came and spoke with me and said the time is limited but said we could sit in a private area to finish if we wanted.
We did move and again had to ask for tea, no service was provided here.
The birthday girl was very disappointed and spoke to the manager when leaving, they told us they have noted our suggestions for a longer sitting.",2,2024,07,06
121,Pathetic Taj Hospitality,"We were there in June and chose to stay in this hotel for 7 nights. We had also booked a Classic Mater suite which was supposed to be a top grade suite. Where do I start as everything was pathetic. 
When we arrived on 21st June after a long 9 hour flight from India and another 2 hours from Gatwick airport to the hotel, all tired, we learnt that the systems were down and we could not check in. We were made to wait 3 hours. They offered complimentary dinner only to learn later that it was charged to my card. I reminded the staff twice during the stay to take off the charge and everything they agreed to it.  Anyways we got our room finally. 
Breakfast was part of our room package and it was horrible experience. Every morning we were made to wait 10-15 mins to get a table. Anything we ordered from the menu took 40-60 mins. Twice during our stay they even forgot our orders.
Like I said I had booked Classic Master suite hoping for better experience but the rooms were small and old and sticked. The room cleanliness and house keeping was not up to the mark.
2 out of 3 phones in the room was not working and no one ever picked up the phone in the room dining. if they did, the room dining food was brought in roughly 1:30- 2 hours, exceptionally slow.
The staff was not very friendly. 
Only saving grace at the hotel was the concierge who were prompt and helped with our tour planning. 
I am a Platinum member with Taj but again seems it did not matter as no one even enquired about my stay or concerns. Even during checkout, the staff did not even bother to even ask once on my stay. 

I have stayed in Taj Hotels all over the world but I must say this was the worst ever experience I have had. 

This experience has definitely changed my perspective about the loyalty program at Taj and the hospitality. 
Will never stay again.",2,2024,07,06
121,"Wonderful experience, comfortable room, convenient location","The St James' Court was wonderfully located with an amazing, friendly, and helpful staff.  The breakfast buffet is simply the best I've ever encountered... and I've encountered many.  Thank you for a comfortable and extremely pleasant stay.  I would recommend this hotel emphatically and hope to stay again.",5,2024,07,03
121,Fabulous stay!,"Amazing very centrally located! The time for lifts took ages but that’s ok! Food was great ! True taj hospitality!
A must recommendation for a family with kids!
Also good food Indian variety for ppl with kids who need Indian food/ Indian Chinese/south Indian/
Fabulous!",5,2024,07,02
121,Not a 5* experience,"Not the 5* stay which we experienced last year 
Breakfast was chaotic and very noisy, with a wait to get a table . 
Our bathroom was small with hardly any space to put our toiletries .
A long wait to check in , with preference given to guests, with queries  already booked in at the hotel . 
I wish we hadn’t recommended to our friends that we stay at The Taj 
The best part of the stay was the Anniversary meal , which we enjoyed at The Ming . Good service, delicious food and we were made to feel special .",3,2024,07,01
121,Experience at St James Court Taj,"We were at the Taj in London from June 19th for 4 nights. I have to say that right from the check in to check out, our experience was great. I had requested to have our rooms ready early since we were flying in from the US.  Although, I was not very hopeful, I was pleasantly surprised when the reception welcomed us and asked us about our long flight and shared that our rooms were ready.  The rooms were nice and clean and well furnished. The property is perfectly located.
 
Morning breakfast was very good, and the staff was helpful.  Dinners at TH@51 on the premises was very nice and Jyothish was amazing in taking care of us whenever we were there. Binoy at the Concierge Desk was outstanding. I would recommend to others and would definitely go back again.",5,2024,06,30
121,Great Stay,"The Hotel is well located. The rooms were well-appointed and well furnished. .  Depending on your age and pace, the hotel is less than 10 Mins walk to Buckingham Palace and a further equal distance to Mayfair with great pubs,  and restaurants. Oxford Circus would be about 20-25 mins walk. The house of Ming serves oriental food and Quilon restaurant also part of the Hotel serves south Indian vegetarian and no veg food. There was a large selection for buffet breakfast including south Indian options as well.  Though one of the lifts was being repaired there were others so no problem. Overall I would recommend this Hotel. It seemed that this Hotel was very popular with Indian overseas travelers.",5,2024,06,29
121,Taj St James,"Excellent service provided by the front office staff … kudos to Ridge  for always responding and taking care of details 

Special thanks to Binoy the concierge as well 

Room service is excellent as well The room was nice , clean and ready when ever we came back",5,2024,06,28
121,Nice and different atmosphere,"The hotel is nice, the staff is very friendly, the location is very good, the breakfast is rich and good, and the Indian atmosphere is really nice.

However, we have some comments:
1. The room we received seemed smaller than the expected 25 square meter we reserved. Upon our request the room was changed to a bigger one which looked older but was OK.
2. One of the elevators is under repair which caused discomfort. We had to use the stairs many times.
3. We had to wait in line for breakfast 10-15 minutes every morning which was quite unusual for us.",4,2024,06,27
121,GREAT STAY,"My family and I had a great stay at the Hotel and being a Taj property we felt as if we were in India. The hospitality is excellent. The property is perfectly located in London a 5 - 7 min walk to Buckingham Palace and 10 15 mins more to Oxford Circus.  It is a short walking distance to Mayfair and the pubs and restaurants around the area, The Hotel is  well-maintained. The Quilon restaurant  served authentic south Indian Veg and non veg food specially curated  by Chef Sriram who went out of his way to assist with what to order.",5,2024,06,27
121,Horrible experience and room not allocated even at 4.30 pm!,"Dont know where to stat with our trip to London is starting with a horrible service and shock at Taj James court London! The checkin time is 3 PM and at 4.30 still the room is not allotted. We had reached here at 1.30 since 2.30 we are being told that room is in cleaning.It seems like its a mistake to book their higher category suite rooms since there is no separate checkin and worst the people who came later are being allocated rooms. The excuse being that they have one suite per floor, ‘bigger room hence the cleaning is taking longer.’ We came to Taj looking for hospitality in-fact its reverse of it. We are speechless and shocked at this experience, There are no signs of plain even vanilla 4 star experience. Have wasted our entire day here and seems there is no way you can get patiently your room allocation even way past their checkin time. The restaurant is also a mess and one could hear people yelling.",1,2024,06,23
121,Taj in UK isn’t TAJ of India.,"Not TAJ. I am a Taj and Oberoi fan. Love their hospitality. But this isn’t our TAJ. They have forgotten Indian hospitality in London.

Worst is I was there for 2 nights and in one night the AC wasn’t working. It’s my second night tonight. So hopefully things can become better. My family with small kids couldn’t sleep. The phone wasn’t working and ten WiFi wasn’t working. They even charge 7 pounds plus tax for water. Even in Europe they don’t charge now though. 

The only saving grace was the Breakfast led by Urmi and Smriti and team were sweet and had the Tajness in them.",2,2024,06,22
121,Poor service,"This is the fifth time that we have stayed at the St. James Court.  The service has deteriorated to an unacceptable level.   
First - the elevator situation - understand that an elevator may need to be out of service for maintenance, but signs should be placed directing people to alternate elevators.  Also it is outrageous that bellman with their carts were forcing their way into elevators with guests.  Isn't there a service elevator for that purpose?   
Second - breakfast - it is chaotic. There are so many staff members that they are interfering with each other while standing in the aisles, talking to each other, and otherwise milling around.   Is it really the intention of a luxury property like yours to tell guests to get their own coffee from the machine?   On two mornings we chose to go out for breakfast rather than experience the chaos of the St. James Court's breakfast. 
Third - changing the door locks without any notice.  Understand that modernization is essential but to change guest room door locks without advance notice is ridiculous.   A note could have been slipped under the door the night before advising of the action.   A phone message could have been left.   Also a sign could have been posted at the hotel entrance asking guests to stop at the front desk and get a new key.   

We have stayed at several Taj properties in India.   The service was impeccable.   No comparison to the St. James Court.",2,2024,06,19
121,Experience of the Season,"From the check in to check out , my experience was as smooth as butter the staff from the reception if I remember well clifa was her name was so damn helpful and the rest of the staff was amazing helpful but most of all the at morning breakfast Shankary and Deepa were so sweet and helpful with our food that every morning was a feeling good experience.  The beds are as comfortable as they can get and the experience of seeing a supercar every damn day was dream come true , staying at taj was an experience of the season and would recommend and would definitely go back for another vacay . Though it’s a recommendation to carry universal socket for your charger .☺️",5,2024,06,16
121,Good hotel that needs a few tweaks,"Pros: Nice clean room. Executive King was large enough for the three of us with the rollaway. Large and amazingly soft towels. Nespresso coffee maker in the room as well as a kettle. Complimentary bottled water. Excellent bell desk - Diego is a star! Convenient location to Buckingham palace. Priced well for what you get in this expensive city.
Cons: Spotty wi-fi - inexcusable for a 4 start hotel in this day and age. Breakfast was chaotic,loud and noisy. Management needs to work on service and food replenishment. If you go after 10am, items will be running low.
Overall a decent hotel. I usually adore Taj hotels, but the St. James just isn’t up to par with its other properties on the service level. Diego made our trip and was most helpful. However, since I work remotely (reliable wi-fi is required) and I love a great hotel breakfast, I would not stay here again. Too many other choices in London.",4,2024,06,16
121,Wah Taj,"A Perfcect Holiday at a Perfect Location. A wonderful experience which you always expect from Taj.
Good Food.
In House & on site Restaurant were Excellent.
Definitely a Visit.
Parks near by for your morning walks.
Beautiful Spa to be tried.",5,2024,06,15
121,Taj not like taj,"So at first we are paying about 350£ per night which as per high season is understandable, but the service and state of the hotel is pathetic, broken latches, dirty cushions , shaky doors, to top it all up only one elevator is operational in hotel which creates lots of delays, in room dinning keeps up on wait for sometime before connecting. In room dining team conveniently tells you about the delay in your order since sometimes the one working lift is also not operational. We have stayed at many taj properties across India but have never experienced something like this. Hotel should not take as many bookings as they cannot manage the guests with one working lift. Concierge and reception are very helpful but that doesn’t fill the gap of bad service and poor state of the hotel",1,2024,06,13
121,This is a hotel property that will exceed your expectations,"This historic property is enhanced by an enormous team of clearly dedicated staff members. Because of their efforts there is little to want for. The hotel gleams: the marble shines, the common areas comfortable and welcoming. We stayed twice in June and each of our Classic Master Suites (772 sq. Ft.) was wonderful including a master bedroom and a spacious living room. We were upgraded to a suite in the Winster wing that had a fully equipped kitchen, clothes washer, dishwasher, fridge, etc. Generous closet and storage space. Worth the upgrade on our next stay here!  The concierges and managers were the most approachable, helpful and kind individuals we have encountered at any of our luxury hotel stays. Every staff member including the turndown service members exceeded expectations. Their room service menus leaves one wanting more non-Indian options, but workable. The TAJ door staff energetically hail taxis and help with packages effortlessly.  We loved our stay at this Buckingham Palace, Westminster location hotel and WILL RETURN!",5,2024,06,13
121,Horrible stay,"We stayed here recently and had a poor experience, with the hotel being understaffed and renovation pending.
The hotel staff denied extra beds at 1 in the night, the concierge took hours to revert and my room (301) had noises of the tube passing by (which apparently according to reception is normal), there was a greeting card in my room with a different name (some English guys name) and there was a chaos for breakfast everyday.
Location is amazing which is the only good part rest is horrible.",2,2024,06,11
121,A stunning London experience!,"From check-in to check-out nothing was too much trouble. Our upgraded room was located in the fitness wing and proved to be very peaceful. Breakfast, although busy, had a plentiful selection of buffet items and we were afforded every courtesy. The room was spotless and every staff member went out of their way to make us feel welcome. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Raj to anyone.",5,2024,06,10
121,Ok but won’t stay again,"This hotel is NOT kept well. It’s supposed to be luxury, but the room had spider webs and tub needed to be cleaned in its corners. They never cleaned either when asked! The couch had a stain too. On floor 2, you could here the tube all the time other than 5 hrs a night. Other guests were rude snobs. 
Pros
Water in room was free which they replinished daily. 
Good location in westminister. 
Buffet options was good. Western breakfast was reasonable. 
Also had ok Indian breakfast. 
Western plugs and English plugs. 
Nice staff and good service.
Classic studio good size for 2 adults + teen = 3 ppl
No charge on rollaway even though they listed it as 50/extra night.",3,2024,06,08
121,Wonderful hotel with the friendliest staff you could hope for,"Very comfortable rooms, great food, helpful staff.  The hotel is very large but did not feel like a big corporate hotel. The hotel architecture is gorgeous. The bathroom was fantastic with a superb shower head. Lovely neighborhood near Buckingham Palace and government buildings. Wish our stay was longer",5,2024,06,07
121,Best property in London,Best Hotel in London. Luxury with a touch of care and homely feeling! If you want to wish and experience real luxury still at a very affordable price and great staff to assist then stay here- located next to buckhingham palace and the service is awesome,5,2024,06,05
121,Home & luxury feel,The best in hospitality with luxury and the family touch only at the Taj at st James court with special thanks to Ms prativa who makes us feel special always . One can never go wrong with the taj hospitality anywhere in the world . The rooms amenities shower bathrooms are absolutely fantastic. The Chinese restaurant and service is superb. The best part is the early check in and late check out . The taj hotel commits and stands by its name :.,5,2024,06,05
121,Love love love!!!,"What a beautiful hotel, gracious staff, excellent cocktail bar with great food open late!!
Awesome location right next to Buckingham Palace and all the gardens, it was our one extreme pleasure in 5 weeks travel. I’m glad we were recommended to stay at St James Court.",5,2024,06,04
121,Staff need customer service training and a mouse was spotted!,"This was our second visit and we were looking forward to returning.
Here are the positives:
A complimentary fruit basket was delivered about 30 minutes after we arrived in our room - not sure why, but appreciated.
As an avid coffee drinker, the Nespresso machine was much appreciated.
Big fluffy bath towels!
Our room was quiet, on the 3rd floor.
Very comfortable bed
Great smelling bathroom products

And now for the negatives:
Only 1 elevator and it is VERY SMALL.  Reading previous reviews, the 2nd elevator has been inoperative for a very long time. Take the stairs? We did nearly all of the time, but the hotel is a maze and not well marked to  access via stairs. We met many people during our 6 night stay that were looking for the stairs, lost completely, or trying to find their room once they located the correct floor. If there had been a fire (the fire alarm did go off about 6am one morning, very briefly), guests would have a very difficult time to get out of the building quickly.
Our room had been updated, but still had some of the old furniture and they looked very tired and worn. Very low water pressure in the shower and a terrible shower head. Not the standard I would expect considering the room rate we were paying.
The food and beverage department needs some help. The staff are very pleasant but they lack leadership and training. Breakfast was so busy, people waiting and they are clearly understaffed. Getting drinks in the bar took forever, even though the 2 gentlemen working didn't seem busy at all. We went up to the bar, only to be told they would come to our table and take our order - which they did, eventually. Then we waited and waited for the drinks to be delivered. No-one came back to check later if we'd like another drink or if there was anything we needed. Having worked in the food and beverage business for a long time, it's clear that the staff need some basic customer service training. 
Also, a mouse was spotted in a 4th floor hallway one morning....

Next time to visit London, we won't be going back to the St. James Court.",3,2024,06,03
121,Best customer service,I narrowed down my choices to two hotels and I am so happy  That I chose this one. Great hotel to stay in. The location is 20-40 minutes walk to all the attractions. The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was excellent. The pool was fabulous. But what made the stay extra nice was the greetings we got from Mojtaba. Everyday he asked us how our stay was and if we needed anything. His great customer service made our stay extra special.,5,2024,06,03
121,Perfect Taj Experience in London,"Being in a different country need not change your culture. This hotel proved that again. You get the same experience as in India in London!
Great experience from the time you arrive till you leave. Made us feel that we should come back again. Keep it up Taj .",5,2024,06,02
121,Disappointing…..,Check in was painful…..from telling us our room was ready to it wasn’t. Big queues to elevators as one had broken down. Room was pleasant but after only an hour into the room we were disturbed twice to ask if we wanted turn down service - it was 5pm!! Decor in the hotel and lobby is very outdated considering this is a flagship hotel! Breakfast was nice but so slow - waited 20 mins just for coffee but Fatma & Jenny were very attentive and polite. Great location but customer engagement is lacking with respect to other taj hotels….the Tajness experience needs rebooting in this location. Nice toiletries Molton Brown smell lovely.,2,2024,06,02
121,A good memorable experience in London,"Great hotel ,good & friendly staff. Will  definitely recommend strongly to choose this hotel .Walking distance to the Buckingham Palace. Overall had a great experience.Spoilt with choices in the breakfast buffet spread .It felt like we were in India as they served Dosa , Chai, Poorie Sabji and so many more Indian dishes.",5,2024,06,01
121,Lovely stay with some surprises,"Great position and in an area we were familiar with.  Upgraded room was very nice and attention of staff, especially the Concierge staff was very good.  However, the room keys did not work to begin with, the bathroom vanity sink plug got stuck in the closed position and therefore the water could not drain away (this style of plug is not good.  We have in Australia and there are similar problems.  Surprising to see it in a hotel of this standard).  Go early to breakfast though, since you will have to wait if it is any later than 8am",4,2024,05,30
121,Overrated,"Loved the food in both restaurants but the rooms ,service and elevators were extremely underwhelming and just poor ...Quilon and house of.ming were both great ...Chef Sriram and Chef Ramesh and Santanu are true rockstars the hotel however was highly overrated",2,2024,05,30
121,Room not ready upon arrival,"This two night stay was a treat for my mother’s 60th birthday. Check in isn’t until 3pm and we were due to arrive in London around 2pm. I requested an earlier check in, which was not met. Unfortunately we did not get checked in to our room until closer to 4pm due to rooms not being ready. There were other guests also awaiting check in due to rooms not yet available and a bit of an angry queue was forming at the reception desk. 

The first room available was a junior suite, therefore we were upgraded once I began putting pressure on them. We had dinner reservations at 4:45pm, a 20 minute drive from the hotel. This left us less than half an hour to get showered and ready for dinner. After a long day of travelling and soaking wet from heavy rain, all we wanted was a clean shower and to get freshened up. No sooner were we in the room and the door swung open with someone arriving to change a broken phone. Luckily this happened BEFORE I whipped off my clothes! 

While rushing to get ready, we quickly discovered there was no hair dryer in the room. I called to request one, and after a call back and insisting there was no hair dryer in the room, housekeeping agreed to bring one. It didn’t arrive on time, and we had to go to our lovely meal which had been booked months in advance with wet hair, or we risked losing our table and deposit. 

During check-in, reception said they would arrange transport for us when I explained why we were now in such a rush. This turned out to be a taxi flagged down and paid for by ourselves. We arrived late to dinner, narrowly avoiding our table being reallocated, and spent an uncomfortable evening at dinner and the theatre with wet hair. This late check in had a knock-on effect which thoroughly spoiled our first evening. The upgrade to a junior suite was a lovely touch, but I would much rather have had my standard room on time and been able to have an enjoyable evening. 

The courtyard is truly stunning. We had a lovely view of the courtyard from our 4th floor room. A broken lift meant the lifts were busy and queued most of the day. The hotel is immaculately clean throughout. Breakfast has a wide selection, something for everyone. Be expected to wait for a table. However, the staff at breakfast are probably the most polite, helpful, and friendly staff I have ever dealt with. Absolutely nothing is a bother for them. They clearly work hard, and we witnessed them dealing with some difficult, pushy guests. 

No one asked how our stay had been upon check out. It was as quick as they could take payment and have you on your way. Needless to say, I did indeed pay the tip which is automatically added to your bill. I hope every penny of tips makes it to the deserving staff. 

These may seem like minor complaints, but when you pay what I paid for this two night stay, you expect things to be near-perfect. Sadly, this experience wouldn’t be worth it for me paying to stay a second time round. There are lots of other beautiful hotels in London for a fraction of the cost- and your room is always ready for your arrival.",2,2024,05,28
121,great location but some bad misses,"Great location
Lots of facilities 
willing staff
But
My room was not ready on arrival at 15.00
I was directed to a dirty one after 30 wait
Clean one eventually ! but no apology 
Breakfast aueue is a joke, service correspondingly over run
Lift is not at all adequate for size and quality of hotel",3,2024,05,28
121,Staff was the highlight,"Be careful about which standard of room you buy.  The websites are not clear.  The good rooms are excellent and the bad rooms are squalid.  The attached Indian restaurant was excellent and the attached Chinese restaurant was sub par- mostly for show. It might have been better if we had sprung for a $135 multicourse.  
Staff was impeccable in the hotel.  That was a very positive experience",5,2024,05,28
121,Great Location and Friendly Service,Great experience!  Our family from the US spent several days in London to begin our European vacation.  The hotel was a fabulous and safe location within walking distance to many tourist attractions and a Tube station. We joyed the quieter neighborhood away from large crowds and noisy traffic. The breakfast buffet was a big hit with so many yummy options from Indian to British cuisine. The staff was attentive and friendly.  All four of us would eagerly stay at this hotel again.,5,2024,05,27
121,Excellent Hotel,"Gorgeous Hotel, excellent attentive staff. Great ambience. Stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights in May 2024. Excellent location and transport links to get around London easily.

121,Wouid not recommend,"I stayed here over the bank holiday weekend and had an unpleasant stay.  Long ques at reception to check in. The lift had ques and waiting time. 

A 40 min waiting time to be seated for breakfast and chaotic management. The television in the room did not work and was not repaired.

At almost 400 pounds a night this fell seriously short on everything",1,2024,05,26
121,Amazing experience,Wonderful experience with amazing staff & fantastic culinary treat!!This was our second visit in one year and would love to stay there again whenever we visit London as the location is so very convenient & all great historical places being close by.,5,2024,05,22
121,Excellent location,"Overall good; with excellent location, this hotel is on the verge of being a great experience, but needs to improve a bit on service at the front desk and have elevators ready and working, also improve a bit on the cooking side, other than that great experience.",4,2024,05,22
121,Very relaxing experience,"Very beautiful property located near all the major attractions of London. This was our first time staying in this property but not the last.
When we arrived for checked in Geetika welcome us with a smile and explain about the hotel resturants and other facilities. We arrived a bit early from United States as our flight got early to Heathrow. Geetika was able to find a room for us in 10 minutes. 
Breakfast was really very nice and appetiting with tons of varities and service was great specially Suruthi, if I smelled her name correctly, was very welcoming and continue asking us if we need anything.
Room was small but that's what you expect in Europe but very clean with all ameneties you need. Only issue I would like to point out that  bath tub is slightly high and it feels scarely when you coming out from tub. Room service was great and daily room cleaning was done on time. Concierge service was friendly and excellent.
Overall it was a very relaxing experience and we will definelty coming back.",5,2024,05,20
121,Great location near to Buckingham Palace,Location of the hotel is great with unlimited scope for improving the amenities. AC in the room i have been allotted was not working . On complaining they have immediately shifted the room . Great Indian food in breakfast . service was fast . But when on entering the hotel what welcome us is a stale smell of food especially a fishy smell which is very very unpleasant .  This gives the vibe of an old and unkept property . Rooms are small.,2,2024,05,18
121,Loved this hotel and would definitely stay again,"The rooms are amazingly comfortable, although water pressure is a little lacking. Service is amazing from breakfast through to the evening bar. Courtyard is very pretty for tea. Close to Buckingham Palace and Victoria. Loved this hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2024,05,18
121,Fantastic,One of the best hotels and great hospitality in central London. The breakfast here had a good range of options. The staff was very polite and made our stay memorable. Can’t wait to come back and stay at the same property. The Sunday brunch at the property was amazing,5,2024,05,17
121,"Run, please see other options to stay","Dear lord, I know London is expensive but if this is 4 star then a backpackers hostel must be as well. Paid upfront but charged £150 extra charge to be credited upon leaving, don't know why the furniture wouldn't be worth as much. The photos might once have been accurate about 25 years ago. It took 30 minutes to check in. It has one working lift with corridors and alcoves which make it look like a demolition site. So very humorous to see people rating this 5 stars. The best I can say if that the location is good and the foyer is very nice, but it's downhill from there.Do try somewhere, anywhere else...I'm stuck here for 3 days. Very furious with my travel agent.",1,2024,05,16
121,Beware of lifts...,"There is a beauty and charm to heritage buildings.  However, if the infrastructure isn't invested in, they can be a safety hazard. I tripped out coming out of the hotel lift  when the doors opened. I did not notice that the lift was not aligned with the floor.  I informed the hotel straight away, and had no aftercare and the lift was not put out of service. I called again in the morning when I woke up sore from how I tripped, and the impact of breaking the fall on my neck, lowerback and hip.  A security guard came to complete an accident report. On checkout, a manager was supposed to call me but no one has.",2,2024,05,16
121,Definitely not the Taj Hotel experience I am so used to in India,"An overall dissatisfactory stay, barring a few staff who were exceptional. I specifically wish to complement Mukesh & Urmi at Chambers along with their colleagues Aditya & Sourabh. Harish, Mojtaba and Jeff were definitely praiseworthy at the front desk. I am sure there must be others who must have been good, with whom I didn't interact with, since most of them were either exceptionally brusque or simply inefficient, starting from the coffee shop to housekeeping. I was amazed that you need to request for something as basic as a soap dish in the toilet, or even thin pillows to help mitigate a neck issue. Though ultimately both these items were informed to be unavailable. The entire hotel desperately needs upgradation, especially the Chambers. I have never come across a Chambers which was so depressing and dated. The room i stayed for two days, reminded me of Indian hotel rooms of the 70's seen in old movies. Haven't come across such rooms in any Taj category hotel that I am staying in since 2005. First the toilet was not attached to the bedroom, then a huge empty  space above the cupboards (probably carpenter made it shorter than the height allocated), inside of cupboard which is huge in size but with poorly planned  storage space and to top it all the windows open into a fire escape staircase so perforce you keep curtains drawn. I seriously feel IHCL should downgrade category of this hotel to either Vivanta or Selections, definitely not fit for Taj category.",2,2024,05,16
121,Sad and disappointing,"So sad that we were told the air con would be fixed and it wasn’t , mocked at reception the next morning. We were questioned why we didn’t ask for a room swap at 3 am. The surroundings are beautiful , the staff some are efficient some were just hoping to hide by lack of confidence",1,2024,05,15
121,Staff mistreated me,"Upon check in the concierge emphasised on the room deposit being returned contingent on everything in the room being as is but the ora is was foreseen was very rude made me feel inadequate, I believe this could have easily been avoided as none of the other guest were treated in this manner",3,2024,05,14
121,Epitome of luxury & hospitality,"We ahd booked a family tripel room at St James and the ac didn't work As it was weekend, it wasn't possible to fix it. So we were generously upgraded to 1 bedroom suite at 51 Buckingham Palace. This is a perfect sign of ""Customer is King"".
The facilities and the amenities are a perfect blend to ensure our future bookings wirh Taj.",5,2024,05,13
121,"Great first time Experience at St. James Court, a Taj Hotel","I am a travel advisor and this was our first stay in London and we  could not have been more pleased. We were upgraded on arrival, room was clean and spacious with a very large bathroom. Felt very luxurious. The hotel itself is within a short walking distance to shops, restaurants and Buckingham Palace. Our only disappointment was the selection of breakfast items on the buffet. If it was included in the rate you may be a little disappointed, but there are two other great restaurants with pastries etc right across the street. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2024,05,13
121,Great customer service from Brook & Geetika at check in,"This was a hen do weekend for my niece.  The hotel is beautiful. The pillows and bed were soo comfy!.
Brook on the check in desk was super helpful, friendly and welcoming. Both he and Geetika were always happy to see us with a big smile and friendly chat. Highly recommended and just a 5 min walk from Buckingham Palace too",5,2024,05,12
121,Not great.,"Tan hotel

The friendliest person at this establishment, by far, is the head doorman. Everyone else is gloom and doom. I never received a look or a “good morning” without forcing it out of someone. When passing the reception desk all heads are down unable to acknowledge you walking by. The majority of staff seem to struggle with English. A few times I just received total blank looks after explaining something. Not even enough words to say “sorry, could you repeat that?” The room was tucked away around several winding corridors. Noise level in the room was bad. Noise from other rooms and from construction or repairs taking place in the building. The room was dated. HVAC system was overly complicated but very quiet. The bathtub is a safety hazard. It was a severe concave shape on the bottom so it felt like you were slipping into a valley. Difficult to stand or turn. Grab bars were very useful. The common areas of the hotel are very attractive. There was even a piano player one evening. One elevator is out of service which caused delays getting to the room on a few occasions. Breakfast was difficult to get a seat. I gave up after the first day. The food selection is good. There was a waiter going around with masala chai. Unfortunately, it was not offered to us, presumably due to the color of our skin. The location is good, walking distance to a couple of subway stations and Buckingham Palace. Overall, I would not stay here again. 

We checked in a few hours before check in time and were told to return at 3 for the keys and that our bags would be in our room. We returned at 5 and had to wait for a thousand clicks of the keyboard again to get keys. Our bags were not in our room. They did not arrived until about 40 minutes later.",1,2024,05,12
121,Simply wow! Home away home experience,It was an amazing experience and it’s always an amazing experience at any and every TAJ hotel we have stayed ! In all our holidays we make sure we should have to allocate atleast few days to TAJ hotels and so without that our holidays is feel that our holidays are incomplete! TAJ James court is lovely bounties luxury hotel and it’s like home away home !,5,2024,05,12
121,Excellent experience,"I had an absolutely wonderful stay.. the spa, food, staff and hotel were excellent.. the only thing that wasn't nice was when another guest using the spa had their mobile phone on loud listening to music and talking on loud speaker. Nothing was said by hhe staff working in the spa, there are signs and its clearly shown the spa is a 'quite' space however to maintain this, mobile phones should be banned and inconsiderate guests should be challenged by staff. It made the spa experience feel cheap, and disruptive.",5,2024,05,12
121,Great holiday.,"The location of the hotel is really perfect to reach the famous sights quickly. The subway and bus stops are very close. The rooms are very stylishly furnished. The breakfast had a good selection. On the second floor you could hear the subway a bit, but it was fine. The birthday surprise unfortunately came on the day of arrival instead of the actual birthday. But then there was another surprise on the birthday to make up for it. The rooms were a bit hidden in another building. In the course of the vacation we helped a woman our age to find the way to her room on the 8th floor. It was a pleasure. They were very nice. All in all a nice vacation. Best regards.",5,2024,05,11
121,Lovely hotel,"I enjoyed the hotel - I was here for a business trip. It’s beautifully furnished and nice and quiet. You can faintly hear the tube trains rumbling underneath, but not enough to stop you sleeping. I didn’t eat here so can’t vouch for that (there is a nice cafe across the road). V central for Buckingham Palace and St James’ park.",4,2024,05,09
121,"Nice room, shame about the noise","Arrived and was allocated Room 246. A lovely room. It was a bit strange to get to as you have to pass through the courtyard and the hairdressers but it was a lovely room. Large comfy bed, clean and all was good. UNTIL - the tube started vibrating. It was also very adjacent to a lift shaft so I don’t think that helped either. But the noise was not good and disturbed my sleep. 
Seeming as the 2 night stay has cost me over £800!!! It was a special occasion I thought I would ask if there was a different room available. I was just given the explanation that I’m in the middle of London and it was to be expected, and no I couldn’t move. 
I then emailed reception to complain and was allocated Room 619 for the second evening. This room was much quieter. It wasn’t as nice as the original 246 but there was no noise & vibration from the lift & tube. 
Breakfast is an experience. Not what you would expect. If you’re looking for a traditional fry up then you’re going to be disappointed! What was available was nice, lovely selection of breads, fruit, etc. but it was quite busy and disjointed. 
All in all I wouldn’t stay here again as it’s just not worth the money. If you can get a deal then maybe, but personally it’s not for me.",2,2024,05,09
121,Wonderful Stay,"We had a real wonderful stay at the Taj. The breakfast was super. A big surprise was Indian Breakfast. We really enjoyed it. I would definitely stay there on my next visit. The location is great, and the staff is really friendly. I loved the whole experience.",5,2024,05,09
121,Everyone is nice and warm,"The hotel is nice and clean, it is one block from buckingham palace and all the parks around it which makes it a great place to stay. Food and drinks are great. Everything is great, But their most important feature is the service, you feel at home once you step in the lobby, Biurik at the front desk was amazingly warm and welcoming and so was everybody else,  Thank you, we had a great stay!",5,2024,05,08
121,I expected more,"As an American Express Platinum client, I had high expectations for this 5-star hotel in London, which is undoubtedly beautiful and boasts an excellent location. However, the experience didn't quite meet the high standards anticipated. The 'studio for 3' bedroom, while elegantly decorated, felt cramped and somewhat restrictive for three guests. The breakfast, although offering a good selection of quality food, was marred by slow and confusing service, detracting from the overall dining experience. This hotel has great potential but needs to refine its guest services to truly deliver a five-star experience.",2,2024,05,08
121,"Poor service, no responses","Our experience, unfortunately, was not a good one.  I would prefer not to write a public review but after sending two emails without a response, this seems to be the best option.  

We were put in two rooms on the second floor, and immediately it was clear that the hotel, outside of the lobby, was run down and generally quite shabby, particularly in the common area hallways and rooms.  While the reviews that I had read noted renovated rooms, that was not our experience.  Further, there was only one available elevator, causing our family to wait upwards of 20+ minutes just to get to the second floor.  As a result, we were happy to take the stairs to and from our room.  However, there appeared to be no public staircase out of the hotel, which seems like a serious fire code violation.

After waiting so long for an elevator, another guest showed us an exit through stairs that took us to the lobby through what appeared to be a small employee hallway.  When we did this, we were chastised by an employee who told us that it is an employees only area and to get out.  It was quite embarrassing to be spoken to like that in front of my children when we were simply looking to leave the hotel.  That was the first negative experience, and we then took the elevators each time, waiting and waiting.

On Wednesday morning, we needed to leave for the airport at 5:00 am, and so the Concierge was kind enough to call us a cab.  However, the cab arrived early at 4:45 am so we rushed down the elevator to the cab and handed our keys to the front desk on the way out.  It was at that time that the front desk attendant ran out of the building with us and asked us for our credit card while the cab was about to pull away.  It was literally as if she thought we were leaving without paying, despite the lengthy check in, proof of passports and pre-running of our credit cards that they did in advance for which I paid $2200+ USD.  It was again, so deeply embarrassing to have our cab driver tell us, ""I think they are concerned that you are leaving without paying.""

We love the location and thought we were picking a winner but it was the worst part of our trip by far.",2,2024,05,01
121,Awesome Experience,Awesome Experience. Staff was vey cooperative. We had a flight @ 9 am which meant us to check out @ 6 am. The hotel staff was very courteous and gave us breakfast on the go.,5,2024,04,24
121,Probably our worst experience.,"Bed was good. Glass-bottled water very good. Everything else terrible. No shower water. Had to rinse under running water in tub. Furniture absolutely worst I’ve ever seen. I didnt put my clothes in the drawers or closet. No ability to open window. It only opened about 5 inches and all that could be seen was the moldy, dark walls.",1,2024,04,23
121,Overall experience was good,My overall experience was very good but only thing which disappointed me that indian meal options are very rare in the menu whether in the breakfast or dinner you guys should definitely do something for this and redesign your menu again .You guys should provide atleast 50 into 50 ratio for indian food and other foods I mean include more indian dishes in your menu so that all indian community can enjoy meal also.,4,2024,04,22
121,Stay at London,"Our four-day stay at St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel in London was delightful. Accompanied by my wife and two kids, we experienced excellent service from the attentive staff and appreciated the hotel's prime location. Overall, a wonderful experience for the whole family!",5,2024,04,21
121,"Did not have a standard service offered.,.some times up some times very down..seen across all depts except house keeping","The stay was average rated because of inconsistency in service standards..

To start with when we arrived at 830 pm after a nonstop flight from Malaysia.. there was no bell captain to even open the door while we handled heavy luggage up the ramp to get inside..
On entering inside the luggage man was busy talking away with the bell desk officer with his back to the main door so obviously he dint know guests were coming in.. I further witnessed this for other guests aswell over the next 3 nights between 830-1030 pm.. only the day time hours bell captain and door assistance was good..

General reception was cold behavior and not the usual friendly welcoming type on the night of arrival.. Instead of first welcoming the guest at the reception.. first time I heard “how can I help you “ at any TAJ product…

The receptionist said we had booked 3 rooms of 3 people each.. while we had only booked  1 such suite…till the end of the stay she never informed if the duplication on part of Taj was resolved or not.. is this how things work 

Was given a room with broken toilet door handle to start with..had to get this sorted so I don’t get stuck locked inside with the handle in my hand..

The breakfast SELECTION was very good.. but there was no standard service operation procedure.. meaning without handing the menu for the hot orders the waitress asked what we wanted to order .. this was on day 2.. English breakfast tea was served without any milk by the side on the second order for day 2 and 3.

Shankari and Fatma did a  good job on day 1.

Housekeeping standards were good and a standard good level was seen for cleanliness and order..

Hopefully this product staff will become more customer centric and customer focused like our staff back home in India…",3,2024,04,18
121,Excellent time in London,"The location was great. The staff at the concierge desk was superb and overall it was a great experience. We really enjoyed ourselves. The restaurant was great for breakfast and bar was great in the evening! Everyone greeted us as we came and went.

121,Most wonderful and memorable stay on a foreign land !!,"In London, we stayed in two other hotels of international repute, but the Taj St. James’ Court stood apart by far in every aspect. Food was amazing as usual but what stood out was the passionate personalised service that the staff rendered which Taj is well known for.  I would like to express my special thanks to the Area Director UK, IHCL(Taj), London Ms. Mehrnavaz Avari and the Executive Chef – St. James Court & Taj 51 Buckingham Gate, London, Chef Sujoy Gupta for their warm hospitality. Also, must mention Mr. Rajat Bhasin, Accommodations Manager, St. James’ Court who was kind enough to upgrade our room.
I only wish that we could stay a bit longer. Being a hotelier myself, I can only imagine how difficult it is to replicate the ethos of Indian hospitality on a foreign land. Well done Team Taj and keep up the excellent work!!",5,2024,04,17
121,To be repeated,"Warm welcome and given upgraded room,. First time staying at this hotel as  it was very convenient for seeing ""Hamilton""at Savoy Palace Theatre. Very attentive staff and delicious breakfast.  Fully recommended and looking forward to returning in the future.",5,2024,04,15
121,"OK, but needs a bit more effort.","Only having 1 lift working in the main building meant long waits, or having to go upto the 7th, before going down to Lobby, (from 3rd Floor). I reported a water leak from the ceiling of the corridor, (just after the 2 steps down from Room 332), and it was only the next day that Maintenance looked at it. By then the carpet was sodden, the drips had got worse, and there was water coming down the walls. Not exactly the experience that we expected. The room was lovely, but the painters had splashed a few items and not cleaned the paint off. The bath panel had screws poking out, and needs to be replaced. Overall, a lovely hotel, but the details in the rooms need to be as good as the details in the public areas.",4,2024,04,15
121,Wonderful as always,"I have frequently stayed at this hotel and it never fails to make our stay extraordinary.
From the warm welcome of the concierge on duty, Brett and co, so kind and helpful to the receptionist Jenny who so kindly gave me an exquisite bookmark on my leaving which I will treasure. All the staff at Breakfast  Th@51 , chef Elo and Umi Sharma and her wonderful team, so attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The food is always excellent and although busy you nevertheless had someone always at hand who asked if all was okay and did we need anything else.
This is applicable to house keeping,  thank you Riya, in room dining who sent a lovely Easter goodie to our room and everyone else whom we encountered. Always a polite nod, a smile, a greeting, all of this differentiates this hotel to others, they always go one step further.Staying here you are treated so well it saddens me every time to leave. I will keep coming to this extraordinary hotel, a beautiful setting but even better staff. Thank you for all your kindness and making our stay, as always, absolutely wonderful.",5,2024,04,13

Cozy room in high floor with garden view, lovely breakfast, staff in all positions are professional , friendly and helpful. Nice hotel for sightseeing and vacation",5,2024,04,11
121,Expensive Hotel in a Prime Location with Hospitality unbefitting Taj,"This was my 3rd Taj stay in past 1 year (others being Dubai-Business Bay, and Agra). I was expecting hospitality befitting a Taj hotel which was completely missing during my stay. The personal touch, great attention to details and going the extra mile to take care of guests - that we experienced during our previous two Taj stays (examples - Ms Pritha from Dubai Taj helping celebrate our daughter's birthday and Mr. Tanmoy at Agra Taj's Dawat-e-Nawab getting Mr. Rihaan to perform for us) - was completely missing this time. 

I had requested an early check-in and was declined saying rooms are not ready - however, the facility did not seem very busy during our stay.  When I went back to the checkin counter at 2:55pm, the lady said now the room is ready. What I was expecting out of Taj hospitality was for someone to keep track of it and come out to us (we were sitting right opposite the reception counter) informing us that the rooms are ready for checking in. 

I also felt I was given the smaller of the Executive King rooms - which the third party website (agoda) did not even let me book since I have indicated 3 guests (also on Taj's direct booking website pictures). 

Starting from reception, check-in to breakfast - everything seemed very impersonal and robotic (only exception was Ms. Shruti and the gentleman serving Masala Chai in the breakfast room). Breakfast spread was much lesser compared to the other two (however it did not matter since no one can eat all of it), and definitely Parathas and Masala Chai was great. 

The major plus point of this Taj is its location - literally 5 min to Buckingham Palace and 10 minutes to Westminster Abbey & Big Ben.

In summary, this is not an experience I would remember 10yrs from now that would bring me back to this hotel again.",3,2024,04,10
121,Overall experience was amazing,"Pros:
1. Had a wonderful service from Front desk as I had mistakenly booked for one kid instead if two. In no time were they able to resolve the issue and upgrade us to another room for additional £170/ day, which I felt was a bit expensive and pretty much adding another night’s charge.
2. I dont have enough words to appreciate the breakfast service they provided every morning. Our waittime was less than 5 mins and we could order anything from the A la Carte menu apart from yhe breakfast buffet. They had a spread of continental, american, South indian and North indian varieties. And to gove it the indian touch, the filter coffee topped our list of favorites.
3. This hotel is eight across the Buckingham Palace, within a 10 mins walk. It was extremely beneficial for us as it was our first trip to the UK and pretty much everything was walkable: The palace, Big Ben, T Square, Mayfair and the nearest station Victoria was also a 7 mins walk.
4. The interiors of the hotel gave us the Palace vibes and service made us feel likes royals, the room itself was huge with a King bed and Pullout sofa bed, the amenities were top class and room service was amazing especially when we requested for a weighing scale.
5. This was our third time staying with Taj, the two times were in India. I can say the overall experience has been the amazing.

Cons:
I cannot think of any except the price range but it totally justifies the services provided and location of the hotel.",5,2024,04,09
121,Excellent stay at the Taj,"Top notch service, everyone working there go above and beyond. Buffet breakfast was a delight. Roop at breakfast was very helpful. Will definitely stay again. Location is walkable to Buckingham palace and Abbey. Tube is five minutes walk.",5,2024,04,09
121,10/10 hotel in central London,"5 star hotel, experience and staff! Celebrated my mums birthday with a trip to London and the A Taj. From the moment we walked through the doors and check in we were treated with the warmest welcome! Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was spacious and had every facility you need. Very clean also. The breakfast was the best I ever had at a hotel. We were truly sad to leave but that will ensure us to come again.",5,2024,04,08
121,5 star hotel,"5 star hotel. From the moment I arrived the stay was exceptional. Cleanliness, location, friendly staff, great food. Sometimes there was a wait for a table or a little slow getting something in the main dinning room but its was expected for the amount of people they were taking care of. It was nice to see the manager of the dinning room helping the staff instead of pointing fingers. Definitely worth staying here.",5,2024,04,08
121,Frustrating,"The overall service were satisfied but breakfast experience and overdue of lift waiting leave me frustrated .
Part of the rooms in the central building were not undergo renovation and looking very shabby but it concerns only part of the rooms.",3,2024,04,08
121,Lovely Easter weekend stay,"Once again we had a most enjoyable stay. The hotel was very busy because of the Easter holiday. Rooms were very comfortable, spa was lovely.  Special mention for Samriddh Taneja who looked after us so well at breakfast. Our dinner at House of Ming - the service and food were exceptional.  Thank you",5,2024,04,08
121,"Excellent Service, Luxurious Comfort.","The St James Court Taj Hotel is conveniently located to London attractions. The staff is efficient, welcoming and thoughtful. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed with comfortable beds, ample storage space, excellent lighting and an abundance of outlets for charging electronic devises.",5,2024,04,07
121,"Location, location and customer focus","Excellent hotel, wonderful location and very friendly staff. Special call out to Atharva at reception for his excellent customer interaction skills. 

The rooms and amenities are very well kept and the food especially the breakfast menu is excellent .

Definitely a great choice if visiting london .",5,2024,04,05
121,Excellent Hotel with great Service,"Hotel is located in walking distance between Buckingham Palace and Big Ben! Underground station is 5 minutes away. Staff was great and we really liked our room and the service. We will definitely come back! Breakfast was a little crowded, but the employees organized everything really well and everybody was really polite. Concierge and recepetion were great as well.",5,2024,04,05
121,BEST STAY EVER,This is the best place u can ever visit it is so clean great service and kind staff if u are coming to London 💯recommend if u are coming with family or friends and solo and others u will love itttttttt it’s is so amazing u will see your self once you stay here!!!!,5,2024,04,04
121,Wah Taj!,"A beautiful property which is just a stone’s throw away from Buckingham Palace.  Known for their hospitality, like any other Taj Hotel, this lives up to their name & reputation too! We stayed for almost 10 days & had a wonderful experience! The warmth by the staff (Deepak, Ibad, Sumriti & everyone!) at breakfast would give a “cheerful” start to the day! We also had an amazing dinner at House of Ming & met the restaurant manager “Shubham”! A special word of thanks for an extremely helpful gentleman by the name “Binoy” at Concierge too! We were disappointed by the one we met before him (I would refrain from taking a name here) who despite offering to help, never actually did! On the other hand,Mr Binoy advised us & arranged our tours very diligently!  Felt like a Mini India in the heart of London! However, if I may… I would like to put in a few suggestions that should be taken as the “feedback” & not criticism… 

i) the breakfast gets too busy & they are not able to handle the traffic well during the peak hours. May be a bigger place & more work-force should help! Someone needs to tell the cook to make parathas with “whole wheat” atta & not  with refined (maida).  

ii) The housekeeping needs to be worked upon too. The soap bar was not being replenished till we asked for it! It would become so thin that it could not be used & there was no soap dispenser near the wash basin! Why not place an extra soap bar or at least replenish after a couple of days on their own! 

Overall, it was an absolutely fantastic stay! Hope to come back next year too!",4,2024,04,04
121,Would not return,"We stayed as a family of 4 in a premier suite. Room was clean, updated and large enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. However service was very mixed so we would not return. 

Pros: SPA - spa treatment, attendees and therapist were great. 

Front desk staff were mostly unfriendly with the exception of Biruk and Jeff. Biruk was attentive and very customer oriented. The remainder were standoffish and unfriendly. You would never see a smile on their face. The Kids@Taj program was not presented to us and even when we asked for the services under this program, either the front desk staff were hesitant in providing the details or they had no clue what it was. Either way, poor service for front desk staff. 

Rooms were cleaned well but hand soap in both bathrooms were thrown out and never replaced. This happened every night which made no sense. 

Breakfast - we opted for the package which included breakfast but glad it was included in the hotel price because it would be a complete waste of money to purchase separately. Each day we ate there the experience was worse. Staff is not trained. With the exception of 1 morning, we sat down to eat with no place setting/utensils. The tables were never set properly and we had to request it every time. Omelette orders would not be correct. The wait staff had poor communication skills and the cleanliness of the staff was very questionable. Many smelled of body odor and they lacked basic forms of etiquette. For example, every day I would be brought my hot cappuccino but never a spoon for mixing. When a spoon would be brought over, the waiter would not be holding it by the handle and he would be rubbing the spoon with his hands. How unsanitary! I also witnessed this with other guests as well. 

Concierge is also unfriendly and never went out of his way to assist (as you would typically expect concierge services to be). We wanted to make a reservation for house of Ming and instead of helping us to secure a reservation, he transferred our call to the restaurant. I’m used to concierge services where if you are an in house guest trying to make an in house restaurant reservation, they assist and complete the booking. When asked any question, he would respond with a basic answer and nothing more. It’s like he couldn’t be bothered. I did find out that the main concierge guy who is great happened to be off the week we were there. 

In room dining - they don’t understand English and messed our order one evening. They are also not trained properly on allergies.  The next day, although the room was cleaned none of the used plates, cutlery and cups  were removed from the room. When we called for removal- they asked why and never bothered coming. 

Although the St. James location is an excellent area our room was in front of a school playground. Every morning when the kids started school it was very noisy. Also for 2 nights we were woken up early morning to sounds of glass shattering or being recycled. It was so loud that it woke up the whole family. Not sure what this was from but the sounds lasted around 15 minutes.  

Overall, for a Taj hotel, you expect a better customer service model. This hotel looks as though they are hiring Indians from India with no English language skills to service the hotel versus hiring qualified and trained staff. What a pity.",2,2024,04,03
121,One of the best London locations,Ottima location.  Warmth welcome. Superb breakfast.  Very decent room.  Quiet.  Clean.  Extra services included. Indian style. Michelin star restaurant. I’m definitely suggest it.  Good price.  One of the best place to stay in London.  Only problem you cannot join their loyalty program via app,5,2024,04,02
121,Nice hotel ...BUT TRAIN NOISE,"Nice hotel in a great location.

BUT

Rooms  240 and 237 were disturbed every few minutes by train noise at 5.20 every morning till about midnight 

I did speak to the manager but nothing happened.

ALSO disappointed that 5 % was added to our room rate for "" service """,2,2024,04,01
121,Simply the best!,"This was our third time staying at the st james taj and we can't imagine staying anywhere else in London! Love every minute! Biruk even upgraded our room to the BEST room we've ever stayed in! Thank you!! Excellent stay, excellent service, excellent everything.",5,2024,03,30
121,Taj London - beautiful,"The good place to have a stay over, whether for business or leisure, centrally located with great access, quality food and comfortable stay, it can just be the place one can opt for. orient building transformed into a class hotel gives an unique experience",5,2024,03,30
121,"Great location, super helpful staff","Great location in central London, close to many landmarks but still in a quiet corner of town. Beautiful peaceful courtyard, spacious rooms and staff that definitely went the extra mile. All topped off with a delicious breakfast spread. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",5,2024,03,27
121,"Wonderful hotel, great service, all the great sites within easy reach. The perfect place to stay in London","Truly one of the best places to stay in London. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are great with plenty of room & the breakfast was excellent. Every single staff member was lovely. Very courteous, helpful & ensured our stay was everything we could ask for. The location was perfect. Only a couple of minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, a short stroll to Big Ben & Westminster Abbey. All the sites any traveller wants, all within reach. 
We stayed to celebrate my 50th birthday & our anniversary & the staff made our stay a memorable experience in every way. A wonderful Taj Hotel that doesn’t disappoint. Thank you",5,2024,03,25
121,Overpriced,"Foyer, building and gardens are lovely but hides the poor rooms. Our room was supposed to be an executive room but the room was tired, poor water pressure and incorrect shower head. There was some Mould on shower screen and threadbare carpet. Our dirty glasses were not  cleared and tea coffee etc not replenished when room was serviced.
The restaurant could not cope with the amount of people going for breakfast. In one morning there was a queue from the restaurant into the foyer waiting for a table. We queued for over 25 mins for a table yet the hotel was not full. Good breakfast choice but the cooked food was barelyLuke warm.",2,2024,03,25
121,"Can be described in just one word ""Excellent""","Overall awesome !! from all angels the experience is fantastic - the location, the facility, the service, employee attitude, willingness to assist, location, you think of any factor you will only have positive comments. Truly Taj means the Super Service!! Whatever they do is always the best. I had my Russian Colleague with me in my last trip with me. She was not sure when I recommended Taj Hotel, but after the stay she too have become a permeant guest of Taj wherever available.",5,2024,03,25
121,Great Experience at the Taj St. James,"With its warm hospitality, vibrant lobby, and perfect location, St. James Taj was a perfect choice for our family. The staff is friendly, the service is top-notch! The gentleman at the concierge desk ( wish I could recall his name) was very knowledgeable about all things London! We followed his advice which resulted in us getting a really close view of the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace without having to line up hours in advance! This hotel is a 5-minute walk to the Underground stop, very convenient if you are looking to do a lot of sightseeing. The neighborhood is rather quiet, maybe not ideal if you are looking for nightlife nearby.
We had dinner and breakfast at the TH_51 restaurant located in the hotel. The food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the vegetarian Thai curry!  The lobby bar often hosts events for outside guests, which makes it a vibrant space to grab a drink after a long day of sightseeing and absorbing the flavors of London!
We stayed in the Executive King Room. The room is a nice-sized space, well decorated and comfortable. The rooms and the hallways are showing age. There is renovation work ongoing, which was Not particularly noisy during our stay. The courtyard is a beautiful and quiet space.
The Taj offers a glimpse into Indian hospitality and warmth in the heart of London!",5,2024,03,23
121,"Great Stay, Great Service, Great Location","My son and I stayed here for four nights, and it was fantastic. We found an excellent price on Agoda and sprung to pay a little bit extra for daily breakfast, which turned out to be worth it. Our stay was not without flaws; however, the benefits all outweighed the flaws. We arrived around 10 PM, and they said that our room was not quite ready that they needed to fix something so they sent us to the restaurant and they comped us dinner. This actually worked out really well for us because we had not yet eaten dinner, and it was getting quite late. We had a great dinner in their main restaurant. The room itself was very comfortable and clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfy. The room had great blackout curtains. We quickly figured out that the problem that they needed to resolve was most likely that the bathroom flooded, wetting the carpet. Everything was dry when we arrived, but there was always a musty smell near the entrance to the room and the bathroom. The main part of the room did not smell at all, and everything else more than made up for it. We also noticed they are doing renovations, so hopefully they are resolving any leak issues. The shower has one of those half doors that are not necessarily the most watertight, so I could see why flooding might be a problem from time to time. We were very vigilant about how we use the shower, so all was fine. The staff was exceedingly helpful. Everyone was so warm and friendly and attentive. Breakfast we pre-paid for was a combination of a buffet with the opportunity to order two entries off the menu. Two entrées would’ve been way too much food for us so we never ordered more than one. My favorite was the dosa. Finally, the location of this hotel is great. It is centrally located, and it is very close to the St. James Park underground station, making travel anywhere very convenient. We took the underground everywhere we went with the exception of a very long walk on our first day and taking a bus on the final day merely for the experience of it. There are many restaurants located nearby and of course London is full of fantastic dining options. We would absolutely stay here again.",5,2024,03,18
121,Amazing,"Our experience at this hotel was amazing. Pratvita checked us in early on arrival with no fuss and into an amazing room. The room itself was clean, spacious and fully equipped. Breakfast was amazing. All the food was so fresh and tasty. Fatima helped us pick which meals to order and was so attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. Would definitely come back.",5,2024,03,17
121,Lovely room and reception staff. Disaster breakfast service and late night room service,"We stayed at the Taj this weekend to celebrate our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade to a junior executive suite which was very comfortable. The front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating and made us feel very welcome. Unfortunately, a late night order of room service was truly awful - a club sandwich and a burger, pretty standard fare, at an eye watering 30 pounds a piece. The burger was tough and bland, the chips undercooked, the salad undressed. The club sandwich was even worse, flabby, lacking in flavour, with the same undercooked chips and undressed salad. If it hadn’t been 2am I would have sent it back, but we were exhausted and needed to sleep. 

We wake up to go down to breakfast on Saturday morning, included in our booking, to find an enormous queue of guests and a chaotic system to assign tables for people who have been waiting for who knows how long. We have been waiting for 20 minutes and counting. Frankly, the inability to 1) provide decent room service and 2) provide a functioning breakfast service are a serious indictment of this hotel and it’s overinflated prices. We won’t be returning.",3,2024,03,17
121,Amazing hospitality - thanks!,"I have been a guest of this Taj property and Buckingham gate 51 right next door, which is also a Taj property for over a decade now and have stayed in every category of room including their cinema suite.

We have had the good fortune of staying in world class properties including Cheval blanc’s, Soneva’s, Aman’s and almost all the Taj palace properties in India. These properties have given us a deep appreciation of what exceptional service feels like and in London, there are many great options. 

However, we are here again despite those many choices, because this property offers everything we are looking for - great location near the Buckingham Palace and hospitality.  

Hospitality done with genuine care is rare to find even at the very best of hotels, but Mrs. Sunaina Soares here does exactly that time and time again and consistently. I have known her for her exceptional care and service for about a decade and she is one of the main reasons my wife and I keep coming back to these Taj properties. She exemplifies what Taj hospitality should feel like to every guest and is world class by any measure. 

Thank you!",5,2024,03,14
121,Exceeded expectations!,"I had high expectations of this hotel, given its location and cost and it exceeded them significantly!  I was very fortunate to be upgraded.     Just a fab experience from start to finish. The staff were incredibly attentive and the food (I had in room dining as I was working) was excellent. The location is great and facilities fab!  Certainly will consider booking this hotel for my next trip.",5,2024,03,14
121,Highly recommend,"We loved our stay at St.James' Court,  A Taj Hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The airport lost our luggage, the hotel was very helpful and understanding. The complimentary breakfast was truly amazing and delicious. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The location was very close to several attractions.",5,2024,03,13
121,Poor customer service.,"Customer service was awful. Checkin was long and impersonal, long queue for breakfast then service. Table dirty, had to remind staff to take order. Food plain, staff too busy to care for guests. Room service wanted paying in full despite swiping card at check-in.
Overall very impersonal from beginning to end.",2,2024,03,10
121,Great Stay at St. James' Court.,"I recently stayed at St. James' Court while attending business meetings and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

The hotel is beautiful and is centrally located. The staff were friendly, welcoming and provided a high quality of service.  My room was spacious and stylish, and the bed was very comfortable.

The breakfast buffet had a lot to offer and was very good. Overall the service was very good; Smruti in particular provided exceptional service .",4,2024,03,09
121,Family time with my daughter,The hotel is beautiful. The staff is wonderful. The rooms were spacious and stylish. All the amendities you need. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet had a lot to offer and very good. Close to Buckingham Place and the under ground rail train . Enjoy!’,5,2024,03,08
121,OK,"Food quality is not at par with Indian standard, Paratha and other Indian stuff at BF menu was so pathetic as looks it was outsourced, order from menu was better and have authentic taste in breakfast. They shd always differentiate between guest travelling from outside UK who looks for traditional taste from india and regular local customer.... i just stayed here for the betetr indian vegetarian food and my plan was flop.",2,2024,03,07
121,"Amazing Stay at St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel","We have been staying at this amazing hotel, St. James' Court , A Taj Hotel in central London, only a stones throw away from Buckingham Palace, on many occasions and we consider this hotel as our second home.

As we have been coming here regularly, we obviously get to know most of the staff and they make us feel very comfortable indeed. 

We would like to thank ALL the staff at the hotel for looking after us during our visit last weekend, which they helped, make it extra special and in particular we would like to mention the following staff.

Sunaina and her team members Jenny, Prativa and Anuja in reception.

Restaurant staff - Samriddh Taneja, Mayank, Mukesh, Shubham, Sue, Smruti, Aritha, Deepa and the rest of the wonderful, courteous staff.

William and rest of the Concierge team.

Finally, special thanks to Victoria.

We look forward to our next visit in the not too distant future.",5,2024,03,06
121,Nice hotel,"This was a very nice hotel with good service from the staff.
It is a shame that this hotel has succumbed to what seems to be common across London now with the dreaded service charges.
The  discretionary 5% service charge added to the accommodation bill and 12.5% charge to all food and beverage services is wrong. We asked for it to be taken off which it was but then you feel awful because staff obviously expect it. But all the service charges add up to a significant additional cost to the consumer for no additional benefit.",4,2024,03,05
121,Lovely hotel and brilliant staff,"Amazing location, lovely clean hotel with a very classy ambiance.

The room was large and had the most comfortable bed and pillows you just sink into. Very nice touch with welcome chocolates.

We used the spa facilities and were so relaxed we fell asleep 😊

The breakfast was incredible- gorgeous coffees and fresh fruit. 

The staff were so friendly, everyone took the time to talk when they saw you and the attention to detail was first class. 

Thank you for such a lovely stay, and we can’t wait for our next visit.",5,2024,03,04
121,Good experience with opportunity to better,"You need to improve your lifts (elevators).  A long wait was required every time I wanted to use it  More lifts are required for a hotel of this magnitude.  Not sure whether other lifts were under maintenance

The Gym needs to be upgraded.  Some of the machines needed repairs",4,2024,03,04
121,Best place to stay in London . East meets West,"It was a wonderful experience. The hotel itself, the staff and the ambiance totally first rate. It is located in the heart of London near Buckingham Palace. The hotel itself is quirky in terms of its Victorian architecture. The rooms are first rate ! The restaurant and the quality of staff and food variety second to none.",5,2024,03,02
121,Wonderful experience - TAJ living up to its high standards!,"Amazing experience, best in class. Great hotel, room and service!

121,City Mini Break - Ticks all the Boxes!,"Excellent from start to finish - highly recommend St James' Court Taj Hotel - second time there. Food is Fabulous and staff are wonderful. The rooms are so modern and clean. 
The hotel is so central to all the main attractions and shopping. The palace is just a five minute walk from the hotel. It is our second time to stay at St James' Court. There will be a third!",5,2024,02,29
121,Not the experience we had hoped for,"We are a group of 5  (3 rooms booked) celebrating 2 birthdays. I phoned ahead and explained it was 2 birthdays  and could I have a cake or bottle of wine left in one of the rooms and to charge it to me. The hotel looks lovely on arrival. The door man is there as the taxi pulls up to greet you. The lobby looked clean friendly bright and lovely. Then you get hit with an over powering (way to heavy) smell of jasmine. The others arrived before us and had checked everyone in. They were very excited to say we had been upgraded. We came up to our rooms. All three rooms were on the same floor but very far apart. My room was besides the lift. (Yes you can hear the lifts and anyone walking by) there was foil confetti outside my door and inside my room on the carpet. The rooms were not what we had hoped for or expected. All three of them. I have the biggest room. Great dressing area. Apart from the confetti clean and tidy. Not big rooms at all. Bathrooms great. Clean tidy & more modern than the rooms. My air con, was unusable incredibly whiny Clanky noisy. The outside is all rusted looking brown and dirty. So goodness know what it’s blowing out. The bed big comfy clean. Pillows were good too. I am obviously above the trains or tubes.  Hear that a lot at night. You hear the rumbling & Room shakes when  they go by (that’s how it feels when you’re in bed). Then every hour I have a terrible pipe gurgling noise. It builds momentum before it stops. As for my view! What view. But pipes and offices. Oh and no bottle of wine or cake in the room for the Birthday. If this is upgraded I dread to think what our original rooms were like. After our night out I did tell reception my concerns. On the first night. When we got back to our rooms at 11pm there had been cakes left. To late! Still no wine. Still confetti on my carpet. Bed was comfy pipes, lift noise did not allow for a good sleep. Only enough milk and sugar for one cup of tea in my room. I originally posted this review then decided to take it off to edit it. In the short time it was originally on, it had been seen. I was contacted the next day by the reception manager. A very nice lady. We were out for most of the day so I couldn’t speak to her until we returned later that afternoon. We were in a rush for our next adventure. She very kindly apologised & she did offer to change all our rooms and move us but we didn’t have time as we were out again that evening and as we were leaving the next morning there was no point. They did give us a free round of drinks and a bottle of wine for the rooms. And they did refund some off each room. Which I thought was very nice. I was also given her card and asked to contact her and to give them another try. We agreed we would as there is another part of the hotel which does look beautiful. I did contact her. Twice. I waited but i never heard back. Which is a shame. Apparently the old part of the hotel overlooks the courtyard is beautiful with beautiful rooms and views. Such a  shame we didn’t get to experience that part or had the experience we had hoped for. I didn’t know at the time either that the other rooms were far worse than mine. Both had broken toilet seats? (How is that not seen when the rooms are cleaned) one of the rooms was full of fruit flies and one of the showers hardly worked. The rest of my party didn’t tell me about this at the time as I had been the one to choose and recommend the hotel and one of the birthdays was mine & they didn’t want to ruin it ,
My weekend in London was a wonderful time. Just not the hotel part. I’m glad we didn’t let that stop us all having fun. I can’t recommend this hotel on the part we stayed in but I have heard the older part that overlooks the courtyard is lovely so if you do book ask for that part and hopefully you will have the wonderful experience we had hope for but didn’t get.",3,2024,02,27
121,Excellent staff and service.,"I must say its an excellent hotel.  The we stayed 2 night (B&B).
The breakfast was amazing.  Could not fault the staff either.  They were very helpful.
Prativa and Mojtaba  at thee reception were amazingly  helpful and made our stay memorable.
Will definitely be coming back here.
Thank you.

121,Old world charm with Indian hospitality,"Great hotel with an excellent location, just 5 mins walking distance from BuckinghamPalace. An interesting combination of Victorian charm coupled with Indian hospitality, or Tajness as they call it. It has 2 very renowned restaurants- Quilon and House of Minh, and both are must try, with prior reservations else you will not be able to find a place.

Being an old property, some of the rooms need significant renovation and uplift to ensure everything is working, but if you are in one of the renovated rooms, they are as best as any Taj hotel. The sleep quality is great, and the rooms in general are spacious. They use Molton Brown toiletries, so no complaints on that front. 

One area of significant improvement would be the staff. I think this hotel also faces the challenge across London of finding a good workforce, and hence this issue. If you are a Taj regular, you will immediately be able to spot the difference in the quality of service being offered, and the professionalism reflected, at the front office, restaurant, room service and housekeeping. 

When back in London, I would definitely come back, to get a real taste of being in India, while in London.",3,2024,02,21
121,very good experience,"stay was pleasant, people are very kind and friendly. In Th51 everybody is kind, Kunal, Ibad are very kind and helpful. atmosphere is lively and good in the dining hall.

121,Wonderful Experience at Taj St James Court,"This was our first time experience at the hotel and I can say it was really fantastic. As we arrived early at the hotel , I can say much early then the check in time. But the staff at the front office was very polite and courteous and specially Miss Prativa Chettri as she accepted our early check In and even she offered us room upgrade also. I can say her hospitality at the best. Overall the experience at the Taj St James Court was fantastic. I would recommend everyone to go and experience the hospitality of Taj St James court.

However I cant add the last and the 3rd reason, and which is House of Ming, wonderful Chesnut dish and the lemon desert was the best of the best dish I had during my entire stay in London.",5,2024,02,12
121,Excellent stay,"We had a great stay and we were sorry to leave we wished that we had booked for another night. 
 The staff were very friendly, professional, attentive the level of service was exceptional.
The young lady on reception who checked us in and checked us out apologies we didn’t catch her name which we are embarrassed about but I’m sure you could check who was on shift from our details. She was lovely a real asset to the hotel.
Bar staff, doormen, waiting staff in the breakfast restaurant and the Chinese were all very pleasant
Chambermaids did a first class job in the hotel keeping it spotless
Excellent job all round",5,2024,02,10
121,Wonderful!,"Wonderful service, excellent standard of room, we got a room upgrade as first time staying. Beds very comfy! Excellent stay, we had dinner at the house of Ming, which honestly was one of the best meals of our lives. Then popped next door to the hotel bar where a pianist was playing. Would love to go back, couldn’t rate it more highly.",5,2024,02,08
121,Amazing stay,"I have the most beautiful 2 night stay. I stayed here 4 years ago and had the most wonderful time and my 2nd trip did not disappoint. Amazing location, ambience and the staff can not do enough. The bedding was so comfy. I had the best massage of my life at the spa. Thank you so much- I will be back for a 3rd stay!",5,2024,02,07
121,The kindest hotel staff in London,"I came here for business trip for only a night but the staff treated me like somebody who spends the whole week there. I haven't got this experience in any hotel in London and I go to London once a months. The hotel is beautiful I've got a  suite what I definitely haven't got before and I felt like royalty. I had an amazing sleep, I checked the mattress in the morning because my back loved it and I had a really good night sleep, I might buy the mattress for my home! I can't express my thankfulness enough for the treatment that I received from the hotel staff. I will definitely come back a lot on my business trips. I also loved the spa part it was really cute and relaxing and the smell in the spa wow it was amaziing!! Keep up the good work you are all amazing thank you so so much.",5,2024,02,06
121,Super stay,"I absolutely love staying at St James Taj. The location is fantastic, rooms are comfy and quiet, but it's the staff makes it special, everyone is always so polite, helpful, and welcoming. 

As a woman often traveling alone for business, I always feel safe and comfortable when I stay here. Also,  love the delicious dosa / idly breakfast options.",5,2024,02,06
121,Very pleasant hotel,"Overall a very good experience. Sauna and steam room facilities are good. Nice breakfast, though a bit slow to offer tea and coffee. Clean and suitably equipped hotel room. Concierge was helpful.
The scent of incense in the reception/lobby is too strong though, quite overpowering and not pleasant. This is ok in the rest of the hotel though.",4,2024,02,04
121,Enjoyable experience,"Always enjoy our stay at Taj St James Court, from the friendly service of Diego assisting us with our luggage to the amazing service during our stay. Breakfast is always delicious and the room is stocked up with all the essential amenities. Thank you Taj, for lovely stay every time!",5,2024,02,03
121,Relaxed and friendly stay!,"Lovely relaxed stay. Everyone was so friendly, welcoming, helpful and kind. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast excellent, extensive choice and relaxed atmosphere. It was nice not to have to rush down by 9am! Will definitely stay here again!",5,2024,02,03
121,Underwhelming,"This hotel is not anywhere near the standard one would expect. The rooms are poorly heated, facilities such as the shower poorly maintained, as well as items such as the iron not inspected to see if clean/serviceable. These are the basics. While other things may be to a good standard, the basic requirements of a hotel are missed. Completely inadequate for such a premium hotel. 

Clearly there is no concept of customer focus and no idea what guests need. Having a changing room and sauna available only after 0900, for example, is completely useless for guests travelling on business. Very poor, I'm afraid.",1,2024,02,03
121,Fabulous stay,Great location. Rooms were huge. I can't explain how friendly the staff are. Can't wait to go back. We were also given a free room upgrade. Breakfast was really good. Bar staff really friendly. No faults anywhere. We will return again as we visit London regularly.,5,2024,02,03
121,Wonderful experience!!,"My experience was fantastic. The concierge desk is one of the best of the Taj group of hotels. My two favourites were Prativa at the front desk who was very polite, kind and very helpful and Aburaj at the courtyard restaurant who gave us superb service and went out of the way to make our meals so memorable. Both of them leading examples of the exceptional customer service one expects. They truly uphold the core values of the Taj group. We will surely return.",5,2024,01,30
121,Memorable experience,"Excellent hospitality really loved our stay. 
Highly recommend to all. We also had food in their restaurant it also taste so good. Also enjoyed other aminities such as jacuzzi, steam, sauna. Although jacuzzi water was not so hot it was warm at that time but overall experience was really nice and we thoroughly enjoyed and loved it. They made our stay special and memorable.",5,2024,01,30
121,A touch of luxury and unparalleled Class!,"Where do I begin...From the onset St. James Court leaves a long lasting impression of British Heritage combined with true Indian hospitality which is synonymous to the world's leading Hotel Brand- Taj. The first look at the stunning façade of this listed heritage building leaves you gasping for more. A stone's throw from the nearest Tube station (St. James's Park) this stunning hotel provides easy access and is situated in one to the safest neighborhoods of Central London. With Buckingham Palace less than 400 meters away, you are not short of the daily buzz of the forever flocking tourists in the area. However one step inside the hotel and you can feel the calm and soothing sounds of the background music as you make your way to the check in desks at the reception. Thoroughly attentive concierge and bell staff ease your stress by taking your luggage away instantly while another member of their team personally escorts you to the reception where we were greeted with the brightest of smiles from the Front office staff. 

We were made to feel extremely welcomed by the front office manager Sunaina Soares. Her warm welcome and bright smile made our travel tiredness vanish instantly. The check in was instant and we were handed the keys to our Suite alongside essential info for dinning and spa facilities. Our suite was on the 6th floor and the luggage was delivered instantly too without us waiting or chasing. 

The suite itself was situated in the newly renovated wing of the hotel overlooking a beautiful courtyard with a stunning fountain in the middle. The lights and a massive floating chandelier made this courtyard even more breathtaking in the evening. Our rooms was nothing less than stunning. I had informed the hotel that we were arriving for our Anniversary weekend, and certainly made us feel special by decorating the room and leaving us a nice card with warm wishes from the housekeeping team. 

The breakfast in the morning was exactly what I would expect from the Taj property. A lavish spread with tonnes of choice catering to all kinds of palates: Continental, full English, Indian, healthy choices, cold cuts of meat, never ending spread of pastry, juices and smoothies. Over all it was a fantastic breakfast. 

I would like to thank the whole team (especially Sunaina) for making our stay so memorable. I will highly recommend this hotel and look forward to coming back again. 

thank you Team St. James' Court!",5,2024,01,29
121,An Exceptional Hotel!,"We stayed here to celebrate our anniversary and everything was absolutely perfect, from the staff, to the rooms to the amenities. The staff in general were excellent and were all super friendly and very welcoming. A special mention for Sunaina who was brilliant from the get go! She went above and beyond to make our stay so special and we really can’t say enough good things about her. She was very knowledgeable and attentive and if there was any slight issue, she would rectify it straight away. Geetika at reception was also great and helped us so much throughout the stay. The room was immaculate as was the spa. Additionally the breakfast each morning was superb and again all of the staff were great, including Jibin who was lovely! All in all, everything, down to every detail, was exceptional. We can’t stop recommending The Taj to everyone and will definitely be back soon!",5,2024,01,29
121,Out of this world! Just Amazing!,"We had a fantastic stay!

Amazing customer service  started with the very first interaction with Sherol at reception, she gave first class customer service, so friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming.

Then the room! Stunning, newly renovated, the decor was beautiful, very classy & stylish.

We were celebrating my daughter’s birthday, the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay very special decorating the room!

We used the spa before we left and this was so lovely, the facilities were really good and it was spotlessly clean!

Courtyard garden was so beautifully decorated!

Thank-you so much! We will be back & have found a new favourite brand!!",5,2024,01,28
121,A Wonderful Taj experience,"Very excellent stay, really enjoyed both the rooms nd the amnesties offered by the home, Looking forward for my next say in 2 weeks. Amazing location also, just 200Mtr from Buckingham Palace and in a very safe and quiet area.",5,2024,01,22
121,Very nice overnight stay in London,"Very nice Hotel, extraordinary breakfast. Very modern deluxe room. The only problems were a disfunctional air condition and a broken refrigerator. But both was solved immediately by a technician. We will come back. Thanks.",5,2024,01,18
121,"Central location, but all in all a let down","Went to London with my wife, stayed for three nights.

The room was a bit old and needs an upgrade and a scrub... We sound the last guests food in the fridge and there was something nasty on the bathroom door.

Someone wrote further down that they saw a rat running through the lobby. We can confirm, but it was a mouse.

A strange experience walking through the lobby on our second day. Maybe 12 people working, and none acknowledged us. Some of the employees was on their private phones and talking to each other and laughing.

Breakfast was very good, and the staff were great. 

Another disappointing thing was when they closed the bar at 11:30, even though they were suppose to have it open until 12:00.

For the price you could easily find another hotel with good location and better rooms. Will not come back.",3,2024,01,18
121,1st Class and Above The Rest! ," It's going to be hard not to make this review sound too emotional, but it needs to be said! 

St James' Court Hotel is how you run a hotel!

5 of us stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. 

We received the warmest welcome from the doormen and front of house reception when we arrived. 

Our bedrooms and bathrooms 
were immaculate.  My daughter's room was decorated with treats, rose petals and a tasteful Happy Birthday banner, a dessert, and a bottle of Prosecco. Seriously, wow!!

 Staff went over and way above to make sure our stay was special. The spa and pool were beautiful. 
Breakfast was amazing. Everything you could possibly want. 

Every member of the concierge, reception, manangement, restaurant, bar, housekeeping, spa teams were helpful, well mannered, and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. 

We have stayed in a few hotels, and no other hotel has come anywhere close to St James' Court Hotel.

If you want a hotel which is filled with friendly, smiley, helpful staff. Gorgeous  food and immaculate well equipped rooms and facilities, then book St James' Court Hotel. 

We won't stay anywhere else when we come to London. 

Thank you for the special memories!

121,Lovely Hotel,"Great staff, wonderful ambiance, beautiful surroundings. The hotel staff went above and beyond. There were treats for the kids as well.

I loved the hotel and my kids loved it too.",5,2024,01,09

However, this time is very different as the service in Taj London is very bad and I would not recommend anyone to stay here.",1,2024,01,05
121,"Great vibe and tajness, becoming exceedingly 3xpensive, location ok ","Great hotel. Amazing christmas decor. Fab check in exp. Loved the tajness aur in London - ended up staying for 10 nights which was not our initial plan. Was lovely during the Christmas time and the sit out area is just great. Taj chambers relatively small but good. 

Not so great on location and service. Becoming exceedingly expensive over years... needs to seriously rethink pricing strategy. F and B team v stretched",4,2024,01,03
121,Don't bother,"Not worth the money. In fact, there was nothing great to say about his place. For example, being a light sleeper, I requested on 3 separate occasions, a room away from lifts. What do we get? A room right across from one. Beyond this, the place is run down. Carpets in the hallways are torn, split and/or dirty in several places. There is a couch as you exit the lift on the first floor that is so dirty, I would be hard pressed to even sit on it.  Our shower leaked under the shower door and soaked the bathroom floor as well and I don't mean a little water, it poured out of the bottom of the door . I did talk to the front desk about the shower door and the fact that our requests were not met, nothing was done about either. In fact, I took a video of the water pouring out the boots of the door and was told it would be fixed, it was not. Another example, one night we wanted to have a drink in the lobby area before heading out to dinner, we walked up to the bar to order and a rather unfriendly bartender told us to sit and he would send someone over for our order, we waited 15 minutes and no one came so we left. These sorts of things are little perhaps to some but honestly it was one huge disappointment. Don't waste your time or money as there are several other properties in the area that are better. ",2,2024,01,02
121,Good but not best,"Not value for money

121,Great location for a Christmas holiday,"Great location, very festive for the holidays, great onsite breakfast, excellent free spa amenities including sauna, steam room, warm pool.

121,"Ok i was mistaken! This is not a Taj, and the GM has a lot to fix here!","It’s the 3rd day of our stay and we still have 4 more days to go, and somewhere i just want this trip to end fast. 

So here with a lot of thought and caution i put down my thoughts and experiences so far.

1. To begin with getting hold of the duty manager to resolve sanitary issues was not possible. Multiple calls later I’m still waiting to hear from them. Exhausted i tried to get in contact with the GM, but the staff outright rejected my request. 

I have personally met GM’s from other Taj palaces and properties and two people come to my mind Mr. Samrat Dutta and Mr Veer Vijay Singh, who were hands on the deck kind of leaders and reaching them never felt like i needed to be a VIP to have a word with them. Thats customer service at its finest. This hotel surely lacks that and yes my sink is still flooded while i type this :-)

2. Staff should be taught to represent the brand and not indulge in self promotion. I humbly appreciate that upgrades are a privilege but while checking in, i don’t appreciate that the only take away is that discretionary authority of that individual has bestowed on the guests a rare privilege. Im happy to be moved to a room for which I initially intended as long as it is clean, does not smell and feel humid, has a sink which is not a mini swimming pool and at least i have a shower/ bath gel. Past three days we are using the shampoo as a make shift bath gel. Lol. We let it slide because we love this brand, but three days are enough for them to have addressed this issue.

3.The breakfast time is chaotic and i can sense most staff are doing their best, but is their best good enough for the service levels and quality we are used to in India? Most often our orders are delayed and some staff can be seen engaging with a select few and for the other guests i could see complacency towards their requests. Since when has IHCL turning into a privileged club kind of a setup? Our water and coffee ordered two days back is still pending :-)

4. For the restaurant Quilon, we were served a sour frozen mango lassi and it felt like “oops are we just gonna ruin our christmas dinner”, as a fine dining takes care to ensure all dishes and beverages on the menu are fine and should be served at the right temperature. If we wanted an ice cream we would have gone to an ice cream parlour. Food was ok and dessert list should be looked into as it just ruined our palette. Well it was just a mediocre experience and BKC via uber eats was much better the other day.

We visited london for christmas and new year with our 15 month baby. We just feel that the staff is under pressure and let it go for the first few days, but i think im more sad to see how much below par the service standards are. We are without a bath robe for two days and would love to see it in our room before we checkout. Lol.

The only two stars for the rating are for Milda and the gentleman serving us the wonderful masala chai (sorry i forgot his name). Only two genuine smiles i found in st james court. Rest are all just patronising ones!

Well may be with this post we are no longer welcome here, but the fact remains we are more disappointed than the staff here at st james. @Mrs Avari, maam i feel this incident is not in isolation and reading a few more reviews there is indeed a lot that needs to be improved.",2,2023,12,27
121,Great location & lovely staff,"Magical courtyard at Christmas time. Staff are lovely and location perfect for a quiet stay accessible to all the hustle and bustle that London offers. 

Long wait for breakfast was unfortunate. Breakfast is a really good spread of indian and western and proves to be popular so when the hotel is busy there is a wait over 15 minutes at times which ought to be solved by the F&B team. We don't want ""angry"" guests. ",5,2023,12,27
121,"Beautiful property, nice breakfast and great staff","Great experience, high level of service, beautiful breakfast area and loved the spa amenities! I should have written this review earlier but time got ahead... Special thank you to Nishi, Jenny, and SoHyeun(?) at the front desk - all very professional. The staff really make an effort to ensure everyone has a nice stay, thank you!  ",5,2023,12,25
121,Best hotel to stay in London,"One of the best hotels in central London. Clean, premium rooms are modern, the staff are very helpful, breakfast is great for Indians, masala tea has definitely improved, walking distance to most attractions. Victoria tube station 5 minute walk away. Buckingham Palace 5 minutes away. London does have some good classy hotels, but this is easy when arriving at London Victoria. Takes 10 minutes from the station to the hotel by foot. Jiva Spa is amazing.",5,2023,12,24
121,Best experience Ever,The bed and shower was absolutely magnificent. The. best I have ever had at any hotels I have stayed in the past. The staff was impeccable from the time we arrived and met William and Diego especially. they were very attentive and so professional.,5,2023,12,21
121,"Terrible Taj, more like Lame court not James Court in ","The experience was a disaster, from checking us in a room that had chipped sink, a tiny bed, to charging us £5 for empty plates (never seen that one before) to their check out process at desk was just a  humiliating experience. 

They implied that was a liar when I told them I got locked out my room when I was at the spa and requested the spa to get my room key to work as I couldn’t go to the reception because I was in my robe.

 The process took so long and they blamed me for a late check out and then right before my eyes a lady called Sherol cross checked my story right in front of me by ringing up the spa and verifying everything I said. For a check out that wasn’t even beyond an hour. 

Sherol was perhaps the most arrogant employee, it felt like talking to an employee at a run down pub. When I told her there will be a review she said do it! So I am. Eventually they didn’t charge me for a late check out but their service and property is terrible, do not waste your money. ",1,2023,12,21
121,A hotel experience done well - very well,"This was our first time staying here and it won’t be the last. We had such a lovely stay and there were a number of things about it that deserve a mention. 

The welcome both on the door and subsequently checking-in was lovely. The family room was great and the beds super comfy. The bathroom was unusually sizeable and the only minor disappointment was the power of the shower being a little weak. The towels were super soft and it was great having so many soaps and amenities such as razors on-hand. Generally, the attention to detail was really good and head and shoulders above comparable hotels. 

Breakfast was lovely and some of the Indian a la carte dishes authentically Indian. The quality of the food is up there with the best restaurants in India. 

Putting the food aside, the standout thing about this hotel is its staff. The staff are happy and smiling, professional and courteous. They cannot do enough to help. They are just sensational and a credit to the management and owners. Wow. Other hotels should take a look so as to learn what makes a hotel special. 

Well done. Standout service.",4,2023,12,19
121,Attentive and detail-oriented staff! A reminder that the best experiences come from attentive and caring staff.,"As a solo traveler, I felt very cared for during my time at the Taj. Every question was answered with attention and care. From check-in to check-out, the Taj exceeded every expectation I could have in a hotel. Very clean room, a comfortable bed, and hotel slippers to greet you. 

First, the Christmas lights at the entrance are so impressive and beautiful. Second, my favorite thing about this hotel is ordering hot and fresh Indian food for room service and even being able to order specialized Indian breakfast dishes outside the continental. The selling points here are the professional staff and immaculate and VERY tasty food outside of the usual British food. When I had questions about certain Indian dishes, the staff answered each question with immense expertise and care. 

Again, I have to say, the staff is simply the best here -- unparalleled. Personally, as I spoke to the staff, I said that I plan to be married soon and they gave me their congratulations and sincere thoughts about my next life stepping stone. To that end, I will be back with my husband at the Taj VERY soon! ",5,2023,12,18
121,Relaxing business stay,My room was not ready on arrival at 1800 but the staff were welcoming and gave me a complimentary dinner.  I always look forward to coming to the Taj as the cleanliness is outstanding and the staff are ready to help and ensure that your stay is perfect.,5,2023,12,18
121,Don't do it. Cheaper and better options in London.,"Very bad customer service.  I would say it doesn't exist.  We waited 5 hours for a cot for our 1.5-year-old son, because an additional bed for an adult was placed in the room.  3 phone calls and two visits to the reception, only a conversation with the manager resolved the situation.  I think it's shameful in a hotel where a night costs over 400 pounds, they tried to tell us that they don't have such beds.  At the end of our stay, we were told that due to the situation, they were canceling the service charge, which should have been voluntary, and the hotel added it to the bill as if it were an obligation.  Additionally, the hotel charges a deposit of £100, I have never encountered this before.  Additionally, the path from the reception to the higher standard rooms looks through an abandoned building.  Dirty walls, dirty old carpets, dirty door frames, it's more like a £20 a night hotel.  I don't know how this hotel can cost almost £1000 for a weekend. We.had to request room cleaning as well ad nobody show up untill 6pm.",1,2023,12,11
121,Don’t bother.,"Smells bad, ordinary food, noisy and too expensive for what it is. Woken up by house keeping early in the morning on 3 occasions (forgot to use the “do not disturb” on those days)  The rooms are ok though.",2,2023,12,10
121,London Theatre /Show Break..,We have stayed at the Taj 4 times and have always been so impressed. This time we were given a suite and it was so beautiful we were looked after from the moment we arrived by Marina and all the wonderful staff to the time we left. Breakfast was outstanding and we will be coming back in April couldn't reccomend them enough!,5,2023,12,09
121,This is not an offshoot of the Taj Mumbai or the Taj Group of Hotels,"From the time you enter to the time you exit - the service, the quality of the rooms, dining, vibe etc was terrible. Never going to stay here again. Please remove the Indian flag. Your hotel is a disgrace to the flag.

121,Wah Taj ! ,"Wah Taj ! Living up to its standard like always . Thank you for making my stay so comfortable and making me feel so at home . Starting from caring staff , the warm yummy meals , the neat rooms to back to after long days to the fast formality check outs . Not to miss the next level meal at the House of Ming ! ",4,2023,12,08
121,Disappointed,Pre cover we stayed at the St james Taj on number of occasions.  Based on this visit  the hotel has lost its edge.  The service you might expect considering its supposed rating and costs were not there.,2,2023,12,06
121,Extremely disappointed,"Check in. It took 20mins for us to be seen by check in staff at reception and a further 15mins to check us in on Saturday. I cannot see any reason why it should take 15mins to check us in. All that needed to be done was to fill in my partners details, scan my credit card and to sign a form.

- Heating. On Saturday the outside temperature was as low at -4. Due to this I was expecting to enter our room 419 and be instantly warmed. This was not the case. We put the heating up to 32degrees and it was only around 2 hours later that the room really began to heat up. I appreciate it is a very old building with large rooms but the heating should have been turned on in our room a little earlier.

- Breakfast was extremely disappointing. Upon arriving we were told a 30minute wait. Once seated no one took our breakfast or coffee order. I then proceeded to ask three separate staff members before we were finally able to order. The breakfast room was chaos. It was beyond stressful and certainly not the relaxing, enjoyable breakfast you would expect at such a hotel. I appreciate that it is a small breakfast room and a very large hotel but surely there is a better system that could be put in place. For a 5 star hotel I would not expect to have to flag someone down and to ask for the following; to order (three times), water (twice), teaspoons, sugar, salt and pepper and cutlery. This should all be on the table or given when our hot drinks/food.

- Check out. After queuing for 20mins I decided to pop my card in the express check out box. I attempted to ask a staff member if this was ok but was ignored.

To conclude I am extremely disappointed with my stay at the Taj Hotel. It was my husbands birthday and we have a young baby at home. It was our first getaway just the two of us in some time and it should have been an opportunity to sit back and relax. Unfortunately that couldn’t have been further from the truth.

I have emailed the hotel and am yet to receive 
 a response",2,2023,12,06
121,Do not go there,"Whole experience was terrible except reception. Guys at the reception was really nice. 
None of the things were like on the web page.
We were, at some oler part where bathroom was like failed DIY project. Room was nothing like on any of the pictures. Was cold, TV was not working, but promises about ppl coming and fixing was constant. 
Location is amazing.
Breakfast is a hectic chaos and waiting on coffee is unbelievable. 

I mean, if you have extra money and you are sadist you will stay at this place.",1,2023,12,05
121,"First stay at this hotel, will be unlikely to stay again, but never say never!","The room wasn’t ready when we arrived at 4.00pm so check in was a slow process. It was my wife’s 40th birthday which I’d let the hotel know in advance. There was no reference to this whatsoever during the stay. We frequently stay in hotels for celebrations and there is usually some sort of recognition, however small. This was disappointing. 
The room was ok, the basin didn’t drain away, this was reported but nothing was done to fix it, we let the hotel know for a second time when we checked out, it’s not nice brushing your teeth/shaving and not being able to get rid of the water for a considerable period of time. The bath and shower worked. 
Only 1 USB port on the room which didn’t work, again this was reported to a member of the team and reminded them at check out. Frustrating when you’re in central London and the rooms aren’t cheap. 
The bed was very comfortable, TV was ok but unable to play radio through it. A good range of tea and coffee making facilities. 
Breakfast was chaotic, it took 15 minutes to be seated and another 20 minutes for anyone to take out order of drinks and food. Breakfast was lovely, there was a great choice, the food was cooked extremely well and was the highlight of the stay. 
I would be unlikely to stay again, I choose hotels for location and service, unfortunately the service was not quite up to an adequate standard on this occasion and offered pretty average value for money. The fine details are what make a venue memorable, it’s a shame these have been overlooked, particularly on a birthday weekend.",2,2023,12,04
121,Pathetic Breakfast Service ,"We chose Taj to celebrate Christmas last year 2022. We expected special breakfast or few activities for kids on Christmas. And even staff used to argue with my son if he had asked for berries and cream both with waffles,which was complimentary. Didn't expect this for such prestigious hotel...never going to recommend this to anyone.",3,2023,12,04
121,Good but not Taj good,"We stayed here for a Saturday evening and overall the experience was good. However, this is nothing like the experience of staying at a Taj hotel in India. The check in was adequate and the room itself was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The heating was not really controllable but hit and miss. Breakfast was chaos with queues out of the restaurant. We were lucky our wait was only 10 mins. The food that was available was OK but it took time for it to be replenished when it ran out. There was a nice touch with masala tea being served at your tables. Would we return - probably not",4,2023,12,03
121,Not the greatest,"We stayed at  the St  James  Court in London and it was a very disappointing experience.   The check in experience was very  very  slow.   We  waited  over 2 hours  for our  room.   We were very tired as  we'd  just arrived in  London.    We ate lunch at the restaurant.   That was an exhausting experience.   The staff ignored us  for almost 30 min.  We had 3 young kids  that were so hungry.   Finally, we  were served.   but,  just asking for another coke took 20 minutes.  
The room itself  was a very nice sized  room.   It  was  a master  suite  and had 2 rooms which was nice.  Another  plus was that it was clean.    Other  than  that...very disappointing  It is a very old room.  The hotel is redoing the hotel, we just got put into the very old part of it.  The plumbing  had major issues...hard to flush the toilet, the shower didn't't drain very  well, in my daughters room, the wood panel on the tub fell off. The counter in the bathroom is so low,  and was very very marred...this room needs to be totally done over!  
 Another bonus was hearing the tube run by every few minutes. It was just not what I expected.  The breakfast was fine...not the best or the worst....it just could be a lot better.
on the plus side, the concierge and doorman were great!",2,2023,12,03
121,Heating NOT working!!!!,"2nd December 2023, it MINUS degrees outside , and our heating isn’t working.

Sitting in bed with clothes on trying to keep warm.

Technician confirmed heating not working.

100’s of £££’s for a cold room….HELP PLEASE!!

(Temporary heater arrived but inadequate )",1,2023,12,02
121,"Last stay ever, no improvement on last year!","A couple of good stays here, until last year! Last year was poor due to a cold restaurant pokey room and staff issues. I gave a poor review (which now seems to have disappeared! I had a phone call from one of the management but asked for a call back due to being busy, the call back never came. Anyway, on to this year, against my partners wishes I decided to book again. Day one saw us assigned a disability room (not that we needed one), on arrival water was coming out of the ceiling, all over the toilet. My partner went to the desk and we were duly assigned another room - an upgrade by all accounts! I’m pretty sure this was not the case. Breakfast saw a 15 minute wait/queue, the food was warm at best. We had to ask for cutlery. We went out at 1140 and came back about 3, the room hadn’t been cleaned and next doors food was still in the passsgeway.  My partner called for housekeeping which promptly arrived. Wish I’d been out, coffee cups rinsed and wiped out with a cleaning cloth, no top up of biscuits or coffee and empty glasses from the night before were left despite my request to remove. I wait to see what happens tomorrow (our last ever day, ever!).",1,2023,12,02
121,Great service but lacked the feel of luxury.,"I booked the classic room at the St. James’ Court Hotel in London. While the room was in the unrenovated portion of the building, the room was still spacious. However, it lacked the basic amenities you would expect from 4 star hotel. I was struggling to find an outlet to plug the room’s coffee maker into - the coffee maker required a three prong connection, but only two prong outlets were easily accessible. Finally we found an outlet behind the TV that would accept the plug. Additionally, while taking a bath I had found a shard of glass on the counter. This made me wonder if the room was truly clean. I left the shard in sight and asked for the room to be serviced and it was still there upon my return. Nevertheless, the staff was incredibly helpful and attentive. The breakfast was also enjoyable. Overall, I was disappointed by the level of luxury the St. James’ Court offered despite the Taj group being well known for helping its patrons experience grandeur in its truest sense.",3,2023,12,01
121,Chilly room and long waiting time for breakfast,"First of all, our experience could have been almost a 10 were it not for some things that will change in the future or can be changed now.

The hotel is gorgeous, to the point that I wished I arrived before so I could spend some cozy time at the reception. The patio is extremely beautiful and overall all public areas are really neat. The restaurant has nice and tasty food and the service is amazing, one of the best I've experienced.

Here's the catch: The rooms are currently undergoing renovation and not all of them are brand new. We were unlucky and were placed in one of the older rooms. The room is beautiful and the bed is really comfortable. The bathroom is okay and the bathtub is big enough so I fit (I'm pretty tall). But since the room is really old, the window glasses are thin and the windows wouldn't close properly and weren't properly isolated. This resulted in the room never being warm enough for us to be in there without a blanket of a hoodie. The bed was warm but our face, which wouldn't be covered during the night, got cold several times and we would wake up with a bit of a cold sensation. It wasn't unbearable by any means but even with the thermostat set on the highest setting we couldn't fight the cold completely and I think a lot of energy was being wasted.

The other issue we had, which actually made us leave with a bit of disappointment, was the breakfast waiting time. The first morning, we had breakfast at 7 and it all went pretty smooth. We were out by 7:40 and could order the included dish. The second morning, we waited for 2 full hours to get the dish we ordered (2 benedictine eggs). We knew by previous reviews that we would wait longer if we had breakfast on the busy hours so we considered 1 hour to be reasonable but after 1:15 we started asking for our dish up to three times until someone went in the kitchen and asked for it. I don't know if they forgot it or what, but after 3 couples coming and having their breakfast just by our side and us asking three times we were just tired and a bit angry. 

Overall an experience that could've been more enjoyable and we may think about returning in a couple of years to a better room but we wouldn't probably eat at the restaurant given this last experience.",3,2023,11,28
121,"Dirty, and scary","Dirty and scary concealed under Indian hospitality.
As a single woman traveling on business, I felt they kept trying to either spike my drink, roofie me, or the staff simply ignored my needs. Awful and scary.",1,2023,11,27
121,Opulence & Grandeur.,"Having booked this hotel from a friend’s recommendation I found a good deal via late rooms, booking.com. 
The location of the hotel is great to pretty much most of the London spots and if your not afraid to walk, then a 20/30 min walk to Trafalgar Square/ Piccadilly isn’t too strenuous, weather permitting. St James tube station is about a 7min walk from the hotel. 
Arriving at the hotel you are greeted with this Grand, opulent building set very close to Buckingham Palace, and with its Christmas decorations in place, certainly makes you want to spend your Christmas there. You are greeted by the very polite and friendly porters as were the reception team on check in. 
Our room was very clean and minimalist nothing grand and our window view was a square of adjoining rooms, not glamorous. 
We had one small issue with our mini bar fridge not working as we had brought our own bottle of champagne to celebrate our birthdays. This was quickly resolved once housekeeping was notified as we left for the theatre. 
I will say the Air Conditioning unit was a little too noisy for us and slightly disturbed our sleep. We did turn it off but the room became quite cold very quickly so we had to turn back on. 
The bed and cushions were very comfortable and the breakfast was filling. As it’s an Indian owed hotel, you also get the delights of sampling Indian breakfast cuisine. 😀
There are some minor niggles to point out that we noticed, mainly in the hallways to our room, but there was quite a lot of damaged scuff marks to the wall and doors which stood out quite well. I know there is a lot of hotel traffics and marks do happen but first appearance makes a great impression. There was also some poor workmanship in our bathroom with tile pointing and missing grout lines which again stand out once you’ve noticed them. Detail in the finish makes a better impression too. 
Overall, a very nice hotel, for its location, a great price if you can find the right deal for your stay.
Unfortunately we did not use any of its restaurants due to our commitments so unable to comment and we did look at using the spa and getting some treatments but found the treatments a little on the expensive side.",4,2023,11,27
121,Will not return anymore,"This is my fourth stay at the St James but it will also be my last. The St James Court used to be my favorite hotel choice in London. 

A few positive points: 
- The premium courtyard junior suite is a beautiful room very well maintained
- The spa is also very good
- Doormen are excellent and very proactive 

As for the negative:
- Front desk staff used to be much more professional (before pandemic)
- Breakfast used to be excellent with very good service. Now the breakfast is served in an overcrowded room with almost 30mn wait! The service is appalling, the tables are dirty, and the food is so-so. 
- I did not receive any welcome amenities in the room (in the past I consistently received fresh fruits and chocolates...)
- My room key stopped working after 11am, although check-out time was 12pm. A very tacky detail and an unpleasant surprise as I was wearing a robe returning from the spa

To conclude, this was a disappointing stay. The hotel is not heading in the right direction. The price-quality ratio is quickly falling down ",3,2023,11,22
121,Fab hotel - shame about breakfast service,"We stayed for one night in a classic room, with breakfast included.  The hotel has an excellent location, is very stylish and comfortable, the staff are well trained and courteous.  Our room was very comfortable and quiet.  What spoiled the overall experience was the breakfast service.  This is a very large hotel and the restaurant in which breakfast is provided is relatively small.  On a Sunday morning, we were greeted with chaotic scenes, with lots of disgruntled guests waiting in a queue or hanging around in the small entrance and one staff member trying to triage the requests for a table (which she was doing using small scraps of paper).  We were told that there would be at least a 20 minute wait to get a table; we hung around with others in a crowded space, no offer of juice/tea/coffee while we waited (which could easily have been provided self service).  There was one juice dispenser with a handful of clean glasses tucked away.  We were shown to a table after 20 minutes, a table with hardly any leg room, among a cacophonous noise.  Our order for hot food was quickly taken, the selection was lovely and the food excellent; one set of cutlery also quickly arrived, had to request a second.  While waiting for our hot food we went to self service buffet which was very good - no self service tea/coffee and no one came to take this order.  Had to manoeuvre around a staff member who stood close to our table, back towards us, chatting to someone, to get to the buffet.  Eventually I asked someone for two coffees - nothing came.  I reminded when our hot food came and was assured it would be there in a few moments - and told that only one barista was working (!).  Finally, when we'd finished our breakfast and someone arrived to clear the table, we made one last attempt to get a cup of coffee and met with success.  The staff on breakfast service were trying their very best, clearly short staffed - but the breakfast numbers on a weekend can obviously be anticipated and planned for, eg by asking guests to book a breakfast slot, opening additional serving areas etc.  Really poor organisation and management, not acceptable for a 5 star hotel.  The whole thing felt stressful for guests and staff alike, not a good way to start the day.  We have stayed at Taj hotels in India and been very impressed, which is why we chose this one; but have never encountered such a shambles in a Taj hotel, a real shame that lets down this hotel and gives a terrible impression of the Taj brand.  We come to London regularly but sadly would avoid this one in future.  I rarely post reviews on TripAdvisor and had anyone asked how our stay had been, eg on checkout, perhaps I wouldn't have felt the need to write this one.",3,2023,11,20
121,This is not a Taj hotel by any means,"Please stop calling this a Taj Hotel. You will be giving Taj brand a bad name. Can’t compare anything with other Taj hotels in India which are just amazing in everything (check in, stay, service, food etc etc). The only thing I liked here was their Spa…",2,2023,11,18
121,Taj afternoon tea ,Awesome service from Bhargav and Harsh.  Lovely Desi afternoon tea.   Really nice and great ambience.  Thx you guys.  Parking at W Park Victoria     Only 10 mins walk.   The Tak customer experience is 10-10.  😄,5,2023,11,18
121,Near Perfect : Typical Taj Hospitality - Warm & Friendly.,"We were booked here for two nights and we ended up staying here for 15 nights. That should tell you a story.

What you will like:

1. The people - they have a great team. Ably led by Shreekumar the duty manager, the front office functions like a well oiled machine. Prativa, Jeff and the rest always welcome you cheerfully and they are efficient.

2. The rooms - large by London standards. The housekeeping is very good. Loved the linen and the towels. They’re cranky about providing extra drinking water, but you can buy plenty from the convenience store next door. Shahjahan and a couple of other Indian lads were excellent at servicing the rooms. 

3. The facilities - the hotel does have a gym and a spa which we didn’t use since we were out most of the time.

4. The location - perfect. It’s just off the main road, so you have peace and quiet. Yet it’s close to major attractions like the Buckingham palace, Westminster Abbey, etc. The St James tube station is 4 minutes away, Victoria (a major hub) is 6 minutes away, there are bus stops all around, plenty of eating places and Victoria street has some lovely shopping places, eateries and theatres. A very good convenience store is next door to the hotel where you could buy and reload your Oyster card too. Most importantly, you can travel anywhere you want, from this hotel.

5. The highlight is the concierge desk. Manned by some really smart and efficient gentlemen. We were particularly impressed by Mr. William who seemed to be able to handle almost everything. Interacting with him felt like being in a James Bond movie.

6. The breakfast - it did get crowded after 9 so an early breakfast is advisable. You have a many options to choose from and the staff are helpful. The food though is a bit bland as they cater to various nationalities.

There are no real downsides to staying here. It’s safe (you’re right next to the King’s bedroom), spacious, satisfying, and most importantly the staff make you feel at home.

Would we stay here again? Definitely.

Would we recommend this place? Definitely.

Do stay here, “St James Court is really the Taj” !",5,2023,11,18
121,Embarrassed and Humiliated!,"I seldom blog about bad service. But this takes the cake. At the hotel restaurant, I was totally embarrassed and humiliated when I was told I cannot charge to the room. There were other guests around me. When queried why, it appeared that the deposit I paid at check in was not posted to my room, hence I was not allowed to charge my restaurant meals to my room! Now now. I have stayed in many categories of hotels. Even in 3 star hotels where deposits were not taken, I can  still charge my restaurant meals to my room. They do not think I will run away without paying on checkout. I really do not know what this 4 star Taj St James hotel is thinking. Are they so worried that their guests will not pay on checking out? Come on. Have more faith. This is totally embarrassing and humiliating. Please have some faith in your guests that they will pay for what they consume. Pls review your ridiculous policy of allowing guests to charge to their room only if they have paid a deposit. In this case, even though I paid a deposit (more than the meal cost), they forgot to post that deposit to my room. And they embarrassed me. Let me add that the staff at the restaurant did all they can. But damage was done because of the hotel’s policy. This is the last time I will stay with them.",1,2023,11,16
121,"Great, spacious rooms!","We have stayed here a couple of times and the hotel never fails to deliver. The rooms are spacious, clean, and the amenities are perfect.

When you walk in to reception you are greeted with a beautiful relaxing aroma like a Spa , I love it ! My room was incredibly comfortable and concierge took care of transporting our luggage whilst checking in and checking out they really are so welcoming . My bed and pillows extremely comfortable .

121,Great stay with young family ,"Beautiful stay in Taj 51 where the staff were very welcoming and incredibly accommodating from reception staff to porters to restaurant staff and the concierge when I recently stayed with my young family, particularly arranging play and baby equipment and allowing us an extended check out made the experience very smooth and comfortable.

121,Leave Expectations at home ,"Stayed for a week.  The breakfast menu was same.  Nothing worth mentioning was served.  Toiletries not stocked daily.  Coffee pods in room were not stocked after second day. The rooms are very small .  Cost cutting was visible in every aspect except for tariffs.  They also add a 5% service charge to your total bill and to circumvent the laws, call it discretionary.  It’s at sole discretion of the guest, but it is added to the bill without checking with guest. ",1,2023,11,07
121,Focus on the detail.,"I've stopped at far too many hotels over the years, this one is just OK and nothing really more. Despite me asking for a room not affected by the noise from the Underground we ended up in a room affected by the Underground, what this means is several times per night the rumble of the trains can be heard.
It was clean and tidy, staff were friendly but one problem which wasn't addressed immediately and should have been was my good lady found cling film mixed in with her porridge and I had a very long black hair in my scrambled eggs, and no it wasn't one of mine. 
I don't know about you but I love to watch the TV for half an hour or so before going to sleep, there was no TV available throughout the hotel and apparently the ""engineers were working on it"", and ""it happens when it's raining"" ..........really?
I'm not saying I wouldn't stay there again but would look for alternatives beforehand and it therefore wouldn't be my first choice.   ",3,2023,11,06

We sure hope to return.",5,2023,11,05
121,"Definitely not a Luxury 5 * Hotel, poor customer service","I must say, this is one of the worst 5* hotels i have ever stayed in. 

The price per night is incredibly expensive, they sell it as a Luxury 5 star Hotel and their service and hygiene standards are very far from this recognition. 

We arrived on Wednesday 1st of November, the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade which we thought was a great gesture until we spent the first night, the room views look over the back of a building with HUGE air conditioning machines and a CONSTANT noice of these machine functioning, you could hear this even with the windows closed. If this was the “better” room I dont know what our original room looked like. Please see picture attached,

Also, we saw a glass of water in the middle of the corridor that we saw laying around upon arrival, was left for 2 whole days until pick up. That says a lot about attention to detail.

In second place, the TV did not work for the full stay of 4 days due to a storm. We had no way to see any tv or anything tv related. My mother went down to reception 3 times assuring someone was going to check until the answer was given next day that the signal had gone, no signal for a TV in a 5 star Hotel in which we paid over a £1000 pounds. Its insane. 

Breakfast service is CHAOTIC, however food is good, i am quite interested in knowing where they hire their staff from. So unorganized, they are all over the place. They do not SANITIZE or SPRAY their tables, once you have finished they will wipe the crumbs on to the floor for the next guests to sit. This is disgusting. Anyone who works at a luxury hotel must know crumbs are never swiped of the table on to the floor, and if you do you must sweep them immediately, making the table surroundings as clean as possible. I have picture to prove.

The restaurant tables are ridiculously close to each other, there is literally 10 cms separation between tables, you can hear other people’s conversations. 

Grooming standards are way far from a 5 star  hotel. I work at hospitality i have traveled the world and this is not the standard. Dirty shoes, clothes not ironed, hair not groomed. Not acceptable.

After all of this Air conditioning/ heater breaks down. On the third day of our stay we head down to reception and we list all the complaints. The gentleman took notes and didn’t even ask for our room number. Usually a 5 star hotel receives a complaint and the hotel has a kind gesture or an apology with an amenity or something, nothing. We received nothing, i would like to point  this was not our purpose and we told reception the same, we did not want anything out of the situation. Just feedback. 

We checked out today, and i must say the gentleman at reception was lovely who attended our check out asked about our stay and we complained and took a charge off the room service that we had pending to pay.

Even though this is a Hotel we would not come back to, the location is perfect. But quality- price not worth it, it is not a 5 star Hotel and it is not a 5 star Service, so i will definitely not spend a £1000 again here.

Customer service  is very very weak, and when you spend that amount of money for 4 days you expect a lot different than what we experienced.",2,2023,11,05

121,Great choice ,"The hotel is excellent with extremely good service and ambience. I was upgraded to a room. The room was comfortable and with all the amenities that you could imagine. The breakfast was great with loads of choices. The only slight niggle is that the waiters were very keen to remove the cutleries when I was not quite finished.

Spotlessly clean room and huge bathroom with lovely Molton Brown toiletries and warm fluffy white towels and robes. The staff all around were all super helpful and friendly. Has a lovely outside area for relaxing which is beautifully planted and decorated. Would highly recommend. ,5,2023,11,01
121,Indian enclave in London,"That I give 5 points is partly due to the fact that this hotel reminds me of other members if the Taj group it belongs to. There is an Indian atmosphere here. Not only are there many guests with an Indian background staying here, many staff members have that background too. What also helps is that breakfast means being able to have a plain dosa. But then I feel at home in Indian surroundings.
But then there also is the location. For those who need to be there Leicester Square is a 25 minutes walk through St James' Park and across the horse guards goings on. A tube station is around the corner.
I had five breakfasts and while there was a short wait to be seated it all was fine. The dosa was nice, as were the western options. At last scrambled eggs as they should be. 
I had dinner at Quilon, a Michelin starred Keralan restaurant which is part pf the hotel, which was fabulous. The bar in the lobby is nice but can become crowded. They made me a very nice Manhattan.
As for the rooms, I took a King Premier which is a recently updates room. I cannot compare with the older rooms but this was a comfortable room, overlooking the unique courtyard. 
I like St James' Court and would not mind staying there again. Recommended, with the note that you do enter a piece of India in London. For me that is a huge pro.

121,A Taj experience with the warmth of a Botique hotel,I have stayed at the hotel once in 2018 and again this year . It’s the best place one can think of staying in at London . Never fails to amaze . I would say it has the warmth of a boutique hotel and the ambience luxury and service of a five star hotel though it’s a 4 star . The only Taj that gives you a boutique hotel feel … hospitality was A plus all employees are very very helpful and one feels safe and at home in a foreign country - what else can one ask for . From booking a room with reservation to booking a table at a restaurant or a cab or train tickets or show tickets everything is taken care of . A 10/10 experience . 😀,5,2023,10,29

121,"Best in London for location, service, and comfort","We are from the US and recently spent a week in London at the St. James' CourtTaj Hotel. This was our fourth trip to London, and this was our favorite hotel, by far. The service was friendly and attentive to our every need. The restaurants, breakfast buffet, and courtyard were wonderful. My husband enjoyed the exercise room and sauna at no extra cost. Our King suite room was spacious and had everything we needed for a weeklong stay. As we adjusted to jetlag in the first day or two, it was so nice to have a couch, desk, and television separate from the bed so that one of us could sleep undisturbed while the other was awake. It was a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, St. James Park, and numerous great restaurants and pubs. We are walkers and chose to walk a half-hour to the theatre district for 3 evening shows, although a short cab ride would have been an option, too. The concierge was friendly and helpful in quickly getting cabs for us for transportation to tours and our airport return. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,10,23
121,Great Hotel and Superb service.,All I would say is that we had a very great stay at the hotel. The service by the hotel staff was exemptional. Great location and Superb breakfast. I would definitely visit them again during our next visit to London.,5,2023,10,22
121,One of the best in London,"Amazing hotel, location and service. Highly recommended. One of the best in London. Breakfast amazing with indian and non indian options. Courtesy of the staff was incredible. Will stay again when in London. ",5,2023,10,21
121,Fantastic Options for a London Visit,"Wonderful hotel, smart customer service and fantastic location.  The location was on a quiet street but next  to coffee shops, convenience store and pubs and a quick walk to key attractions. The room was very comfortable and nice sized.  The breakfast was delicious and their courtyard stunning!  Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!",5,2023,10,21
121,Best hotel for those who would prefer Indian food. ,"Good location. 
Difficult to contact the hotel via calls and email prior to check in. 
Check in time really strict and no scope for early check in. 
The old rooms are shabby, with damp and wall cracks and below average facilities. Limited space, limited charging ports and facilities. 
Renovated new rooms are made well and worth the pricing. 
Room service really slow. Breakfast facility was superb and well managed except for a few staff who were extremely rude. Concierge and housekeeping staff were great. 
Overall a good option for those who would prefer Indian food and hospitality. ",4,2023,10,19
121,They need to upgrade. ,"The building is old and worn out. The housekeeping is at its worst. Some of the front desk are good. One Mr. Coutino who was the night manager had no clue what he was talking about. 

The location and place is great. Just needs a lot of work- In terms of staff and building works. ",2,2023,10,18
121,Worth Staying....but....,"Recently stayed the week at St. James' Court and would definitely give the hotel another try. Every aspect of the stay was exceptional, EXCEPT for our room. Although the room was spacious and clean, we were put in the older section of the hotel; the hallways and room/bathroom were very well worn and aged. We went with another couple, and their room was in the remodeled section. So if you are making reservations, make sure you request updated rooms.

The staff is nothing but first class, always friendly, knowledgable, and there to lend a hand.

Other than the room, one could not ask for a better location. EVERYTHING is within walking distance. There is a great coffee shop across the street and many pubs close by.

",4,2023,10,17
121,Great stay,"Our stay was wonderful! The room size large and bedding was perfectly soft! We loved the beautifully decorated public spaces including the garden patios. The breakfast buffet was good as it had everything you could want plus a made to order options! On our last day we had to leave too early for the buffet so they had a bag with sandwiches,fruit and yogurt waiting for us at checkout!",5,2023,10,17
121,Eat elsewhere,"The food service was disappointing.  While there were lots of options for Breakfast, many were cold from sitting out and the eggs were tasteless and runny.  Service was hard to get, having to chase down empty entries and coffee refills.  Lunch was also poor in quality and value for money.  The hotel is clearly in a phased remodel, so you may have a nice room or you may have a dated room.  Walking through the hotel to your room may mean walking through different eras of remodels.  Not what should be expected of a hotel at this level.",3,2023,10,16
121,Amazing hotel and location. ,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, excellent location. The hotel itself was gorgeous, including the courtyard. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The location itself was a short walk from Buckingham palace. Would definitely stay there again. ",5,2023,10,16
121,Excellent Hotel in the Hear of Westminster,"I spent nine days in London and stayed at the Taj, St. James Court.  The service was exceptional from start to finish.  I was treated as a welcomed guest my entire stay.  The lobby area, front entrance, courtyard, piano lounge, and dining room are ""old school"" classy.  The concierge service was very helpful in securing tickets for me for several shows.  My room was a bit worn and dated and could use some refurbishment.  Overall, an excellent hotel in the heart of Westminster.",5,2023,10,16
121,"It could not have been better, we  loved our experience! ","Accommodations great, roomy rooms, staff very friendly and helpful. Buffet and restaurant were amazing. Walking distance to many sites and easy access to buses and cabs. Wonderful place to stay, I would certainly stay again while in London. 😊",5,2023,10,16
121,Best hotel in all of London,"One of the best and memorable holiday due to service provided by ever reliable hotel.
The front desk was quick and prompt there was never any problem for them to address but I’m sure if there was they would done it quickly. They upgraded our rooms when we came back after a short break.
We are vegetarians so no eggs also and I love croissants and on request they had it ready for us along with pancakes which they remembered when we came  back after three days.
Special shout out to mr. Sanjeev who was always smiling and having a conversation  with all the guests at breakfast.
Ms Gayathri and ms Anuja were also prompt and quick with their service during the breakfast rush.
The hotel is very centrally located a literal stone throw away a from Buckingham place and two metro stations close by as well as they Hyde park which was a quick walk 
Thanks guys will come back soon keep up the good work",5,2023,10,15
121,Great Location with a warm heritage hospitality,"St James is one of the historic hotels nearby to the British History of museums, Buckingham palace, west minister abbey.  The rooms are very clean with great views.  It offers a variety of restaurants ,but I enjoyed the fruits, Masala Dosa, Masala Tea and Croissants at HH restaurant. Staff is friendly and can guide you in case you want to go out for a trip.  The New or parttime staff at times may lack a bit of consistency in hospitality but that is taken care by the senior staff. ",5,2023,10,15
121,St James Court London - Taj Hospitality Rocks!,"With Taj, there is always an expectation. Of superb location. Great understated classy ambience. Even greater care & service. But as you travel abroad, the service levels of the hotel go down compared to what we are used to in India since hotels deploy lesser manpower to control costs. 

With that context, we were pleasantly delighted on almost every aspect of hospitality industry at St James Court - the Taj, London. 

First of all the Location. Next to Buckingham Palace. 300 yards apart. My longest golf shot has been 280 yards! The most Central of Central London. Most attractions are at a walkable distance from the hotel. Or at best at short taxi distance. So much so that we hardly had to use the underground except once when I went out to Pinner Golf Club to play Golf. 

Secondly, the ambience. Classy understated elegance. Period. Nothing over the top. The central court yard is indeed a breath of fresh air. Spent many evenings there. Vibrant energy. 

The third and the most important part, the care & the service. Right from the word go, to the check out. Impeccable service, nay, care. The welcoming hand every person of the staff was willing to provide. At all times. From the customised breakfast & dinner menu (very specific Jain Vegetarian menu, no onion, no garlic, of course no eggs, no cauliflower, no mushroom et all). The staff, the managers, and the chef were genuinely happy to ‘care’. Each breakfast & each dinner was a delight. 

The staff at reception displayed true warmth rather than plastic smiles that we experienced at 8 hotels during our entire trip to Scotland & England. No hotel whether 5 star or 4 star came even closer to the Taj Culture of Care & Warmth. 

The staff at the Wellness Center was equally warm & caring. The large jacuzzi was like a tiny swimming pool, heated one of course. 

The housekeeping team & the concierge team was ever ready to help at the drop of a hat. 

I have given it 9 out of 10 ratings because we faced an “AC not working” issue upon check-in & the Duty Manager Mr. Srini on 7th October evening was a bit argumentative & defensive. We had given him 3 options including the one to accept a tiny air-cooler for night if he can take care of the ac-issue during the next full day when we were out. Anyways, later he made up for it by upgrading our room when I insisted on speaking to his reporting boss Ms. Mehrnavaz. Frankly, he was the only exception to the Taj Culture we witnessed all throughout with each member of the staff. I heard from other guests that ac-system was conking off too & their rooms were changed too. Surely, the whole ac-system needs an upgrade perhaps. 

Overall, to sum up our one week experience I would simply say “Wah Taj”. There is no match for the genuine care & service that you exhibit. Ms. Mehrnavaz & her team is obviously doing a fantastic job to keep the Taj flag flying high in London. 

There is absolutely no doubt that we will stay at the Taj in London every single time we go there, as well as recommended it to all our friends.",5,2023,10,14
121,A great experience overall with some suggestions on the room,"The people make this place what it is - the service from everyone was fantastic and my check-in and check-out experiences were nice and quick. The foyer and the floors are all designed beautifully too. Of course, the location is super ideal. 

I had food twice when I stayed and both meals were made to perfection. The amenities in the room were plentiful and the water was hot.

I did have a few gripes:
- my room is screaming for a refurbishment
- I felt and heard every underground train going by and I was on the third floor; my sleep was not great as a result
- it's quite loud outside and I feel like a hotel like this, and for the price you pay per night too, you'd expect some double or triple glazing",5,2023,10,13
121,"Best staff, large rooms and excellent hospitality","Excellent staff, large rooms- best hospitality. I had an early check out at 6am, before the breakfast started so they make me a breakfast box to carry, with fruits, a sandwich and take away coffee. Just amazing. The location is very good, fairly central and close to tube stations, if you aren’t staying at Mayfair, this is your second best option. The hotel, the staff and everything is beyond expectation",5,2023,10,12
121,Amazing Stay!,"We were only staying for 1 night and had booked 3 rooms for us and friends to celebrate our Anniversary.  
The reception staff were fantastic and so helpful, Ridge the member who checked us all in, upgraded our rooms, which was such a lovely surprise!
Very clean rooms with everything you need. Comfortable bed with great shower room.  
The bar area was very nice with a piano player in the evening. 
Great location for tubes and taxis to get across London.  Would definitely stay again.
",5,2023,10,12
121,Perfect hotel!,"This hotel was perfect for our visit to London. The location is great, just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and a few minutes walk to Westminster Abbey. The staff was so nice and helpful, and although the rooms aren't huge, they were impeccable and well appointed. I'll stay there again next time for sure. ",5,2023,10,11
121,Fabulous!,Beautiful and spacious room. The restaurant had delicious food. Breakfast buffet had an extensive selection. The staff were all very pleasant and attentive to our needs. Far exceeded our expectations. Would definitely stay here again! ,5,2023,10,11
121,Great location and property,We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and they went out of there way to provide assistance on the area. The hotel is is very welcoming with excellent amenities. Our king bed room was very clean and comfortable. Transport services are plentiful. Breakfast each day was excellent.  Centrally located. We would recommend and stay here again.,5,2023,10,10
121,"Good hotel, nice location","Overall good experience
Nice ambience
Good service 
Great location
Nicely outfitted rooms 
New and clean
Safe
Wonderful architecture 
Close to all major attractions
Worth a stay the next time you visit London.",4,2023,10,10
121,It was an amazing experience ,I would like to stay courtyard room.I can’t get in touch with the lobby the phone didn’t work and also the door didn’t open I don’t know what was the problem.But apart of them I enjoyed quite much.Expecially hotel staffs are so kind and smiley face,5,2023,10,09
121,Lacks Tajness!,"The hotel is in close proximity to the local attractions and a London tube station. My room was small, dark, and with carpet stains. There was no view since the only small window was glazed. There was no walk-in shower and the fixtures were outdated. The wait times for breakfast was 20 minutes on both days and the staff was overwhelmed. I had stayed in this hotel about 30 years back, but it will not be on my list for the next trip. I have stayed in almost all Taj hotels in India and this hotel does not express the true Tajness.",3,2023,10,07
121,We will be back here.,"Loved our stay at this hotel. Friendly, efficient and helpful staff. Relaxed and comfortable. The spa treatment was very relaxing and wonderful staff. Beautiful outside garden to relax in. Clean, comfortable rooms with great facilities for all the family.5 star rating from us.",5,2023,10,06
121,GEETIKA helpful customer service ,GEETIKA was very lovely and helpful with the check in and also helped me to upgrade my room as was my wife birthday so I came second time and meet her again. I totally recommend this hotel the best service.,5,2023,10,06
121,Worst sleep ever,Literally on top of the tube line. Terrible sleep. Whole room shakes every 2 minutes. Lamp’s don’t work. No hairdryer despite advertising. Asked for room change but of course nothing else available. For the price better off in Premier Inn.,1,2023,10,05
121,Wonderful Hotel,A wonderful hotel. Beautiful restaurant and breakfast. Comfortable beds. We will stay here every time we are in London. A fabulous place to stay with an impeccable staff. Looking forward to my next visit.  Highly recommend the breakfast. Great!,5,2023,10,03
121,A fantastic experience at the St.James Taj,Lovely and warm experience . Home away from home kind of experience by Rajat Gupta & Panchan Walia . Thank you so so much for making us feel so warm. Lovely food and ambience but above all brilliant experience ,5,2023,10,02
121,Great Service ,Overall experience was amazing! Have to give out a special thank you Kajal from breakfast service. She was so kind and sweet and really made every breakfast feel special. The facilities have everything one needs when away from home. We had great weather during our stay that it was lovely to have a courtyard. ,5,2023,10,01
121,Well below of what I was expecting for a Taj Hotel with nice restaurants and in a nice area.,Nice hotel but many rooms are not the same quality as the lobby or the hotel. The rooms in the classic area are small and noisy. The quality of those rooms are less than a 3 star hotel. Bathroom is very small and the room is almost the size of the bed only.,2,2023,09,30
121,TAJ,"The Taj is located in a great section of London. Breakfast included every day
Staff was attentive and gracious. Our room was tight but comfortable.
Stay overall was good and for the price was as expected",4,2023,09,25
121,I write this review while I’m staying at the hotel. Overall very average stay.,"I have stayed at many other Taj properties and this one was the most average one. Didn’t meet expectations at all. For the following reasons: 
1. We had a 10nights stay and the breakfast was same every single day. I asked for some verity but it went on deaf ears .
2. The staff is full of Indians who are biased towards foreigners and do not care about Indians staying with them. It’s a clear bias with staff talking to each other in Hindi all the time. It just seems unpleasant. 
3. Breakfast  timing is till 11 but you get seated only at 11 when they are already picking up the spread. Long que wait everyday. If you have to go for a meeting you’ll surely have to give breakfast a miss. 
4. I ordered tomato soup from kids menu in my room and it came with a hair in it. Totally disappointed. And no standard portion sizes
 The breads that came with the soup were sooo chewy. It wasn’t even breaking with hand. The kid could not bite it. Also ordered chicken biryani which was good.
5. The day i checking in I complained about the washroom being sooo small. As I have a 3yr old with me I requested for a room with larger washroom. But again this fell on deaf ears. 
There was a towel rack in the washroom which is always very hot as it also is connected to water supply I think. It was a worry as I had to keep ensuring my toddler does not touch it. The rooms are clostrophobic  with no view and very tiny washrooms. Stayed at the premium studio suite.

Had high expectations from The Taj but unfortunately it was not worth the price. Would not recommend specially if with family. Disappointed :(",3,2023,09,24
121,Exceptional ,Our family had an enjoyable stay at the Taj. The staff were exceptional and our room was comfortable. We mostly enjoyed the buffett breakfasts which included a wide offering including some Indian options. I particularly enjoyed the chai. Seated in the beautifully designed breakfast area was a wonderful way to begin the day.,5,2023,09,24
121,Always a delight to stay at this property.,"With great dining options- in room and on the property, this Taj hotel stands out. The newly rennovated rooms are a class apart from older ones. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. My 4th stay in 2 years.",5,2023,09,22
121,Dissapointing,"Having stayed with the group in India on several occasions perhaps I expected too much. Check in was ok, the room was uninspiring, clean, and worked in that the bed was comfortable, sheets and towels of good quality. However why have pumps for shampoo, soaps etc. very cheap. Breakfast was a disaster, waited 10 minutes for coffee, no salt and pepper, no spoons, side plates or any sign of service. Fairly dreadful food, cheap bacon, sausage and pastries.",3,2023,09,22
121,Good location but that’s about all,"Location was very handy for all the London sights; a great location.
Room booked was very spacious by London standards and was value for money, again by London standards.
Reception and lobby staff very friendly and polite.
The real down side was the breakfast service in the restaurant. There were too few staff to accommodate the number of covers and the level of service was chaotic, fragmented and not anywhere near the standard expected. On our first morning, every time we left our table to attend the buffet for additional items, we returned to a completely cleared and re-set up table. On the second morning it took 30 minutes and two requests to obtain a cup of green tea, rather than coffee, which arrived in a pot without a cup. Had to ask for cutlery twice, most of the buffet hot food was luke warm. Coffee refills were again requested a number of times before being addressed.

This hotel is very much akin with other Taj hotels I have stayed in on the Indian sub-continent, and with mostly sub-continental guests; nice hotel but lacking in service and attention to detail, while charging high inner London prices.

The room service menu prices even by London prices is exorbitant.

Next trip to London will be a stay at a different location.",3,2023,09,21
121,"We Didn't Have A Reservation For House Of Ming, So Whomever Cancelled Theirs, Last Night, Thank You","As we were leaving The House Of MIng in London UK, last evening, I borrowed a quip from Simon Cowell when responding to the question, ""did I enjoy my meal?""  I said ""I didn't like it"", and then there was a look of pain on the face of Zetty, and then I said, ""I loved it"", and the painful look became a pretty smile.  Mavis & Zetty, are 2 very lovely ladies, who took exceptionally good care of us, and our meal was delicious.  We are visiting from Toronto, Canada, and whenever we return for another visit to London, we will definitely return to the House of Ming, which is part of the Taj St. James Hotel where we are staying, and enjoying the outstanding hospitality.

121,Homely feeling at London,"Having Indian brand, Indian traditional hospitality, Indian food in the heart of London near Buckingham Palace was an incredible experience.

121,Very disappointed,"So very disappointed with this hotel.  I paid £320 per night for a two night stay and was stuck in a dingy, depressing broom closet that has to be the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  Carpet stains, only one plug socket for the kettle/phone charger/hairdryer, the floor was not level so the chest of drawers kept opening and I had to wedge it shut, only decaffeinated pods for the coffee machine and no security lock for the door.  Room service burger (luke-warm and unappealing) £27, and bottle of wine (retailing at £10 elsewhere) £47 - total rip off.  Staff cheerful and helpful, but breakfast service slow and erratic.  Courtyard area could have been nice, but ruined by ghastly plastic flowers and butterflies.  I chose the hotel specifically for the location, which didn’t disappoint, but frankly everything else did.  More Fawlty Towers than Taj Mahal.",1,2023,09,17
121,They are Saints at the St James,First time at the St James. Picked it off the internet so other than the reviews I had no idea whether they were right or not. I can honestly say the St James was a great experience. The service goes beyond and reminds me of the old days in the USA. Doorman greets you when you arrive and helps immediately with the luggage. After a 9 hour flight that was greatly appreciated Staff was professional at the desk at check in. Rooms in Europe are smaller than the USA  so prepare for that. However they are very clean and attended to daily. Breakfast is included and what a buffet. Caters to Indian and English breakfast needs. You want for nothing. I would certainly stay there again without hesitation. Thank you St James,5,2023,09,17
121,Do not recommend!,"The air conditioning in our room rattled very loudly every few minutes. After the second night we requested they either fix it or give us a new room. We moved into a new room but it wasn't as nice (bed was less comfortable, less amenities and the furniture was dirty). Will definitely not stay here again.",1,2023,09,15
121,A good Indian experience,"The room was newly furbished in back side of hotel where there was some primary school. Children playing and all noise was all audible and a bit disturbing in day time. The glass should have been sound proof. Other wise the room is clean and well maintained. Room has an iron, usb B type charging ports , bed and Samsung TV( very slow ) . A wifi In name of Taj london. 

Lifts working around to TH 51, courtyard. Car/Taxi stoppable at gate of hotel with black cabs too. The hotel doesn’t gives a welcome drink on arrival . The feel is a bit indian with staff being 80% indian. Overall a nice hotel stay in Nice area Buckingham . Almost every attraction in a radius of 4 miles from the hotel. ",4,2023,09,13
121,An Average Experience,Room was good. Just a grunting occasional irritating noise from A/c area which also was there once A/c was switched off. Indian Restaurant experience was close to poor. The Chinese Ming Restaurant was Taj Standard.,3,2023,09,13
121,Excellent Property,"Great location about 200m from St James Tube Station and next to the Buckingham Palace. Everything is in a walkable distance and the hotel ambience and service are just Best in Class, will stay here again. ",5,2023,09,13

The lobby is spacious and it includes a bar. The garden in the back is enchanting, flowers everywhere, the ancient fountain, all surrounded by beautiful old buildings. We had breakfast and dinner there. Also, go to tea at their restaurant Kona, they made us feel like royalty. It’s central location is also a big reason to stay here. It’s only a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and the park. ",5,2023,09,13
121,Loved My Stay,I spent 4 nights at this hotel and absolutely loved it! Geetika and her colleagues at the Front Desk were super nice and helpful during check-in. My room was quite spacious for a room in London. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large. My room has views of the beautiful courtyard. Breakfast was superb and included both western and Indian dishes. The location was prime a few mins walk to Buckingham Palace and other sites. I will certainly be back and highly recommend this hotel to others.,5,2023,09,12
121,Home away from home,"Taj group of hotels have always been home away from home. But this time I was a bit disappointed. Though the hotel is located at a beautiful location and aesthetically taj has always acted a 100 on 100 , good was quite average. The in room dining experience wasn’t good at all . One the food choices were too limited and also the Indian cuisine was very disappointing. Rice was raw, extremely oily and the Bhima lamb had a stench in the meat. Not a quality expected from the Taj group. ",3,2023,09,11

121,What a wonderful hotel and exceptional staff!! ,"From our arrival we were instantly greeted by Leo offering to take all our luggage from us to our room. His friendly and professional manner truly made for a great start to our visit. It was only seconded by Leah who quickly checked us in and got us into our room with the swiftest of effort where we were then welcomed into our wonderful family room. The sitting area created such an oasis allowing us to kick back and relax before a long day of discovery. Don't skip breakfast as you will miss a wonderful selection of both Continental and Indian dishes. From Eggs Bene to Dosa they have it all covered. Oh yeah, location, location, location as it's a 6min walk to Buckingham Palace and 12min walk to Big Ben, with easy access to the Tube.",5,2023,09,05
121,Perfect place in Central London ,"Fantastic property...nice rooms and great location walking distance from most central London attractions.

Rooms are functional, clean and modern. Felt like they had been recently updated.",5,2023,09,03
121,Disappointed,"Room amenities, cleanliness, wifi, response to complaints needs a major upgrade to match the Taj standards that we are all used to

121,A charming location to see the most of London on my two day visit.,"A beautiful hotel in the Taj group, very well located, to walk in the park, and explore London on foot. The staff are all courteous and helpful. It is expensive, but so central for a great city experience.

121,5 star ,"I stay here regularly with work and I cannot fault it.
The staff are outstanding (a special shout-out to Geetika who was wonderful on reception) the service is 5 star and the rooms, toiletries, amenities are fabulous.
I've stayed in some supposed 5 star hotels around the world and they do not come close to the quality and service you get at St James Court.
This is why I will always be a customer and nothing else comes close.
Amazing place- can't wait for my next visit!",5,2023,08,31
121,You must try it,"Fantastic staff, those on the reception area were warm and friendly
We stayed in a lovely room and in the morning was served a fabulous breakfast in the room, room service was brilliant, the greeting of the door staff made you instantly welcome, you simply cannot fault this hotel.
 ",5,2023,08,29
121,Not the Taj experience one hopes for,"The manager at breakfast was racist. There were a white couple seating in a table which was between ours and another brown couple, the manager came to them and said ""if you are feeling uncomfortable I can shift your table"" didn't ask us or the other couple but just them which the couple politely declined and said they are good where they are seated. The fact that the manager himself was Indian and the hotel is run by an Indian hotelier to witness such racism was embarrassing. Have stayed in 4 different Taj hotels worldwide never had such an experience. 

There was a weird smell in the room and corridor, the property looks and feels like its not yet renovated. Lot of dust in the room, old furniture and cushioning, very dark. The AC shows the filter needs to be cleaned, the heater doesn't work. You can hear noises from other room and outside. The shower is broken as well. Hotel charges 7.5 pounds for 750ml water bottle. 

The lift at the right side is broken and shakes when you are in it and when it stops it feels like the lift would break. There was a line when we were about to check out which caused a delay of 20 minutes. Never witnessed such a thing in any hotel till date. ",2,2023,08,29
121,Excellent hotel. Thin walls.,"Excellent hotel with impeccable EVERYTHING! From the moment I arrived to the moment I checked out, I felt very attended to. The public areas are superb and my room was spacious and comfortable, with many amenities.
My one complaint is that the walls are thin between rooms. I couldn’t hear any street noise but I was awakened at midnight by my neighbor, on speakerphone. I could hear almost every word from both sides of the conversation. I was truly shocked as I’ve stayed at many higher end London hotels and have never experienced this - most are totally soundproofed. 
If this isn’t important to you then absolutely stay at this hotel. It really is perfection. I have to get sleep though so will be going back to the other hotel I like where I can’t hear anything at all through the walls.",4,2023,08,27
121,Comfortable good Stay friendly staff good breakfast ,Welcoming staff Clean room comfortable matress Shower jet not provide sufficient flow for good bath change shower head for wide  flow Tub is only place to take shower Getting in and out inconvenient. ,4,2023,08,26
121,Simply perfect - our favourite hotel in London.,"Our favourite hotel in London - it's the attention to detail, from the welcome smile at the door to the scent of jasmine as you enter the hotel lobby; the relaxed yet luxury decor; wonderfully comfortable bed and bedlinen, bathroom layout etc. 

Then there's the courtyard - the architecture and layout is stunning, a hidden gem in London where you can retreat from the busyness of the city while still being a stone's throw away. St. James Park on its doorstep, tube station round the corner.

Then of course there's the service - every single member of staff so attentive and we feel that they genuinely care that we have the best experience possible.

And finally the chaat at TH@51 - delicious!! Followed by a pot of mint tea sitting on a comfortable sofa chair looking up at lit butterflies swaying in the breeze. Simply perfect.",5,2023,08,24
121,地点不错，但是车开不进去,"The hotel is situated in a good location. It's clean, but the interior decor and furnishings don't resemble those of a four-star hotel; they are more akin to an Airbnb property. The hotel staff is very polite.",4,2023,08,23
121,Great hotel!,"Great service overall. Great family room, and a very warm and courteous staff. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast, which was plentiful. The location is wonderful being close to Buckingham Palace and walking distance to many of the feature attractions London has to offer. ",5,2023,08,21
121,Great Location - A rather forgettable Taj Experience!,"Great location right next to Buckingham Palace, Westminster and Victoria. Front office staff are extremely courteous and are willing to help wherever possible. Akshay, Clifa and most specifically Sunaina, deserve a special mention. These guys are superstars who are striving to keep up the Taj brand. 

Unfortunately, the housekeeping and a few other internal teams do not support the front office. Our stay was for 10 nights, and we had repeated issues with the housekeeping and technical team. 

Breakfast at TH51 is great, with a wide variety of offerings. One must try at least a meal each in House of Ming and Quilon.

I would like to stay at St James' Court Taj when I am scheduled to visit London later this year again but am concerned with the repeated issues.

121,Wonderful hotel,Beautiful and comfortable hotel with lovely and helpful check in and concierge staff. Included Breakfast was also amazing. I had read some reviews of parts of the hotel not being so nice and I did walk thru an older section on the way to our rooms that I think this referred to so if booking worth it to make sure you are in the executive area.,5,2023,08,19
121,Good experience,Overall we had a super stay at the hotel. The hospitality was amazing. The breakfast was fabulous with a wide range of dishes. The only thing was that our room was a bit dark as it had a translucent window which could not be opened . So it was a bit suffocating when we were in the room . When you are booking your room please make sure you book the right one with a proper window.,3,2023,08,19
121,Wonderful Stay in Central London ,Awesome location and the rooms are so tastefully done. Spacious rooms with great beds. The bathrooms were very neat and comfortable. The service was impeccable. The morning breakfast had a good spread.,5,2023,08,18
121,London Stay,Great place to stay - very welcoming staff and helpful. Amazing food and service at the TH@51. Rooms are excellent and housekeeping is at its best. The location is very central with easy access to key areas of central london. Looking forward to visiting again soon.,5,2023,08,17
121,Enjoyable stay. comfortable and welcoming,"Staff are pleasant and friendly. Courtyard restaurant food is really good, great choice and interesting. great location for accessing the sights of London as well as for business. would definitely recommend ",5,2023,08,15
121,"Great hotel , shame about the room.","The hotel is excellent, lovely lobby, bar and extremely friendly staff.
Unfortunately our room was in the unmodified part of the hotel. The room was very dated and had an unpleasant faint urine smell in the closet. We expected more , paying over £300 per night for our stay.",3,2023,08,15
121,Amazing…,"Sherol at the Check in was extremely kind and friendly.The chefs at TH 51 Chef Mohit and Amarjit, Managers Duncan and Abburaj were thoughtful and took note of all my dietary requirements made sure our stay was enjoyable and comfortable.Thank you to the team who went above and beyond. Brett, William and the Concierge team was helpful.",4,2023,08,13
121,Amazing place but avoid the bar,Staying in an apartment next door. 5 star accommodations - and expect 5 star prices. That said 60 pounds for a rum and a Paloma - deserves people to know … don’t bother having a drink here! Stay and enjoy all of the amenities but avoid the bar if you don’t want to feel ripped off.,2,2023,08,11
121,Highly recommended!!,We stayed here for a week.A wonderful property.lots of open spaces.Particularly loved the courtyard. It was stunning.we ate there a couple of times good food and ambience. The room was spacious and lovely.we were particularly happy with size as it is a rarity in london.The service was excellent. The staff was friendly and helpful. excellent property. ,5,2023,08,11
121,Fine Indian Hospitality ,"There was a warm welcome at the entrance from Brett on our first arrival and this set the tone for a very enjoyable stay!! A friendly check in was provided by Leah, who did a great job explaining the hotel facilities.  We were very grateful for an upgrade,  as we had a celebration! Room was beautifully appointed, with a comfortable bed and it was quiet. Really appreciated some of the bedroom facilities such as tea/coffee,  water, iron/board, bathroom nightlight,  blackout curtains and writing desk. We enjoyed a hearty breakfast in the restaurant for our stay each morning.  Good selection of cereals,  fruit, cold cuts, hot food, pastries etc. The muesli was absolutely delicious,  my only regret was that I only tried it on the last morning.  Enjoyed a couple of drinks in the bar on Saturday evening,  after a busy day out and about in London.  There is a very nice courtyard,  where drinks and food can be enjoyed.  Location is excellent,  Tube is only a short stroll. Brett remembered my name every day and we enjoyed a few exchanges each day at the main entrance. He is a real asset for the hotel. All the staff we encountered were super friendly.  Thanks to the team for a super stay that we really enjoyed!! Tom McFadden ",5,2023,08,10
121,Highly recommend!,"Great location right next ro the Buckingham Palace and historic places. Wonderful and very friendly service. Great breakfasts !  
My special thanks to the front desk receptionist ANUJA. She is very professional and helped with all necessary arrangements with our stay. We are very pleased with ouer stay and highly recommend this hotel for business and pleasure travels.",5,2023,08,10
121,Our Second Stay,"Our second stay. We enjoyed every second starting from the doormen who welcomed us all the way through till they wished us well on our journey home. Reception great very fast and friendly full of information. The room was a premium room very well appointed bath and shower tea coffee and also coffee machine and wonderful biscuits.for our morning coffee in bed which was very comfortable.
Breakfast was very good lots of choice buffet and items cooked to order. Our favourite place was the courtyard just to sit out in of an evening remarkably quiet very beautiful place and well kept. Staff couldn’t help you enough making sure all was ok.
Hotel location is fantastic access for everything a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, theatre land and St James Park tube station. 
Bar open till you stop drinking always nice especially after a night at the theatre. Room service 24/7.
The Spa and gym a favourite of mine so tranquil from the swim in jacuzzi to the steam rooms, sauna and showers a place to lie down and relax in the warmth very very quiet loved it.
Not much more to say other than we will return again.

Top Hotel ",5,2023,08,10
121,Great place if you are not a breakfast person,"Absolutely love the hotel. The location is great, reception staff is very friendly and co operative, food is nice. Stayed here with family for 4 nights. And staff helped us with early check in too. Highly appreciated.  
Few points to consider though:
1. No views from room. So if you are looking for view, this is not a great place.
2. Breakfast restaurant is smaller compared to expected number of guests so be ready to wait fr 30 mins before go get a seat.
3. Staff is restaurant during breakfast is not responsive enough & little rude too.
4. Breakfast service is very slow. Most of the days, we missed our planned excursion due to breakfast.  ",4,2023,08,09
121,Not Taj Standard,"Not a Taj experience at all . Housekeeping is extremely bad. Breakfast is  terrible and ver repetitive . Rooms are very stuffy. 
Only the paid restaurants are good standard.
Avoid this place for now. ",2,2023,08,07
121,"St James Court, a Taj hotel","We had an absolutely brilliant experience. From the moment we checked in the staff were courteous and friendly to going to our room. The room was large and clean with a good sized bathroom and lots of top quality toiletries for us all to use. We ate in the restaurant Th@51, and the staff were super helpful. The food was delicious, especially the pakoras which were amazing. we were rushing for the theatre so explained that to the staff and our food came quickly, but was still hot and fresh. In the evening we went into the Hamptons Bar and again the staff were very friendly, courteous and professional. Once back in the room, the bed was super comfortable and the pillows were perfect too. We all slept well!
Next morning we went for breakfast, and although it was very busy, we were seated within a few minutes. There was lots of choice for all 4 of us. The only 'hiccup' was our order for poached eggs got 'lost', the replacement didn't turn up either. But on the 3rd time of asking it came fresh and perfectly cooked. Overall a great experience, and we cannot wait to return!",5,2023,08,07
121,How away from home  and near the throne!,"The hotel is homely and just a stone throw from Buckingham palace . The renovated rooms as at aug 2023 are very nice . The ambience is completely nice . There is a particular staff who’s very helpful
A mr. Ridge, He was loved by our kids very much. ",5,2023,08,05
121,Warm and Calm stay.,"Fantastic warm welcome, a very calming hotel experience with great staff happy to help with a smile. Unfortunately only here for one night but will return when I have more time. Will look forward to visiting the restaurants next door.",5,2023,08,04
121,There are better options for vacationers,"Hotel property is very nice and if that is the only reason for your visit, you will be happy. The location is excellent. But it all goes down hill thereafter.  Service in the restaurants, the concierge, and the bar was not good, considering a 12.5% service fee is added for the staff non-performance.",2,2023,08,04
121,Taj London,"Very good place in central London . From arrival checkin to the departure everything had Taj touch in terms of hospitality and services. Taj did accommodate us in the best possible way in terms of early checkin , which was very much helpful after taking a long night flight and jet legged.",4,2023,08,03
121,Great place  to stay,"Great location  - staff is friendly and professional. Rooms are sharply appointed. Great hotel for business or leisure. The hotel is very close to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, and many many great restaurants, shopping , and pubs.",5,2023,08,02
121,Nice weekend stay,Nice weekend stay. Good location near Buckingham and the parks. Room was very well maintained.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Pleasant breakfast in the outdoor restaurant. It was my second stay. Would consider another stay next time I visit London.,5,2023,08,01
121,Excellent One Night Stay!,"A warm welcome from Beatta on the front desk with the high standards that you would expect.  A free room upgrade, some cake and an excellent couples massage from the great team in the spa and a tasty dinner in Quilon.

Boys behind the bar could be a bit more attentive but that didn’t spoil an incredible visit.

Breakfast the following morning was exceptional.  Not really sure how the team could have made our stay any better.",5,2023,07,31
121,Not as great as it used to be! Getting far to expensive,"We've stayed at the hotel many times including at 51 Buckingham Gate. We felt for the price we paid (which is so much higher than it ever was) the overall service wasn't what were used too. Something wasn't quite the same. We visited twice in the last 6 months and paid a lot more for the same type of room. Many of the rooms are very dated and the bathrooms need attention. Unfortunately we didn't take pictures.

The staff are friendly and polite. The food was good. Overall service was just OK. They've always been fantastic but this time round something didn't feel quite right.

We treated the kids to an impromptu stay as it's their favourite hotel but I don't think we'll be going back any time soon sadly.

",3,2023,07,31
121,A little London luxury,"From the moment you walk in the staff are fabulously attentive and friendly,  nothing is too much trouble. The Spa was so relaxing and with lovely facilities. A meal in the courtyard is highly recommended with gorgeous surroundings and a delicious fusion menu. Even the bar had great staff who created off menu cocktail to perfection. Our room had everything we needed for a fabulous nights stay in a great location for all the London sights and shops! What more could you want. Thank you Taj we will be back soon.",5,2023,07,25
121,Extremely kind and family hotel,"We stayed at the Taj due to a member of our family being critically ill. The whole FO team i immediately took care of us Akshay, Sunaina, Dharini, Sree, Shara  along with everyone else on the team was phenomenal. They became our family away from home helping us navigate every aspect of this unfortunate situation of our loved one in the hospital.  We cannot thank you all enough for making our entire stay so comfortable and homely. It is very rare to have an entire FO team be so great, caring and attentive.   Also Victoria and team were also so attentive.  We appreciate you all so much.",5,2023,07,25
121,Is it really a Taj?,"I stayed here many times earlier since Taj is my favourite chain I don’t think twice to book anywhere else when there is a Taj in the city. 
It’s been over an year since my last visit and it is nothing like I saw it last. People are unwelcoming, clueless of amenities and tasteless food. It is sad that everyone in our group felt the same. 
We tried the newly opened Chinese restaurant too which was equally bad. 
I know London is a different city post Covid but I wish Taj could bring back its forte which is its warm welcome and service!",3,2023,07,24
121,Unbeatable and Unparalled ,"Each time you stay at a Taj Property, you feel the experience can't be bettered, but the next time it surpasses it, and this continues.
A 2 night stay at St James Court, Taj London was just brilliant, absolutely top class. The property, service, hygiene, food, arrival and check out experience, hospitality - all was just unparalled with the charasmatic Mehrnavaz at the helm. 
No wonder this property is a favourite with who's who of the corporate world, Bollywood and politics who want to experience the ultimate in hospitality and Indianess outside India. 
Taj has not only mastered the art of perfection in hospitality n experience, but keeps on innovating, leaving others far far behind and unbeatable.",5,2023,07,24
121,First time,"The receptionist showed no pressure at all. Upon check-in, we hoped for a room on a slightly higher floor. However, when we asked, she immediately responded with a flat ""No"" without even checking for availability. It feels like she enjoys saying no to us for everything. Nonetheless, the room, amenities, and area were comfortable for our stay overall.",3,2023,07,22
121,From the ordinary to the extraordinary,"This hotel is just lovely . 
It is a very short walk away from Buckingham Palace . 
Our room was spacious, spotless and very comfortable. 
The staff went out of their way to make our stay special . 
The breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice . 
We wish that we had figured in time to have an evening meal at the hotel ; we will next time .
Overall an excellent hotel with very attentive staff 

",5,2023,07,22
121,Underwhelming! ,"My recent stay at St James Court from 30th June to 5th of July was incredibly underwhelming. I cannot in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone. I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed with my experience and must admit that this stay has tarnished the image of Taj Hotels worldwide. As a loyalist of the Taj brand, this visit has left me feeling incredibly discouraged, and I will be avoiding this hotel at all costs in the future.",1,2023,07,21
121,Perfect Location,"Beautiful room.  Very helpful concierge staff who made suggestions to make our stay even more enjoyable.  Centrally located between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey within easy walking distance.  Also two blocks from Victoria Station Underground.  Best breakfast buffet we have ever has.  Enjoyed having salad
and Indian options. ",5,2023,07,20
121,Pure chaos  and mayhem,"Taj London does not do justice to the Taj brand. Being an avid Taj connoisseur, this hotel is a joke. The receptionist cannot speak proper English, no instructions are given, elevator got locked and no one came to rescue us. Emergency help failure and a possible security breach is highly likely. I had to support my family come out of this dangerous situation. Food is ok. The manager Mr Rajat tried to pay our food bill to compensate the damage but we did not take the offer. This property needs major leadership support and hire vigilant staff who are customer oriented so that the image of Taj propers, if not, the hotel will lose its charm and customers.",1,2023,07,19
121,An enjoyable experience ,"The staff were excellent,always smiling, courteous, friendly and accomadating.The lobby,bar and bedroom very clean.
2 negatives:The check in process very slow. 
The 5% discretionary charge is disappointing considering the hotel stay was very expensive.We did not use the dining areas and we paid service charge on drinks so why this added charge?
Would still recommend this hotel.Close to Buckingham palace, St James Park,Westminster Abbey and 5 mins walk to Victoria Station.",4,2023,07,18
121,Not worth it,"The hotel has been refurnished but only partially, we got a bad old  room.
Its a large hotel for a small breakfast restaurant, everyday there were large waiting lines to be served.
The service, polite but lacks experience.
Its too expensive for the experience.",1,2023,07,17
121,Good place to stay or is it?,"Great location. Services are deficient, due lack of staff or organisation.
On days the the entire hotel restaurants were sold out for a private party. and, for residents there was no priority. One had to hunt outside .
idea of staying in hotel, is too feel is ones home",3,2023,07,16
121,The worst treatment from front desk staff ,"The hotel is clean and the wait staff are great, unfortunately cannot say the same thing for front desk staff. We got there around 10 pm and although we paid for executive room, ours was very small with a horrible view of walls and rod irons, we immediately went back to request another room but was told there are no managers, and should come back in the morning. The next day we had an all day tour but before leaving spoke to so called manager who assured us she'll change our room to a one with better view and more specious
The new room was a little bigger but the view was worse and the bathroom much smaller, it was like a slap in the face. Also, a few minutes after checking out my wife asked for a bottle of water, the front desk staff, the same so called manager, made her walk to the bar with her and she offered my wife a glass of tap water when my wife refused to take it and asked again for bottled water, she rudely said there are some in your room, my wife told her that we just checked out and her response was in that case you have to pay for the water. We travel quite often and never been treated like this. I should mention that if you want to sit in their courtyard watch out for mice, a lot of them running around specially at night time.",2,2023,07,15
121,Wonderful!,Great location! Great hotel! The breakfast is awesome! The concierge was very helpful as to getting around on the tube and getting to Wimbledon and the train station to Bletchley!  Also the wait staff were very gracious. ,5,2023,07,15
121,Charming Victorian Property Next to Buckingham Palace,"Beautiful Victorian masterpiece with its famous Shakespearean Courtyard. Its location is perfect for business as it is placed between Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament. Crisp and elegant, with an easy charm with modern ameinities. If you are someone looking to enjoy good food particularly Indian and Oriental, they have good restaurants. The staff is real caring and hospitable.  ",4,2023,07,15
121,Breakfast is an absolute scrum and not worth the room,"Room, staff, hygiene and public areas all good.
Breakfast was very disappointing.  Waited ages to get a seat and then the food was fairly mediocre, which would be ok for a 2-3 star but for a room charge around 400-500 a night, it felt a bit lame.",2,2023,07,14
121,"TERRIBLE – SO BAD IT WAS EMBARRASSING (ROOM CHANGES, BROKEN A/C AND INCOMPETENT ENGINEER)","We had a terrible stay in June. Do not be fooled by the hotel’s good reputation - find another hotel!

I was traveling with my wife and two teenagers and were excited to stay at the St. James Court.  It was our kids’ first trip to Europe and London was the first stop. We had heard good things about the hotel and that Taj has a good reputation.  WE WERE TERRIBLY WRONG.  DO NOT BE SUCKERS LIKE US. 

We had a suite and a room with 2 twin beds.  Our travel agent had called the hotel twice to confirm that the kids’ room would have 2 twin beds (rather than a king bed). When we arrived at approximately 10pm on Tuesday, we were disappointed to find the kids’ room had a single king bed which could not be split into two beds. After a significant fuss and even a call from our travel agent to their contact at the hotel, the hotel agreed to move the kids to another room. (ROOM CHANGE #1 – for those keeping score at home.)  But this room did not have working air conditioning (BROKEN AIR CONDITIONER #1 – again for those keeping score.)  We were there during the mid-June heat wave, so air conditioning was not a nice-to-have but a MUST-HAVE. The manager (Rajat) said this was the last room with two twin beds and said they would provide a portable air conditioner for the room. (The portable A/C ultimately did not work and the kids slept with the window open to try to cool the room.)  The manager also agreed that the next day when we went out for our tour of London, they would pack all of the kids’ belongings and move them to another room with twin beds and working air conditioning. I agreed (as there was no alternative) and thanked the manager.  

We went out Wednesday morning for our tour and told the hotel we were leaving (so they could make the room switch).  When we arrived back that afternoon/evening, we found the hotel had done nothing. I was upset and spoke with the manager (Duane).  He asked if the kids could again use the portable air conditioner, and I told him no (because it did not work!) and that I expected the hotel to do what had been agreed to last night – that is, to move the kids to a room with twin beds and working air conditioning. He ultimately agreed and they moved the kids as they had previously agreed.  He was helpful and made sure the room had working air conditioning and that we were satisfied.  (ROOM CHANGE #2.) 

(Minor issue #1:  we had informed the front desk on Wednesday that the couch in our suite was badly stained – as it looked like something had died on it – and the hotel said they would clean it or replace it.  They did neither, but as we had working A/C we simply put bathrobes over the couch to sit on it.)

(Minor issue #2:  the hotel breakfast was fine, but they were very understaffed.  We would sometimes ask for some generic item (coffee, soy milk, ketchup, etc.) and it would frequently take 10+ minutes.)

My wife and I had housekeeping service our suite on Thursday (after we had been there 2 nights) - what a mistake!  We came back after a full day of touring and dinner and discovered that the air conditioning was broken. (BROKEN AIR CONDITIONER #2.) The room was heating up (remember… ongoing heat wave) and the control panel/thermostat for the air conditioning had a flashing red light.  We called the front desk and they sent up the engineer. He initially told me me that the air conditioning was working, but finally admitted that flashing red light was not normal and the room was getting warm. I told him that prior to having the room serviced by housekeeping, the air conditioning worked great and there was no red flashing light. The engineer responded (this is verbatim – I am not exaggerating) “then you should call housekeeping and ask them what they did.” I told him that I was not going to call housekeeping because (a) even if they knew what they did (unlikely) they would not know how to fix it and (b) it was actually his job (not housekeeping’s job) to determine the problem and fix it. I reminded him that he was the engineer and that the housekeepers were not engineers. He said he could not fix it.

I went downstairs and again spoke with the night manager (Duane) that had helped me the previous evening with the kids’ room.  He was very apologetic. He asked me if a portable air conditioner would suffice. I again told him no, as it had not worked in my kids’ room the first night. He and an assistant showed me another suite. The suite was generally very nice and about the same size as our existing suite (and the couch was actually not stained!), but the bathroom was tiny – i.e., about a 1/3 the size of our existing bathroom and barely big enough for one person. I would have taken it as we were desperate but (wait for it...) the air conditioning was broken. (BROKEN AIR CONDITIONER #3.)  The manager initially disagreed with me, but I was insistent so he had his assistant get a ladder and climb up to the air vent to check the temperature of the air blowing into the room – and the assistant confirmed that the air conditioning was not working. The manager told me that unfortunately this was the only other suite they had in the hotel, and that to move us to another room with working air conditioning would require that my wife and I take a standard room (even though we had reserved a suite months’ earlier). I told him this was unacceptable and that this was his problem to fix. I said that even if it meant moving us into the presidential suite, they needed to find us a suite, not a standard room, that had working in air conditioning.  I said this was absurd and embarrassing for the St. James Court as heat waves are now part of life in London.  I said this was also embarrassing for me, as I had told my family that we were going to stay a nice hotel and we had problem after problem.  He said he understood and apologized. 

After about 30 minutes, he said he had found a suite.  It was a two-bedroom suite over in the residences (the adjacent building) and it had working air conditioning. So at approximately midnight on our third evening, my wife and I packed all of our belongings and moved to the new suite. (ROOM CHANGE #3.)

Shockingly, on the last day of stay (day #3 / night #4) there were no additional room changes or A/C failures.  BUT THE POWER MYSTERIOUSLY WENT OUT IN THE KIDS’ ROOM THAT NIGHT (WITH ONE OF THEM IN THE SHOWER IN THE SUDDENLY PITCH-BLACK BATHROOM AT THE TIME).  The hotel was not sure why this happened, but they eventually got the power back on (likely using a different engineer than the incompetent gentleman who suggested I call housekeeping to diagnose and fix our suite’s broken A/C) – and told the kids not to use one particular light switch.  (So while it was nearly cause for yet another room change, they were able to stay in that room.)

Overall, it was a terrible stay and there is no excuse for such poor conditions.  Hot weather and London are no longer mutually exclusive.  I was embarrassed by the continuous problems, inferior service and failing accommodations.  I cannot recommend the St. James Court at any price.  STAY AWAY. Do not get fooled by the Taj reputation – it is not deserved as I unfortunately learned (the hard way).  Hopefully the Taj’ reputation will quickly become as tarnished as the St. James Court’s third-rate accommodations. 

Footnote: when we flew home from Amsterdam two weeks later, our flight from Amsterdam to London was delayed and we missed our connection to the U.S., forcing us to stay in London for one additional night.  Our travel agent got us into The Capital hotel in London.  IT WAS EXCELLENT.",1,2023,07,12
121,Not Really a Taj hotel !,"I booked this weekend break for my 10 year old daughter, partner and I for some sightseeing, theatre and dining. The hotel was a great location and beautiful building, decor and a friendly greeting at check in with a lovely touch of free teddy and gift bag for my daughter (though the room was £400 per night so not strictly speaking free).  Reception lady was very friendly and the room was spacious and airy. However, bizarrely for a hotel of this standard and cost the in room fridge was empty no mini bar a lumpy bed and a rather pathetic shower. We have stayed in 3 prior Taj hotels in India and the standard of this hotel does not come close to the Indian standards unfortunately.  The breakfast staff were extremely friendly, though, again, the breakfast was not a high standard, small yoghurt pots, no plain greek available,  flies on the fruit, the orange juice was not fresh.  When i requested a table for 3 the manager seated us on a small table for 2, when i reiterated that my partner was joining us shortly the manager questioned me on where he was and then said he would find an extra chair which never materialised and had to be requested a further 3 times before it turned up.  The same with requests for coffee which we had to keep asking for.  When we returned back to the hotel bar after our theatre trip around 10.30 we were refused our request for food, apparently their is no food available at the hotel at all apart from breakfast and the separate restaurant next door which was long closed by then.  For a hotel of this cost to not serve any bar snacks or food at all is quite ridicolous the next evening we tried to order a drink and were told the bar was closed !!!! it was 11pm !!!! the American couple sat next to us who had just flown in were hungry and could not get any food at all, what shocking service - not even a basic sandwich.  We attempted to order drinks from our room on roomservice - we were told no problem - they never materialised !. On checking out on the final morning - i checked that the £100 deposit that was taken off my card on check in for extras went back onto my card since we hadnt been lucky enough to get any extra's despite all our best efforts!  and was told there was a £50 service charge - so only half of my deposit was refunded to my card, - this is unbelievably cheeky and i feel that many guests especially if in a rush may not even notice that their full deposit had not been refunded especially if they had extras .  I explained to reception that i did not wish to pay £50 for service when the service we had received had been so poor and we had already paid £800 for 2 nights and was told that this would be refunded to my card im still waiting to see this credit on my card.  I would be happy to tip the friendly door staff and waiting staff appropriately however i do not like the extremely dubious practice of taking my money off my card in such a sneaky way especially after we had so many issues.   I will not be returning to this Taj, it tarnishes the good name of the Taj hotels !

121,Disappointing,"Room was old and dated, does not reflect what was in the pictures at all. Bathtub was stained and brown. Service was non-existent especially during breakfast. 
The doormen were welcoming and grounds were beautiful but the room we stayed in was the opposite of the lobby and public areas. 
We have stayed in many hotels ranging from 3-star to 5-star hotels but this hotel stay was the most disappointing. We will not return.",2,2023,07,09
121,Horrible Experience,"Really poor service, arrogant staff and unsatisfactory, small executive suite room, with old interiors and design.

Staff is not friendly and is unwilling to help the customers. 

They also give false assurances then retract their words.

They first told us they would move us to another room, slipped a note to give us the details of the room and the additional price, and even showed us the room but at the last moment when we were waiting with our luggage packed, called to inform us that room had maintenance issues. 

On another instance, they assured us that we could check out late but called us on the check out day to ask us to leave early.

Hygiene standards have dropped as well and we heard customers on our next table complain about hair in the food, completely ruined the dining experience for us.

The hotel has lost its charm and needs alot of improvement.

",1,2023,07,09
121,Comfortable stay,"Great location and ease of the stay. Staff friendly and rooms very clean and comfortable. Tube station around the corner and quite s few restaurants nearby. Great stay. Breakfast was okay, the tables in the restaurant are not positioned correctly as certain tables are affected by passing guests.",4,2023,07,08
121,I would rather stay in the embalming center of a funeral home then at this hotel again.,Absolute chaos and systems and process (or lack of I guess) overrule customer experience. Saying Maam and Sir does not make a luxury hotel. Literally dread the idea of ever staying in a Taj hotel again. While they brand themselves as a luxury resort I have had better experiences with a Residence Inn at midnight outside an airport after my flight was canceled then staying here.,1,2023,07,07
121,Not worth it at half the price,"I had stayed at the St James 6 years ago & enjoyed it. When I returned recently it was an entirely different affair.
I had booked the same package I had before & was put into a room that would've been considered shabby by airport motel standards.
The bathroom fixtures were rusted, the laminated furniture was chipped, the TV was on top of the dresser taking up any & all counter space & the carpeting was badly stained. I had to unplug a lamp to use an electrical outlet. There were dead phone jacks everywhere, but no electrical outlets.
Itold the front desk that it was completely unacceptable & was told I had to stay in it for 2 nights. After 2 nights, I was moved to a room facing a schoolyard with a dozen children playing soccer so loudly I could barely hear the front desk clerk on the phone telling me the room was high enough to not hear the kids! I insisted it was not a quiet room. I was told I had to wait 2 hours to be moved. I was never offered even a cup of tea for my trouble.
The front desk & housekeeping (& if the mildew smell of the towels is from in house laundry) the laundry are woefully inadequately trained.",1,2023,07,06
121,Fantastic stay!!! A million thanks to all!!,"First of all A Very Big Thank You to all the wonderful people at St. James Court, A Taj Hotel for making our stay really awesome and memorable!!! It was a long cherished dream of mine to stay at this hotel and it came true!! And might I add I wasn’t in the least bit disappointed rather I was thrilled to meet such excellent people and the warm hospitality!!! The staff was extremely polite nice and helpful and I really love those qualities in people!!! The service was quick and satisfying and the food was simply amazing!!! We left the hotel a happy lot and sweet memories lingering in our hearts!!!",5,2023,07,06
121,Excellent,"The service was impeccable. Staff was courteous and friendly. The room was decent size and had all amenities. 
The breakfast was outstanding. A vast spread with lot of Indian choices. 
The location is wonderful. Walking distance to almost all of Central London. 
Will be back again",5,2023,07,05
121,Trip to London,This was a beautiful hotel close to Buckingham Palace. The room and bathroom amenities were great! There was a bakery across the street that was convenient for breakfast and underground transportation was a short distance away. I would definitely stay here again! ,5,2023,07,03
121,Tajness in London,St. James’ court has a great location & highly recommend for families. We had a great time staying here for a full week as a family. The courtyard remains a special attraction at this busy hotel. We had a great stay overall- thank you !,5,2023,07,03
121,Nice location but beware of hidden charges and room service,"The hotel's central location, proximity to my beloved St. James's Park, and Indian ownership made me select it over better options.  The Executive room was reasonably nice; the service staff were courteous and professional, and most would greet guests upon accosting them. Duty Manager Shara deserves special mention for her helpful and attentive attitude.   That said, a couple of things stuck out like a sore thumb.  First, during advance confirmation the hotel staff did a ""bait and switch "" number on me: I was upgraded to a better room for a fee.  What was left unsaid was that it became a ploy to impose a per-day 5% service charge during check-out over and above my prepaid booking expense.  That unreasonable theme was on display when I was charged GBP 40 for a plate of Palak Paneer and one Naan, delivered to my room!  My advice to future guests is to avoid In-room Dining (whose menu is conveniently hidden behind a QR code) like you'd the plague or Covid.",3,2023,07,02
121,What you cannot imagine...happens here.,"I had planned travelling with my family to this hotel in June/July 2023 and we made the reservation last winter. As another cheaper rate came up few days later,  I cancelled the previous booking for free and we made a new one.
However, due to a change in our itinerary, we finally decided to go to Scotland instead and we cancelled the second booking free of charge at this hotel definetly 8 months ago.

Surprisingly, a charge of almost 700 pounds was made yesterday to my credit card. They say that there are 2 reservations but only one cancellation, (which it's no true as I have all the details). And because of that, they charge the first night. 
When i sent them the 2 cancellation details, they answer that the reservation manager will investigate this issue in 2 days because it's weekend time.
Everything is very unprofessional.",1,2023,07,01
121,Great location but improvement is needed,"The location of the hotel is superb; within walking distance to the attractions most folks want to see in London.   Our room was old and small. In addition, the bathroom did not have ventilation so there was some mold on the ceiling.   It seems there are two wings to this hotel,  one wing with old dated rooms and the other that has not been updated.  We had the sound of the elevator going up and down in our room.  We asked to be moved, but were told our room was quiet compare to others.  The buffet breakfast was very good and the AC was very cold, a rarity in London. ",3,2023,06,28
121,Fantastic Experience,"TAJ St James has always been Fantastic this was my 4 th Visit in 11 months and Many More to Come 

Specially if one in a Vegetarian and an Indian this is the place to be Everything is Good 

GOD BLESS",5,2023,06,27
121,Housekeeping needs improvement,Everything was comfortable except for the housekeeping. The housekeeping people were little lousy and didn’t fill up the tea/coffee pantry with the supplies. Also they didn’t put adequate number of water bottles for our family of 4.,4,2023,06,27
121,Terrible,"Terrible service… with no guests around, but undone tables.. was a shame..it’s a hotel I have gone to for over three decades, never seen such nonchalance by the staff.. will not go back. I’m not here to write a story.. made my point, totally disappointed. Have had brilliant service before but the latest ne has been a write-off. Not the fantastic Taj I knew",1,2023,06,25
121,Wonderful Stay At The St. James,"Had a wonderful visit at the St. James Court.  The staff was very helpful (especially the waitress in the restaurant who greeted us each day with a smile and got my kids to try an Indian Breakfast).  The front desk said hello every time we passed, the room was ready exactly at 3 PM, and the rooms were huge.  We had an absolutely great time.  5 stars.",5,2023,06,23
121,Expected superior service- got Motel 6 service!!!!,"Very weak customer service and follow thru from arrival - no bellboy service for bags.. front desk- room not ready at 2:30 and promised follow-up when ready- they never did- by 4 my husband went back to desk and had to argue for a room. Terrible restaurant service- ordered coffee from hostess"" with attitude"" placed while waiting for room and it never came. 40 minute later we asked a bartender to follow up.
 We have traveled all over the world and were Terribly disappointed with the service. Will never stay at a TAJ hotel again.
 In the back of my mind i was wondering if this service was a result of us being American and white- seriously.",1,2023,06,22
121,Wonderful stay with the staff always with a smile and really to help.,"Wonderful stay with the staff always with a smile and really to help.

The location, rooms, people all were marvellous.

Everything was in order.

The morning breafast was as per our request which was for Jain food and the staff made sure we had the correct food.

Many Thanks to all at Taj",5,2023,06,22
121,Nice hotel and location ,"We had a two night stay here and the hotel room was large and comfortable for our family. The location is very convenient next to Buckingham Palace etc. The room service was extremely expensive, small portions, and took 45 mins longer than we were told when we placed the order. It's definitely a splurge to stay here. ",3,2023,06,21
121,BAIT AND SWITCH,"Our experience with the London Taj hotel was excellent.  It’s location is fabulous, near many attractions and convenient to several different underground lines.

The staff were all polite and helpful.

My only complaint was the “DISCRETIONARY SERVICE FEE of 5%” which was added to the bill.  When I booked, through Trip Advisor, I was advised that the price quoted “INCLUDES ALL TAXES & FEES”.  I strongly resent all hidden fees such as this one imposed by the Taj hotel.",4,2023,06,21
121,"Try a different Taj in a different city - this one is some ""flash"" no substance","We were super excited to stay at this property as we've had stellar experiences at other Taj hotels.    Unfortunately, this is was very inferior - the hotel, restaurant, and staff are far below expectations in nearly every way.  Our experience started with us being told that the Chinese restaurant is fantastic with the concierge pointing us to the restaurant to make reservations.  We did so, only to find out 1 1/2 hours later that we went to their ""European/Indian"" restaurant.  The server did not know what liquor they had, or what the descriptions of the food were.  Despite there only being 4 other tables in the restaurant and the ""head"" server having a helper - they didn't get us drinks for 10 minutes, could not figure out one out of 6 salt shakers (they were all empty), couldn't remember the orders (serving soup without a spoon is an example) and on and on.  It was 300 pounds for what should have been a great experience that was barely edible in most cases.

Upon check-in our room was about 78 degrees, we called down and an engineer came right up - after about 30 seconds - he couldn't figure out what was going on and asked us if 19 celsius was acceptable - it was, three hours later our room was the same.  I called two times over about 45 minutes and despite being assured someone is going to take care of it - no one ever came up.  I also called down to request ice and it took over 90 minutes to get the ice, they said the room was marked do not disturb (it was not).  After about another 30 minutes of me calling down and being assured someone would be ""right up"" - I asked for the manager to call us.  Again, after another 30 minutes or so - I went down to the desk.  After being told many different excuses I requested a different room - Shara acquiesced and provided a different room.  Wow - what a difference - from the bed, to the carpet, and overall appearance - a completely different experience.  I later found out that the hotel was undergoing some renovations - boy, did it need it.  The areas around the hotel were rough, indicative of a 2 star hotel - not a 4.5 as the review sites suggest.

Management really needs to get a handle on things before this type of property truly diminishes the brand.",2,2023,06,20
121,Worst breakfast experience,"I have been to many taj properties. Haven’t experienced such SAD breakfast experience . 
The service during breakfast buffet  is pathetic, looks like they have managing issues and waiting time to be seated and food being served takes ages. And finally when the food is served , it’s cold. 
They should either decrease the seating capacity or increase the staff. 
I had to cancel my breakfast here  for rest of my stay. ",1,2023,06,20
121,Nice hotel close to the palace.,"Room was nice and big.  Breakfast buffet had a big wide selection but service was slow.  Great location close to Buckingham palace. Provided coffee maker and tea kettle with shortbread biscuits.  Free water in the room.  Refrigerator, hair dryer, iron, robes, slippers, tower warmer, and bathroom accessories included.",5,2023,06,19
121,"Not a hotel, more like a hostel and disappointing",Disappointing. The rooms are not up to modern standards- no charge ports for USB and USB-C. The air conditioning was not working and room was hot. When I brought it to the staff attention they did not do anything  I had waited 5 hours and then finally got a manager. Moved to a new smaller room which wasn’t what I reserved. Anyway won’t stay here again,1,2023,06,19
121,The saddest hotel and standard has really dropped,"I have stayed here before but, now its like the saddest hotel trust me, if you have a better option please take it. Nothing close to the indian hospitality that we seek in an outside nation. Short staffed to the extent of some being rude, new people who dont follow instructions, ac not working complained but no one paid heed, then one person comes & says cant do anything till tomorrow, breakfast area is always so crowded that everyone is just running around without knowing what to do and whose order to take. Matchbox sized rooms. Duty manager akshay is the rudest person i have encountered after staying at so many hotels. Only saving grace is Sunaina soares who atleast has a smile. But except for her please give this hotel a big pass. Never again 😡",1,2023,06,15
121,Wknd stay,"Nothing comparable to experience at Taj
Always use Taj and will continue to do it. The interior needs updating but still will go back to stay at Taj.
Food quality awesome 
Staff very helpful
Welcoming feel",5,2023,06,13
121,Wonderful stay,"My husband, 11-year-old daughter and I stayed for 7 nights in an Executive Studio and had a wonderful stay. The room was very quiet and comfortable and even our daughter's rollaway bed was high quality! The staff were fantastic--warm and friendly and helpful throughout. The location was fantastic, with a tube stops nearby and easy walking distance to many sights. The included breakfast was fantastic and my daughter and I really enjoyed their ""Secret Garden"" tea. We also enjoyed the nearby Italian restaurant, Bon Gusto, as well as the bakery/coffee shop on the corner nearby. This was our first time staying at a Taj hotel and, based on this experience, we would go out of our way to do so again. ",5,2023,06,12
121,“Location is good”! ,"I requested a room in the other section where rooms were renovated or  updated but was told there’s an additional $50 for that section. I was given a room on the 2nd floor facing the courtyard, a very tired room with soft soggy  mattress.  Had to put a pillow in the middle of the bed not to slide in the middle! Trash from previous occupant still in bathroom not emptied! There’s an event at the Hotel courtyard on our 2nd night, it started around early afternoon the music was so loud we’re not able to relax from our long day sightseeing. Being an old Hotel the windows are not sound proof. I called the front desk 2x was told it’s ending around 11:00 pm, there’s nothing they could do but to wait until it’s over! The bathroom towel warmer rack was extremely hot, it touched my elbow on the way to the toilet one morning. The elbow pain from the burn was excruciating, it ruined the rest of our stay in London.",2,2023,06,12
121,Our favorite hotel while staying in England,"My daughter & I loved this hotel!! The patio & restaurant were so beautiful & cheerful. We loved the brick & white colors & architecture. All of the employees were so helpful & friendly & professional....in the restaurant, bars, spa, door men, front desk. We really felt welcomed. We enjoyed an Indian breakfast one morning as we like trying new food. The spa was so relaxing. I was so thankful you sold a bathing suit there as I forgot mine. The Tea at Kona was the BEST tea I have ever been to and I love going to tea! I highly recommend St. James Court Taj Hotel and it is so close to the tourist attractions.",5,2023,06,11
121,The best hotel to stay in ,"This was the first time we have stayed at this prestigious hotel. From the very beginning of our stay, we were both made to feel very comfortable. Absolutely everything we needed was provided by the most professional, friendly and welcoming staff. 

We sadly only stayed for one night but it certainly gave us the most amazing experience and gave us a really special time in London.

The breakfast was incredible. Every single member of staff were again, professional, welcoming , friendly and very attentive. There was a manager going round as well making sure we were happy. A really nice experience. 

The food, well that had to be seen and experienced to be believed. There was the standard cooked breakfast items, then just round the corner there was the best way to describe it as a banquet, there was all different types of food for everyone to enjoy.  It was totally delicious and very very tasty.

We both left totally full up . The best thing I can say is you really need to visit this hotel, even just for a night. It will really blow your mind. Prepare to be pampered…….",5,2023,06,10
121,Money?  Go elsewhere!,"Very small rooms.  Difficult to get in and out of shower.  Weird glass door.  Very mediocre light.  Small window.  Good news is good location and nearby Starbucks. Hotel coffee is terrible. Plus breakfast line is crazy. Service non existent.  If you can afford better, spend the money.",3,2023,06,04
121,Adequate but not what I expected,"A convenient hotel between Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace.  Convenient to a tube station.
We were in the old section, the furniture was worn and the room and the bathroom were small.  
Staff was very friendly.  Lobby is lovely.  Courtyard was pretty but not over the top.

121,Best hotel in London ,"Just return form a wonderful stay at taj hotel,  it was my granddaughter 9th birthday,  she was so spoilt by all the staff, she was given a back pack with books  craft and a bear , birthday cake in room , a biscuit with her  name on , we had a upgraded room it was amazing,  the hotel is fantastic location,  thank you to all the staff my granddaughter had a really amazing time  she crying when we had to leave ",5,2023,06,03
121,Lovely Experience.,"We arrived after an overnight flight from Arizona. We presented at the front desk about 8am. Too early for a formal check in. The front desk associate offered us a use of a smaller room to shower and refresh for the day ahead.  They also transferred our luggage once our room was ready.  
The location of the hotel is fantastic. Just steps from Buckingham Palace.  Would recommend to all who are looking for a wonderful experience while in London

121,Amazing hotel and service,"Fantastic hotel with outstanding service. Hotel staff is helpful and attentive, we had a great time staying and we've returned so many times.

I love the service & the Manager, Rajat, who I met for the very first time(quite impressive), is so friendly with the guests & always takes care to offer the best quality & puts forth one of the best recommendations as per your cuisin preferences! My personal favourites are breakfast pancakes & uttapam, rather any South Indian dish! Great atmosphere with really nice people. ",5,2023,05,31
121,Great experience,"Being frequent travelers to London , we were nervous on our decision to try a new hotel on our recent trip. We were not disappointed, the Taj exceeded all our expectations, the location , the building and the room was amazing, but the the staff outshined it all. I must mentioned our host at the lobby desk, Frederica who was both patient and understanding to all our questions and needs. Planning on returning to London and  will be staying at the Taj.",5,2023,05,30
121,Perfect stay in London,"Fantastic location, fabulous rooms and the staff were outstanding!

121,Great location,"Superb location and lovely hotel. Only real negative was at breakfast. The food was great but had to queue the wait for a seat at breakfast each day. The staff were polite and a choice of Indian breakfast I liked.

The courtyard is a delightful place for a drink",4,2023,05,30
121,"Nice Hotel, But Expected More","Positives: 1) Elegant lobby/bar/restaurant/courtyard; 2) Attentive professional friendly staff (one exception noted in Negatives); 3) Excellent breakfast buffet
Negatives: 1) Check-in took over an hour (arrived 15 minutes early at 2:45, was politely told to wait in nearby lobby by desk staff, who said they’d let us know when room was ready). After sitting in lobby for 35 minutes, I went back to the check-in desk at 3:20 and noticed the staff who was supposed to get us was no longer present, so spoke with other staff for several minutes, who scrambled to get us a room, but had to wait again and finally got into room at 3:45 an hour later. 2) Agree with recent Gidons51 review “bath was old and looked very worn”  - would say same about room as so different in quality after being in the top-notch lobby 3) A few minor items – no hairdryer in drawer marker “hairdryer”, half the tv channels didn’t work, and lamps by bed table didn’t always work (wiring issue?)

121,Everything is great except A/C unit and no solution found.,"Hotel's good, breakfast is great, rooms are great location is great. 
On our second night air conditioning stopped working, we reported it and it looks like no one has the authority to fix it or find a solution for it. 
Technician came to our room 3 times at 10 pm trying to fix the units (it's 2 units in one room, neither worked) he was very kind but couldn't fix it. He told us he was going to get a portable ac unit for us. It's now 12 am and we still can't get nor a fan nor a solution and people in the lobby kind of gets annoyed when I call (although I feel is more a cultural thing everyone being Hindu and it might just be a cultural difference but I feel like if they get annoyed when I call asking for a solution.)

Would stay here again but if this had happened mid summer it would've been impossible to sleep",2,2023,05,12

From the moment we entered the lobby until the time we checked out the service was excellent. The front desk personnel, the concierge, the housekeeping personnel and everyone we interacted with at the hotel were professional, pleasant and helpful. The breakfast in the lovely atrium restaurant was full of delicious choices and friendly personnel. The location of the hotel could not have been better. Just a short walk to two tube stations, St. James and Victoria, and a couple of minutes walk to Buckingham Palace. Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the Churchill War Rooms were an easy 10-15 minute walk. Wimbledon was a 30 minute ride on the tube. We would like to especially recognize ""Eddie"" from the hotel's business center. He was extremely helpful. This hotel was a great value which we strongly recommend  ",5,2023,05,11

121,Very disappointing,"While the hotel is lovely and expensive there was no television available during our stay which was specifically to enjoy the coronation. We were relying on television updates and news for this once in a lifetime trip   

We would have checked out, but no other hotels were available. No offers of discounts or additional amenities were made. We did suggest they provide complimentary breakfast  it looks like we will e charged for that after all 

Quite disappointing!!",2,2023,05,05
121,Excellent service all through!,Excellent experience from arrival to departure. My room (in the renovated section) was squeaky clean and the in-room dining was divine.

Looking forward to staying there again in July!

121,Short London trip with my daughter,"Wanted to share my experience with Rajat in chambers - he was simply outstanding in all aspects; service , attitude and attention to detail.

We, including the kids, really enjoyed the breakfast everyday at TH@51 and all the great staff that works there who were really caring and considerate.

From the time we checked until the time we departed, the entire team was extremely helpful and courteous. Special shout out to Akshay and Rajat for going out of their way to make us feel comfortable. 
During our stay we did manage to experience  the hi tea at Kona. The best Hi Tea we have experienced !! It had a Secret Garden theme which is spectacular and was loved by all age groups. A big thanks to Gabriel & Harsh for making the experience even more wonderful. Super friendly and fantastic choices. Can’t wait to go back again !!! Not only was the Hi tea delicious but the entire theme is so well thought and magical it keeps you excited for what’s coming up next. 

My little one (Hriaan) was completely awestruck with unravelling the mysteries and showing off skills in trying to fly away butterflies. 
Can’t wait to be back at Kona and Taj. 
As they say you can never go wrong with Taj. ",5,2023,04,23
121,Great Food and Hospitality,"This was my first trip to London. I wasn’t ready to experiment with my cuisine. I asked the Manager, Rajat to suggest me cuisine that will make me feel like home.

121,"Poor rooms, tired and dated.","Arrived for our anniversary and really excited as it looked amazing in the pictures. However…. arrived at the hotel room to find it hadn’t been updated in a very long time with damages throughout the room such as curtain falling down, shower that you had to wash your body in sections due to the lack of power and regulating the temperature was difficult as either really hot or cold. Paid £200 for the night for a four star abs this was far from previous 4 star quality with a picture that was on a slant.

I had sent an email to the hotel regarding my disappointment of the room but with no reply and I have had no choice but to pass this on to other so they don’t feel as disappointed as we was.",1,2023,04,21

Benoy, the concierge; Brett, and Leo were extremely helpful and welcoming. 

The lobby is impressive, and although we had one of the older rooms (there
is a ""refresh"" in the works), it was clean and very, very quiet.

The hotel is well-situated. Not too far from any of the major attractions,
and well within walking distance of many. 

The building was constructed in the late 1800s. It is charming place to 
stay, and ""very London.""

Aburaj, Joel, Mayeema, Nishi, Akshay, and Ram were all outstanding in their roles. The luggage storage facility was definitely a standout feature for visitors. One minor suggestion would be to include Indian cuisine in the eat sleep repeat package, as currently it is only available through in-room dining. Overall, my experience was excellent and I highly recommend this establishment.",4,2023,03,27
121,"Great Service, Indian Cuisine and a Fabulous Hotel","We stayed for 2 nights starting 2nd March. We had our cases taken to our rooms from our car, relaxed in the spa, ate in TH@51 and had afternoon tea at the Kona, had food delivered to our room,  help with our sarees an the 3rd March for an important event at  Buckingham Palace. The concierge waitresses, waiters were all polite, helpful and friendly.  Naima served us at  TH@51 and provided exceptional service. 
Special thanks and appreciation goes to Mohit Tak, the Head Chef at TH@51 who went over and beyond to take care of us. He was exemplary, so kind and attentive. HE really made our stay special. We loved the food that was on offer and the menu was amazing. ",5,2023,03,21

Built in a classic old building, it feels like all the rooms are unique but extremely well maintained.  beds and linens very comfortable.  staff friendly.  breakfast and the breakfast venue are truly lavish.  if you like indian flavors, you are in for a special treat, but more typical UK/european choices are also plentiful.  location is amazing -- between victoria station and st james park for metro stops; stones throw to Thames, Big Ben, Westminster Hall/Parliament, Abbey, St James Park, Buckingham Palace, Victoria Theatre.  A few more steps to Pall Mall and Green/Hyde Park.  i always look forward to my stay here...",5,2023,03,21

For sure",5,2023,03,20
121,Lovely stay as always !,"We stay here whenever we come up to London. It is our favourite Hotel although the price has risen quite a lot , this seems to be normal for all the more luxurious Hotels since the rise in gas prices  .As usual we had a lovely room and a very good breakfast with such a good variety of English and Indian food .Staff were excellent  - very efficient and friendly..",5,2023,03,20
121,"Excellent hotel, Amazing location and Great service.","We stayed at this amazing hotel for 2 nights on 18th Feb 2023. The hotel is very close to The Buckingham Palace , Westminster Palace, Victoria station and many other popular London landmarks. Sunaina the Reception Manager looked after us on checking in and allocated a lovely room for our stay. I would also like to mention Anuja on reception , she is always friendly and helpful.

We always look forward to the breakfast in the restaurant TH@51 where we were looked after by Chef Mohit Tak. He always makes us feel special together with Naeema and all  the other staff in the restaurant.
 
We always recommend this wonderful hotel to our friends and family. Our next visit will be on 13th May and we already looking forward to our stay.",5,2023,03,19
121,Lovely base for first-time visit to London,"We stayed 4 nights.  The hotel is huge, a complex of buildings  located between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Street.  The room was comfortable, though had a few spots that were a bit rough- paint was a bit tired here and there.  The staff is great, and the breakfast was fantastic- a very generous buffet and the option of several cooked to order items to complement it.  Both the buffet and the cooked to order items were a mix of traditional English selections and Indian options. The lobby is gorgeous, with a cozy bar just off of it.  In terms of location, it’s about a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, and also an easy walk if you’re attending the Victoria Palace theatre ( long-time venue for Hamilton).  Short walk (3 blocks, maybe) to the tube.  Sunday supper options were limited in this immediate neighborhood because most of the kitchens were closed or closed early on Sundays.  But easy to take the tube.",5,2023,03,17
121,We won't be returning.,"We stayed at the St James Ct in 2019 and really enjoyed it so were glad to stay again.  What a mistake.  We booked and prepaid for our room with early arrival in January.  When we arrived at the hotel we were told we could not get a room until 3pm unless we were willing to pay an extra 70 GBP per night!   So we checked our bags and went out for the day.  At 3pm there was still no room available.  We raised a fuss at 3:30pm and finally got a “suite” (essentially just a larger room).  We dropped off our bags, put out the Do Not Disturb sign, and went out to dinner.   The next morning we got up early for breakfast, which wasn’t available yet, so we left for the day leaving the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  We returned late.  We again left early the next morning for our flight home (with no breakfast). When we checked out the front desk tried to charge me 17 GBP/night service charge.  When I asked for what, I was told for Front Desk service and House Keeping. I refused to pay considering the Front Desk didn’t have a room for us and we never used House Keeping (The DND sign was up the whole time).",1,2023,03,14
121,Slightly lost its edge but sure it will bounce back after the refurb,"The Room was tired and in need of refurbishment especially the shower with low water pressure. The heating in the room didn't work, only cooled which for me was fine but probably not for most guests.  The staff in the bar were not very attentive.  The reception staff were great as was the morning breakfast with plenty of choice. I hope to stay again when I'm next up in town & hopefully with a better room next time.",3,2023,03,14
121,"Great service, fantastic location!","So glad we ended up at the St. James Court! My sister and I stayed here during the last portion of our overall stay in London. We had stayed in another hotel, which we loved, and only switched because we extended our stay and the other hotel had no double rooms left by the time we decided to extend it. The other hotel was on the other side of the river, which didn't bother us at all, but once we moved to the St. James Court, we realized how a more central location could be such a huge benefit!! The hotel is literally around the corner from Buckingham Palace, and we easily walked to every other major tourist destination in the area, which was extensive (the mall, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament, Downing St, Piccadilly, Trafalgar, Regent St, Oxford St, etc.). The service was wonderful and the hotel was beautiful. We had a slight mix-up with our reservation, which was entirely my fault, and they fixed it without any problem at all, which was a huge relief and much appreciated. We also checked in early with no problem at all. The room was slightly more dated than the other hotel we stayed in, which is to be expected in such an old building and neighborhood, but it truly didn't detract from the experience at all, and I think added to the historic feel of the place, which for me, is something to appreciate whilst staying in such a historic neighborhood and city. I have already recommended it to a friend planning her trip and I will likely stay there again the next time we go. ",5,2023,03,13
121,"Nice hotel, centrally located",The Taj is one of my favourite hotels in London! Excellent customer service and location is perfect (close to Harrods and other department stores/shops). The restaurants and spa are also quite nice (great Indian food). Tip: Ask for rooms in the newly renovated wing if available.,5,2023,03,13
121,Wonderful hospitality and fantastic experience at a top hotel,"I visited with my family for a short stay for my OBE so it was a special occasion. We were extremely well looked after and catered for at TH@51 by Head Chef Mohit Tak who catered specially for our dietary needs with mouth watering Indian food and Nayeema who waited on our table for dinner and breakfast. 
We also very much enjoyed our Indian Afternoon Tea at Kona.  
The reception staff Sunaina, Akshay Kumar, Anu, Druvi, Ridge Fernandes who also looked after our every need.
To sum up it was a memorable stay due to all the staff at the Taj.",5,2023,03,12
121,Remarkable experience,"Everything perfect, from checki-in to the staff kindness and rooms ammenities. Special highlights for te Spa which was incredibly relaxing after walking All day in London.

Highly recommend St James for its location, services and customer care.",5,2023,03,12
121,Breakfast at TH@51,"I along with my family had breakfast on the 10th & 11th March 2023 at TH@51 Restaurant ; The Saint James Court-Taj London.. 

I have to say that the buffet. breakfast has a wide choices of delectable Indian snacks ; dosas, masala dosas, idly, upma ,stuffed paratha , methi parathas and many more. You also have a choice of cold cuts , variety of breads, cereals, yoghurts, apart from a range of fresh fruit juices. 

The staff at the restaurant are very professional, courteous and attentive. I have to make a special mention and commendation of the Manager Mr Gonsalo whose spontaneous warm and affable nature is instantly endearing to every guest.",5,2023,03,11
121,Great hotel. But needs modern improvements.,The rooms are old. Less plug points. The bathroom flush did not work. The WiFi also did not work. Also water pressure in Taos were low. Things a modern hotel must have. Staff is very helpful and responsive. I was upgraded as I stay here often. If you ignore some of these aspects great place to stay and very good location.,3,2023,03,09
121,A confused 4 star hotel,"Whilst all the communal areas and spa of this hotel are wonderful and truly deserving of their 4 star rating, there were some aspects of our stay which fell below par and weren’t really in line with what was expected. We had three rooms booked - one had toothpaste marks in the bathroom which took many calls and many hours before they were addressed and the other had a bathroom which felt like it had seen better days - as per the photos attached, the sink was chipped in places, the side of the bath was cracked, the bath mat was a brown colour. Just not great. I think that probably either many rooms could do with a refresh to bring them up to standard or the difference in standard of the rooms needs to be more explicit to manage expectations. 

On the plus side, breakfast was excellent and spa really wonderful. Location really convenient.",3,2023,03,08
121,Excellent hotel,"From the doorman on arrival, reception checking us in, bar service and breakfast we were totally blown away with how lovely the staff are and that they really want guests to have the best stay.  The room we stayed in is a little dated as is the bathroom but I am told there are newly refurbished rooms available though this didn't detract from us having a lovely stay.
Breakfast was included with out stay and I have to say one of the best I have had at a London Hotel.
The hotel is walking distance to Buckingham Palace and St James Park Tube Station so great location.  
I would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again",5,2023,03,08
121,Really good,"Simple room, excellent service really good even if your english is bad, real good food, the breakfast is something you want to add, their bed is everything you need after a long day of walking. Close to most of the big events on London and easy to reach.",5,2023,03,07
121,Stunning hotel,"Beautiful and luxurious hotel in central London!
Only disappointment was the £15 service charge added to the bill as an assumption! The room was already expensive for a 1 night stay but was for a special occasion.
 
A lot to pay for nothing as we did not ask for any extra services or have room service or any other help during our stay.",4,2023,03,07

One of the best hotels in London. It has an amazing SPA with a sauna, steam room, Jacuzzi, and fantastic restaurant.",5,2023,03,02
121,"Perfect location, great stuff, amazing breakfast","Great stuff always willing to help, amazing breakfast with several kind of food (with a very nice courtyard), perfect location (walking distance from buckingham palace and very close to 2 subway stations). Perfect for few days in the city.",5,2023,02,28
121,Booking was excellent service,"A magnificent hotel, last stayed around 20 years ago, it was a Hilton group hotel as we remember. It was beautiful then, however now it certainly has the definite WOW factor. From speaking to the lovely Sarah N on bookings who was extremely helpful, pleasant and so kind regarding my worries about our stay as I had an issue which needed resolving. Sarah went above and beyond and I can’t thank her enough. You couldn’t ask for a more professional, better understanding service from a telephone call, she excels at her job. A big thank you to her. From the moment we entered with the divine fragrance in the huge fabulously sparkling clean marble reception area. Pleasant welcome from the reception staff, lovely spotlessly clean room, given an upgrade to a premier room was a wonderful surprise addition. Everything at the hotel is top class absolutely one of the best hotels in London in our opinion and we’ve stayed in many five stars over the years. The breakfast is varied, something to suit everyone’s tastebuds. The staff work so hard in there and are so pleasant at serving you. The hotel is so conveniently situated especially for a short  walk to Buckingham Palace and all it’s surrounding sights.  Victoria is only a 10 minute walk away. Almost all of Londons sights are all on your doorstep. Couldn’t find a single thing wrong, will definitely be staying again, soon we hope. Well done to all the staff. I would recommend to anyone to treat themselves to a wonderful stay there.",5,2023,02,28
121,Best Place to Stay Centrally Located,They rooms were spacious and clean tea & coffee provided. The breakfast was very delicious and great variety. We loved staying here. Thank you for a great stay. The staff was wonderful in every department.,5,2023,02,27
121,Relaxing stay,"Always have a wonderful time at this hotel and I always like to mention the lovely people that make it so special.
From the time you enter to the time you leave you are made to feel welcome and if there is nothing too much for them to do for you.
Again the very attentive concierge Guillaume Serdan asked us if we needed anything and to let them know if they could help, especially Dhruvi in reception. Thank you for the very sweet note left in our room along with some chocolates. 
Housekeeping saw to all our needs in the room, my apologies I did not take the name of the particular attendant but he was very kind and helpful. 
Breakfast was amazing as always and the variety and quality of the food is superb, my husband is a chef and he is always impressed by this especially in such a busy hotel breakfast buffet. The staff cope admirably and always apologise if they think we have waited too long for something which to be fair does not happen. The assistant restaurant manager Gonsalo welcomed us back and the manager Asif Bajwa chatted to us whilst also enquiring if we needed anything. Both gentlemen were helping the staff at the very busy times, a mark of dedication which really impressed me. The front of staff were attentive also, I'd like to mention Bristi and Navya, but also want to thank all the other staff who always smiled and made sure everyone's needs were met.
Our visit was short but we come every month for a break and will continue to do so, to this wonderful hotel and mainly its staff who make it truly exceptional.",5,2023,02,26
121,A Must Experience!,"We were introduced by a friend to dine for lunch at TH51. 

Upon entering the lobby, we were greeted by the lovely jasmine fragrance and immediately brought us back to Asia.

It was a beautiful afternoon and the restaurant atmosphere was warm and inviting.

Staffs were so welcoming and sweet.

Asif Bajwa, the food and beverage manager came to greet us and we were immediately captivated by his humorous and heart warming presence.

He made us so happy!

So we decided to visit again and brought a new friend this time!

We were so delighted to see Asif and he and his wonderful staffs took care of all of needs so well.

“Less spicy, more ice, some coconut curd please!” 

It was amazing!

We highly recommend anyone to dine and even stay at Taj to experience their excellent hospitality! 

Royal Treatment!

We will be back!",5,2023,02,25
121,Perfect location!,"My family and I stayed in St. James Court in London for 5 nights and 6 days. The location is perfect as it is in central London and can walk to most of the sights, restaurants and bars. Our room was cosy and comfortable, the facilities and the service was good. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again in this property!",5,2023,02,22
121,Engagement surprise ruined by customer service team!,"Good morning,
 
I explained to the customer service team that I intended on proposing to my partner at your hotel a month in advance. I'd already purchased a bunch of balloons from a shop near my home and asked if I could get them placed inside the room before we arrived,
I was told this was not possible but offered a variety of services for the room. I agreed I would purchase the rose petal package on the premise that I could bring the balloons. I was disappointed to be told that if I wanted to do so I would need to purchase the room the day prior at a rate of £250. This resulted in me refusing any of your services and if I could've received a refund I would've cancelled.
 
I was very disappointed and upset. I thought the hotel would be grateful I chose it to be part of our special occasion and yet I was met with rudeness and an attempt to get more money out of me. It really ruined my trip and no matter how nice the hotel was,
I could not get over the lack of empathy from the customer service team, especially after paying a high-end rate for the room. Why was an issue made over something so trivial? I’ve pre-arranged items to be placed in rooms on several other occasions with no issue.
 
Unfortunately neither my partner or I would return.
 
Sam",2,2023,02,21
121,Perfect service ,"Nice aesthetic, good food, perfect service. Couldn’t ask for better on my anniversary. I’d definitely come back and highly recommend to my peers and family. Everything really went well, we really loved it. ",5,2023,02,21
121,Wonderful Trip,This is the second time I'm staying at the hotel & it has been a wonderful stay. The new side of the Hotel is nice & would be a recommendation to ask anyone checking in to ask for the new wing of the hotel. The stay was nice & memorable. The breakfast was nice & the staff is really helpful & bubbly in the morning which is a nice thing to see. The location of the Hotel is perfect as everything is just a stone's throw away in Central London. The service & the staff is just wonderful making sure you have a memorable stay.,5,2023,02,21
121,London Weekend,"Stunning hotel, architecture that will take your breath away. Courtyard is beautiful.
An abundance of friendly, polite and amazing staff. Nothing was too much trouble.
Fantastic breakfast that caters for every taste and nationality. Also room-service 24/7.
Very clean and spacious rooms. Shower was amazing! Love to know what make of mattress was on the bed, as we had the best sleep in a long time. As frequent London weekenders, we will definitely be booking again.
Only downside was the price of wine; £38.50 for two large glasses. Wow!",5,2023,02,19

121,Wonderful experience ,What can I say?! This is a beautiful hotel. The room - we had a free upgrade - was beautiful. It was spacious and very clean. Loved the slippers provided and the dressing gowns. The light up mirror in the bathroom was amazing - although the magnification was scary!! We didn’t have to queue for breakfast as we went at about half eight and were seated in the conservatory. There was a huge choice of breakfast dishes - everything you could want including Indian dishes. It was self service so you could as much as you wanted. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We stayed early January. It was amazing. ,5,2023,02,18
121,Amazing staff.,"The location of St James’ Court hotel is excellent.  Everything about our stay was perfect. I highly recommend the Jasmine afternoon tea which was an amazing taste sensation.

Breakfast was also good as there were so many options to choose from. Will definitely recommend this hotel",5,2023,02,13
121,Amazing experience,"Stayed at St James court this weekend. Have nothing but praise for the quality of service, accommodation and food. Attention to detail was fantastic and what made the experience more memorable were the little thoughts for my two young children. Special mention to Sanya who was absolutely fantastic - a real credit to the Taj. Nothing was too much for her and she made our experience all the more better. We will definitely visit again.",5,2023,02,12
121,A hotel of two halves,"We paid a lot of money for two nights bed and breakfast after reading reviews and looking at photographs of this hotel. 

Upon arrival, we weren’t disappointed and we were overwhelmed with such a palatial lobby area (or reception) After checking in, we moved through to our room but the decor changed, we negotiated a maze like chain of corridors and took the lift up to seventh floor and again negotiated lots of twists and turns in the vast network of corridors. The decor (carpets, furniture, walls, paint and doors) had changed from the new and fresh palatial look of the first part of the hotel to where we staying - in the eves at the far end of the hotel! 

The decor was shabby and tired and was like stepping back in time. This part of the hotel was in stark contrast to the entrance and other parts of the hotel. It was in desperate need of a refurbish

Our room was small, tired and in the eaves and was almost C-shaped room, which was very small and pokey, not as comfortable or as palatial as the website purported

Our toilet didnt flush properly and the shower controls didn’t work, so you had to stand and hold a shower knob to get the water to come out

The stairs down from our floor (because the lift next to us was broken) were disgusting. The paint was coming off the walls. The windows look like they’d been there since the war and as you moved down between the floors, different items of rubbish were deposited on the stairs, like bin bags with rubbish in. 

As you approached  the lobby, we saw the decor change to how it was advertised on the Internet

Our alarm call was 8:10 am each morning when the local construction company were using the pneumatic drill on a nearby roof, but we were already awoken by the nesting pigeons in the roof at around 5 am

Whilst all of the staff we spoke to were helpful and polite, the hotel lacks a sense of personal “human” touch and it has a very uncomfortable, formal approach, which feels very intimidating for a lot of people including ourselves

The breakfast was average. The first day we were given a seat in the conservatory next to the glass door, which had a huge gap down, so it was absolutely freezing.

The trays where you got your food from, didn’t keep the food, hot. Both days we ordered from the staff and things were missed or forgotten about, and we had to ask a couple of times. 

We enjoyed our stay, but for the price we paid and our experience did not meet our expectations. We were disappointed with our accommodation but we did make the most of our stay",3,2023,02,12
121,Great stay,"Just one night as it’s not a cheap place to stay but everything was perfect the food, service and room for our anniversary. Thanks to all the staff particularly Mocla in reception. Very central to most things to explore London",5,2023,02,11
121,Fantastic Hotel!,The front desk staff were very efficient during my checkout and helpful.  Bridge and Leona were very kind and made my checkout quick.  Thanks to you all. See you again soon.  The hotel was clean and comfortable.  Conveniently located.,5,2023,02,09
121,"Great stay, all round excellent experience.","Excellent property, Superlative service and extremely professional staff. Incredibly well located in central London with two tube stations within 5 mins walking distance. Lived upto the Taj reputation on all aspects. Keep up the good work.",5,2023,02,09
121,Anniversary weekend away.,"We had an amazing stay for a couple of nights. 
Thanks to Sunaina (one of the front desk managers) gave us a lovely welcome and kept checking on how we were throughout the stay. 

Breakfast was lovey and the staff again amazing. 

I would only stay in this hotel in London. English and indian breakfast items available.

Our room, bed pillows were really comfortable",5,2023,02,08
121,Fantastic hotel - exceeded expectations,"This room was booked as part of a work package and far exceeded my expectations. The room, facilities and staff were very accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast offered so much choice, it was hard to narrow down my options. :-) Highly recommend.",5,2023,02,08
121,Perfect as always,"The hotel maintains the highest standards and my wife and I are always happy yo stay there. We are greeted and treated as if we matter.
Being recognised makes one feel at home. From Concierge to managers civility is the by word.",5,2023,02,08
121,Beautiful hotel in the most amazing location,"Rooms are spacious for a central London hotel. Staff very friendly and willing to help. Beautifully decorated hotel.
Impeccably clean rooms and bathroom. Nice spa area, very relaxing atmosphere.

The only problem was breakfast queues. The breakfast options were not what I expected from a Taj hotel.",5,2023,02,06
121,Wonderful visit,We arrived very early (around 8:30 am) after an overnight flight from the US.  I was thrilled that we did not have to wait until 3:00 to check into our room and were also upgraded to a much bigger room.  I told the person checking us in that he had just made my day!  We were so happy with our stay that I canceled another hotel I had booked for a couple days in July when we are returning to London and we will be staying at the St. James Court Hotel again instead.  The hotel is in a wonderful location - you can easily walk to just about anything you would like to see.,5,2023,02,06
121,What a find!,"Not sure we can label somewhere this established as a ‘hidden gem’ but that’s the feeling we had having stumbled across it trying to find somewhere quality but decent value for a weekend trip to the city.

Beautiful hotel, outstanding welcome from staff, great food (loved the Indian infusion at breakfast!) and a super spa. 

Strongly recommended!!",5,2023,02,05
121,Gracious staff and ambience,"Warm welcome from gracious staff underscored a pleasant stay. Room well furnished but I found the temperature a little cold (despite being relatively mild outside).  Bathroom plumbing a little aged, awkward to use and not in good repair.  Th51 restaurant excellent for dinner. Extensive and eclectic breakfast, hot food not so hot on occasions. I would stay again.",4,2023,02,03
121,Comfortable and very pleasant,"Overall experience was outstanding the rooms are very comfortable and the service is remarkable. However disappointed with the service and standard of breakfast, need to queue and wait to be served and the flow was very strange for this standard of the hotel. Ambiance was a little noisy. Other than this it was a wonderful stay.",4,2023,02,02
121,Express business in London,"Good location, great service and a comfy room, although heating was difficult to manage and it was quite chilly in January. Pretty good breakfast, including Indian options. The only area for improvement would be the shower. You would expect in a hotel like this good water pressure, specially after a transatlantic trip.",3,2023,02,01
121,"Wonderful, accommodating staff","This is our second stay at St. James Court and we will be back.  The staff uniformly was fantastic.  We were upgraded upon arrival due to a five night stay.  We did have to give up our suite as there were toilet issues, and I know that areas of the hotel are in need of renovation (forthcoming).  Love The Hamptons bar area and the lobby.  The Taj51 restaurant is also great, though the service there was a bit spotty; I think that part of the issue with some of the servers is understanding English.   The breadth of the breakfast buffet is excellent.  Overall, this is a fabulous hotel, and a great value; cannot recommend it enough.",5,2023,02,01
121,"Exquisite attention from its staff, faultless experience!","It was my first time back at the Taj after 2.5 years of covid and I must admit it’s not lost any of its essence.
There are many luxury hotels in Europe and in London but I have never felt so well looked after - at every single step of your customer experience- like at the Taj in St James Court. 
Hotels these days are understaffed and they tend to automate a lot the process, yet the Taj has been able to keep up to date whilst maintaining the human touch and care of its guests. 
The breakfast is very complete and another occasion to experience the Indian hospitality where you’ll be very well looked after. 
The rooms are spacious and I cannot think of any other hotel in the UK where everything is so shiny and clean like this one. That will surely catch your eye I am sure. 
I have travelled the world, tried all the western hotel chains but I still haven’t found any with the attention the touch, and the style of the Taj in St James Court.
Huge kudos to Duane Coutinho, night manager, who after my long day of work arriving at the hotel at 1.30am  he managed to make the check-in process as fast as possible. 
Again, western hotel chains, please learn from the Taj and its staff!! 
Carlos",5,2023,02,01
121,wonderful stay,"Stayed at the St. James for my trip to London with my daughter. From the moment we checked in to the morning we left everyone at the hotel was so friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable for the five nights we were there. Justin, the concierge and the other concierges were all helpful in their suggestions and contacting the places we had made reservations to make changes. Every morning we were greeted with a smile and a war welcome when we came down for breakfast. Breakfast was plentiful but was the exact same from day to day with no variations. One morning, for a change, we skipped breakfast at the hotel and went into the center of the city for a later breakfast. The hotel is in a quiet section of the city. Everything, in and out of the hotel was clean. My daughter and I were both very happy with our choice of hotel. 
Thank you to all the staff,",5,2023,01,31
121,Lived up to our expectations of a Taj Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay , Centrally located 
Front desk Staff were welcoming and the  Waiting staff too !
Will love to come back again soon 
Room really spacious and comfy 
Cant wait to come back again
Breakfast was also great",5,2023,01,31
121,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff, and extra special anniversary","We had a lovely time staying at a taj. On arrival we were upgraded which was a lovely start to the trip. And when we got to our room there was some chocolate and strawberry treats left for us! The staff were also very friendly at the desk and were congratulating us on our anniversary. the room itself was very nice, we had an executive king room. The bed was very comfortable, shower was lovely, and we had everything we needed. Only annoying thing was the tv wouldn’t work properly - it kept turning itself off every 5 minutes and sometimes wouldn’t turn back on. It also glitches and went black when watching. - this was typically when planes went over - I fed this back to the hotel for the next persons staying - but for us it wasn’t a major issue so didn’t get anyone to sort it for our stay. 
the breakfast was lovely too - and they catered well for my coeliac partner. the bar in the evening (where the breakfast is) was a nice vibe with very friendly staff who were also very helpful and attentive. However the price for us was shocking. £12 for a basic rum (e.g. goslings or kraken) and we weren’t told the price of anything and had no idea it would be this expensive. To some this may not be an issue, but to us, it was a shock and we couldn’t afford to continue drinking there. we wouldn’t drink there again unless we wanted the special cocktails instead (as this feels more worth the price but still a hefty average of £16 a cocktail.
Granted hotel drinks are always pricey, but it’s something we would have preferred to know prior to ordering by being given a menu when we arrived. 
The guys on the door as you enter the building also deserve a special mention - they were so welcoming and polite. They were extremely helpful and they were always there with a big smile. 
overall; a very lovely trip and our anniversary was made very special by everyone at a taj. We would definitely return.",5,2023,01,31
121,Annual family vacation and our daughters engagement party,"At the outset I would like to Thank the GM Ms Avari, Hotel Manager Mr Raphael and the F&B manager Mr Asif Bajwa for the memorable stay and the engagement dinner we hosted for our daughter. The personal attention in the detailing of every aspect of the evening was very touching and we are grateful for that. The F&B team under the guidance of  Mr Asif Bajwa made sure that every visit to the restaurant was a memorable one- starting from food to the service.. we celebrated New Year’s Eve at the hotel and we saw how the entire team worked long hours including Mr Asif to make sure that it indeed was a beautiful start to the new year for each and every guests.. we truly appreciate everything.
The feeling and experience of “Tajness” was cascaded down by Ms Avari and most definitely displayed by Mr Asif and his Team. 
Our daughters engagement dinner  was one of the most important days in our lives and they sure made it memorable. 
I thank the entire team and in particular - Mr Asif Bajwa, Mr Karan from Chambers, Mr Kapil, Mr Neil, Ms Ashley and a lot  of other managers and wait staff..",5,2023,01,31
121,What's Not To Love,"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel 4  different times. The newly renovated rooms are lovely but the thing that makes the stay the best is the staff.

They are so kind and helpful-making one feel right at hom.

It is a wonderful hotel.",5,2023,01,31
121,The Most Wonderful Staff!,"Our stay at the Taj was exceptional and this was due to the amazing staff employed there. Everyone was so nice to us and especially to my toddler. It can be difficult traveling with a very young child, but the staff never made us feel like a bother. They put a crib in our room and always had a high chair available at breakfast. They even gave a teddy bear to my son which he is still carrying around everywhere. 
Another wonderful part of the stay was your breakfast buffet and the many vegetarian and vegan options. So often as a vegetarian hotel breakfasts are waste of money. This was definitely not the case at this hotel. 

I would recommend upgrading to the more recently updated rooms. We did and found it very comfortable and well maintained.",5,2023,01,30
121,Very good hotel,"Close to the metro and close to most import attractions. When it is possible ask for a renovated room. It is an old building and some rooms are small. Very good breakfast, sometimes it’s possible to get the breakfast in a smaller room, that is more relaxed.",5,2023,01,30
121,Amazing Experience,"Beautiful hotel , superb attention to detail. The Staff are so friendly and accommodating. The room is stunning , pillows extremely comfortable. 

Receptionist called Modou has been exceptional, he couldn’t have been more helpful. ",5,2023,01,28
121,"nice, but not perfect","Nice hotel, not small, there is a space in lobby, and was ok in a breakfast area...
We were suggested to upgrade room for 60 Pound to get more space... we were 3 , with a girl... so, we upgrade and we got Clock room.. the downside is that it doesn't has a window... After that we were suggested to move but we didn't use that : pack again luggage and waste time for moving  with all those long corridors was an issue..I think the personnel was supposed to explain that upgraded room will NOT have a window...
About breakfast, overall ok, but : I like very hot American coffee...  I like to heat it few times or prepare new one.. I prefer to manage it by myself : via coffee machine or microwave....   : asking the waitress for a coffee and waiting about 10 min each time was a nightmare... Kids enjoyed pancakes :) 
location was very good..
Kids got special attention with kids bag and bears:)   they like it very much.. took it home... The girl one day got cookie with her name on it :) she liked it very much.. we did many pictures :)",4,2023,01,26

Professional from check in to check out.
Clean room & bathroom in the renovated side of the hotel.
We booked a Royal Afternoon tea ~ again professional service and set up. I will say it’s intimate and too close to other customers. 
Breakfast at the Hampton, it is busy so you may need to wait a few minutes.  Breakfast in terms of taste is average however there are options for all. 
We did not have the opportunity to visit the Spa. 
The Courtyard is lovely and would be fabulous in warmer weather.",4,2023,01,22

121,Great Hotel / Venue Superb / Gem in London,"Your Hotel is superb with a great location. If i was being picky, some areas need a refurb as carpets threadbare.

121,The spa facilities were the highlight of our stay,"I stayed at St James A Taj hotel with my partner. This is the best hotel I’ve stayed at in London, the staff were all very polite and welcoming, the beds were so comfy and rooms were of good standard. The spa facilities were amazing and the highlight of our stay, it was so relaxing, there was pool facilities and a hidden jacuzzi which was so lovely. The sauna and steam room was also very relaxing. Would highly recommend staying here and we will be back",5,2023,01,15

Really enjoyed the hospitality of the team Asif Bajwa/Kapil/ Deon/Lara and the many number of wonderful people in the team.",5,2023,01,09
121,Loved everything about this hotel,"We will definitely come back to this hotel next time we come to London. The rooms were clean, location was best, breakfast was fabulous and service was excellent. I would like to extend our thanks to Ms. Bristi  who was especially courteous to us and gifted us with her smile every morning.",5,2023,01,08
121,Great property - Mismanaged royally,It’s a beautiful and very central property. Spacious by London standards. But the Taj management hasn’t been able to do justice to it. It’s left to inexperienced and trainee staff to manage. They need to improve management and the boiler on the terrace which gives a constant noise to all rooms on top 2 floors,3,2023,01,07
121,A wonderful 4 day holiday in the arms of the Taj St James Court,"It was our third stay at the Taj St James Court and we really love the ambience of the hotel. 
Warm Hospitality and True Heartfelt Kindness are the key words and those words are written all over the place... We stayed in a premier King room, a beautiful refurbished room with a very comfortable bed, a lovely bathroom with a vey good shower and all the things one needs to have a relaxed stay. We even had a little balcony and a window that we could open (which is very important to us). Breakfast was lovely and the staff was amazing, even when it became very busy. A special word of thanks to Mr Twinkle and Miss Artha who were so kind to us.
On the third day we couldn't enter our room in the afternoon, because the battery on the door was broken. The most friendly lady at the reception joined us to check and called emergency right away. 15 minutes later everything was fixed. We call that professionalism! 
A special word of appreciation for the cleaning department... Our room was spotless and very well maintained during our stay (so is the rest of the hotel).
We loved the subtle house parfums, the warm energy from India, the coffee and drinks at the cosy bar, our evening meal in the new restaurant with the fusion of different cultures... Gosh... Is it possible we fell in love with this hotel? We wonder ;-)
Thank you!",5,2023,01,07
121,Absolutely Lovely,"Our stay at St.James Court was lovely. We will be back and if there is a Taj hotel at any other location we are visiting it will be our first choice. 
We were taken care of as soon as we stepped through the door. We loved it and would recommend.",5,2023,01,07
121,Loved it!,"Great hotel! Impeccable service and amenities. Huge shoutout to 
Dhruvi ( front desk)
Anuja ( ( front desk)
Bashir ( front desk)
Shruthi ( restaurant )
Aashiq ( spa)
Ridge ( front desk)

All staff was exceptional. The spa was lovely. Breakfast had a great selection. They ensured we were well served

And what a fabulous location! 

Can’t wait to return with my toddler",5,2023,01,07
121,Excellent,"Bristi was a very open and friendly staff member and provided a very good service together with her team.
The food was very delicious. 
The rooms and the hotel was clean and we have nothing to complain about. 
In overall, we would surely recommend the hotel in a top location.",5,2023,01,06
121,First class,Spend the evening at St James Court whilst visiting London for my wife’s Birthday. Upgraded to a premium room and a nice Birthday treat left in the room whilst we were out. All of the staff were brilliant including the very helpful concierge. The breakfast was also first class. We love Taj Hotels.,5,2023,01,06
121,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in the newly renovated rooms, which were clean, modern, and spacious for London hotels.  Excellent service across the board.  Tushar (front desk manager) was very helpful and friendly trying to get our rooms clustered together.  Anand at TH 51 was friendly and attentive to our whole family and kids.  Great combination of western and Indian cultures.",5,2023,01,06
121,"Lovely staff, facilities and food :)","We had a fantastic time at this hotel. From the get go the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, we especially enjoyed our breakfasts being looked after by the lovely Bristi :) Speaking of which, the breakfast buffet is insane with both English and Indian breakfast options, fresh fruit, pastries and nice strong coffee. 

The location is excellent being very close to Buckingham Palace, St James Park with gorgeous squirrels scampering about, and is walking distance to icons such as the Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral. There is also a plethora of pubs and reaturaunts nearby of course.

The boys at the Hamptons Bar near the foyer were very friendly and fun to talk to. Thank you to the St James Court Hotel team for looking after us so well!",5,2023,01,06
121,S S naganand,A lively luxury hotel in central London.  Great ambience. Very good service.  Excellent food.  Being the famous Taj hotel make us proud Indians . The roomsl size is good.ca nice gym and famous Jiva spa are useful.,5,2023,01,05
121,Mixed bag,A mixed stay. We had a fantastic room (we were upgraded) and it was really new and comfortable. Unfortunately the breakfast experience was rally poor.  The service was a bit chaotic and the buffet food poor and there was also a poor selection.  The rest of the hotel really needs updating.  Other than that is was fine/ok.,3,2023,01,05
121,You can stop looking you found the hotel you should stay at,"The water pursuer could have been a litter better but other than that I challenge anyone to find something wrong. 

As soon as we arrived we were welcomed and taken care of, and  it continued till the moment we left. The rooms we booked were perfect. Yes we had a couple of issues come up but the staff fixed then with speed and grace. 

The staff are always trying to make your stay better. We never stayed at a Taj hotel before but this will be the brand we look for first going forward.

And the concierge team made a miracle happen. 

This is an Amazing property to stay at.",5,2023,01,05
121,It was an excellent experience,"We had an extremely wonderful and pleasant stay at the St James court, Taj. Although I have stayed here a no of times earlier also, however this time I stayed with my extended family and our experience was exceptional. Right from the check in to the quality of rooms, the breakfast and housekeeping, it was all perfect. I would personally like to thank Mr Ridge at the front office, for bearing with my impatience and was kind enough to give us an early check in and upgrading our rooms. We were also lucky enough to have watched  the spectacular New year fire works from the Buckingham palace grounds which was an added attraction of staying at the Taj.",5,2023,01,05
121,Short but sweet and comfortable Stay,"Had a wonderful time at the St. James' Court. Kudos to the staff who made my stay distinct and more comfortable (via upgrade). Thanks Federica and Marco (from Spain). Who were always there to help. Fabulous breakfast, with a tinge of Indian curries, chutneys and spices. Best in London!
Happy New Year to everybody working at the hotel!",5,2023,01,04
121,"Amazing service, room arrangement and lobby ambience/atmosphere","Amazing service, room arrangement and lobby ambience/atmosphere. The in-room dining food was fantastic. They had a very elaborate christmas experience during the holidays period. The most peculiar experience was the scent in the lobby.",5,2023,01,03
121,Worst Experience compared to all other Taj Stays,"We were given a different room from what we had booked and was totally different from the photos. The room was pretty small and even the washroom was very small.   The tap in the wash basin was pretty old-style.  
Long waiting for the breakfast buffet even at 8:30 am when it was mentioned everywhere that 8:30 am,  it will be quiet.  We had to literally wait for 45 mins for the breakfast even after coming at 8:30 am.

We have stayed in other Taj also and even in St James earlier and our last visit to St James was really awesome and that's why I booked it again but this time it was totally disappointing.",3,2023,01,03
121,Fantastic Experience,"Being an Indian it is the most proud feeling to be staying at The Taj in London. Right next to Buckingham palace. Excellent Location, Excellent Staff, Excellent Hospitality and Excellent Service. Special mention for the FnB manager Mr Asif Bajwa and his entire team Milda, Twinkle, Anuja, Nitika, Kapil etc etc who took care of us and our needs during our entire duration of stay at The Taj",5,2023,01,03
121,I like this hotel located in the center of London but with a quite and warming atmosphere,Premium rooms have been renewed recently . This hotel is 500mt from Buckingham Palace and 700mt from Big Ben and Westminster Abbey .  Staff and reception are really kind. I hope that remaining rooms of this fantastic hotel will be all renewed shortly.,4,2023,01,02
121,Dated hotel,"Convenient location but otherwise limiter value for money. Hotel in general dated, room and bathroom below par for this kind of hotel (Executive sugits). Poor breakfast for being England. Service ok but not seemless by any means. Will not come back.",2,2023,01,01
121,A wonderful hotel!,"Me and my fiancé stayed at the hotel for New Year’s Eve. We had a great stay. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are helpful and friendly. 

We had a dinner reservation at the hotel restaurant on New Year’s Eve through booking.com that we were looking forward too. Unfortunately there had been a technical error and the hotel hadn’t received our reservation and the restaurant was fully booked. When we started to get worried, the food and beverage manager Asif bojwa came to the rescue! He found an alternative solution and made sure we had a great celebration. Asif is a problem solver and truly service oriented! The hotel is lucky to have him working there. 

Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2023,01,01
121,Good to great - just one step away from being a great hotel.,"The hotel has all the ingredients to make it a great one but it is a borderline case, just one step away. The location is great, The property is just ok OK but the Taj team has done a good job by bringing it to a decent level. However, some small steps can really add to the vibrancy. Being Indians, we specially stayed here to enjoy the Indian delicacies at the Breakfast but it takes 20-30 minutes for the order to be served and by the time it comes, it gets cold and maybe you are in the process of leaving. The staff is very receptive but has to be repeatedly followed up for accomplishing the tasks which can be easily improved.",3,2022,12,30
121,CANNOT GO WRONG WITH TAJ,Very nice stay Really Taj culture Everyone ready to help Really enjoyed every bit of it I have always been saying one thing You cannot go wrong with Taj From check in to Check out you feel like you are a VIP,5,2022,12,28
121,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days to celebrate our wedding anniversary. On check in we were upgraded to a premier king room which was superb. We had a large bedroom, great storage and a massive bathroom with a luxurious shower. 
From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic. They really could have not been any nicer. We would highly recommend this hotel and we can't wait to return. Thank you for making our stay so special.",5,2022,12,26
121,Legendary Taj Hospitality - Simply the best,"Our stay at the St James Court London was fabulous. We were visiting our Son who studies in London and chose to stay at the hotel because of our Indian Connection. The Taj never disappoints - The room allocated to us was lovely, very well appointed and exceeded our expectations. The food and beverage experience was also excellent. However one aspect that really stood out was the warm and caring staff and managers that we met during our 5 days at the hotel. The staff are truly the stars that make the Taj stand tall amongst other hotels - This feedback comes from a family of hoteliers who have stayed in some of the worlds finest hotels. Your staff  are the real stars that truly make a difference. Right from the lady who checked us in on arrival ( don’t remember her name but she was possibly the duty manager) . Your Concierge Binoy is truly a star himself - warm and caring he assisted us with planning our travels / trips / site seeing plans. We also dined at Bombay Brasserie and Chef Srirams food was truly outstanding. Your Accommodation Manager Rajat was a pleasure to meet and interact with - Warm and caring - He was always in the lobby meeting guests and ensuring that they were comfortable. Your Food and Beverage Manager Asif was very helpful and although we saw that there were challenges seating guests over breakfasts due to limited seating - he kept cool and composed and took care of all our needs with a smile - We wish him the very best. Asif Bajwa is truly a peoples man. It was a pleasure also interacting with Naveen Sikka who was always moving around the lobby greeting one and all and always smiling. It’s good to see Senior Managers like Asif and Naveen always smiling when interacting with the most Irate guests - and keeping a cool and composed demeanor while going thru the stresses of the job. Ridge who checked us out was also quick, efficient and a true Ambassador for the Taj. He was able to guide us on the Taj Loyalty program and also answer numerous questions that we asked him. We also briefly interacted with Raphael on arrival and finally credit should go to the General Manager Mehrnavaz  who coaches and guides the team to ensure that every single guest who leaves the TAJ doors, leaves as an Ambassador of the hotel. We truly enjoyed our stay and promise to return. Our trip to the UK was for over 20 days and we stayed at Intercontinental Hotels in London, Cardiff and Edinburgh - but the Taj experience has been the best - My Children also commented on the Taj experience and found that only the Intercontinental in Edinburgh came close to the Taj peoples experience. Thank you to the entire team at St James Court - You made our UK trip this festive season truly memorable.",5,2022,12,25
121,Xmas Luxury Trip at Taj James Court,"Family Xmas holiday with the most amazing room, fabulous service and extreme friendly staff at front desk Mr Ridge and with special mention of the restaurant manager Mr Goncalo who made not only us but practically every guest feel special amd unique.
Definetly will repeat Taj James Court.
",5,2022,12,22
121,Luxury Staycation,"There’s a reason why the Taj group hotels are one of the best around the world.

Smooth check in by the wonderful Nishi, large executive room with amazing amenities.

Location is the best in London, the staff from reception to concierge are just amazing, my girls absolutely love this hotel.

We can’t wait to return again in the new year.",5,2022,12,18
121,Best hotel in London,"Excellent customer service treated like royalty only wished we had booked for more than one night! Used Agoda to book who were terrible so as precaution we got hotel to confirm booking. When we arrived Arian couldn’t find our booking but he sat us down arranged a hot drink and sorted things for us resulting in an upgrade to a suite with courtyard view and he then came to our suite with a scroll announcing that we were guest of the day and we received additional benefits! ARIAN made our stay so special you are a star!! However all the staff in restaurants , reception were all exceptional as was the accommodation manager Rajat who made a point of asking about our stay and made us feel that every person who enters the hotel is special! The Taj group should be very proud of their staff and service. We will definitely be back for a longer stay and when in London would not consider anywhere else!",5,2022,12,18
121,very good,"my holiday was amazing, I can raccomend you for sure. Just one thing: breakfast hall is small for the guest, the waiting sometimes was too long. but quality and service was very good, and the employees always smiling",5,2022,12,18
121,Superb hospitality,Bristi was amazing. Service was great and made us feel at home during our stay at the Taj. She made the stay memorable and could not thank her more! An absolute asset to the hospitality team at the Taj! I would highly recommend staying at the Taj!,5,2022,12,17
121,Bristi is great,Bristi was fabulous at breakfast in the morning. She was very accommodating and tended to all of our needs. The food was amazing however the service was second to none. I especially loved the masala dosa with the coconut chutney and samabar!,5,2022,12,17
121,Amazing stay at London..,"Perfect stay. The breakfast was amazing. Very polite people. Especially Brixtie at breakfast was very kind. The rooms are perfect. Good temperature. Nice to take a hot bath here with some music in the bathroom. Chromecasten is possible to TV. WiFi works perfect, also for streaming. ",5,2022,12,17
121,First time - will not be our last!,"Great staff, lovely hotel.  Breakfast choice great.  Room modern (we were in the recent refurbished Superior room).  Chrome cast on the TV so we could watch what we wanted in the evening from our phones (why more hotels don't have this I don't know).  Air conditioning in room was ace (kept us warm when it was freezing outside) Will 100% stay here next time we come to London",5,2022,12,14
121,"Lovely room, great location. Breakfast experience was a nightmare","We stayed at the taj on the 2nd & 3rd December as a treat for my other half’s birthday. The room was lovely as was the hotel location. The staff were friendly. 

However, everything g unravelled on the Saturday morning when we ended up waiting nearly 45 minutes for breakfast. Most of that was standing up in a cue. After being promised that Sunday would be better, it was but still a 20 minute wait. Pictures of the cues attached. 

We were late for a booking on Saturday because of the wait. So frustrating so I’m afraid I wouldn’t  recommend, I wouldn’t want anyone paying nearly £500/night to have to cue for breakfast like we had to. Disappointed.",2,2022,12,13
121,Lovely staff and great hotel,The staff were soo attentive and our room was upgraded to a lovely suite. A calming hotel close to many landmarks. Great stay! Really enjoyable. Cannot fault the staff they couldn’t have been more helpful.,5,2022,12,13
121,"plush, luxurious and complete","The room was very nice and everything was done to a very high standard.  The staff we courteous, happy and helpful.  Mo at reception gave us a beautiful welcoming smile and that set the tone for our whole experience",5,2022,12,13
121,Fabulous hotel.,"The most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in.We cannot thank the hotel staff enough for making our wedding anniversary so special.
All of the staff were wonderful,caring and attentive and made our stay truly memorable.We are already planning our next visit.",5,2022,12,11
121,"Hotel Location, Room size is good and  having a Nice Breakfast","It was amazing stay
Hotel was very good, Room also is good but it looks for disabilities people (anyhow not an issue), I stayed for one night.
The breakfast was vey nice.
The Hotel location is good as well.
But the price was high.",5,2022,12,11
121,Poor room but great staff,"The hotel is in a great position &  the staff are fantastic 
Unfortunately our room was far from  what I would expect from a 4 star rated hotel. To be completely honest a premier inn room is better.
There were broken tiles in the floor of the bathroom. The toilet seat was broken. The towel ring was  hanging off the wall . The shower screen seal  was split & hanging down along the bath & paint was flaking from the ceiling.
The bedroom furniture is dated .
We thought the windows had been blacked out until the morning when we could see they weren’t it was dirt.
When we went for breakfast we had to wait over 25 minutes for a table. It was explained to us that the wait was due to the restaurant being only able to cater for one hundred guests when the hotel holds Five hundred !
Overall really disappointed.",2,2022,12,10
121,Amazing stay,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom deluxe suite from the 29th of Nov until 4th of Dec.
It was a superb serviced hotel with amazing and outstanding staff which I will be naming the ones who stood up for me :
Ms Suveille Paul, Ms Sania , Ms Lana, Mr Tibor , Gabriella and Hatoon from the breakfast hall and Ms Mariana and Julia from Housekeeping.
Hope did not miss out other staff whom I encountered during my stay.
They exceeded all my expectations from service, hospitality, kindness and warmth.
The comfort of the cleanliness and brightness and apartment size and utilities were all so soothing and relaxing to come back to.
The staff never hesitated to reach out to me for any request or problems I would encounter .
The only problem I faced during my stay was the water temperature control which was not functioning at all as in which ever direction you turned the tap either cold water would come or for a short time extremely hot water and then go away to cold and there was no color guidance for knowing the direction of cold and hot.
Although they send the maintenance staff couple of times to rectify the problem.
Location wise also very convenient for visiting Buckingham palace , St James park, 10 minutes walk to Victoria station and walking distance to Piccadilly square and Green park.
Overall will highly recommend this hotel for all to stay in .",5,2022,12,10
121,They do say never go back!,"Fourth or fifth time here. Got ""upgraded"" to a King Size bed, which basically filled the room, would rather have stayed in a normal room like the previous year. Hamptons bar service wasn't the best, due to time waiting for service, eventually went to the bar myself and we had to clear the table! Waiter seemed to be in a bit of a mood with the bar manager. Restaurant wasn't the warmest in the atrium area, at least this matched the food! On checkout day we had breakfast and were shown to a table in the atrium again :(, whilst we collected our food, they gave our table away to another couple who put their jacket over one of the chairs - they were not amused on their return to find us sat down eating!  After an awkward moment and a few apologies, all sorted.",2,2022,12,08
121,Bad experience,Avoid this hotel.3 star hotel at the best .Checked in 1 hour later than I supposed.Breakfast restaurant too small and you have to wait for hour to sit and eat .I got charged more than i had agreed and noone answered my emails,1,2022,12,08
121,Repeat customer due to great experience every time.,Great location- walking distance or short cab ride to most central London locations. Great food-with forthcoming chefs to cater cuisines to your taste buds. Great hospitality-Welcoming staff and willing to consider customer requests.,5,2022,12,08
121,Tatty room,"This appears to be a nice hotel. Reception area is very inviting and looks lovely. However I unless your room is one of the refurbished ones I would stay elsewhere. Our room is tatty. Rotten window frame, bathroom grout is black, wooden bath panels have been badly painted, paint on tiles and on the wood at the side of the the bath. The ceiling in the bathroom is scruffy, looks like a botch job. The desk is chipped and there are ring marks on the bedside cabinet. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. I would say definitely not 4 star standard.",3,2022,12,06
121,Too many bad service strikes,"I’m staying here at the moment and have already had two bad service experiences in  less than eight hours. Arrived early and understandably the room wasn’t ready, so I asked where I could have a bit of lunch while waiting. The front desk staff directed me to the restaurant, which was closed at the time. When I returned and was sat, I waited over 20 minutes and a sever never appeared - despite the fact my table was right at the area where the staff rang in drinks, nobody approached me to take my order, offer water… nothing. I left and grabbed a sandwich at Pret instead. 

Later in the evening I had an unpleasant experience when one of the doormen went to find a taxi for me - I forgot something in my room so had to go back upstairs. I was back within a few minutes and he’d come back in and said his colleague outside would take care of me. I exited, saw nobody around, then a taxi appeared. I went to get in and some other doorman came after me shouting that it wasn’t my taxi. I explained I was the guest his colleague had gone to find a cab for earlier and he brushed me off rudely.

The renovated rooms are beautiful but I’ve been ignored once and treated like a cab-stealing lowlife once and that’s two service strikes too many. Additionally, both times I’ve hosted private group dinners at the hotel’s restaurant, Quilon, we’ve had problems with the staff pouring more champagne than they were supposed to and charging us more than anticipated for the events. Avoid the service headaches and stay/dine elsewhere.",3,2022,12,05
121,My stay was good...,One thing I will write in here that the service rendered by Mr.Tushar at the Reception Desk was really good.The services at the time of breakfast of Ms. Shruthi and Mr.Twinkle was good too and satisfactory. Secondly the room Service staff was also good.,4,2022,12,05
121,Excellent first time stay.,"My fiancé and I decided to pick St James Court to attend a dinner in London. We was greeted by very welcoming staff that took our bags to the room.

The room was very spacious, welcoming and luxurious. My fiancé had a slight accident with the radiator for the towels and caused a small surface burn. Staff were very helpful and provided her with a cold pack. Upon check out we provided feedback on a small hole in the bathroom, some black mould in the window (it’s an old building and we sort of expected this.) the team was very apologetic and offered us £50 off the total bill however we wasn’t asked about my fiancé’s well-being. I did address this in a polite and respectful email with welcoming feedback and the manager came to the restaurant to chat with us and apologise. As a result our meal was paid for by the hotel. We was very grateful for the experience and will certainly consider giving St James Court another visit in the future. We considered the feedback as little bumps and would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family going forward. I included the compensation in this review as it could make my overall review score biased as the result of the compensation provided by the hotel.

We enjoyed the breakfast too which included traditional English cuisine as well as Indian cuisine.",4,2022,12,04
121,Fabulous stay in this gem of a hotel,"Lovely weekend stay at this beautiful hotel. Great room, spacious, clean and well-appointed. Staff friendly and very attentive, brilliant service overall. Lovely bars with live music on the Friday evening. Hotel is in a great position just a short walk from tube, parks and major tourist attractions. Marvellous.",5,2022,12,04
121,What a wonderful experience.,"This was my first time staying at the St James Court and I was so happy with everything.  The hotel is centrally located between two well serviced tube stations.  It is clean and comfortable.  Morning breakfasts were incredible, with so much to choose from.  And the staff couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating, from the front desk staff, to the bartenders, to even the guest services who brought extra towels! 
I will absolutely be returning for another visit!",5,2022,12,03
121,Hotel Staff find my 500 Pounds & return it,"Dear All,
I stayed at this property from 3rd to 11th Sept, 2022. 
After checking out on 11th Sept, I realized some cash was missing from my bag. I would like to thank 'Kapil Singh Adhikari' & 'Aamir Shah Mohamad,' both employees at St. James' Court (London) who found my cash in an envelope & rushed to hand it over to me. All intact! This shows the honesty, dedication & hospitality for those that work at The Taj properties.
Kapil & Aamir, I wish you the very best in your career & happy holidays.
Best regards,
Angad Sandhu",5,2022,11,29
121,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS - Shameful, poorly run hotel with no customer service","AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! This hotel is impossible to reach via phone or email. The customer service is appalling. 
We made a reservation over the phone, no cancellation policy mentioned, we cancelled a few days later due to extreme ill health and was told no refund would be given. Ever since it has been impossible to contact anyone at the hotel. I would strongly recommend avoiding staying or booking here. ",1,2022,11,29
121,Whenever I'm in London I will stay at the Taj,I enjoy the 'Tajness' and the quality of service I have always experienced there.  The hotel is perfectly positioned for my normal business activities in London and the concierge services are also excellent.,5,2022,11,28
121,Great place to stay,"The rooms are nice and clean , the Breakfast is very good And the place is in centre of London. the food is great specially the breakfast is very good. And my next visit I decided I will be staying at the taj",5,2022,11,27
121,Unfortunate stay,"1st room was small and old, TV didn't work and WiFi connection weak, room was changed the following day to a good room which was comfortable, unfortunately there was a leak in the bathroom coming from the ceiling. There were issues with getting things resolved, it took several calls with promises of people coming to the room that didn't show up. Eventually the duty manager came and she resolved the issues well and was apologetic for the issues. The hotel kindly offered to pay for one of my meals and drinks as a gesture which was appreciated given the unfortunate incidents. Overall not the best stay but once the duty manager was involved they tried hard to resolve the issues.",3,2022,11,24
121,Wonderful Hotel,On arrival we were warmly greeted by Federica who was extremely welcoming and helpful. It was our first visit to St James Court and we were kindly provided an upgrade to a premium room. The room was fantastic in a great position overlooking the courtyard. We loved the look and feel of the updated rooms. We dined at the Quilon restaurant and the food and service was exceptional. The attention to detail was amazing and the ambience was perfect. My husband and I were so impressed with St James Court we decided to book another visit for New Year! On reception we spoke to Arian who was very helpful in selecting our room for our next stay. This hotel gave us one of the best stays we have ever had. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing with the staff being extremely attentive in a respectful manner not overbearing. The decor and furnishings are very tasteful and create a relaxing setting. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Looking forward to returning for the New Year.,5,2022,11,24
121,London Rugby & Theatre break.,"Good hotel and facilities, if one gripe it's that the heat of the breakfast food should be improved. Have used the hotel previously its in a great location very central and close to 2 underground stations.",4,2022,11,23
121,Room Allocation,"Arrived at the hotel at past midnight on Saturday 19th, I would have expected the room that was allocated for my stay to be ready. In this case, 
-The room had a very strong cigarette smell 
-Reallocated to a room with no luggage or key assistance 
-I had to wait 20 mins in the lobbey with my partner in the hallway as she was tired at this time of night
-I had to go downstairs to get a new key and received an apology

To compensate I was given an amount of my total invoice, which i do not believe covers the misfortune and also believe there is a wider issue that needs to be sorted out amongst the team at this branch.",2,2022,11,22
121,"Great hospitality, courteous service, fantastic breakfast!","Taj brand is true to its name - great hospitality, served with a kind smile, and courteous service. 

We live in Reading and wanted and took an impromptu weekend break and loved it.

Taj/Tata's have truly got their Taj vibe and Indian philosophy of guest is king from India to London 

The breakfast (with such a huge set of Indian choices right in the heart of London truly gladdened our hearts). I would also like to call our Aritha, our table server who served us patiently and always with a smile and chatted us up and made it extra special

The one thing I would call out is that their wonderful cosy bar by the reception closed on Saturday around 9 pm. The management should think of keeping it open longer. Also, the swimming pool was under repairs so we couldn't use it.",5,2022,11,22
121,A Bombay bustle….,"It’s so close to being good but the rooms in part are old and shabby. 
The breakfast was cold and very late. 
The spa only partially functional. 
Reception seem unable to keep it calm. Bags everywhere. It’s a mess!

But it’s so close to being great. Location is good if your looking for a little piece and quite 
Resultant options are a little limited.",2,2022,11,22
121,Amazing hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights as part of a wedding party. Amazing hotel, staff courteous and couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast was absolutely phenomenal , great selection of hot and cold and again amazing staff. Thank you we felt special and cared for by the amazing staff, we will be back!!",5,2022,11,21
121,Wonderful experience with children,"We booked St James court Taj last minute on the way to London and could not have had a better greeting experience. The front desk staff were lovely and treated my daughter with such kindness. She was given a beautiful bear which she was delighted with and some crayons and activity bits which was such a lovely touch. The breakfast was absolutely brilliant and the location was fantastic for exploring (changing on the guards is literally a 5 min walk). At check out the front desk staff were, again, exceptionally lovely to our daughter and clearly took great pride in their jobs.",5,2022,11,20
121,"Good room, OK Breakfast, Very bad checkout experience","Breakfast does not take into account Vegans. I had to guess what I could or could not eat.
At Checkout we were surprisingly handed an additional charge. This was surprising because we did not order any room service or any extra services. The charge was handed to us on paper as an account to be settled. Only when we asked what it was it was the check-out person explained that this was a service charge for the staff and that in was optional. This additional service charge was not mentioned anywhere in the reservation process. The rep argued that this was mentioned on the confirmation. I went over the confirmation again but couldn't find any mention. This is a very bad experience which made us leave the hotel with an off sentiment. I wouldn't go back and will not recommend",3,2022,11,20
121,Just perfect,"I found this hotel purely by chance as my plans changed. I arrived on a Sunday morning after a long flight from Singapore, in the pouring rain. 
I was greeted with a helping hand and a warm smile by the doormen. 
Reception staff were so kind and helpful, allowing me to check in early and get some sleep. 
Concierge were also helpful and kind with advice and tips. 
Wonderful rooms. I stayed in 523. Immaculate, spacious and had everything I needed. 
Breakfast was excellent and so well presented. 
I cannot fault this hotel and I have now found my go to home from home in London. 
Thankyou to the whole team.",5,2022,11,15
121,Fantastic experience at a beautiful hotel.,Brilliant stay. We were in London for a special event and found every aspect of the hotel amazing. Service was outstanding and it was a pleasure to experience a little touch of India in the heart of the capital. Frankly everything about our stay was perfect.,5,2022,11,14
121,Good stay,"Overall, we had a great experience with the Taj; the staff was incredibly helpful, and the amenities were great. The room was wonderful, clean, and perfect to celebrate an anniversary weekend. Thank you for making our special weekend memorable. ",5,2022,11,14
121,VIEW OF the 'gasworks',"I'M sad to say I didn't enjoy the stay due to drilling next door at 7.30 a.m. hammering and door slamming which meant i cudn't sleep at all, I was there for Her Majesty's state funeral and had to watch on t.v. as I was exhausted! I was offered £100  'discount'when  i notified manager, but the stay was £1600  for 4nts. Cold comfort",2,2022,11,14
121,Another lovely Taj experience,"We’ve stayed at three other Taj hotels so were really looking forward to going.   It didn’t disappoint - lucked out with a recently renovated room although it had a view over what looked like a school or college sports area which wasn’t ideal!  We asked for a room overlooking the courtyard as other reviewers have suggested but they didn’t have one available.  Anyway, we managed to get early check in which more than made up for it.  The spa area is very nice indeed and I had a lovely massage with the therapist Dulley.  The room was smart but not quite as characterful as the other Taj hotels we’ve been in, but the communal areas are lovely as is the breakfast room / dining area.  Our only criticism is that it’s really very expensive and the breakfast wasn’t amazing.  Good choice but the pastries were a bit stale and the service, while very friendly, was a bit patchy and disorganised.  Saying that, it’s still a lovely hotel and we have great affection for Taj and their lovely staff so we’d go again for sure.",4,2022,11,13
121,Beautiful Experience,"My partner and I stayed for the night to celebrate our anniversary. The entire stay was completely faultless. Our room was upgraded and my partner has surprised me with flowers and chocolate strawberries but the hotel had also provided a cake and card. Every staff member we passed was polite and so welcoming and the breakfast was incredible. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and so clean! If I am lucky enough, I will without a doubt definitely return.",5,2022,11,13
121,The most convinient place to stay with the best service quality I have tried in London,I have been staying at taj since 2018 and the reason I choose it every single time I visit London is because of the service quality before the actual place which is the most convenient but this time I would like to thank the manager Duane and modov and basheer for their help and understanding to make my extended stay even better! I would definitely choose taj again and again because of the amazing service.,5,2022,11,12
121,Excellent family service,I just came for dinner with my boisterous 4 year old and Nayeema and team were beyond hospitable.   Nothing was too much for them and both food and service were excellent.  Definitely a good place for a young family in spite of the place being so posh and  swanky.,5,2022,11,12
121,Quite positive,"The room we got was not 24 square meters, as promised, 16 square meters at most.
The ventilation was poor, far too warm, even though we lowered the thermostat to 16 C.
At check-in we were charged way too high  price. When checking out, I showed the email with the confirmed price, then a refund was made.",3,2022,11,10
121,Great location,"The hotel is centrally located, the ability to walk to most landmarks. Our suite was very spacious and the bathroom too! Breakfast is great though go early to avoid the lengthy wait to be seated.  The major let down every time we visit is the TV connectivity - which is poor. Despite maintenance coming to 'fix' the problem it remained faulty till we checked out.",4,2022,11,10
121,Mr pradeep sekar,"Crown jewel in the heart of central london.
My sincere appreciation to sreekumar and fraizer for going out the way to make sure we felt at home and taking care of everything. Incredible service and hospitality through out.

Many thanks and best wishes

121,Taj's St James Court London - A Classy Heritage Hotel right near Buckingham Palace,"This place is a real very old heritage building well improved and maintained by Taj Hotels. This Hotel is superb by all means rooms are huge and classy, service is just the Taj class. Location is so good... near to Buckingham palace and also near to lot of good restaurants and shopping area, Train station St James also is at walking distance.",5,2022,11,10
121,A real gem,"My husband I stayed several days at this beautiful hotel. It was a unique experience for us.The room was delightful. Although small in comparison to most hotel rooms we have stayed at, it was designed with innovative touches that made up for a smaller room than we were used to. For example, the bathroom mirror was treated in such a way that when the bathroom was steamed up from a shower, the center stayed clear so that you could use the mirror despite the steam. How did they do that? Alcoves are built in to provide a reading or sitting area and another with comfortable well lite work space including desk. Best of all was the extremely well trained staff that anticipated our every need. When we let the food service know that we would not be able to have our included breakfast one day because of an early tour, they provided food so generous that and well packed that it lasted for the following 11 hours (breakfast and lunch.) I would definitely return to this gem (also extremely well located.)",5,2022,11,08
121,Family stay,The Taj hotel was a great experience. They were super accommodating with the rooms and friendly staff members. They ensured our stay was a memorable one at the Taj. Thank you for the amazing service. We will come again,5,2022,11,06
121,Third and last stay here.,"My husband and I and our 9 year old daughter styrs here for the third time 22/23 Oct. Room 641. The previous two times, i booked directly with the hotel. This time, my husband booked through booking.com. Perhaps due to this, we were out in an awful room. Truly nauseating decor from 1979. Water damaged curtains, and above window. Large room (only plus). They had forgotten to put up he's for our daughter. TV kept going black and we gave up waiting for someone to fix. Other children received welcome bags. Our daughter did not. Horrible shower and mould around top. All of that for £438 for 1 night. Do better Taj!",2,2022,11,02
121,"What a hotel, location, history, and guest service ","The Taj in London is a unique hotel that makes you feel in between history of England and India: Sreekumar, the Duty manager is an outstanding manager, customer service and making sure the guests are taken care of is his life 24/7. ",5,2022,10,31
121,Fabulous  hotel,"We had a fabulous time at taj Hotel.
From the minute we've arrived, the staff made as feel so welcomed.
Everyone at hotel was brilliant  and the facilities were amazing.
We had really great and relaxing time.
We will be definitely coming  back
I would like to say a special thank you to the manager Beata, who went extra mile to make our stay so fabulous.

",5,2022,10,31
121,A short one-night stay,"We stayed at the property for a night. The legendary Taj hospitality was on display and no complaints there. The rooms were a bit small than what we're used to at other Taj properties. However, for the location and the brand, the rooms were competitively priced in my opinion. 

The food at the restaurant (TH@51) was great. The in-room dining experience was good as well, though the food could have been better. The location and the decor makes this property worth it and we had a great time! ",4,2022,10,30
121,Amazing Stay! Incredible Value and Experience in London.,"I've stayed in some high end, quality hotels in London, and this was by far the best hotel experience I've had in London. The hotel staff were very friendly and efficient. The quality of our room and amenities were top-notch! And the Royal Afternoon Tea is unmatched. I won't stay anywhere else when I'm in London. Thanks St. James Court! You're the best!",5,2022,10,25
121,A stunning hotel and very memorable stay. Cannot be faulted ,"My husband and I have just returned following a one night stay at this amazing hotel. We had booked it to celebrate our Wedding anniversary.
We were greeted by lovely Sunaina at the front desk who warmly welcomed us and wished us a very Happy Anniversary.  She had kindly upgraded our room from a classic to executive suite so we could be spoilt and celebrate in style.
Our room was gorgeous. A sitting room adjoining the bedroom. Spotlessly clean, neutral tones. A stunning (and delicious) cake was left for us with Happy anniversary written on the top. A beautiful gesture that made us feel very welcome instantly.
The bed was huge! Crisp linens and fluffy pillows. We could not fault anything.
This year our anniversary coincided with Diwali. This hotel embraced  the Diwali celebrations and each corner of the hotel and courtyard was brightly decorated with flowers, candles and lights. It was a marvelous sight. The courtyard itself takes your breathe away with its natural beauty. A real oasis in this busy city.We took many photos there.
We participated in Diya decorating and  candle lighting  and on Diwali day were greeted by staff members with ""Happy Diwali.""
I used the sauna, jacuzzi and pool. Definitely felt more relaxed after spending time there. Bliss! 
The lovely touch of having a room turn down when we returned after dinner was a sweet surprise.Slippers left by our bed, lights dimmed, bed turned and chocolates on our bedside table. We felt so special, so comfortable and so at home.
Breakfast the next morning was superb. A mix of continental, British and Indian. I had the aloo parantha and chole my husband had the eggs Benedict.
My soft, warm parantha was made perfectly. Not oily or heavy and the chole were mouthwatering. Fruits, cereals, nuts, soya keema, kachori, dosas, waffles , pancakes to name a few were also available. The drinks available were masala chai, freshly squeezed juices, tea, coffee etc.
We had a late checkout but honestly did not want to leave.
Our celebration was over but our memories will stay with us forever. Sunaina personally came to say goodbye to us. Bashir at reception deserves a special mention for his kindness and knowledge too.
The small box of mithai as a farewell from Sunaina was the cherry on the cake for us. We used the mithai for our own prayer ceremony later that evening for Diwali at our home.
We will definitely be returning to this hotel. It is so close to public transport, restaurants and tourist sites.
A  Jewel in the city. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made our trip so memorable. It means a lot to us.",5,2022,10,25
121,A perfect stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. The service was fantastic and it was lovely to sit by the bar (in very comfortable chairs) and listen to the piano player. This was a belated birthday celebration and there were smoothies, a slice of chocolate cake and some balloons in the room when we arrived (a wonderful touch). The room was spotless and modern with everything you could possibly need. We had the waffles for breakfast which were very tasty. We cannot fault our stay! ",5,2022,10,23
121,Poor experience,"Poor experience, have to go back & forth to reception several times in order for them to sort out key cards; each walk takes 10mins at least, while the staff would not care about customers and just go in front of you - no customer care or whatsoever",2,2022,10,23
121,Overall good but not wow,"Just as we come it’s been an absolute disappointment the the over all service is very very poor 
Not upto the name 
We have been living in Taj group of hotels always but this one has been a sorry decision 
We come here as we had good expectation with service with In room dining and housekeeping 
The welcome was wonderful the front desk the (guest service )concierge has been very good 
Been day for today patiently waiting to see if it gets better 
Basics like water, stirrers missing 
Breakfast has been very good but service is poor
The staff is good it’s something with the top management is not going good.
Over All it’s not been as expected:(",2,2022,10,21
121,Awesome trip with great accommodations in a great location,"Great location, service and food! Beautiful setting in courtyard. Room service 2 x a day, free water, coffee and tea in room. Treats left in room almost daily. We stayed 7 nights!! The only thing was the concierge desk was not as helpful as you would expect.",5,2022,10,21
121,Excellent hotel,"Wheel chair access provided in all areas for those with mobility issues.  Staff always willing to help.  Executive King room had a walk-in shower and the room facilities were excellent.  Breakfast in TH@51 offered a good tasty selection of Indian and western breakfast, breads, pastries tea, coffee and juice.  Dawali Jasmin tea at hotel Kona restaurant was colourful, very tasty and a real treat!",5,2022,10,21
121,Good and bad.,The hotel and staff were excellent. The breakfast was also very good. But the beds were very uncomfortable. It was a very expensive night for a bad night’s sleep. My son ended up sleeping on the sofa. We wouldn’t recommend this hotel unfortunately which is such a shame as it had many positives.,3,2022,10,21
121,Great London Experience,"the location of the St. James Court, A Taj Hotel is ideal.  We could walk to the parks, palace and many dining options.  Close to the Pubs as well.
The Concierge staff were unbelievable.  They booked dining reservations, made excellent suggestions and were overall very helpful.
I will stay here again when I return.",5,2022,10,20
121,"An over priced, disappointment","The rooms on your website looking amazing. The basic room we were given wouldn't have looked out of place in a 1970's bed and breakfast. The furniture was outdated, the shower sprayed water out of the bath, the unhygienic shower curtain barely reached the top of the bath, so water sprayed onto the floor. Thin, cheap duvet, uncomfortable pillows.  When I complained to the front desk the reception just wanted to upgrade us (with extra cost) to another room.  I later understood that you operate a 'renovated' side of the hotel, with the other side being 'unrenovated', what a shame that isn't clear on your website, if you had I would never have stayed with you. A  Premier Inn would have been infinitely better.",1,2022,10,20
121,Great Location and Good Value,"I'm a Taj hotels member and we stayed in London for a week in September.  This was, unfortunately, the week of the Queen's funeral, but the stay and staff were excellent throughout.  Our room was not only held for us despite the influx of well-heeled travelers, but we were given a room upgrade.  I consider the entire stay a very good value for the price paid.  The hotel has a perfect location within easy walking of the main tourism sites and mass transit.  The only negative was the one operating elevator for the entire hotel and leaving the outside doors open during cold weather, brrrr, but these are minor.  If you decide to stay here, enroll in the Taj program first for a better rate.",5,2022,10,19
121,Fraizer is absolutely amazing.,"Fraizer, a gentleman who works at the hotel reception/ front desk, is fantastic. 
He is an example of what excellent customer service should look like. Always very professional and considerate. 
He deserves a special acallade.
Thank you, Fraizer :-)",5,2022,10,19
121,Family Holidays,"Hotel is very old, hotel entrance street is very deserted. Not a charming street. Restaurant and food is really good. We have booked the hotel considering it is on Buckingham palace gate... But disappointed.",3,2022,10,18
121,Elegant with the Perfect Location!!,We had nothing but the best stay at this hotel. The location was perfect. Close to major tourist attractions and the tube. All the staff were professional and courteous. So very helpful in making our stay perfect. We had an issue with the A/C and when they couldn’t fix it they immediately gave us another room. All the added touches of the balloons for our anniversary and the afternoon chocolates were wonderful. Also as we celebrated our anniversary on one night it was such a pleasant surprise to find a small cake waiting for us in our room with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate. We could not have asked for a more beautiful hotel to stay in. The rooms were so comfortable and very spacious for us. The breakfast was absolutely delicious. So many choices. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all my family and friends and would love to stay again.,5,2022,10,18

121,A Lucky Find!,"We needed a hotel near Victoria station and lucked onto the St. James Court.  Great restaurant for a late night light Indian meal after a long flight, a super breakfast and superb room and bed in a great location. Service was excellent, staff friendly and helpful. We’ll worth the price. Only wish we had more time, as we were in transit.",5,2022,10,18
121,Mrs Guasch,"Very good service as an hotel of 5 stars . Very clean and i recommend to spend time in the Jiva spa and have excellent Indian food  in his dining restaurant . 
A great experience and for sure I will be back",5,2022,10,17
121,A very nice hotel to stay,"Friendly and very efficient welcome at the reception desk by Federica.
Very comfortable room with a large bathroom.
Impressive breakfast buffet with a wide variety of dishes and nice staff.
Ideally located hotel near Buckingham and the parks. A place to come back.",5,2022,10,16
121,Excellent service,Excellent service as always from Naveen and his team in the Taj. Special thanks this time especially to Bristy and Fathima Nasrin at breakfast and the reception team. It’s always a pleasure to come back to the Taj. ,5,2022,10,14
121,First time and best experience in Central London,"A great place to stay, spacious rooms, very clean and great bed and air-condition.
excellent staff and warm welcoming. 
breakfast is worth the money from continental to Indian and again very easy-going staff and taking care of allergies so easily. ",5,2022,10,14
121,Best breakfast,"I always stay at the Taj St Lames for business travel and breakfast is always a highlight for me. 
 Bristi was fabulous and attentive this morning at breakfast. Thank you for a great start to my day. ",5,2022,10,14
121,Excellent,Professional and friendly staff. Fantastic hotel in a great location. It is luxury at a reasonable price. This is the first time I have stayed here and I would definately book again in the future ☺️..,5,2022,10,12
121,Should have booked into Travelodge,"I chose this hotel as it was the closest to the theatre I was attending. I would have been better off going to a Travelodge as the bedroom and the breakfast would have more superior there. Given the price I paid for an overnight stay, I expected something more grandeur than a 3/4 bed and sitting at the bar to eat a mediocre breakfast. In addition, beyond the reception, which looks quite grand, this hotel could do with some care, as the carpet was lifting up by the lifts on the first floor. Shabby to say the least. I wouldn't be staying there again.",1,2022,10,12
121,Great stay,We stayed here for the first time with our daughter due to my husbands last minute work commitments. We usually stay at the neighbouring taj suites as it's perfect with a toddler due to space and kitchen area. However we were pleasantly surprised at how lovely our room was. Not only that but the staff at reception were so kind to our daughter providing a soft bear and colouring books for her to use. Breakfast was by far the best we have experienced in a london hotel and everyone was so helpful. I would also like to say a big thank you to Gaurav Lamba from marketing who went above and beyond for us taking time out of his busy schedule to discuss and give advice on booking a event in the hotel he is a real gem and we are looking forward to returning.,5,2022,10,11

121,Great service,"The concierges at the hotel were fantastic.  They went to great pains to help with arrangements and advice.  We were there during the Queen's funeral procession, and there were lots of obstacles to getting around, but the hotel was always extremely helpful.  It's a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location---a five minute walk to either Buckingham Palace or Westminster Abbey.  I would absolutely stay there again.",5,2022,10,07
121,"Awesome, Must visit hotel in London","Awesome place..Amazing hospitality. Central to all the must see places.. 

I am surely going to come back.

Food was good and rooms were spacious and clean.  We had taken the executive suite. 

Special thanks to Tushar from front desk",5,2022,10,07
121,"Great location, Comfortable stay","This was the first time I stayed at Taj St. James Court. The location is 10 / 10; Check in experience was 6/10; Room would be 7/10; breakfast would be 9/10. The gym could have been better so barely used it. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The room was slightly small, no view as such. I would say that on a value for money, the place was 8/10. Overall its a recommended place, but don't have too high expectations of an ultra luxury stay. The hotel is very close to victoria station and st james park station. Buckingham Palace is at the end of the street, so royalty are neighbors. Very close to Westminster Palace and Westminster Abbey.",4,2022,10,06
121,Absolutely great experience,"Amazing, super friendly staff! The hotel is absolutely stunning. The building is beautiful, with big and super conformable rooms (we stayed in a Premium King and was great, loved the bathroom). Perfect breakfast with a lot of choices. The location is perfect, close to Buckingham Palace and Westminster.",5,2022,10,05
121,Great Concierge,"The concierge, William, was instrumental in making our visit a success. He gave us excellent restaurant recommendations, assisted us with our previously arranged car rental and return, and helped us navigate London during the Queen’s funeral. He was personable, extremely knowledgeable and enabled us in so many ways.",5,2022,10,04
121,"Excellent service, beautiful hotel","We stayed one night and would've liked to stay more, the hotel is really spacious, clean, smells like flowers, the staff is super friendly and eager to help in any way. Have a special thanks to concierge Guillaume who went the extra mile for me, helped me send a postcard at the last minute and payed it himself. Couldn't be more grateful.",5,2022,10,04
121,A Trip to remember!!,"Spent 8 nights here at the Taj, St. James Court, and was very happy to see that the Taj hospitality extends worldwide. I expected nothing less. A seamless check-in, which after a long journey is just what you need! and an equally seamless check-out. a special thank you to Mr. Agnelo Lobo, Ms. Nihita & Svlen at the Hamptons. they did all they could to make my stay comfortable. No request was to small for them. to the extent, that when I said the bed wasn't feeling very comfortable they got the mattress changed immediately. Loved staying at the Taj, their afternoon tea at KONA, i recommend highly, a lovely themed spread combined with the Taj Hospitality is a wonderful experience, a special mention for KAPIL, who was so patient while we kept asking him to click our pictures! thank you! & thank you Taj Hotels for your hospitality.
That said, its very well located with the underground being a stones throw from the property, even the bus is a 5 minutes walk, so connectivity is sorted, the Buckingham Palace is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, so is the St. James Park, very touristy but at the same time a beautiful and quiet area, in the after hours. The hotel is happily busy at all hours, so its feels very vibrant and lively, which is a nice feeling to come home to. Rooms were a better size than other hotels of this category.
So the next time your in London, try the St. James Court, you'll feel like your coming home..",5,2022,10,03
121,"Not all rooms have heating, air con, silence or healthy air.","Hotel was great until it reopen after covid. Since then on the hottest day in the Uk i was given a room with no  air con. Last week I was given a room with toxic fumes to be thought to be coming from engines outside the window.
Yesterday I was given a room with no heating. I was then changed to one with heating but next to the tube station (#333). You can feel and hear the tube ( underground) passing every minute from 5 am to 12 am. Just time to avoid it.",1,2022,09,30
121,Good hotel experience,"Lovely hotel, staff super friendly and room really well maintained and cleaned to an extremely high standard. Reason for a four star is the air con didn’t work and with the hotel full because of HM’s funeral, and only two lifts - one was out of order.
The bed sheets were the nicest sheets I’ve ever slept in, I’d buy them as they really were divine. Gorgeous big fluffy towels and lovely bath products. 
I used the sauna and spa which were fabulous. Wish I’d had breakfast - next time. 
Location is superb as well. 
I’ll definitely stay again.",4,2022,09,27
121,An oasis in the hubub of a beautiful city,"We stayed in the Taj London for three days on our way to an extended vacation. This happened to fall at the same time as the mourning period for the queen and was quite hectic around the location. The staff was attentive, accommodating and professional at every step. They made us feel as valued, and as important as anyone who may walk in the door. The experience was a haven away from the hectic flow of the city.",5,2022,09,26

121,Very posh and friendly,"I left an earlier review all 5 star, but I forgot to mention the incredible jazz pianist they had playing in the lobby one night. I wish I knew the name of the artist as he was incredible.!!!!!! This man was on a level you don't hear everyday. This hotel was wonderful!!",5,2022,09,25
121,Great place for families and couples,"The service was immaculate, the server Martin was very attentive and very helpful.  The food was fantastic and the steak we ordered was very well cooked. Overall, the restaurant atmosphere was very relaxing - I forgot I was in a busy London! Would recommend.",5,2022,09,23
121,"Good location, horrible bed","While the location is excellent and the hotel is clean and the staff friendly, the beds are the worst I have ever encountered.  Sit down and immediately sink down to springs.  They changed the mattress with no difference.  Their solution was to place a board on top of the mattress.  If I wanted to sleep on a hard surface, I would have slept on the floor.  I resorted to using 6 large pillows placed sideways to create some semblance of padding.  The food was decent but over priced and too much slanted to Indian fare.",2,2022,09,23
121,Excellent Taj St James Court,"Have just returned from a short stay at Taj St James court and as always the hotel & staff have exceeded my expectations.  We had stayed at this hotel  earlier in the year to celebrate the Queens Jubilee not knowing we would be returning only a few months later for her funeral. This hotel always delivers the highest levels of customer service from concierge, reception to restaurant & bar staff.  I have would recommend anyone staying in London to consider this hotel to the extent we have now booked a holiday in Dubai staying at the Taj Exotica on the experience of our stay at this hotel!

121,Great location and ambience for a London first visit.,"Has the feel of a unique older downtown hotel with a friendly and high quality level of service. Great place to spend several days to tour London for the first time. Walking distance to Victoria Station, and to many of the famous old London tourist attractions. I would not hesitate to book this again.",5,2022,09,21
121,Family trip to London,"We had a Wonderful visit. This was our second trip to London, this time with family and our second time staying at St James Court, aTaj hotel. We like the location and have been very satisfied with our room and any dealings we have had with staff.",5,2022,09,20
121,A very pleasant experience. Thank you,"A year later after leaving a not so complimentary review of this hotel my wife and I returned to enjoy a special anniversary for us and to give the hotel a second chance. 
We were not disappointed, I understand our last visit coincided with a hotel badly lacking in staff due to the Covid Pandemic, however this was not the case this time. 
Every member of staff was attentive and efficient, given this was the weekend of The Queen’s  Funeral this was all the more impressive. 
In summary a wonderful experience, great friendly staff and a beautiful room. 
Thank you so much.",5,2022,09,19
121,A great week at the Taj in London,"Everything about the experience at the hotel was 5 stars plus.  
The service is the best I have experienced and I have travelled a ton.
We walked almost exclusively which says volumes about the location and many of the walks are through the parks.",5,2022,09,17
121,Fine but not again,"The hotel is old and requires further care and update to the hallways furniture, rooms and specially bathrooms. It  remains a nice huge hotel and the room is actually nicely spaced. However for the price paid there’s better options. I extend a special thank you to the restaurant staff all welcoming and nice and having breakfast in the court is very joyful. 

One note I add and I don’t  appreciate is noticing the difference in dealing with us in compare to visitors who are actually english or European from the reception team, after all I’m paying if not the same then more expensive rate staying in this place.",3,2022,09,17
121,A Fabulous Hotel.,"Our first time at St James Court Hotel and we will definitely be returning!
Our luxury stay started the moment we walked into the stunning lobby and everything and everyone about this hotel just continued to impress.
Firstly, the location is excellent.
Secondly, the standard of service and care from the whole team was exemplary. We were greeted with smiles whenever we asked for anything and all the staff are extremely courteous and so willing to help in anyway they can. 
They have won the Best Concierge award and it's easy to see why as their standard of knowledge is awesome.
The breakfast includes a plentiful array English, Indian and Continental dishes plus a choice of freshly cooked items which are served to your table. (It was 4pm before we even felt remotely hungry again!)
The outdoor courtyard with fountain is a little haven of tranquility in central London and we were even offered some complimentary services in the Spa.
Our standard double room had everything we expected and more and the bed was divinely comfortable.
An absolute winner 👍",5,2022,09,16
121,Very attentive staff,"While the hotel was nice, one elevator wasn't working which was only a minor inconvenience.  The staff was GREAT!   Two members of the very attentive staff were outstanding.  Bashir was at the front desk. When my travel partner did not arrive back in time from the opera, he waited with me for two hours (1.5 hours past his time to leave work) to make sure my partner got back safely.  At the breakfast and later tea, we found Kumar to be very helpful, efficient, and a good leader for other wait staff.",5,2022,09,16
121,Excellent service and well located hotel,"My wife and I were fortunate to stay here from 7th to 12th September 2022.

It's a wonderful hotel with great Taj service and highly recommended for everyone who wishes to visit London.

It's walking distance from the Buckingham palace and very close to all the important attractions in London.",5,2022,09,12
121,Wonderful birthday stay and a lovely hotel,"Wonderful stay and a lovely hotel
Service on reception and in the lobby was first class on arrival. The facilities in the hotel
Itself were good, the hotel was well located close to bars and restaurants but quiet enough for a good nights sleep. I would stay here again. One of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had. Lots of variety and food was fresh. An amazing birthday experience and was made to feel special.",5,2022,09,10
121,Great location,"A great location (walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster and St. James' Park). Rooms a decent size for Central London (although in a double the bathroom was very small).  A nice cozy bar area and fantastic courtyard, although service was hit and miss - some staff were superb, others may have been on training still(?).",4,2022,09,09
121,A wonderful 3 night stay,"My wife and I have just returned home from a 3 night stay at the St James Court hotel in London.
I booked a Premium King bed room and couldn't have been happier.
It was spacious, clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The shower room was of a similarly high standard.
Breakfast was buffet style, with a huge selection of food, including some delicious Indian dishes.
All the staff were helpful, professional and incredibly friendly.
I am somewhat surprised that the hotel is 4 star.....our experience was definitely a 5 star one.
Thank you.",5,2022,09,08
121,Fabulous!,"This hotel was beyond expectations! Check in was amazing - we were able to get into our room early and the gifts they gave my young son were unexpected and very much loved! 

The team members were all wonderful and so friendly and helpful! Marcos helped us with our luggage when we checked in and out and was always very nice and understanding about all the bags we had!

The room was spectacular! We weren't expecting it to be as big and comfortable and accommodating as it was, but it was so lovely.

I cannot speak enough about how much we loved this hotel! It was convenient to all the places we had plans to visit and could walk everywhere. We will definitely book here again!",5,2022,09,07
121,Racially abused and the hotel staff did nothing,Verbally and Racially abused by a drunk person in the Lobby of the hotel. Sreekumar did absolutely nothing forcing me to defend myself . His excuse was that the guy was drunk. I will be reporting this matter to the police in the morning. Hope the hotel maintains the cctv footage,1,2022,09,07
121,Hidden Gem in Central London,"What a fantastic property! Right from front desk check-in ably managed by Frazier Machado who works hard to ensure that guests enjoy their stay at The Taj to the max with regular follow-ups on rooms, amenities and services to the Concierge team (William, James, Diego) ever willing to provide expert guidance to tours, theatre, restaurant reservations and quickest routes to City destinations, this iconic property is really worth a stay. (It is also the only Taj in Europe I am led to believe)

Rooms are unusually large and spacious for Central London, beds super comfy, bathrooms are spotless and evening turn-down service was an unexpected surprise. The restaurant decor, fountain and ambience is a treat to the eyes. 

The young Jiva Spa team (Sri Kumar and Jindoo) are cheerful and welcoming.

Close proximity to Buckingham Palace, Green & St James Park and Victoria railway Station is an added plus.

We will definitely make St James Court (Taj) our preferred choice whenever next in London.

Keep up the great work Guys!",5,2022,09,05
121,The best hotel in London,"This has been the best experience ever for us.  I have stayed in many hotels across the UK and this is the best by far.  The food, drink, room, ambiance, staff, architecture literally everything is top quality and the hospitality second to none.  Ivonio and Kavya made our night this evening with such fantastic service.  Ivonio was charming and funny and professional and Kavya so helpful and kind and knowledgeable and made us beautiful Indian tea.  Thank you for the best time.  Try to stop us coming back.  Fabulous!!!",5,2022,09,03
121,Extreme hospitality in the heart of London,"The first advantage is the team,which works very good.
The location allows the access to all the main atractions.
The inner garden,allowing to enjoy the architecture of the buildings,is a great pleasure itself.
The restaurant gives you nice cuisine,music and services.
A special notice to the bar tenders,very inovative.
The room very clean and pleasant.
The reception very efficient.",5,2022,09,02
121,Bad Start Good Finish,"We  did a  2 night booking with the Taj for the 26th & 27th August, when we attempted to reach the hotel in our car we found it had road works outside and a No entry, try as I may we couldn't find around he Diversion.. Eventually I parked up nearby and walked to the Hotel & met up with the X Keys Concierge. Who was not that helpful.... 

By this time we were running more than 50 minutes late in which time we had allotted to eat and reach the start of the show... 
The only advice we received from the Concierge was to Reverse into the temporary  one way street, he appeared to have no knowledge  where and what street to enter....

 It would also have been helpful had the person taking the booking on the phone  warned us about the diversion and had a map of such which the Hotel could have emailed us at the time of booking... This set the two nights off to a stressful and negative start.. And it could have been so easily avoided by the Hotel being more  pro active ... 

None the less we booked in, I mentioned the problems to reception, in fairness he tried to compensate us with a upgrade but the room offered appeared ( tired and in need of  renovation... We decided to stick with the room first allotted No 659... Which in fairness was a nice and comfortable room. 

We eventfully made it to the show but with very little time to spare, so nothing to eat.. 
When we returned to the Hotel we went to the bar for a drink  and asked about room service, as the kitchen had closed we were given a menu, we chose some items just to eat in the bar...
 We were told in no uncertain terms that this was against Company policy and that they would take the order but only deliver to the room.. There was nowhere comfortable enough in the room for both of us to sit and  and eat. eat... This again left us both with a negative feeling especially as we saw the delay caused by lack of information from the Hotel in the first place ....

One other point, when we were checking in the Receptionist  was talking fast and moving their head away from us this didn't help me at all as I'm deaf  .
Not every disability can bee seen.. .

Back to the room, as I mentioned it was really comfortable and appeared to be recently refurbished, The bed was excellent as was the bathroom so we had a couple of good nights sleep if not hungry on the first night,
 Housekeeping were professional and helpful , One problem the carpet had some black stains which looked as though a previous guest had dyed their hair, although this didn't protract from the comfort...

The first, Breakfast morning brought another saga... ! The place was absolutely  Chaotic..
with no guest flow ... a complete free for all  and no organisation .... 

However, the Breakfast area and choice  is very good. It consisted of a choice of Indian Continental and, English breakfasts ( all are buffet style )  although you can order from the menu .

Which i tried on both days.. This was a bit of an experience, in that i ordered two eggs , bacon sausage and two toast.. this was all over the place with eggs being brought to table separate to everything else and like wise with the toast and then the butter 

From what I could understand is that the majority of the staff are students doing their 20 hours a week.. They're not specifically trained in Hospitality.... This is a double edged sword for the Hotel as BREXIT has caused a critical shortage of professional and well trained hotel personnel....  
And the Hotel Managers obviously have a major task in front of them.
In Fact the restaurant manager became  involved and he did his level best to accommodate us... But I don't envy his Job 

Although the boys and girls themselves want to please.. they need  more training

What IS a must is to book and dine in the Restaurant next door   Named QUILON 
This is a Micheline star Indian Restaurant  .. The Food was nothing less short  of complete perfection as indeed was the service which not conspicuous but there just when you needed them superbly managed and friendly ... .. Your meal can be booked to your room... 

All of our niggles were dealt with on site by management  .. This is a lovely hotel. And Taj is One of the best  hotel groups in the World   
  
However,  to be fair the staff do need training  a lot more and that sadly in my opinion includes front of house as well as breakfast staff",4,2022,09,01
121,Wonderful hospitality!,This hotel is convenient to many of the sites in Central London. The staff are friendly and they are very attentive to their guests needs making the stay very enjoyable. I can’t think of when I have stayed at a hotel that was more hospitable than this one.,5,2022,09,01
121,Mrs,"Poor……… 
Noisy hotel
Good location 
Charged for moving to a better room but disturbed by sounds of tube trains at night so poor sleep and was charged £50 extra per night. Unbelievable . I therefore would not recommend this hotel . But was so looking forward to it.",2,2022,09,01
121,Our new favorite hotel,"Sometimes hotels are listed as 5 stars and should be 4 stars. Other times 4 star listed hotels should be 5 stars — this is the case with St James Court. 5 star service, attitude and kindness. This is our new favorite hotel around the world. The location can’t be beat; the service is exceptional. And the breakfast is among the best anywhere. Absolute 5 star experience.",5,2022,09,01
121,"Hidden Gem of London, few steps from Buckingham Palace.","Great 5 stars hotel in London, we got the nice newly renovated rooms. Well located, just few steps from Buckingham Palace and Saint James Park underground station. Very good service overall especially staffs at the reception for check in and check out, very helpful. Hidden gem of London.",5,2022,08,31
121,Outstanding Stay,"The St. James Court Hotel is absolutely lovely. Our flight arrived to London in the early morning so we went straight to the hotel to drop off our bags and check-in. Anuja checked us in and went above and beyond for us. She told us she would try and have our room ready for us as soon as possible and she certainly delivered. Our room was ready hours ahead of schedule and our room was a much more upgraded one than we booked! Anuja, thank you so much for starting off our stay so perfectly! Everyone from the doorman, to the housekeepers, to the waiters at breakfast were kind and accommodating. The location of this hotel is unbeatable. I did morning runs in St. James park, and we were able to walk to almost anywhere in London. There were fantastic restaurants around (Chez Antionette, Bon Gusto, & the Ivy Victoria to name a few favorites) and our room was wonderful. We have already recommended the St. James Court Hotel to our friends and family. When we come back to London, we will definitely be staying here again!",5,2022,08,31
121,Mrs,"Hotel reception is nice and location too Buckingham palace at the end if the road and nice high street with eating places .The hotel reception was nice but can always smell food in corridors which is a put off

Staff are polite around the hotel and ambiance is good too.",4,2022,08,31

121,"Beautiful Hotel, Quiet location","We had been staying earlier in Covent Gardens and moved here to have AC  and a more luxurious hotel. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were spacious. It's right next to Buckingham palace. We used the Bus service from here b\c it was more convenient then the tube for where we wanted to go. Also rented bikes nearby once. We had breakfast here, and enjoyed the juices and uthappam the most. Also had two dinners here at the Taj@51 restaurant. Liked the special dinner more the first time, the 2nd time we found it too spicy for the average Indian. The wait staff and hotel staff are very friendly and attentive.",5,2022,08,30
121,"So many problems, and a really poor service.","A number of issues which really have made this an extremely poor experience:
•	No valet on arrival as agreed and advised to park in a spot which resulted in us getting a parking ticket, despite me advising that this spot seemed incorrect. I had to waste time on check-out resolving and will also need to pay the ticket now, wasting even more of my time.
•	Room was upgraded, despite us advising a normal room was fine.
•	We were unable to extend the checkout time, despite requesting this on booking. In the end we were able to get this pushed to 1pm.
•	Water bottle in the room had faulty cap which resulted in not being able to open the bottle
•	We requested an ice bucket on arrival which was never sent up. We in fact ended up having to call to get it sent up several hours later, at which point we were already too tired.",1,2022,08,30
121,Always an absolute pleasure to spend time at the St James' Court.,"A very happy return to St James' Court after a year of Covid and two years abroad. The staff welcomed me back like a long lost relative. It was good to see so many old faces, something which is rare in hotels, as staff turn over at an alarming rate. I wouldn't entertain the idea of staying anywhere else in London now that Taj hotels have returned this gem to its former glory.",5,2022,08,28
121,Lovely stay and perfect location!,"We had split our stay in London with our family to be in two different locations for ease of getting around with two small boys (ages 3 & 4). We had previously stayed at Taj 51 when we were sans little monkeys but this time we chose St. James. The pluses were many: a beautiful newly renovated room, exceptional breakfast and kind staff, plus the location truly can’t be beat! The unusual aspects are really down to Covid recovery it seems; elevators out of service at times, slight delays when asking for things, less staff than they need and the most unusual one I’ve experienced, needing to request room cleaning each day if you want/need it. Again these are slight annoyances and nothing that should really count against the charm and the experience of staying here. Oh, plus the boys received darling Guardsman Teddy Bears upon check out. Such a lovely touch!",4,2022,08,27
121,It was a fantastic experience in a great location.,"I really love this hotel.  I stayed at this location almost 10 years ago, and it was also fantastic.  For this experience, even though I was early, they gave me a key to the business center so I could write loved ones.  The room was clean.  I had a great view of the courtyard.  Basically, this hotel provided me with a nice place to come back to after a hectic day of traveling.  And everyone I dealt with at the front desk was extremely friendly.  Thank you!",5,2022,08,25
121,An Amazing Visit,The hotel is centrally located close to St James & Victoria Stations and Buckingham Palace.  Our room was spotless and had an amazing view of the courtyard below. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I forgot my adapter and they graciously found one and loaned one to me for the duration of our stay. I would recommend the Taj to any of our friends and family.,5,2022,08,25
121,Memorable,"Excellent stay at the hotel. Impeccable service, smiling and hospitable staff, great food. Over all great experience.
They take care of the minutest requirements if the guest. I recommend the the hotel, either for business or even for family stay. Keep it up.",5,2022,08,23
121,Lovely stay,"First time staying here, I was surprised at how lovely this hotel was.  Great location a few blocks from the Palace. Absolutely lovely courtyard where meals were served in good weather (which it was while we were there) and a wonderful spa.  My room was exquisite. It was in the more modern building and reflects a lovely updated bathroom, and is bright and spacious.
Service by all employees was excellent.",5,2022,08,23
121,Amazing hotel! We just loved it!,"We had the chance to stay in the modern part of the hotel, in the blue part. It was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The room was big and comfortable, we had a convenient 2 bathrooms, we were 4 in the room, the staff were very friendly, and breakfast was amazing!

I really recommend this hotel! It was also in a great location, close walking distance to the Buckingham Palace, and also near to Big Ben. 

I live quiet places where I can rest, that was also another 5 star from this beautiful hotel. 

The staff at the restaurant made us feel like home.

Thank you!",5,2022,08,23

121,Excellent service,"The hotel is beautiful, but the most important thing is that the service is amazing. We were given a beautiful large room with a great view. I would especially like to thank Mrs. Beata for the fantastic service and thanks to her we could have dinner in our favorite restaurant.",5,2022,08,21
121,Good Hotel - Nice Location,"Overall good experience. Mentionable people - Tushar at front desk, the whole F&B Staff.

One gentlemen was rude at the concierge desk - i think more of an exception to the other staff that I saw in the hotel.

Food is ok for an Indian Palate.",4,2022,08,19

Thank you to all the staff .",5,2022,08,16
121,Weekend at the Taj,"Beautiful hotel , the courtyard had a feel
Of India . The rooms were fine but would have been nice if they had more of a splash of colour like the rich Indian colours . Food and drinks were great but sometimes the service was slow . Staff all very friendly",4,2022,08,16
121,City Break,"Very good hotel, clean, safe, friendly personnel. The room had a cpnfortaable size. The view was bot so good. The breakfast was not complete, they are charging separated for omelettes and others usual breakfast dishes, but they serve plenty in the included breakfast.",5,2022,08,16
121,Very disappointed,"Note - this is the review I left with Taj.

I had booked this stay to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. I rang in advance to ask if the room could be decorated before we arrived. I was told this would not be a problem and in addition to the normal treats you leave for all the guests, the kitchen would place a 50th cake as well - all good so far. At check in, I've been told we've been upgraded as well. Wow, now I'm thinking this is why I always stay at the Taj ( I'm an Inner Circle member ). Imagine my disappointment when we entered room 650 - it's much smaller than I expected, very basic and no small treats or birthday cake ! I discreetly tell my wife I need to check something at reception because I'm thinking they have just given me the wrong room by mistake. So, I go to the front desk and speak to the lady. She tells me that I have the correct room and does not know why the cake is not there. I explain that this is the smallest room I've ever had and I can't possibly believe it's an upgrade from what I had booked. If room 650 is an upgrade, exactly what kind of rooms was I going to get before. She explained this room had better wardrobes - really, I'm only here for 2 nights ! She spends a few minutes tapping on the computer and tells me this is the best they have. So, now it's getting worse. On Friday morning, we leave after breakfast for a walk around London and come back to the hotel at 2PM as we have Spa treatments booked for 3:15PM. We entered the room as we left it - not cleaned, old towels and the bed is not made up. I try calling from the room phone but nobody is picking up - both at housekeeping and the front desk. Now I'm getting really upset - is this really the level of service that Taj has become? I walk down to the front desk and ask why the room has still not been done. It's the same lady as before and she asks whether it's to do with the birthday cake. I'm not worried about the cake now - the moment has gone and it's very disappointing. I ask to speak to the supervisor and the lady tells me they are with a guest. So I tell her I will wait. She disappears into the back for about 5 minutes and comes out and tells me she can't get hold of the supervisor. ( in the meantime a cake has miraculously been delivered to the room - while I was at the front desk and my wife was on her own - nice surprise ! ). Anyway, it is what it is and I will know better next time.

Some other things :
1) My room should have included a 10% discount on the Spa treatment. I asked when I checked out if this was applied and was assured it would have been. As the invoice was emailed to me, I did not check and trusted that the man at the front desk was telling the truth. Later in the day, I checked the invoice emailed to me to find the discounts have not been applied, so now I have been fraudulently cheated out of that discount as my card has been charged the full amount.
2) You should not leave empty boxes in the bathroom - my wife wanted a shower cap and there was nothing in the box. Luckly, she had one from a previous trip. When the bathroom was cleaned, there was no replacement for the empty box.
3) You need to have more Indian snacks during the middle of the day. We decided to have a late lunch in the Courtyard. The first menu we got only had western snacks, the second menu was the Indian evening menu and the third menu we got was the general evening menu. No pakoras, no dabeli's, no chats, no masala chai...
4) On breakfast on Saturday morning, there was clearly a shortage of staff. After a long wait to be seated, we ordered breakfast from the menu and masala chai. The food arrived and was eaten but still no chai. I managed to call over the waitress to remind her. Just as we had given up hope, the chai arrived.

Please know that I am a loyal Taj customer and always choose Taj hotels as a preference. However this time, the stay at St James was really disappointing - and on my wife's 50th birthday which I was hoping would be memorable for good reasons.",1,2022,08,15
121,Superb service,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We were given an “upgrade” - this was still quite a small room so the standard room must be tiny. However it had all that was needed, the ac was excellent, and the room as quiet. Don’t take many clothes though as the wardrobe was tiny! The breakfast was outstanding, excellent food and very helpful and attentive staff. In fact all the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. The hotel was spotlessly clean. The courtyard was very pleasant to sit in, as was the bar and lobby.",4,2022,08,14
121,"Comfortable luxurious stay, room for improvement","We stayed for 2 nights family of 3 for my son's birthday. Excellent room specs, very quiet and comfortable, ample drinking water bottles supplied, all requests kept at front desk,  exemplary service. We really had a good time.
One lift was out of action for the whole weekend, caused long waits at lift. Long wait for check in, offered complimentary bottle of wine as a good gesture.
Very surprised with TV, very slow internet connection, TV was wrongly labelled for another room, chromecast didnt work despite multiple attempts, engineer attended twice but no resolution. As goodwill gesture we were refunded £25, but a better quality well connected SMART TV expected at a hotel of this level.",4,2022,08,14
121,S Premji,"Excellent experience!, everything was superb!!, we love our stay !. We will definitely going back again!. 
We want to thanks All the staff and management for giving us such excellent hospitality. 
We also want to thanks restaurant and bar staff and marketing team.",5,2022,08,13
121,Business trip - Solo for 2 nights,"I thought the hotel was OK. 
Room was very small and quite dated for the price i paid. 
Had to call out the maintenance team because none of my sockets, TV etc would work, they came about 2 hours later when i was getting into bed. 
The coffee machine never worked despite asking at Reception. 
Hotel was OK, in a good location, but doesn't justify the price or star rating for the quality of the rooms and service.",3,2022,08,12
121,Amazing service,"First time I stayed at this hotel chain and will
Stay with them whenever I travel. Just great service on every level. Loved the music and singer during drinks. The cleanliness was great and every staff member was just great. Kudos",5,2022,08,09
121,It's okay but can be better,"1. Electrical systems - This needs an upgrade. My previous stay, I had to wake up at 2am because all my electricity was busted. I had to move in the middle of the night in which I had to wake up early for work in the morning. I wasn't even comped or given a comp night and all I got was ""sorry"". 
2. Elevators - On my last stay on the last week of July 2022, the elevators were out of service for over a week. I don't think that's a 4-star rating hotel service.
3. Telephone in room - Your shortcut numbers are all messed up. I tried to dial housekeeping, then I get reception. I tried to dial in-room dining, then I get concierge. Then when someone responds, I sometimes get an irate person irritated why I was calling that number when I only dialed the shortcut from your phone.
4. Housekeeping: When I asked for a blanket, I didn't get it. Sometimes my coffee or fruit tray wasn't relinquished. Sometimes someone comes in to clean my bed but doesn't clean the washroom. There is no laundry bag. They are all friendly though.
5. Breakfast - This is almost a 5-star rating but food variety can be better. Also, your bacon is always over cooked, and it takes a long time just to get a cup of coffee. There is always an overflow in the morning. But the lady that greets you there doesn't even offer the other breakfast room. She should offer the room so as to get everyone seated because we all have other places we need to go to.
6. Room - The washroom is great but your conditioner must be all expired. They don't actually condition anymore. From my stay on the last week of July 2022, for a Premium classic room, I didn't get a table where I can eat. I only got a desk. When I stayed last May, I initially got a room with a table to eat. Then I was moved to a room that doesn't even have a full length mirror or a table to eat --and to think, I was moved in the middle of the night, the courteous way to appease me was to at least give me a better room but no. I felt cheated in both times on a room that we've already paid for and got a lower-rate room. Again, I wasn't even comped at all.
7. Reception - Not everyone is friendly. I understand that people can be busy but there was a lady that snapped at me for approaching her. There was no one in the counter and I didn't know she was helping another person who was sitting in the lobby but how would I know. When I arrived at around half past 12 on Sunday, I had to wait for my room. Someone came to me and asked me if I wanted a drink while waiting for the room and I asked for coffee. After I got the coffee, I got charged for the coffee. Seriously.
8. Concierge - There is a guy there but I forgot his name and he was super amazing (worked at night during my stay on May but on July he helped me during breakfast. He was a bald haired guy with a great personality). However some of them could smile a little bit you know... I felt at times they would look away instead of opening the door for me, especially when I was carrying a back pack. But when someone that looks so much more prestigious comes in to the door, they rush to open it, only to find out that person just needs to use the washroom. 
9. In-room dining - Expensive food that doesn't taste good, with the exception of the bread pudding. Presentation is even lousy. It's like you ordered an expensive food and they just dumped it on the plate and covered it with metal to make it look good. This goes for the two restaurants in the hotel.
10. Overall staff - Most are friendly. Some are not, doesn't even smile, some look racist like it's dragging their feet to try and open the door for you. Dining service really friendly. Most of my staff comment is above.",3,2022,08,07

121,"Great Location, Run-Down, Items Stolen from Room","I stayed at St. James Court for work prior to Covid and had a good experience. It's in a great location - literally a block from Buckingham Palace, and the breakfast (included in my rate) was really good. So when I decided to head back with my family in June 2022, I booked 2 rooms at the St. James again. The experience was disappointing - I'm not sure if I didn't pay attention as much the first time, or if it was simply my wife joining me, but it was very run-down. The carpet is old and stained, the base boards are chipped and in desperate need of painting. Coming from the Intercontinental in Paris, which was redone in the last 18 months, was jarring. The breakfast was good -- and the new restaurant space is very nice, but it was super crowded and at least a 30 minute wait every morning. The concierge was terrible - he didn't call me back multiple times on dinner reservations. And finally, we had a bag of items we bought in Paris stolen from our room. The bellman kindly remembered taking it to our room and it just disappeared. The front desk staff was nice about it, but after returning home, our experience with corporate was terrible - no help at all. They just said their ""investigation"" revealed nothing, we could report it to the police and we could have a free night next time we came to London (as if I would stay there again). I do not recommend.",2,2022,08,02

121,Impeccable face to face service but behind the scenes service needs attention.,"First experience at check-in met our expectations, however, on entering the room there were a number of housekeeping issues. Chewing gum was found in two places on the carpet, some of the bins had no liners, the sanitary bag dispenser was empty and the Nespresso machine was not there.
We raised the issue with housekeeping and their response was impeccable. We cannot fault any of the staff for trying to make our stay as memorable as possible and on this basis we enjoyed our stay and would consider staying here again in the future.",4,2022,07,31
121,Avoid this hotel,"First time on TripAdvisor, I am compelled to write a review on this hotel.  We had an appalling experience.  We emailed the hotel asking for a room in the renovated area of the hotel.  When we arrived, we were checked into one of the older rooms.  We took one look at the room and the Holiday Inn in the US appeared superior to that room.  (The rate is over $500 per night)  We talked to the front desk and emphasized that we be placed in the new wing.   The room was tiny but we decided to lump it for two nights.  The new wing reminded me of the lower end of Hilton hotels in the US.  The hotel is incredibly dated and does not bear the quality of even a 4 Star.  Old carpeting, dated décor, non functioning elevators, broken television set.  One positive of the room was a comfortable bed.  However the sink in the bathroom filled up and did not drain quickly.  Housekeeping sent “an engineer” who did not know what to do!  The elevator in the new wing worked occasionally and we found ourselves stuck on the same floor after several tries.  Breakfast was decent but the ambience in the dining room reminded me of a busy diner in India.  The worst of all was housekeeping showed up four times a day and did not clean meticulously.  Towels were not replaced, I’m not sure they even brought cleaning supplies.  One time they showed up when I was in the shower, they let themselves in and knocked on the bathroom door and talked to me to ask if I needed anything.  It was creepy, unprofessional and unsettling.  The staff looks like they have been recently imported from India, with little to no training on communication or etiquette.  Fantastic location in London and probably why they get away with incredibly low service levels.  I would give them negative stars if they existed!  Stay away from this hotel if you have a choice!  The legendary Taj service levels experienced in domestic properties do not exist in this one.",1,2022,07,29

121,Home Away from Home,"Being a Taj Innercircle Gold Member, I always prefer staying at a Taj property wherever I travel & if there is one. Hence, staying at this hotel was a long pending wish. But honestly I was a bit disappointed as the hotel definitely needs refurbishment specially the bathrooms. Otherwise my stay was great because nobody can beet the ""Tajness"" & for sure the food variety + quality. The courtyard was amazing to chill & enjoy the nice weather.",4,2022,07,19
121,Brilliant service and location for a great stay in London,"We had a brilliant 2 night stay in London in one of the classic rooms and will definitely be returning when we next visit London. The location was ideal, 5-10 min walk from Victoria station/underground and 5 min walk to Buckingham Palace. Other places were within approx 20 min walk including Downing street, Covent Garden, Mayfair, West End theatres and Trafalgar Square.

From arriving we were greeted at the door, every member of staff said hello in the foyer and we were asked if we would like help with our bags. We arrived at 11.45am and didn't expect to be able to access our room until 2/3pm however we were able to check in as soon as we arrived. 

Our room 339, was large and clean with plenty of room to relax. We were provided with robes and slippers alongside usual amenities. It was a quiet part of the hotel and despite the heat is was cool in the room. 

We had no issues as a walk-in during the evenings (Saturday & Sunday), both in the bar area for cocktails and having dinner in the stunning courtyard. Special thanks to the waitress and barman who each evening made an effort to come over and make conversation with us, offering classic cocktails which weren't on the cocktail menu. We had read that sometimes the courtyard is busy so may be worth doing a quick reservation online. They have a choice of restaurants to choose from as part of the hotel complex but for us, TH@51 and the courtyard were ideal and price wise it wasn't too horrendous for well presented and tasty food.",5,2022,07,13

121,Terrible experience,"We spent a lot of time searching for the perfect hotel to spend a few days getaway in London. After reading the reviews for this hotel we were very excited about our trip. Over all we ended our trip very disappointed and feeling upset by our experience. 

Room was much smaller than advertised when booking, our view was a wall with no daylight in room,  very dated with a lot of repairs needed. House keeping woke us up on two occasions and we were not provided with a sleeping sign to stop this from happening. Very overpriced nightly rate for the size and quality of room. 

Breakfast, ridiculous queues every morning, queuing for at least 30minutes before we were seated. Not given a menu like other guests, so we just ate from the buffet, coffee arriving after we finished our breakfast. I have never had to queue in a hotel for breakfast. This hotel could not accommodate the amount of guests staying. 

Courtyard is absolutely stunning and was the main reason we booked this hotel, we didn’t get to eat in the courtyard once over our three day stay because of private functions and large reservations. 

One of the lifts were broken which was a nightmare to get up and down to our room. 

Food was just satisfactory but way overpriced even for London. Drinks again ridiculously priced £15 for half a glass of Prosecco!! 

From the exterior and lobby this hotel is very beautiful and well kept but the rooms are unsatisfactory for the price of them with cheap Nescafé coffee and poor in room facilities. 

Staff, so many staff in this hotel but we were never approached with menus, we always had to ask for service, we often felt like we were bothersome even asking to order a drink. We were on our holidays and dressed very casual and felt because we weren’t in suits we were not priority like other guests dressed in more business attire when in fact we run very successful businesses ourselves. We left feeling very upset, neglected and judged by our appearance.",1,2022,07,11

121,Läget gör hotellet,"Hotel with very good location for shopping and tourist attractions etc. The staff is very nice and friendly.  The rooms were ok but with worn and old interior and a bit dirty (dust in several places).  After the room was cleaned, there was a strong odor of sweat in the room, which must come from the cleaning staff.  The bed was comfortable.  The breakfast had a very small selection.  It is also not good that you have to pay if you want to eat more than one dish of the hot breakfast dishes (boiled eggs, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, omelets, pancakes etc), this has actually never happened in any other hotel.  This is surprising, given that the price per night is relatively expensive (compare with other hotels).  Incidentally, a nice bar with a good selection.  What makes the hotel attractive is the location in London.  Also a plus for the very nice staff!  However, the wear and tear on the hotel and the interior as well as the poor breakfast selection means that the rating stays at three out of five (approved).",3,2022,07,05

121,Pathetic Experience !!,"Dear Sir,

We stayed at the Taj, London from 27th June, 2022 to 2nd July, 2022. Our room number was 734. To start with our experience, the room allotted to us was very small in size unlike the description on website. The service in the hotel was the most disappointing. There were many occasions where our room was not made up for the entire day and we had to call up the housekeeping at 11 in the night when we returned to our hotel asking to clean up the room and their response used to be sorry sir the housekeeping staff has left for the day. We then had to take up the issue with the front desk. This was complete harassment for us to face at 11pm in the night. The bottles of water were barely replenished in our rooms and we had to constantly ask for the same which took more than 45 mins each time. On many occasions towels were also not replaced. When we informed the reception about this all they had to say was sorry. 

One night we had ordered for a vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce i as a room service and they sent us vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate milk. Also the vanilla ice cream was stale, it literally had frozen pieces of ice in it. A fresh ice cream is always very smooth and creamy and this was nothing like it. 

Also during the check out there was a long wait where we had to wait for almost 20 minutes. The hotel was looking understaffed and over booked.

We are regulars at Taj in Kolkata and have visited various Taj properties in India. The service here is impeccable and amazing. We were wishing the same out of Taj in London but unfortunately it was no where even close to it. We have paid close to 350-400GBP for our stay per night and the value for money I would say was close to maybe GBP50 a night. The staff was often dressed untidy, the bottles of water in the room were being  served from some random shopping bags, biscuits were being kept from a ""Selfridges"" bag. This is nothing like a Taj property would do. Your property is tarnishing the name of Taj Hotels. 

After this visit I would not recommend Taj, London to anyone. In short it was a pathetic experience. 

Regards,

Rahul",1,2022,07,04
121,Prefect location but expected more for the money.,"Keep in mind we are not hard to please and went with the flow.  When i read some reviews before booking i tried to keep in mind some people are just never pleased. We are not that way.  Not a bad experience just not 5 star. London is FANTASTIC!  

Courtyard was very beautiful,  but Loud at night.  With no AC and windows open , don't expect to sleep soundly.. Large room but very worn. Ac didn't work. Bathroom water was extremely sensitive.  Had to take cold shower otherwise would be scalding hot.  People were nice. Would be nice to have more attentive service at breakfast.  1 cup of coffee is sometimes not enough 😀. Perfect location near the palace but the street was shut down which made getting cabs or cars a nightmare.  Ordered a car through consignor but better make sure have cash was a nightmare since we were trying to catch a train to Paris for the day. In the end we figured it out.  They don't accept cards nor bill to room. I had 3 suites for 2 families, Bill was over 10k for the week which is way overpriced in my opinion but we were in London during peak season. If 5 start location is priority , this place is perfect.  If 5 start comfort and service is important,  I wouldn't recommend it.",3,2022,07,03

121,"Very nice hotel, great experience",The hotel is well located close to St. James’ park station and Victoria station. The area is very quiet during the weekend snd almost no restaurants open around. The hotel itself is nice but outdated. The rooms are very small. The staff is nice and willing to help. Very clean hotel. Very expensive restaurant. Breakfast is very good and it has many Indian dishes.,4,2022,06,29
121,Very good hotel with an excellent location,"I had two stays on the same UK trip: first two nights and when coming back to London another three nights. I very much enjoyed the hotel, which is very classic on the exterior, but modernized in the interior. On my second stay I was upgraded to a superior room in a renovated wing. Both rooms were quite fine, not large, but perfectly comfortable and cozy. Typical of English hotels in old buildings, one had to walk through rather complicated corridors to reach the room. There were beautiful items here and there throughout the hotel.

The lobby is also comfortable and elegant with a cozy bar. The staff throughout my visits were extraordinarily pleasant and helpful.

One of the best aspects of this hotel, though, is its location in the City of Westminster. It's very close to the Buckingham Palace (in case you have some business with the Queen -- I didn't) and the beautiful St. James's Park. There is no shortage of good traditional pubs in the area. At least two tube stations are within a short walk and can even take you directly to Heathrow. Victoria Station is also just a 10-minute walk away (from there you can take a train to Gatwick).

I'd say I'll stay there again next time in London.",5,2022,06,26
121,Felt unsafe and mistreated,"1. Yelled at twice for asking for help when nearly fainting in the room on 22nd of June
i. On entering my room on the 22nd evening the A/C had broken down and since it was a very hot day in London, the room was like a furnace, I called to asked for it to be fixed and explained that I was feeling faint and to send the engineering team and housekeeping as fast as possible. I was yelled at and told that ‘ it was not housekeeping’s job to help with this and that a message would be left for the engineering team'. I remain utterly shocked that I was not offered any assistance.
ii. The engineer came to fix the A/C and explained that the filter was completely clogged. He cleaned the filter and, for no fault on his part, the dirt fell across the entire bathroom and all over the toilet seat.
Iii. I now requested for housekeeping to come up, but it took over 1.5 hours which meant I couldn’t use the bathroom at a time when I was feeling unwell and it was necessary for me to be able to do so. 
Iv. I called down many times saying I really needed the bathroom cleaned, and then requested the person to come up and help sort out the issue. I was yelled at for this request, told I was being extremely rude for asking her to come and help as she couldn’t leave her station, This to me was absolutely shocking. How can a staff member not offer to help a guest who is unwell and instead yell at them for asking for assistance? If she couldn’t help, surely she could have asked someone else to do so.
v. After repeated calls to the front desk to request for the duty manager she came up 1.5 hours from my first request, and did try to be helpful. However, by then I was feeling so unwell I basically had to cancel my evening plans, rest the entire night and consult my doctor.

2.Male staff walking into my room while I was changing on two separate occasions on the 19th of June and 22nd of June:

3. Wifi not working on 19th, 20 and 21st of June
i. I am not sure why I was given a room with a clogged A/C and no WIFI but for the first 3 days of my four day stay the wifi didn’t work. I made repeated calls, and only after my 5th call was the request attended to. 

4. Elevators not working/rattling:
i. On top of all of this, of the two elevators in the hotel for 300 gates, 1 didn’t work at all and the other rattled and slammed shut. Every single guest I met commented on how scary it was to be in the elevator

5. Overcharged on checkout, mistakenly.
i. My checkout experience was marred with confusion and thus it took a long time to check out when I needed to rush to get to the airport, given the rail strike was causing significant traffic jams, 
Ii. First the person charged the wrong card  and then he said he would reverse the amount and we then charged my other card. 
Ii. Then instead of refunding that amount and the 100 pound rebate I was offered, they mistakenly charged another 159 pounds to my card. So now an additional 219 pounds had been charged to my card instead. I had to show the message from my bank multiple times to explain that they had not refunded the amount but instead charged it to me. Then again had to explain the calculations to show that they hadn’t given me the100 pound rebate at all.
Iv. The person was genuinely apologetic. I think he had a good attitude and wanted to be helpful, but just did not have enough training perhaps. 

I am shocked that anyone working for the Taj brand would yell at a guest, repeatedly, when they are in distress. The services and facilities were extremely shoddy and that to me is also very surprising. 
I am surpirsed that this hotel carries the Taj name, as it certainly doesn’t represent the values that the Taj espouses.",1,2022,06,26
121,Friendly well located hotel,"I stayed for five nights.  Very friendly and approachable staff.  The room was clean and a good size.  The location is great for central London.  I was able to walk everywhere (15 mins to Big Ben, 5 mins to Buck House, 40 mins to Oxford street etc….).  Given the season the hotel was busy and for part of my stay only one of the core lifts was not working so perhaps some sign-post suggestions to other lift locations would have been a good idea.  A slight gripe and this can not be blamed at the hotel. This was other guests.  There seemed to be many entitled guests that assumed the right to push in front of lift entry or exit plus trying to make out to staff how important they are!  I travel a lot and this is the first time I have noticed this.",4,2022,06,26

121,Disappointing,"During the Platinum Jubilee weekend, I and two colleagues brought six students to stay in the hotel as we had been invited to the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Celebration at Buckingham Palace. As you can imagine, this trip took a great deal of planning, and we chose to stay at St. James’ Court Hotel because we believed that the great reputation for customer care would avoid any possible difficulties that might be encountered in a hotel with less prestige. However, we were disappointed to have been faced with a number of unexpected issues. 
Firstly, although we were able to check in earlier to 2 of the rooms, one room had to be changed as it was not big enough for the three students to share. By check in time (2pm), we had 3 out of 5 rooms, so we went out and returned at 4:30pm to be told that the 5th room would not be ready before we were expected at the palace at 6pm. The three girls who wanted to get ready were then given a room to use; they left their bags there. When we returned at 11pm, the room was ready, but their luggage had not been transferred to it.  
The following day we arrived at breakfast at 10:10am and waited for about 20 minutes to be seated. We realise that the hotel was extremely busy and understand the delay, but were disappointed that many of the buffet items were being cleared as we were taking breakfast. My colleague asked for a coffee and we also ordered herbal tea. The teapots arrived, but we then had to ask for cups as there were none on the table. With no sign of the coffee, we reordered it and when it arrived, we found that the milk on the table had curdled. We had to ask for another coffee and some fresh milk. 
Having been promised a later check out of 1pm, due to the check in problems that we had had, we returned to our rooms on the 8th floor after breakfast to find that our keys did not work. We went down to reception and had the keys re-programmed and went back to the 8th floor.  My key was still not working, so I had to return to reception yet again. I was given another key and went to the room to change so that I could use the spa facilities. When we returned from the spa, the keys for two rooms were not working again, so we knocked on a colleague’s door and called reception to ask for someone to come and open the doors as we were locked out of our rooms, in robes. We received a call back to our colleague’s room to say that there was no one available to help us. Refusing to go to reception dressed in a bath robe, we called again, and after a total of about 15 minutes of waiting in the hallway, a gentleman arrived and unlocked the doors for us. 
There is much that I could praise about the hotel, most of the staff were friendly and the décor and ambiance were lovely.  Our students, never having had a trip to London or stayed in such luxury, were delighted with their stay. However, as staff who have stayed in a number of prestigious hotels around the world, we were shocked and disappointed that our first stay at this hotel left so much to be desired and proved not to be the stress-free break that we had been hoping for.",2,2022,06,25

121,Just average,"There are two lifts (elevators), and on our second day one was shut down.  It was still not working by the end of our trip, and having only one elevator made things very frustrating.  It took forever to get up and down and the lift was always full to the point where we often had to wait for the next one.  Worse yet, there were no stairs to use.  

In our room, there was no remote for tv second TV and after out first day of sightseeing we came back to find the second remote was apparently taken by housekeeping.  We called and the maintenance worker who came was very nice.  He said that the second TV was for some reason unplugged as well.  There was also a large hole in our bathroom wall (2 feet by 2 feet), that they obviously attempted to fix. You could see where it was cut out, though, and it still moved and felt like it would fall out if not careful.  The shower also leaked all over the bathroom floor.

When we checked in…after the correct check-in time…we were told the room was ready, but they just needed to remove a cot because the last guest had a third person in the room.  I was told it would take five minutes.  20 minutes later I approached the front desk again to see why things were taking so long.  I was given my room keys and when we got into the room we found the cot was still there!

There are no good restaurants around that are within a reasonable walking distance.  The hotel has a great breakfast though, but we got it as a package with the room so I don’t know about the price.

The positives are that the property is in a great location for sightseeing Westminster, Buckingham, and the mews.  And if you like quiet this is the place for you because the place is dead after 8:00 pm.",3,2022,06,22
121,Home away from home,"Wonderful staff, great rooms and really felt like home away from home.
Mayur was great to accommodate me with a bigger room since my booking didn’t really mention the age of my child who is 12.
Lift was not working one day and in the evening an apology note was sent in my room which was least expected.
Even while checkout was waived 250 pounds for not getting a roller bed.",5,2022,06,20
121,Great Location,This hotel is 5 minute walking distance to some of the major touristic attractions in London. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Staff is friendly. Their buffet breakfast is good but needs a little more variety for the price. I will definitely recommend it.,5,2022,06,20
121,Service,"Your fire alarm went of 6 times between 3 and 4 AM on the night of my arrival.  When asked about the problem at both 4AM AND at 6:30AM, staff were highly defensive of the hotel's role in the fire alarm and blamed it on a third party.",2,2022,06,20
121,Stayed several times - wont be back,"Pros
- location
- size of room
- housekeeping (prompt & friendly)

Cons
- train noise was prolific - (stayed on level 1 ). Underground must run right underneath
- Tired hotel & smelt.  Fish smell for whatever reason. Carpets run down, needs to be painted
- Lifts - multiple breakdowns. There is only 2....so if 1 is down it s a long wait (we chose the stairs)
- Communication - front of house could have been better
- Faulty smoke alarm - went off at least 7x between 3am to 4am.  No acknowledgement/apology by hotel management",1,2022,06,18
121,Such a comfortable welcoming hotel in a perfect location,"We have just returned from two nights at this lovely hotel. Staff were great from start to finish, courteous efficient and very helpful. 
Our room was very comfortable clean and spacious.
The restaurant was amazing and the food a delicious  mix of Indian and European. Breakfast was epic! we tried traditional Indian food which was explained and politely encouraged. I'm glad too, as I probably wouldn't have had such a feast.
The location is perfect about ten mins from Victoria station and five from St James.
All in all Id definitely recommend it.",5,2022,06,17
121,Not 5* star. Such a shame.,"Staff are accommodating and polite. Hotel is clean, and the decor, specifically on the ground floor, makes this hotel a generally nice place to be.
The room however, was in very poor condition. The bathroom door didn’t close (as if it didn’t fit) and the bathroom door handle was almost completely fallen off. The windows were very old wood and and couldn’t be opened. They were also badly in need of a repaint. 
The room itself just felt generally worn out.
It is such a shame as the hotel theme and staff are nice, but it clearly lacks investment and/or proper maintenance. 
I wouldn’t associate this as a 5* star hotel at all, particularly in London! 
Sadly I won’t be staying again. I really hope the rooms improve.",2,2022,06,17
121,Scammers,Went for dinner…. Ordered scurry and asked spicy was told it’s fine. Got the bill and it was 3x the price of the menu item. Was told it was now a special order because I wanted a few chillis. Waiter became rude. On this basis I do not recommend as clearly they just inflate your bill.,1,2022,06,16
121,London love,"Celebrating our 32nd anniversary! From our touch down in Heathrow, catching train to Paddinton station, cab to St James court Taj, we were greeted by Tushar. He was very helpful making our 5 day accommodations fit our needs starting with a hearty buffet breakfast each day. Each day was filled days 1) Tate Britain with Thames boat shuttle to Tate Modern and Borough Market. Finishing with dinner At Michelin Quilon restaurant 2) national gallery and lunch at cafe, Kensington Palace tea, walk in the gardens then dinner at St James area pub 3) British museum with special Stonehenge exhibit and lunch in cafe, shopping at Fortnum and Mason, Royal Albert Hall - the Car Man 4) early morning train from Kings Cross to Cambridge, Fitzbillies, touring kings and trinity colleges, eagle pub lunch, punting on the Cams, even song at Kings chapel, back on the train to Kings Cross, dinner at fabulous Quilon 5) Bath to see Roman baths, Lacock, medieval village sand pub lunch, sunset at Stonehenge inner circle and back to London 6) goodbye and will be back for more!",5,2022,06,15

Extremely professional and hospitable staff.  The food is amazing. The hotel has a beautiful spa and we had an amazing experience at the hotel. A big thank you to all the staff at the hotel. Overall an amazing experience,5,2022,06,15
121,Beautiful Hotel,Fancy hotel with nice modern rooms and wonderful service. It has a beautiful courtyard that serves drinks and food. The lobby is very nice with lots of seating and a piano. The concierge was very helpful and were the bellhops.,5,2022,06,14
121,Avoid this hotel.,"Definitely not a 5* hotel, not even close. Except for the lobby, the hotel needs a face lift. Rooms and bathrooms are good size, but old chipped furniture, mold in a bath, shower curtain, sink and even on a window frame (5* hotel?). Old and dusty carpet in a hallways. Breakfast, you have to wait for 15/20 minutes to be seated (5* hotel?), and the selection of food is not even close to real 5*. Location is excellent, but you can find much better 5* hotels in the center of London.",1,2022,06,13
121,Great stay in London,"We loved St. James' Court.  Courteous, attentive staff; great room, great lobby, great location.  All first rate.  You are five minute walk to the tube stop. The hotel was understated luxury, perfectly balanced.",5,2022,06,12
121,Lovely stay at St. James Court,"We just ended a fabulous European tour in London and spent our last 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. The experience and hospitality were all we had hoped for and more: From our deluxe accommodations, to the strategic location in the heart of London, to the delicious food at their various restaurant venues. The very best part of all, though, was the marvelous, well-trained and personable hotel staff.  They all made us feel so welcome! We would like to specifically commend Tushar at the front desk for all his assistance. He is a real professional and represents The Taj brand very well.  Should we come this way again, we will definitely book our stay at The St. James Court!

Bob and Robyn Turrill",5,2022,06,12
121,Old world charm is no longer attractive,The hotel feels jaded . Although Major renovation is going on but some of the renovated rooms don’t feel modern or justified to the price . Food is improved and the bar is also interesting . Overall nice location but check for value .also breakfast is very good,3,2022,06,12
121,"Excellent hotel, great service","We loved our stay. The rooms were well furnished, luxurious, and well-sized for London. Some of the staff was extremely helpful & courteous - the folks at the front desk, reservations, the concierge (thanks for the recommendations & bookings) and the manager on duty. Their service was what we expect from Taj - top notch. 

The location is excellent. A quiet street, a 3-4 minute walk from one Tube stop (St. James' park) and less than a 10 minutes walk from another, major, station (Victoria). There's also a bus stop a few minutes way. And, in 2 mins, you can walk up to Buckingham Palace. 

The service from housekeeping and (some of the) restaurant staff was a bit below expectations, but it looks like all of the UK is facing issues with retaining and training staff. The Taj being what they are, I'm sure they'll fix the problem as soon as possible. 

We were very happy and would love coming back.",5,2022,06,11
121,Beautiful Hotel in Central London,We stayed here for one night during the end of our holiday to catch our flight out of London.  We were very impressed with the customer service.  The rooms were much nicer and larger than what the website showed.  We are a family of four with two small kids and the suite with the sofa bed was perfect for us.  The courtyard in the middle was nice to sit and have a glass of wine.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and we had such a nice server that provided a delicious recommendation of an Indian dish to try.  We would stay here again!,5,2022,06,09
121,Very comfortable,"We opted for the premium executive king room.  Although not a very large room it was well furnished, clean and an extremely confortable bed.

We were joining up with family and they had a family room.  This was perfect for them although the decor dated.  The cleanliness of this room needs some attention in particular around the door in the bathroom.  

We had a very nice meal in the Court Yard, again 5*.  Service and politeness of staff very good.

The situation of the hotel to Buckingham Palace and other historic sites is amazing.  

Therefore I have no hesitation in highly recommend this hotel.

Thank you to all the staff.  Doormen, Restaurant, Reception and house keeping.",5,2022,06,09
121,Fsbulous stay in oppulent surroundings with great helpful staff,".From the minute we arrived the staff made us feel welcome and really tried to assist us without us even asking, we arrived early and were given a room straight away.   Nothing was too much trouble and we had a wonderful stay.    Breakfast was good with an array of produce.",5,2022,06,08
121,"If you can afford it, GO!","Super helpful. As a working class Northerner,I felt treated with respect.
Everyone went above and beyond to assist me.
Mega close to Buck Pal, (3 min walk) where I had a ticket for the Jubilee Party In The Palace.
On checkout I worried I'd miss my train due to the Pageant, however Ms Sunaina Soares Front Office Manager liaised with her staff and reassured me.
The concierge guy then walked my suitcases 2 streets to whistle for a taxi, as the roads were close due to the Jubilee Pageant Parade.
Naveea (sp?) assisted me with every aspect of Breakfast, ensuring it became a memorable part of The Jubilee Weekend of all Jubilees. Ever.
The bed was amazing. Best sleep I had in years.
I was only going to stay 1 night, I stayed 3!
I intend to go again, just because its an experience in its own right.
Oh, and lots of Spa and Wellness shindigs
I have photos of the extra helpful people. Unfortunately not of Ms Soares.",5,2022,06,07
121,An Excellent Stay at St. James’ Court,"Wonderful hotel; everyone was friendly, helpful, and efficient. Tushar at Reception was particularly helpful.  Excellent location and great room. For such an elegant hotel, the atmosphere was warm and friendly. I will definitely be back. A+++",5,2022,06,05
121,Comfortable long stay for 11 nights.,"I am a Platinum Innercircle Member and booked two Classic Master Suites for my family. Overall stay was nice. All hosts & individuals at the SJC was warm and friendly. 

Both Suites require some sprucing up. Wooden floors require urgent polishing. Some electrical fittings and sockets not working. Both the Suites need thorough cleaning up of upholstery and curtains. Mere vacuuming wont do.

Suite and /or Gold Platinum Guests are not offered any complimentary high tea or complimentary happy hours or any Lounge Access. This is again something not available at SJC. All other Taj Hotels offer these to the premium guests.

Since we are Taj Loyalists, we stay at a Taj property, if it is available at our destination. We are shortly going to stay again at the SJC in mid-August.",4,2022,06,05
121,Perfect,"We had a brilliant experience at Taj St. James'.  Throughout our stay, the service was excellent.  Breakfast was a delightful experience.  The room we got was luxurious.  If anyone doesn't mind staying around Westminster / Buckingham, then this should be the number 1 choice!",5,2022,06,05
121,"Comfortable stay, easy check out","Overall the stay was very comfortable, staff is very helpful and courteous. However, checkin time was 2:00pm, but the room was not ready until 3:00pm.
In room refreshments were not added daily, and the water bottles (2 X 330ml) are too less for 3 individuals, staying on a daily basis.",4,2022,06,02
121,Horrible service and dilapidated hotel,"This hotel would be at best a 3 star.  I was staying at the hotel for business.  Unfortunately got sick and had to quarantine there.  No joke, I could have died in my room and they wouldn't have known.  They knew I was sick because they weren't allowed in my room. Not once did they check on me or ask what I needed.  I had to ask for fresh towels 5 days into my stay, and then sheets the next day.  On the 6th day I asked if I could get things to clean the bathroom with myself. When I complained to management, the response was ""COVID restrictions are over""... Then they agreed to call me at 10 every morning, but somehow couldn't even deliver the simple things I asked for - a light bulb that had burned out and a couple more towels. Dead flowers were left on the table in the hallway for days. Enough said. There are many options in London.  This should not be on your list.",1,2022,06,01
121,A home away from home,"The best part about Taj is personalized service we get whenever I stay at the property. The St James Park is a must for us whenever we are in London. The food, the décor, the service are immaculate. The rooms do need some updates as they are showing signs of aging but it makes up by the attentiveness of the staff. notable mentions- Silvan at the Lobby Bar who ensured everyday we get what we need and was very friendly and courteous.",5,2022,06,01
121,Not the best experience in our room,"We were thrilled with the location of the hotel, and the hotel's public areas were very nice.  All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The restaurant and bar area were great.  Unfortunately, we were placed in a Classic double room in the older section of the hotel.  The room was extremely small and very dated.  It was obvious that they had tried to upgrade the room but fell completely short.  The furniture was old, cheap and dinged up everywhere.  The windows were rotting, and the handles were falling off.  The bathroom tiles were raising up and the back of the door was all scratched up.  In the room itself we had to coordinate our movements since two people could not pass each other.  If we opened the drawer to the dresser we could not even pass because the drawer reached the bed. They had placed a large TV on the dresser but didn't even bother to raise the pictures on the wall behind it so you could only see half the pictures.  We realize it is difficult to retrofit very old buildings, but we did see what was available in the newer part of the hotel and the difference was significant. When we book a five star hotel we feel that every room should meet a minimum level of quality.  Our stay felt like we were in a 3 star hotel at best.",3,2022,05,30
121,Birthday weekend at thet Taj!,"We stayed here for 1 night for my birthday and we got one of the newly renovated rooms! OMG -  what a lovely room. They were told that it was my birthday so there were balloons, a card and a cake waiting for me in the room upon check-in. The service from absolutely every member of staff was outstanding. The concierge chap (Canadian guys) was the standout for us - he was so engaging and helpful that I could not be thankful enough for him being there.
The breakfast was busy but was of a good quality. The only let down, for being an Indian owned hotel, is that their Masala Tea (chai) was not authentic and could be better.
We also visited the spa and had treatments which were great. The rest area with sauna and pool was also fantastic. It was VERY relaxing which we both enjoyed as a couple.
10/10 for our stay and will definitely be back again soon, Loved it!",5,2022,05,30
121,"Excellent, Luxurious, Homely","St. James Court, Taj Hotel is a blend of luxury and comfort. Situated in the heart of London, this marvellous piece of property offers exquisite food and service. The hotel is within a five-minute walking distance from Buckingham Palace, and other major tourist points are either at a decent walking distance or a few stations away by bus.    The hotel also has a cosy courtyard which is soothing for evening tea or drinks. Indian celebrities and politicians can be seen roaming around the courtyard. The hotel also has a jacuzzi, steam bath and sauna services (included in the price of the room). However, due to paucity of time, I could not avail of those services.  

As for the service, I would like to highlight a specific instance, Chef Mohit Tak made special efforts in preparing my meal per my requirement. Not only did he comply with my dietary needs, but he also followed up after that to see whether I liked the food or not. The food was delicious beyond comprehension. This remarkable personal gesture was welcoming and heart-touching. It also shows how well Taj takes care of its guests. The guest is made to feel at home, and he never feels like an outsider. Apart from this, I was also touched by the fact that a hand-written note was sent to me at my arrival, welcoming me to the hotel. I will certainly recommend this property to everyone and ensure that I stay here whenever I am in London.
Good luck, and keep the great work going.
Best,
Mohit",5,2022,05,26

121,Wonderful Stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Taj.  We were made Guests of the Day and received complimentary drinks, dessert and a late check out time of 2pm. The staff were friendly, welcoming and made sure our stay was special. Our room was very comfortable and we had everything we needed. We ate at the TH@51 and our food was delicious. We also had breakfast in this restaurant. The range of breakfast food was varied and the buffet side of it was well stocked. The location is great, just a 5 minute walk from Buckingham Palace, Westminster and the royal parks.",5,2022,05,25
121,Disappointing,"We booked this stay for our honeymoon as an extra special treat. 
Unfortunately this was ruined on the last night of our stay. We arrived back from dinner, spent some time in the hotel bar but on arrival back to our room at midnight our key card wouldn’t work. We went to the lobby and spoke to the manager who said he would fix this and added ‘whilst you’re here you can pay your bill’. We asked politely if we could settle this in the morning at checkout as we were using cash from our wedding gifts which was back in our room. This was ignored and we were told that someone would come up to our room to collect the payment. A member of staff then came to our room, gone midnight to collect a payment without any receipt which we was not happy with. It then meant my husband had to walk back down to the lobby to pay the bill. Lots of excuses to say the payment was needed as there was no credit card details on our room but in the next breath was able to confirm my credit card number (I also had to put a card down to secure my booking in the first place and this was confirmed on check in so was a load of rubbish) 
Me and my husband left feeling very judged and untrusted by the hotel staff. Really ruined our last night and left us very upset by the whole experience. Left a review on our booking over 2 weeks ago now which has been ignored. No apologies or contact made by the hotel. 
Would not recommend.",1,2022,05,23
121,The Perfect Hotel,"We initially stayed at St James' Court in May 2021, we had such an amazing experience throughout our stay. The hotel itself is stunning, a great location with very spacious and comfortable rooms. All the staff are incredible friendly and helpful, always delivering the best service, making our stay that extra bit special. We have now made St James' Court our go to hotel in London and recently stayed again May 2022. Our second stay was just as amazing and memorable at the first. We visited Qulion for dinner and have to say it was one of the best meals we have ever had. We cannot recommend highly enough and look forward to our return in June 2022.",5,2022,05,22
121,Fabulous location 5 min walk from the Palace,"I have stayed at St James Court several times. We used to deal with a lovely desk manager named Ciara who has since left which is a shame, but I can happily say that all the other members of staff were helpful and courteous. The rooms are nice enough- the refurbished ones even better. The location is excellent for Buckingham Palace and St James Park. It is a lovely area and you are always guaranteed something interesting and exciting happening somewhere. All in all I'm giving it a good review and we have booked in again for the Jubilee. Not the cheapest place to stay by a long way - but you really are paying for the service, the location and the standard.
During covid we were fortunate enough to get a good deal at the The Taj suites which was absolutely outstanding. That's a whole other level.",5,2022,05,20
121,Amazing hotel and fantastic experience all round!!,"From start to finish this place was superb. The stay was a surprise for my 40th birthday, and all the staff were so accommodating, providing a complimentary room upgrade and placing a wonderful cake section plate along with a handwritten birthday card. The front of desk were fantastic and also took a complimentary couples photo of us...obviously when we got a bit more glammed up!

Now the breakfast.....AMAZING!! The selection was fabulous, from fully cooked, fresh fruit, cold meats, breads, and a full Indian breakfast selection to boot, in addition we were also offered complimentary mimosas, I could go on, but you get the point.

The room was wonderful, clean, modern, and very welcoming. The toiletries were of top quality as one would expect from the Taj. Room service daily to a high standard, if you wanted this, however ability to choose a sustainable option and skip days if you so wished.

The cocktail bar was also excellent, with a great selection on offer and perfectly crafted, with all staff being very attentive. We did not eat dinner at the hotel as we had various celebratory dinner reservations planned, however I am sure this would have also been excellent.

This hotel is a hidden gem in the city, and we intend to visit for some summer events and spend time in their beautiful outdoor garden space and of course stay on a few occasions ;) 

Overall if you are looking for a high end stay, with quality as standard, then this is your hotel. I have and will continue to recommend this place to anyone who wants a bit of luxury and pizzazz at affordable prices in the city.

Thank you again for making our stay and my 40th so wonderful :)",5,2022,05,20
121,Wanderful experience,"All perfect,  

All perfect, service is wanderful, location incredible, people and ambience really nice.

I just would pay more attention to breakfast experience.",5,2022,05,19
121,A disaster from start to finish ... too many hotels in London to justify staying here,"You might be considering the St James Court because of its central location and the fact that it is slightly less expensive, though no bargain, compared to other luxury London hotels. But do not make the same mistake we did. This is hands down the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in for the price (around 500 pounds a night). Other reviews highlight how tired the hotel looks inside, and this was more than true. The hallway walls and carpet are beat up, and the furniture is cheap and damaged in the rooms. However, the service makes the Taj’s “World’s Strongest Brand” motto simply laughable. Housekeeping didn’t come on multiple occasions, leaving us to have to shower with dirty towels we left on the floor as a courtesy to the staff (we were in a rush to the theater). Dirty cutlery was left in the room and twice in one night housekeeping barged in while we were getting ready. The third floor was essentially used as a storage unit for banquet furniture, with tables and folding chairs left on the walls. The elevators routinely did not work, and we had to exit the lobby through a service entrance via stairs at least four times. The restaurant service was so slow and inattentive that we ended up walking to the Corinthia to for breakfast to be treated with some respect. On top of all of this, there was not a single staff member or doorman at the lobby upon coming back at night, which is especially concerning given that you don’t need a room key to access the elevators to guest rooms. We were granted a late checkout, but that didn’t stop housekeeping from leaving welcome materials for the next guest in the room and a manager banging on the door to ask if we checked out before the time the front desk offered us. As a 4 star hotel, I expected less service than Claridges or the Mandarin, , but this was unacceptable and I’m shocked this property is vetted by the Taj Brand. I was extremely respectful in letting the management know of these things so they can make improvements for future guests, but  Beata's response was flippant and she offered to take off one night of a rollaway bed charge for 50 pounds (off of a 2000+ pound bill) which was also laughable. I will never stay in a Taj again. With so many excellent hotels in London, avoid this one at all costs.",1,2022,05,17
121,Our London trip with a stay at St James Court Taj Hotel.,"On the whole we had a good trip, the hotel was just above average, changed room as facilities in original room were poor, breakfast was good but drinks were expensive. Staff friendly & willing to help. Why do hotels not consider hair drying? Never a plug point near a mirror!!",3,2022,05,17
121,Attention to detail,On arrival we were booked into room 734 but were then told we had to switch to 745.The room had a few issues.The toilet handle was corroded and the decor needed refreshing and better cleaning.We felt it was a room that was in need of modernisation and more care whereas the public areas of the hotel were upmarket and stylish.,4,2022,05,16
121,Good position 10 minute walk to the Palace.,"We got a really good deal with this place as it is within a ten minute walk of Buckingham Palace and has a really nice outside garden for drinks e.t.c. The room we stopped was a classic room and we were hardly in it or we would have asked for a change . The window did close with two rickety fasteners and there was no double glazing which meant on the 7th floor every plane that passed seemed like it was nearer than it actually was .Other than this the stay was perfect and the hotel staff were great . If you get a deal - we paid £327 for 2 nights (room only) - if you book now the same deal will cost you nearly £700 ,just take care to have a look around before you unpack as you might want to change - I would book again as we were probably unlucky this time - lovely hotel though .",5,2022,05,16
121,Excellent Experience,"This was our first stay at St James’ Court and we were very impressed with the service and attention to detail from all of the staff.  However the Canadian concierge (sorry we didn’t catch his name) in particular was so helpful and knowledgeable about the area and provided excellent guidance and information. He really did make a positive difference to our stay and his helpful welcoming personality shone through and made him stand out from the rest.  We also have to acknowledge the doorman from Monaghan who again was very welcoming and helpful on our arrival. The hotel, room and amenities were all excellent but it was the staff who made this hotel stay for us so very enjoyable.",5,2022,05,14

I would 100% go back.",5,2022,05,12
121,Real service in a great hotel.,"When I visit London I usually despair at the poor customer service. This trip was the opposite. Our goal was to attend a Royal garden party and a night away. We had difficulty booking a hotel room available early so we could change. St. Jame's Court won through. We arrived at 1100 and were looked after from the moment we arrived. Coffee and 30 minutes wait and we were in an upgraded room. Very clean and well presented. The bed was comfortable  and bedding and towels of very good quality
 The whole place is smart and well kept. Breakfast was fantastic. Huge choice and great attention to detail. The only place that does scrambled eggs in a buffet without over cooking.
Customer service fantastic.",5,2022,05,12
121,Amazing property let down by Haphazard Service,"The property is lovely, the bedrooms are clean and well fitted out, the reception welcoming and the new restaurant stylish.
All let down by a haphazard service from Reception through to room service.
The staff appear to only be semi trained and while extremely polite, not particularly happy. I waited 25 minutes for a cup of coffee, I waited 10 mins to be seated at table one breakfast morning, despite there being empty table and then was never offered the al carte breakfast menu. Another morning, we could hear staff being loudly berated in the kitchen!
I had to ask for the room to be serviced (this is in the small print on the desk in the hotel room but would have been nice to told at check in) and then it took 2.5hrs for anyone to turn up.
I found myself needing a meeting room at very short notice. I asked if I could book one at the hotel. I waited 15mins  for some one to come and let me know if they had anything available, by which time the window of opportunity had closed as my office had found an alternative.
And be aware of the steps in to the vitality pool. My other half came into London one evening. We went to use the Spa and when stepping into the pool, he found the edge of the step is a slippery as ice, and fell into the pool. He had some amazing bruising!",3,2022,05,12
121,"Great location and nice building, but only a mediocre experince","Stayed at the St. James for a business conference also hosted at the hotel.  The room was expectedly small, being in London.  Several of the outlets did not work (yes, I know the UK has a switch to turn each outlet on, this was not the issue, rather half the outlets simply had no power).  Housekeeping was prompt on the first morning.  The second day they never showed up.  I asked at the front desk and was told they would be sent up immediately.  Hours later, still no cleaning staff, so I asked if at least fresh towels could be sent up and was told they would be sent up immediately.  Never got them.  The following day, same thing - no cleaning staff.  This time I asked if they still had suspended cleaning due to COVID, but they said no, they just hadn't gotten to my room yet, and would make sure they came up immediately.  Late that night, I returned to see that still, no-one had been to the room.  They said again they would send someone right away, and finally someone came to give me fresh towels (at this point it was too late to expect a cleaning, and I was happy with dry, clean towels).  
The service elsewhere in the hotel was good.  Restaurant and bar staff were good, and our conference rooms were well equipped and tended to.  
Overall: I've certainly had worse experiences, but I've also had far better.  The commonality with the worse experiences is that they were at hotels that charged a fraction of the price.  This is a motel experience with a luxury hotel price tag.  I stayed the following week in London at another hotel (different chain) and it cost about 1/2 the price and was a far better experience.  Will not be returning.",2,2022,05,11
121,Another great stay,"Another excellent stay, all the staff as always so pleasant and helpful they really make you feel welcome. Room spotlessly clean with lovely welcome of fresh fruit, water and chocolate strawberries. Excellent location, the only hotel we will stay in when we visit London. Thank you to them all.",5,2022,05,09
121,Great Hospitality,I always stay at the Taj in London and the senior staff take personal care to see that you are comfortable during the stay - you are made to feel special. The overall experience is always super satisfying.,4,2022,05,09
121,"Incredible staff, new favorite hotel in London","From the moment I arrived until departure, Tushar at the front desk made everything extremely easy for the group of us staying at St. James’ Court. He quickly fulfilled our (many) requests for all kinds of extras, and more than that his commitment to customer service and empathy for tired and needy travelers was completely evident. I normally don’t leave reviews for hotels, but I had to in this case because I have NEVER been treated this well at a hotel, and I never plan to stay at another hotel in London again. The food was amazing, facilities beautiful, and location unbeatable. If there were 6 stars I would give them!!!! Cannot recommend this hotel strongly enough.",5,2022,05,08
121,Thx,ver  nice hotel The location is more better on here to everything in London And the reception sree manager very good guy and the reception Soon I will come back and this beautiful hotel Nice The breakfast it’ Halal food on the spa very nice,5,2022,05,07
121,"Excellent service, excellent comfort, excellent food and brilliant location.","On very early arrival (after travelling overnight on the Sleeper train from Scotland) the super-efficient receptionist managed to find us a room we could actually move into then and there! After a panic with some paperwork, a lovely lady from the business center area was able to sort us out and print out an important page for us. The level of expertise of the staff was well above average and people actually looked as if they were enjoying their work, not just enduring it!
A great experience for us both and one which I would gladly repeat.",5,2022,05,07
121,Absolutely amazing,"A beautiful property which is located very near to Buckingham palace. Thanks to Tushar (front office) who helped me with a smooth check-in and gave a lot of information regarding the city. All cuisine food is amazing. The breakfast has a wide menu and a lovely taste. Room sizes are also nice with a nice wifi speed. 
Thanks to the entire team for making my stay a memorable one.",5,2022,05,06
121,Excellent stay at St James Court once again - fantastic hospitality as always!,"A great stay yet again at the fabulous St James Court Hotel. The hospitality of Taj is unmatched, the location of the Hotel is fantastic and the stay experience is always delightful. I would always choose St James Court for my future stays in London",5,2022,05,06
121,Taj is Taj,"James Court Taj is a perfect blend of classic and contemporary hotel. Taj’s common commitment to highest standards is reflected at this centrally located property in London.
We can take a stroll through Green Park. Underground station,Buckingham Palace and New Bond Street which are nearby.
Taj is a home away home for many Indians.Bright and welcoming staff make us feel really at home. 
Breakfast is elaborate in spacious area. Energetic Indian and English staff intimately pampered to served to our delight. Offering selection of Indian dishes promised our day to begin in great spirits.
We could order anything of our taste.Parantha to cold coffee, idly-vada, sambhar or fruits.
Quite filling to our taste and mood. 

Standard Rooms are average sized but executive rooms are impressive. Room Service is different from India if you ask for any item. Ice to plates are chargeable. But was made available to us on request.  

Concierge was cooperative. Tushar and Dinesh made us feel comfortable and guided well to make best use of London stay.",5,2022,05,06
121,"nice hotel, good reception, but...","The hotel is very pleasant and the welcome lives up to its category.
The management of the light fixtures in the room is quite strange and some bulbs seemed not to work properly.
We were surprised to find on leaving that the bottles of water made available in the room were chargeable (it is generally customary to offer one per person each day).",4,2022,05,05
121,"Only Satisfactory, I was expecting more","Very good location for tourism, beautiful building, good breakfast.
But, our romm has view of nothing else than pipes, tubes of an internal area. The cleaning was not efficient too. A lot of dust on the things into the room (mugs and furniture).",3,2022,05,05
121,The extra mile,"One of my favourite places to stay in London 
The service is impeccable, the breakfast was good  and the hospitality was worthy of the Taj brand
The staff is courteous polite and go the extra mile to cater to the guests need 
They always try and accommodate your requests as much as possible and make you feel at home.
I would strongly recommend this hotel for your next stay in London.",5,2022,05,05
121,Best and royal experince,Me and my wife has visted hotel for our first wedding night and really it will be going to memorable for us for whole life really we had a royal and wonderfull experince and the staff is also very good.,5,2022,05,04
121,Wonderful stay - lovely service.,What a treat - lovely hotel and staff. Really enjoyed my overnight stay at this luxurious hotel.  The room was lovely and the staff really attentive and extremely helpful.  I would recommend this hotel and would like to stay again.,5,2022,05,03
121,Visited with three friends,"Hotel is very beautiful,  staff super friendly and the food is delicious. Enjoyed my stay at the Taj hotel. Shared a room with 2  friends. Only thing was that I had the one person bed in the room. This bed is too narrow and small, I fell out of the bed a couple of times during the night",3,2022,05,02
121,Outstanding St. James Court visit,"Outstanding customer service, great room, very good location! If we ever stay in London again, the St. James Court will be our hotel of choice. We were able to walk to most of the iconic spots in London. Everyone on the staff were delightful and very accommodating!",5,2022,05,01
121,Sensational,"I have visited the hotel 3 times now and it is a beautiful place to stay; I actually think this might be my favourite London hotel.

The staff are unbelievably attentive, friendly and uber professional.

The rooms are of a really high standard and I absolutely love having a robe, a pair slippers as well as the high-end toiletries. I always have a brilliant night's sleep and the bed, pillows and duvet are all super comfortable.

This is not an ordinary hotel; this place is exceptional.

Five Stars ALL ROUND!",5,2022,04,29
121,Fantastic experience recommended for stay close to Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace,"Fantastic experience with a very welcoming Staff, Mr Dinesh M from the recption team really made us feel welcome as did the rest of the staff at the entrance. the room was excelent and we enjoyed a very tasty breakfast. the breakfast was so good with such nice and friendly staff! Would definetly want to return and try the spa and afternoon tea!",5,2022,04,29
121,"Quality, attention, service","Excellent colleagues at reception, special thanks to Tushar, very accommodating, friendly and efficient. Advised on accommodation, arranged an upgrade, always smiling, helping colleagues, Bravo! Good choice of rooms, refurbished better.",4,2022,04,28
121,Pleasant stay for short business trip,I was looking forward to my stay and on arrival was not disappointed. The location was excellent and the staff and reception area were first class. Check-in was quick and easy. We were staying 2 nights with breakfast; this was good although service on the first morning was slower than expected and I ended up cancelling my order after waiting for over 20minutes as I had to leave for work. My room was fine; a bit dated and in need of modernising but had everything needed for a short stay. We were advised on arrival that there were newer rooms which we could upgrade to however didn't want to do this. The TV picture quality in my room was surprising poor; only watched for a short period of time anyway. Bed was very comfortable and there was a decent amount of space. Overall was happy with the stay and would consider returning.,4,2022,04,27
121,Indian comforts and British class,"The choice of Taj is prime when considering access to shopping, government, theatre, public spaces and public places. Each member of the staff takes time to extend courtesy and care with an elegant pampering of the needs and whims of the guests. A fine point that outpaces the others",5,2022,04,26
121,Excellent from start to finish,"I booked this hotel as a last minute weekend away for my wife’s birthday and was so pleased I chose this one. I let them know when booking it was my wife’s birthday and they made us feel special from the moment we checked in. We were upgraded to a suite and there were balloons, card and cake in the room which was a lovely surprise. Every member of staff we spoke with wished her a happy birthday throughout our whole stay and always had a smile. 
We enjoyed the breakfast and our eggs were cooked exactly as requested. There was a large selection of breakfast options which were all delicious. 
The location of the hotel was great on a quiet road but 2 minutes walk and you are at Buckingham palace! We enjoyed watching the changing of the guard and then relaxing with an ice cream in St James Park after enjoying the hotel cocktails the night before! 
We can’t wait to book and stay here again.",5,2022,04,26
121,"Great, but maybe too much service?!","Very nice hotel, the room was a little tired, but nothing to majorly complain about.
Service was attentive (sometimes a little too much but I’ll get to that).
The atmosphere is as one would expect, elegant, calm, respectful.
The spa was well appointed, with a lovely pool that was more like a giant hot tub for 40 with jets along the side - although I suppose you could swim laps in you wished.
The sauna and steam room were nice. The clientele spoiled it (watching Loud social media videos on mobiles while using the relaxation loungers). Sadly the passing staff did nothing to intervene but aside from this and some over amorous couples partaking in what my grandmother would call “heavy petting”, it was a great experience.
The staff in the restaurant were a little overzealous in their drive to deliver service. There are only so many times I can tell someone at breakfast that I don’t need more coffee, or anything else before it feels intrusive rather than supportive.
At dinner, the food was lovely, the cocktails great and the portions large. I was slightly out off by the waiter asking what was wrong with the main course three times because I had not finished it. It was divine but I had rather overestimated my appetite by having a starter!
What great problems to have though, too much service!!
All in all, a great location, lovely hotel and wonderful experience. I will be back.",4,2022,04,25
121,Exceptional Afternoon Tea Experience,"After a few years, we decided to have afternoon tea at the Taj again.  It was the right choice. We were celebrating my best friend and her daughter's birthdays.  From arrival the service was exceptional. Gabriella and her colleagues who attended to us, were warm, friendly and inviting.  We were all vegetarian and one with allergies, they did an amazing job of catering for us.  The teenager absolutely loved the treats, and the Taj team came out and sang Happy Birthday to them both with a lovely slice of birthday cake.  The surroundings and atmosphere was fabulous and we didn't feel over looked by other guests. Thank you again Taj, we are already thinking about our next visit.  See you again.",5,2022,04,25
121,Beautiful and friendly stay,"My self and my sisters surprised our mum for an overnight stay. We enjoyed room service, requested items and spent time in the Jiva spa, we have nothing but praise for the customer service, cleanliness and organisation of the whole Hotel. We would 100% recommend and attend again. Thank you so much!",4,2022,04,24
121,A Must Stay in London!,"My sisters and I have stayed at St. James Court Hotel on two occasions in the last 2 years. This hotel lives up to the ethos and brand of Taj Hotels. 

Our last visit was in February this year, to celebrate one of my sister's birthday. I had put in a late request for something special to be arranged to mark her special day. Despite the short notice, the hotel staff ensured that there were balloons and a birthday card in the room. At that occasion we stayed 3 nights; each morning, the maitre d at breakfast greeted us with the most warm welcome and provided us with a mimosa each! 

The rooms are luxurious and spacious. The cocktails at the hotel bar are exquisite. Do try out the spa in the hotel, which offers excellent treatments. The courtyard is a further special part of the hotel, where you can relax.

I literally cannot praise the staff at this hotel enough. From the welcome by reception staff, the hotel porters, the bar staff, restaurant staff, doormen and house keeping, all  exemplified what true hospitality should be; making guests feel that they are welcomed and appreciated. We love this hotel so much that have booked another night for this evening to enjoy a short trip to London! Thank you to all staff at St. James Court who have made both our stays so far extra memorable. 

All in all, I would highly recommend  that if you are thinking of staying in London for a short or long stay and want a hotel that goes the extra mile, St. James Court is the place to stay!",5,2022,04,22
121,Warm Hospitality & Superb Staff,"I recently stayed with my family at St. James’ Court Hotel, London. It was an amazing experience with extremely warm hospitality by the superb staff especially Sunaina & Duane. This hotel has a great location and is very reasonably priced for its high standard. I highly recommend this hotel for an enjoyable stay in London.",5,2022,04,21
121,Excellent (food) experience m,"Great service from check-in to check-out. You should at least order a veggie burger in your room, that’s a terrific experience and one of the best burger I tasted. Indian breakfast is also a nice way to start your day when it’s not your culture. Note the hotel is super silent by night so ideal for great nights.",5,2022,04,21
121,Apr 22 Business stay,"One of the best places to stay in London right from location to the overall hospitality and customer experience. My recent stay was once again great right from checkin, room allocation, and most importantly prompt assistance whenever was required. The entire Taj Team makes you feel at home ( away from home). Sunaina at front office and Mohit at restaurant really took great care of me and made my stay for over 2 weeks really comfortable. I am sure I will visit again soon!

Thank you Taj  or wonderful experience, you never disappoint!",5,2022,04,20
121,Good and bad,"Overall Hotel as was expected very nice. Spa treatment was excellent however the waiting area only afforded 3 lounge seats for everyone using spa and awaiting booking s which is very poor and people were hanging around all muttering the same thing.
My main moan has to be breakfast, for such a high price it was very average and quite poor service although pleasant staff. So 1st day the eggs order took 30 minutes and all the plated food on the service was not very hot. The 2nd day the hot plated food was warmer however the eggs took 45 minutes and were asked over easy sunny side up and really runny, so after such a long wait they came out with one broken and hard and the other quite hard too. As you know breakfast sets you up for the day and left us very disappointed.",3,2022,04,20
121,Old fashioned hotel to stay for one time,"I didn't like your hotel. It was old fashioned with not good smelling inside, not fresh furniture in the room and no view from room's windows.
Breakfast was poor.
Only location was superb.
I am definitely will choose another hotel for nest staying in London.",3,2022,04,20
121,"The hotel and the rooms are big, clean and beatiful and the staff very kind","I really enjoyed my experience in your hotel. Its situation is very good. I liked the decoration of the building and the rooms are big and clean. The breakfast is rather good and the staff in the dining hall is very kind and polite though sometimes it is a little mess becauset there are so many people having breakfast at the same time! The room had everything we needed, including iron (with table), tea pot and fruit!!
Thank you very much!!",4,2022,04,19
121,not the Taj I know,"rooms was way too small
ordered 2 boiled eggs; waiter made a big deal - ""let me ask the chef""...then I got charged 11.3 pounds for 2 boiled eggs!!
Taj hotels in India offer better facilities and service and therefore i was expecting much more...",1,2022,04,17
121,Don’t waste your money,"For the money you pay you would expect a clean room,  good service & a good nights sleep.. we had none of these.  We checked into 2 rooms & was given 2 single beds in one room when asked for twin beds, granted this could happen anywhere. 
Was told on booking it was double beds. 

We could not book into 315 until 4pm.. Then we booked into room 316 to find urine on the toilet seat basin & floor!!.. 
it was one event after another.. My daughter had to shower holding the shower head all over body as was broken. Although once reported it was fixed. 

The free water bottles at the side of the beds please do not touch as the seals were broken on them. Room 317 were up until 3 am sorting the shopping out throwing boxes on to the corridor, speaking really loud banging the door open & shut all night.. I had to get up to knock on the door to ask them to be respectful.. 

We ordered a milkshake for the breakfast the following day then was told they had forgotten to order it.. the breakfast was so busy no matter what time you went it was an awful experience to say you pay a lot of money per night. The tables where we were sitting to wait for breakfast were unclean with dirty glasses on them. 

I spoke with Irene the reception staff but she was unhelpful & didn’t seem to bother about our experience. 

I work for the NHS & when I come to London I do like to book into a nice hotel to feel looked after & special. We have always felt like this at this hotel & we have booked several times before, recommended by one of the consultants I work along side. 
On this experience I will not come again & I will be surely informing all my colleagues, family & friends to book else where. I felt like I was in a 3 star hotel where no one cared about my families experience, very disappointed..",2,2022,04,17
121,Awesome Hotel and Sevice,"This is an amazing hotel. The rooms are awesome and staff so welcoming. 

The Indian Restruant is something that I look forward to every time I am in London Looking forward  to my next visit already. Cannot wait to be back.",5,2022,04,16
121,Excellent,Excellent hotel to stay with family. Good breakfast spread with Indian breakfast options if required. Good location close to Westminster Abbey and London eye. Very few hotels in this world can beat the Taj hospitality.,5,2022,04,16
121,Excellent Taj is Taj,Taj doesn't leave any stone unturned to make the stay memorable and goes beyond the call of duty to service the guests. We created numerous memories for almost 9 days at the St James Court Taj Property. Keep it up guys. Superb!,5,2022,04,16
121,Fantastic Hospitality,"We were originally booked at another hotel, which was a disaster. We arrived at St James Court tired and looking for a room. Dinesh was fantastic, showed us 2 different rooms and got us all settled. The staff at this hotel is very friendly and accommodating, nice rooms, a beautiful interior courtyard, and a good breakfast. We appreciated their service and hospitality which made our visit to London wonderful.",5,2022,04,16
121,"Wonderful hotel, Helpful staff, Very good breakfasts","I stayed at this hotel for three nights with my daughter and grandson. We enjoyed the beautiful facilities and the spacious, light-filled room. The food at breakfast was varied and delicious, although there was a short wait for breakfast each morning. The spa looked lovely, but we didn’t have the time to use it on this trip. 
While in London, we had two mishaps - my daughter’s IPhone was stolen, and I fell on the sidewalk and sustained some injuries. The hotel staff was very helpful in both cases. They helped my daughter with her phone issues, and they brought ice and bandages for me.
I recommend the St James Court highly and will stay there again when in London!",5,2022,04,15
121,Overall good but not fully as expected.,"All staff was friendly and helpful at all time, lobby and other public area nice. I did though lack that feeling of being taken care of that I apreciate when staying at these sort of hotels. Ther was basically nothing ""extra"" at all, neither in the staff meeting, durig stay or even in room. Maybe this i due to covid precausions? 
In addition so was my room clearly not dusted on top of cupboard and other high surfaces for most probably half a year. (Having worked myself for many year in 5-star hotels and can't help to do a kind of ""white glove inspection"" of the unseen surfaces.) I reported this to front staff at checkout. This has for me nothing to do with the dayli cleaning, that was well working (exept the day when I had forgotten to turn of the small do not disturb sign) 
Overall good quality but unfortunately not memorable.",4,2022,04,15
121,Wonderful experience !,"Very nice hotel, extremely well located.
What makes the difference ?
The kindness, warmth and helpfulness of the staff (reception, breakfast and an excellent concierge service).
Very good breakfast buffet.",5,2022,04,15
121,Great stay,"Excellent service, lovely hotel, great location. Whats not to like?! We were really impressed with this hotel. It was our first stay. We got a deal online which made it great value. We went for breakfast in a cafe over the road which was our biggest mistake.",5,2022,04,15
121,Gorgeous hotel and amazing friendly kind staff,"My sister and I stayed at the Taj for my sisters birthday weekend so we could watch the Moulin Rouge show(which was incredible). The Taj is a gorgeous hotel and we had an upgrade with it being my sisters birthday, cake and balloons and a card in the room which was so nice! All the staff were very kind, helpful and friendly. The courtyard outside is stunning, our room was perfect and the spa facilities are wonderful. We had an amazing treatment as a little birthday treat. We really enjoyed our weekend and would absolutely love to stay at the Taj again. Thank you for a fabulous few days!",5,2022,04,14
121,Mrs,Our room was very clean and the staff was always friendly! Cleaning service was great every day. Our room was very spacious. I would definitely stay here again. I have no negatives about this hotel. Location was great.,5,2022,04,12
121,Excellent Location - Even Better Service,"This hotel was awesome.  The location is great, the neighborhood is quiet due to the majority of government offices.  St James Place tube stop is less than 3 blocks.  The staff is amazing, they are everywhere and always ready to help.  You don't get giant American hotel rooms in London, so don't expect it.  The rooms have character and are nicely remodeled.  The Front Desk and Concierge staff are the best; Federika and Zora and the others were attentive and helpful at all hours.",5,2022,04,11
121,Nice but has its issues.,"1st look at the hotel is wonderful. 
Lobby is amazing & staff really helpful. 
We stayed in the refurb side of hotel and glad we did as the other part looked very tired. 

Spa - it’s ok but be careful. When wet it’s dangerous and I fell and hurt arm. 

Major issue is mix up in room services. We’re disturbed twice for some getting wrong room. 
Last was at midnight. 
Had the do not disturb turned on, fast a sleep to have a porter bray on door. 
He said we needed a replace duvet. Then realised at wrong room. 
When asked why knock on door with DND on , just looked puzzled. 
Given £50 goodwill but in all honesty not worth it as it £300 per night hotel and could not get back off at that point. 

Major issue was breakfast on 1st day. 
Arrived at 9.50-10am. 
Absolute disaster - big queue, people complaining, then a couple March from back, say not happy and say down, which is unacceptable and made a scene as I was not allowing that having waiting patiently for 10 mins. 
Management tried to calm us down by giving a free Prosecco, but not the point. 

Overall it’s a nice hotel. Just spoiled by the breakfast and wake up at midnight. 

Prob won’t return.",3,2022,04,10
121,Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Service,"We loved our stay in this hotel. The location is ideal, the rooms are nice and the service is excellent. I have to mention that the food and the service at the restaurant was exceptional. Our server Mohit was specially welcoming and charming! he served us some delicious Indian breakfast making our morning a little more special. Totally recommend this place and we will come back next time we are in London.",5,2022,04,09
121,London after 2 years,"We had  a lovely stay at the hotel, as always. Taj London has become our second home, over a period of time, and is my favourite hotel in London. The ambience., location, rooms, and most importantly, the people, are all excellent.
I would like to mention a few people here, who made our trip even more memorable, during the stay.
Starting from Geeta Punjabi, who has always made my bookings so simple and easy. 
Sree at the reception did a great job too.
Mohit and the entire breakfast team, who went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.
Will be back soon. Thank you Taj London.",5,2022,04,07
121,Superb hotel in excellent location,Wonderful experience with our family for a 3 nights stay in London. The location and style of the hotel is awesome and I can suggested this place to anybody.The breakfast is superb - thanks to Mohit who served us very well and was extremely kind to deal with.,5,2022,04,07
121,Lovely place,"Stayed here on business for the best part of week in March 2022.

Checkin was a breeze as there was no one else in line when I got there about 1500 Sunday.

Room was nice, a tad disappointed to see there was no bath robe but I'm sure if I'd ask one would have been made available. As with most hotels the pillows were far too soft for my liking but a quick call to reception saw a firm pillow delivered to my door with 20 mins.

(Did not see this info in other reviews) The room has an array of ports (HDMI, usb) underneath the TV that I'm assuming allows you to hook up your fire stick/apple TV .
/ whatever to the TV, unfortunately mine didn't work but I wasn't bothered enough to find out  why or request help. TV has Sky and BT channels along with a good selection of international channels. Picture quality seems to be SD and delivered over IP. The TV has an associated speaker in the bathroom so I managed to get my music/ football podcasts steaming from my phone to the TV via Bluetooth to the speaker in the bathroom in the mornings which was nice.

Breakfast is good and if you get there before 0800 it's a breeze, dosa's and egg's Benedict were among the things I had.

Staff a delight throughout, always friendly, smiling, polite and willing to help.

Will be staying here again",5,2022,04,06
121,Falling wardrobes,I had a very mixed stay. Check in took longer than it needed to be. I was staying at refurbished room but the wardrobe door feel as I opened it and alarms went off for no reason (when I informed housekeeping I was asked if I had pressed any buttons!). Service needs polishing and rooms need a Handiman.,3,2022,04,06
121,The best  hospitality in London!!!,"I stayed at the Taj and was blown away by the warmth and hospitality of the staff. Incredibly super clean rooms and the delicious food made it even better! The spa is amazing and be sure to ask for Sylvia ( masseuse)who gave me the best massage of my life!!! So much care taken at breakfast by the lovely morning staff,  and the warmth is everywhere!!! Such a caring, warm and hospitable hotel and staff!! I will never stay any other place in London!!! Feels like home and last nights meal at ,’ Quinon’ was the cherry on the cake’! Best Indian meal in London ever! I will be definitely be  a repeat customer. !Loved my stay and cant wait to be back And not to forget the amazing caring concierge, doormen lobby staff… everyone!!!… truly wonderful!! Love it!! Highly highly recommended!

121,Go to hotel in London,"This was my third time at the property and my experience keeps getting better:) highly recommend this place due to location, warm staff, food etc. During our stay we had breakfast both days and we were very taken care of by Suhaina, Mohit and many others with smile and warmth. We had a similar experience at Jiva spa. I recommend the spa as a must do at the hotel.",5,2022,04,04
121,Fantastic,"The stay was comfortable. The room extremely cozy and the ambience very nice. The staff was very nice and warm and friendly. The only minor area of improvement is the breakfast which we found slightly repetitive and there was some delay in getting our egg orders. 
Otherwise simply fantastic.",5,2022,04,03
121,Very attentive and polite staff,"A fantastic hotel with good amenities.  The room and bed were a good sized and comfortable.  The bathroom was very well appointed but suffered from a little mould on the tile grouting, lack of a bath plug and the lack of a hand held shower.  And no biscuits.",4,2022,04,03
121,Evening meals,"We visited at Th@51 for evening meals , we had allergens issue and Mr.Ankit suggested us lot of options he was very well knowledge about food and allergens he suggested us perfect meal also suggested us places to visit in london very well polite and gentle man thank you for all the assistance.",5,2022,04,01
121,Great Hotel and service like no other,Great Hotel and great location centrally located around everything. the restaurant service was especially Eizettee Zawawi  =was an absolute gem of a server.  was the best host I have ever had in all my travels. Visit TH51 while you are here and see Zettee.,5,2022,04,01
121,Loved the Tajness,"Affordable luxury in the heart of London. A great experience, staff were very welcoming Upon arrival and we had a great surprise in our room fornour birthday celebrations. Had great meals in the hotel but a fantastic dinner at Quilon too. I cannot  recommend Jiva spa enough,fantastic.",5,2022,03,31
121,First Class!,"Stayed for 2 nights Friday/Saturday whilst catching up with friends, O2 gig and theatre.
Lovely refurbished comfortable room, very attentive staff.  Amin on Reception was very helpful, organised a lovely table for us in the conservatory for lunch.  
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,03,31
121,Taj St. James awful experience,"I am a huge fan of the Taj brand and have stayed at a number of Taj properties from vivanta, gateway to Palace properties like Udaipur. When I found a Taj in London, I was very excited and changed my reservations to move to Taj St. James for 4 nights. Unfortunately, the experience was awful. The rooms were in awful shape, even the elevator was not upto standard. The breakfast was a total mess. We shortened our stay to one night and moved out. This property absolutely needs new management.",1,2022,03,30
121,Outstanding is a understatement ,"I have to say from checking in, service, dining facilities and evening drinks the stay for the wife and I was wonderful.  It's hard these days to find staff so welcoming and attentive.  I will be staying here again. Every service was outstanding in the hotel and sincerely mean this.",5,2022,03,29
121,Evening in London,This hotel was amazing! Everything was thought out to meet the expectations of their customers. The breakfast buffet was delicious with lots of options for adults and kids. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel is located within walking distance of St. James park and so many other great sights! Would definitely stay again.,5,2022,03,29
121,Great stay at a great property,"This was my first time staying at a Taj Hotel and after my experience it certainly will not be the last.  Every staff member was incredibly friendly and helpful and made you feel like the most important person at the hotel.  Ive had the luck to stay at a number of 5 star luxury hotels (St Jame Court is not listed as one) and I can tell you that based on the service it should be.  Absolutely top notch.  We also had the experience of walking through the pre-renovated part of the hotel into the newly renovated part and the new part is gorgeous.  Rooms and bathroom is spacious and done up to a high standard.  One of the most comfortable beds and great linens and easily the best hotel pillows I have ever experienced.  We also ate at the restaurant, the first night by default (we were too tired from travel to try anywhere else) and the second night by choice because the food was incredible.  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  It may have been the best cooked lamb Ive ever had.  From start to finish St Jame Court looks and acts like a 5 star hotel.  If you are looking for a place to stay near Buckingham Palace or anywhere in London, you surely wont be disappointed.  If you cannot tell already I HIGHLY recommend St. Jame Court.",5,2022,03,29
121,Birthday treat !,"Federica welcomed us at reception, upgraded us as it was my birthday, took us to our room where I had a birthday cake and balloons waiting, such a nice surprise. The room was amazing, we went to the spa for some relaxation time. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. Rally enjoyed our stay. The staff were all very friendly. Evening meal was very tasty. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,03,28
121,"New restaurant, food and service","Great service and attention to detail. The new restaurant was a great experience the food decor and especially the service thank you Zetty you made that even more special. 
Congratulations to the Taj for creating this new restaurant and delivering such a great experience. Congratulations to the chef and the team for looking after us this past few days.",5,2022,03,28
121,"Beautiful Hotel, Fabulous Service, Great Breakfast!","We had a weekend at the hotel to celebrate some girlfriends' 50th birthdays. The staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and attentive, it was everything we wanted. The breakfast is great, the surroundings are beautiful, and I highly recommend Kona restaurant for their afternoon tea, and an indian head massage at the spa.",5,2022,03,28
121,A Royal Girls Trip Away & More Taj breaks,"I would like to give my personal thanks to Sunaina and the team for making our stay a memorable one. I was at the Taj in London with my parents around January and Sunaina shared her details at check out if ever i was interested in personalising our next trip.

I was there on the 19th of March with my sisters and sister in law and i got in touch with Sunaina to personalise our trip with an indian garland welcome, some bollywood entrance music as a bit of fun and bollywood dialogues plaques for afternoon tea, room and breakfast the following morning.  (as a surprise)

Sunaina was very responsive, replying to my requests, offering a number of options and even though she struggled to get flower garlands, Sunaina knew how special the trip was for us and provided an alternative as long as we got the experience.  The moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The staff were very friendly on the outset and although there was a wedding on, the hotel was busy, the staff and Sunaina still made sure we got the full experience and the surprise i had planned.  The detail and thought that went into everything was just perfect. I had also requested a table to be reserved for breakfast and good indian vegetarian breakfast items which we all thoroughly enjoyed. Every so often during our entire stay we would be asked if everything was ok.  The indian hospitality and the friendliness of the staff felt being part of the taj family.  The staff and sunaina had made sure every detail of my request was covered.

Sunaina made sure she got the opportunity to say goodbye to us and she also gave us some taj goodies/teddies to take back home for the kids.

It was amazing in every way and we still cant stop talking about it. The whole experience has created memories that we will hold forever and now my friends, my brother, my cousins all want the Taj experience! 

My brother did end up booking a trip to the taj a week later (As i write this review). It was very last minute but Sunaina and the team still delivered first class service and a complimentary free upgrade was appreciated.  

The hotel staff go out of their way to make sure everything is on point and the personalised service adds on makes the trip extra special.

Thankyou for everything and being amazing at what you do and being who you are.  Sunaina and team managed to bring the mumbai taj experience in a london way.",5,2022,03,27
121,OUTSTANDING,"I Stayed her for 4 nights as my neice was 30 and come down from Scotland there were 4 of us we had the most amazing time. Thank you to every single member of staff at this hotel that were ALL very very professional  we really couldnt have asked for a better stay EVERYTHING from the min we walked in the foyer to when we left the food  service room FACILITIES were OUTSTANDING thank you st James we will definitely be back .

Kind Regards 
Marion Mcgurk",5,2022,03,27
121,Well worth the wait,"Amazing hotel in a great location. From check in to check out the staff were fantastic. Good size bedrooms, and a wonderful breakfast thanks to a chef who obviously is passionate about food and presentation. The courtyard is beautiful and will be wonderful for afternoon tea or a pre dinner cocktail.",5,2022,03,24
121,"Too crowded, sub standard service","I checked in on Saturday and at that time it was too crowded and there wasn't enough staff to handle checkin etc. even at restaurant I had to wait for breakfast and since I couldn't they switched me to another restaurant where they claimed they had same menu but no one asked for any order of eggs etc. since there was shortage of staff. Weekdays was supposedly less crowded but still when I ordered water in my room it never came. You would expect a name like Taj to be able to fulfill basic needs in a room like water but that was not the case. I had to go to reception to give them specific instruction that I do not want any sparkling water in my room, but I do need around 2 litres of still water daily which they did remember for a couple of days but not everyday still. Overall worst five star experience. If you looking for a decent stay and can't find a cheaper place you can consider this one. Although I would suggest otherwise if you are an Indian. They do discriminate if you are an Indian.",2,2022,03,22
121,london break for 30th occasssion,"I wouldn't normally write reviews, but on this occasion felt I had to. I stayed at St, James court hotel, Taj hotel London for my daughters 30th birthday for few days from 15th march until 18th. I cannot praise this beautiful hotel enough, from entrance to leaving, staff were amazing, so friendly every one of them, and Francis on reception was outstanding on helping us along the way. Food was lovely n what beautiful surroundings. they even put beautiful card in our room with balloons n some little cakes for my daughter and upgraded us to junior suite, Which was stunning. so would like to thank you guys each n everyone that was involved along way, we would certainly recommend this hotel, and I will certainly be back. well done guys. we both enjoyed every minute of our stay. 

Thank You

121,Great hotel with exceptional staff,"Amazing hotel in the heart of London, very warm welcome from all the staff 
And the staff really make this hotel exceptional 
Rooms are clean, but slightly dated
Breakfast is excellent but does get very busy at peak times, but worth the wait if you can",5,2022,03,22
121,Excellent Hotel,"The staff were very welcoming and helpful, particularly at check in. Check-in staff knew we were visiting for a special occasion. They upgraded us to a premium room and allowed us to check in early. The hotel is very well maintained and is in a good location. Our room was spotlessly clean and appeared to be recently decorated. The room was a reasonable size for a central London hotel but not large. It did have a very nice bathroom with a large shower (but no bath - which was fine for us). We didn't use many of the hotel facilities during our stay so can't comment. Breakfast was very busy during our stay - on the first day we gave up waiting for a table and went to a local café. Maybe you need to go to breakfast early",4,2022,03,21
121,"Splendid time at the Taj, thanks to the G.O.A.T Tushar!","Coming into hotel I was greeted very warmly and any issue I may have had was resolved.  I landed and was heading to a Tottenham football match and needed to shower and go asap and it was resolved.  If you are not checked in by Tushar I suggest you seek him out because he was the model of service industry standards.  
Incredibly knowledgeable, hospitable and charming.  I’m sure the other agents are excellent as well",5,2022,03,21
121,Please exercise caution when dining here,"I booked a weekend stay at the Taj mid-February of 2022 as an add-on to my trip to Spain. I had an amazing time there a few months prior. The hotel is beautiful and it’s located in a great part of town. My last stay included breakfast, which was also great. This time, I made the grave error of ordering the tikka masala from the room service menu the night before I left. I became violently ill the next morning, making my trip back home very unpleasant. It got so bad that I had to take 2 extra days off work. I’m confused as to how a high-end Indian hotel chain failed spectacularly in making this staple dish? In the future I would stay here again but it’d be very unlikely that I dine here again due to their questionable food prep practices.",1,2022,03,19
121,Great experience!,"First trip in 2 years and traveled with my young toddler. We arrived ~8:30am and looked to check-in. Federica was helping us and offered us 60 pounds to check-in early for our Executive King room. I initially declined but she heard we were celebrating my sons birthday that she gave us a free upgrade to premium king room. I couldn’t be more grateful after a very long flight with my young child. Federica went even more above and beyond when she came over to give my son a teddy bear. He was SO happy. 

The room was great and very quiet. Highly recommend a premium room to splurge. The bathroom was huge!

We had breakfast only one morning but the staff was very kind. We had a very short wait at 7:45am but we didn’t mind as they offered us orange juice.

I also had a package sent to the hotel and the concierge was very helpful in handling it for me. Shoutout to Shay.

Overall I highly recommend this hotel. The staff was so pleasant to me and my son that we would happily come back and stay here!!",5,2022,03,19
121,Not the experience we were hoping for,"We were going away for the first time in a few years without our children and were hoping for something wonderful, but sadly the hotel was a real let down.

When we first arrived at the hotel, it appeared to be very nice and the check-in staff were pleasant. I asked if there was a complimentary room upgrade available (we had booked an Executive King) and we were told we had already been upgraded to the newly renovated Premium rooms as the courtyard view we had originally requested was unavailable as the hotel was at 90% capacity. I mentioned that I thought these were smaller and the check-in man said only a little bit smaller and it would not be noticeable. We were given a room on the very top floor. It certainly appeared smaller than we were expecting and there was a tiny window. But we thought OK it was fair and it was clean. 

I asked the concierge for assistance with where would be a good place to eat and he gave a few suggestions, but to be honest didn't really appear confident about where to send us. Eventually we booked into a Thai, which was delicious, so a good recommendation, but it would have been better if he had seemed more positive about where to send us. Maybe there are just no really good restaurants near by??

We then got in from our evening out and settled down to sleep, however, by midnight sleep was not going to happen due to the pipes making a terrible racket above our heads. Called down to reception and they were very good sending an engineer up within 10/15 mins. He agreed that it was not acceptable and arranged for us to be moved. The concierge again came very quickly and was very polite. The room we were offered was just 2 doors down and even smaller than the one we had booked, plus the pipes could still be heard. So we were finally moved down to the 3rd floor. My goodness what a difference in the room. This is what I would have expected to start with, it was a lovely size with 2 full sash windows. The wardrobe was smaller as was the bathroom, but it did not feel any where near as cramped.

So I cannot understand why we were not offered this room to begin with. It felt like we had just been put up in the attic. Perhaps it was because we had booked via our air miles, but surely that should not make a difference.

We then ventured down for breakfast at 9am and it was extremely busy, so we were put right by the door to the kitchen. I appreciate this can't be helped, but to be honest, this should not even be a table on offer. All we could hear was banging and crashing. Then the hot food was luke warm at best, I have eaten better at a Premier Inn. The server was nice, but to be honest they all seemed a bit dazed. We also sat for ages and had to ask for a coffee, so definitely felt like we were forgotten. The 2nd morning we went to breakfast at 1030. We appreciated we would probably need to queue so were prepared, but then pleasently suprised when we were taken to the Bistro. Well this was even worse. It was clearly the overflow for the main restaurant and the food was even colder, the bacon was totally clumped together and there were no bread or pastries. The light above my head started flickering really badly, I asked one of the very young staff if they could turn it off and they just stood there looking at it. So I had noticed a black switch underneath it and thought I would take a chance that this was the off switch and thankfully it was. So now the staff know where the off switch is too!!

I did have to use the downstairs ladies room, and this was not terribly clean.

The check out was fine and they offered an apology for the room, but that was it.

So, our overall experience was not a good one. We spend many hours debating which hotel in London to book as we were using the last of my husbands air miles, which we had been saving for a special occasion. So, we really wanted it to be a fabulous experience and honestly it was probably one of the most disappointing hotels we have stayed in.",2,2022,03,16
121,Hospitality par excellence`,"I absolutely cannot stay in another place but the Taj in London now. The warmth of the team at this hotel from the concierge desk to the restaurant will keep you going back there again and again! 

The breakfast spread is perhaps the best I have ever had. Every member of the hotel seems so willing to help, so incredibly polite and smiling at all times! They offer everyday housekeeping and a turndown service in the evening as well. They are so gracious about anything extra you need such as water bottles. 5-6 minutes walk from Green Park and St James Park. So many eateries and shops on Victoria just 5 minutes from the hotel. 

I just find the hotel exceptional on all fronts!!! And would highly recommend it to anyone over any other hotel in town!",5,2022,03,15
121,Pleasant stay. Friendly and helpful staff. Expensive drinks at the bar though.,"A comfortable room with everything you’d expect but could be improved with better pillows and more condiments for tea making. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was impressive with a fantastic choice. It does get busy though. Again, staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2022,03,15
121,Amazing,"It was perfect. Thank you St James Court staff, they were so lovely. The room was beautiful and clean. The spa was amazing. Great choices for the breakfast with Indian food, it was so tasty. We were so satisfied of the hotel !",5,2022,03,15
121,Very satisfied,"We were very happy to stay here and surprised with the nice service of the staff. We had a small problem while check-in but it was due to booking.com (we booked room on booking.com for 3 adults but in the system of hotel showed only for 2 adults), I think that hotel should work with booking.com to avoid this mistake. Anyway the problem was solved quickly by the staff at reception. It was great also that the staff at the restaurant always offered us some Indian food during the breakfast which we have never tried before. It's a nice surprise and experience. The position of the hotel is also very good, very near to main attractions, just by walk. We love it!",5,2022,03,15
121,Fabulous London hotel,"As always we were treated very well, hotel has excellent amenities and is in a great location. Check in and out are fast and smooth while the rooms are comfortable and practical. There is a great choice of food available and the breakfast is pretty good, the room was competitively priced for such a good central London hotel. Overall I would highly recommend.",5,2022,03,15
121,Friends 40th,"Absolutely loved our stay at the Taj, the hotel was amazing, staff all extremely friendly and attentive, rooms were lovely and my friend got a free upgrade for her birthday. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back.",5,2022,03,15
121,"Having stayed several times at several Taj properties in India, this experience was lacking","Main problem to note is the mattress in the room had collapsed. I did not get proper sleep until a few days later when it was replaced. No option of room was offered. It would have been easier to just change into a different room.
There were no laundry bags in the room.
There were no DND tags in the room which I could hang outside. None were made available when I pointed this out either. I kept getting disturbed throughout the day because of this for the entire duration of my stay of 6 days.

Overall, I was really looking forward to the stay and it has been nothing but lacklustre.",2,2022,03,15
121,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed at the taj for my daughters 40th birthday, the hotel is absolutely beautiful and all of the staff are so very polite and friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them!  Our premier king room was wonderful, the food is beautiful thank you taj staff",5,2022,03,13

121,Excellent hotel with amazing staff,"On arrival we were greeted by a very smiley receptionist who upgraded our room as it was my birthday. 
The room was beautiful and clean with lots of space.

This was a first visit and won’t be our last!….  This was a special treat for my wife’s 50th birthday and the hotel couldn’t have treated her any better. On checking into our room we were informed that we had been given an up grade to an executive suite, which was fabulous! Then on returning to the room later the hotel had given a complimentary cake and at breakfast the following morning we had complimentary Buck’s Fizz. The hotel really our trip very special. The hotel is in a great location although down a side road it was only 5 mins from Buckingham palace and 10/15 mins from Westminster and theatres at Victoria, bars and restaurants.
Thank you for a wonderful stay we WILL definitely be back!……",5,2022,03,07
121,A Unique and Fabulous Stay in London,"Exceptional Stay. Fantastic change of vibe in London.
My husband and I often stay at the Lancaster Gate but he booked this hotel having stayed at a Taj hotel in Bangalore. I’m so glad he did.

The hotel is in a great location and only a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and Westminster. 
We would definitely stay again!",5,2022,02,27
121,Perfect!,"Myself and my daughter had a lovely overnight stay in the Courtyard suite. From the moment you step into this hotel the staff make you feel welcome and looked after. 
The suite was spacious, modern and comfortable and the shower was amazing.

This was a spa weekend for us so we booked a massage and an express breakfast facial at the hotel's Jiva spa. The staff were very friendly and professional and the treatments were wonderful. The spa facilities are very good but I wish the spa had opened earlier than 11am so we could have enjoyed the facilities for longer.

We had a lovely stay. Thank you to all who made it special.",5,2022,02,27

This really was an extraordinary stay and we wouldn't hesitate to book again on our next London trip. The location was perfect too. Thank you to everyone.",5,2022,02,22
121,Not worth it price wise,"Spa ridiculously busy and would not adopt a booking system 

Premier rooms far away from reception - a gazillion maze-like corridors to follow.

Hot breakfast items were lukewarm at best. Hour long waits for some queuing for breakfast

Service at breakfast was good and in common areas.

Housekeeping very attentive and quick 

Overall don’t feel it was a relaxing luxury break.",3,2022,02,22
121,Week-end stay with family,Have been at the hotel few times in past. Never ceases to impress. Hotel is in an excellent location. Rooms spacious. Staff very attentive. Was celebrating my daughters birthday. Staff went the extra mile to make the event memorable. Will certainly be back.,5,2022,02,20
121,Decent 4 star hotel in a nice location. But not worthy of the Taj brand name,"First the positives: the location is very good; it is a period property that is well maintained. We stayed 3 nights in the new wing and the views of the courtyard were nice. The breakfast spread is as expected. Some staff were very helpful.

The negatives: Rooms are nice, but storage is limited.  The spa is good, but is open between 11am and 7pm only, so a lot of time is lost, unless you plan to do nothing but stay in the hotel. But more importantly, despite staying there for 3 days, none of the treatments were available, apart from one 30-minute massage (that too not even a full massage) at a time which was not convenient for us.

However, the main reason for a negative review is our experience with the Reservations team which was scandalous, to say the least. Both the global and local reservations team did not respond to my email enquiry. Hence, I called the hotel directly to make the booking and the person who answered spoke with an Eastern European accent and sadly I did not take his name down. He should not be working in the hospitality, or any industry, for that matter. He actually lied to me on the phone, and I was made to feel very cheap for enquiring about the NHS offer that was advertised by them on their website. He said that we were not eligible for the offer, as a minimum 5 day stay was needed, which was absolutely untrue!

This is unpardonable, in my opinion. Hence, I am writing this review, despite the effort by Sunaina, the reception manager, to sort things out when checking out (more about this later). Hence, I am giving a 3/5 rating - if not for her efforts, I would have given a 0 rating, which is sad for such an iconic Indian brand. In our experience the Taj brand prides itself in providing good customer service and this is where the hotel failed.

This was supposed to be an extended weekend break to celebrate a special occasion, and the property was recommended by our friends. We had messaged the hotel earlier about the occasion and mentioned it at check-in as well. But nothing was done for the 3 days that we were there. This is okay too, as there is no obligation upon them to do anything. But we have stayed at other hotels who have looked after us much better, so will not be recommending this hotel.

Some of the staff were excellent, but others were inexperienced, and dare I say, more eager to please the 'locals', if you get my drift.....

We had fed back our problems with the reservation team during check-in, and were repeatedly reassured by Tushar that all efforts would be made to give us a good experience. However, when checking out, nothing had been mentioned in the system about the problems that we had faced earlier. And when I mentioned that I was promised an NHS discount for the very small meal that we had eaten one evening, the initial response was to reluctantly offer a 10% reduction with a comment that the conversation with Tushar will need to be confirmed with him. 

This was very embarrassing, as other guests were looking on, and I was left feeling as if I was trying to be some sort of cheapskate. The person dealing with this happened to be the reception manager Sunaina, and I told her about all the problems with the reservation team. And to give her credit, she discounted the entire amount of £73 from the bill. She also apologised and gave her personal card while asking me to give them a chance to make amends in the future.

This is exactly what Tushar had said when we checked in, and sadly the hotel did not live up to their promise despite us having stayed with them for 3 days. It shouldn't need customers complaining and saying they would post negative reviews, before action is taken. Hence, this long review - a special occasion was ruined and I am not sure if we would be taking a chance by staying there again. Book at your own risk - other options are available.",3,2022,02,20
121,Birthday treat,Had a great stay at the taj.dropped cases off early where the receptionist wished my wife happy birthday.when we went back after theatre matinee show cases were waiting in our room.room was lovely.nice bed n spotlessly clean plus sky sports on tv.the courtyard was beautiful where you can get some lovely pictures.breakfast was good.buffet style with loads of choice.location is really good.2 minutes walk to Buckingham palace and 15 minutes walk to Trafalgar square.highly recommend this hotel,5,2022,02,20
121,Satisfactory,"Generally it was ok, nothing stands out to blow me away - Room was good and clean, gym was good and clean, bar area was nice especially having been re-done. Only issue I would say is the plumbing - the taps and shower when you turn it on spurts out water rather than a smooth flow - must be air in the system - not exactly pleasant but sorts itself out after a minute of running the tap and shower. 

Got charged the £100 safety deposit on my credit card and still not had it credited back into my account, as I did not use any incidentals!",3,2022,02,20
121,Very happy stay ,"I stayed for a week on holiday in London before Christmas and was very happy with my choice.
The highlights were:
-Breakfast was included with the room rate and this was served in the restaurant with a lovely view facing the inner courtyard. There was a good variety of food including freshly made eggs of choice

- my room was upgraded to a deluxe room that was spacious and peaceful facing the inner courtyard

Staff overall especially the restaurant staff was helpful. The only exception was the lady who was on duty as the manager at the reception when I checked out. Her manner was abrupt and she also charged me twice for some local calls. Though it was resolved it wasted my time and spoilt the end of my stay after the overall good experience.

The hotel is very close to St James tube (3 minutes walk) and the rest of Victoria so it is near to eating places and shops. 
It is also quite a short cab ride to West End and at night after shows, the fare would be around £10 to get back to the hotel.

I would choose to stay here again in London. ",5,2022,02,20
121,Dinner at TH@51,"Absolutely enjoyed our dinner at TH@51. We were guest at the hotel (separate review later) and the staff were excellent. We were travelling with young children and true to the Taj brand, every member of staff did everything they could to accommodate us and make us feel comfortable. Special mention of Ankit, Ashton and Marco who constantly checked on us and the lovely blond haired Maitre’d (didn’t catch her name) who took our youngest girl to say hi to the chefs.

The food was both interesting and divine and we are excited about our next meal there. Definitely try their signature dishes and cocktail. Amazing ambience and try to get a table by the windows.",5,2022,02,20
121,Truly Amazing Experience!!,"What an amazingly plush and absolutely brilliant hotel and experience staying at the Taj was. Amazing, courteous service which makes you feel just like royalty! A really memorable experience and truly unforgettable and unique. From the concierge to the help desk to the bar staff to the reception staff... every aspect is absolute class and honestly an amazing experience. 👏🏽 ",5,2022,02,15
121,Disappointing service aspects,"Whilst the hotel itself is nice, the receptionist at the check-in didn't explain clearly how to get to our room, meaning we got lost and needed to find help. The room itself was fine. Then at breakfast in the morning, there was a 20-minute wait to get seated at a table and we weren't even offered a drink whilst we waited.",3,2022,02,15
121,Brilliant,Loved this place. Would definitely recommend it. Was well worth the extra pennies. Would defo book again. The service was brilliant. The food was gorgeous and rooms were well looked after and clean. Beds comfy,5,2022,02,15
121,Beautiful Taj Hotel,"A wonderful hotel with a warm welcome from every member of staff.
The food & wine  was excellent together with the service. Breakfast took as back to our stay in India when we saw & ate the paratha's subji & Chole. It was delicious
House keeping made the experience even better by presenting balloons 🎈 cake & card in our room as we were celebrating my husband's birthday.
Thank you to Marika at check in for making it so smooth & the photo!
The courtyard in the Summer would be amazing.
Not to forget the Jiva spa escapism from the lively city.
Would Def stay here again.",5,2022,02,14
121,Fit for a Princess 👸,"The staff are beyond warm and kind. Thank you to Irene at check-in and check out.The culture of this hotel and its staff definitely understands what guests value. Although totally a luxury hotel the atmosphere is not 'stuffy'. We are blown away by this hotel, best nights sleep I have had in ages! and we have re booked for a longer stay in June.",5,2022,02,13
121,Perfect location and experience,"Dinner in the restaurant was fantastic. Exceeded expectations. Culinary staff is clearly talented. Staff were kind and friendly. Bed was great, sheets and mattress perfect. Excellent pillows. Very comfortable. Not a huge room but roomy enough and location is superb for walking around London.",5,2022,02,13
121,Great hotel,"Taj Hotel is well appointed. Staff are attentive and friendly. Breakfast was of good quality and plentiful. Spa and wellness facility was great. Location is good for galleries, shops and restaurants. The courtyard is pretty spectacular.",5,2022,02,12
121,"Lovely hotel, overpriced drinks again.","Another lovely but brief overnight stay. I’m happy paying the £200+ overnight price to stay here as the property is in central London and the place is lovely with professional attentive staff. But yet again, my gripe is £40 for a single vodka/coke and wine in the bar. Come on folks, at cost that’s £5. It doesn’t exactly encourage you to relax and enjoy sitting back and drinking there, so yet again we didn’t. Other than that it would get 5*",4,2022,02,11
121,Excellent Experience from the moment we put our feet on the front steps.,"We were warmly welcomed as we approached the doors. Greeted at reception and thoroughly looked after. Finished off with a most delicious, fresh and amazing selection for breakfast and perfect check out at 12noon. Already looking to re-book.",5,2022,02,11
121,The Taj at St James,"Great location. Good amenities. Staff very helpful.  Room very spacious and warm. No noise issues so a good nights sleep. Breakfast had a huge selection  

The Taj point system is good and add to your stay experience. Would definitely come back.",5,2022,02,10
121,Excellent Stay,Our favourite hotel in London. The location is great but it is the excellent customer service that sets it apart. The breakfast is particularly good and the setting in a glass conservatory is a treat. Special thanks to Federica on the front desk who looked after us so well,5,2022,02,10
121,Don't perform building works at night,"It's simple. You book a room to sleep typically that night. You do not expect there to be building works ongoing during that period. Least of all would you then expect the night manager to argue that they had a contract with the builders so nothing can be done, excuse me you have a contract with the guest first and foremost!",1,2022,02,09
121,24 hours in london,Fabulous….it’s like a 7 star hotel and the staff was excellent. They upgraded my room and gave me early check in and check out and made my quick stay fabulous . The location perfect and so close to Buckingham palace,5,2022,02,08
121,Birthday treat,"I throughly recommend this hotel. Very clean, polite & friendly staff with nothing being too much trouble. 

I mentioned it was my partners birthday and we had cake in our room upon arrival and also again the following day, which was his actual birthday. 
When we came down to breakfast and gave our room number, he was even wished a happy birthday by the staff member.

It's those little touches that make your stay even more memorable. 

Many thanks to all at the Taj.",5,2022,02,08
121,Great service,Rooms very clean and tastefully decorated. Breakfast was excellent with combination of continental and Indian. Location is very central to main attractions in London and also convenient to the public transportation,4,2022,02,08
121,Another fantastic stay at St James Court,"As a frequent visitor to London, I regularly stay at St James Court. For me there is no reason to stay anywhere else! This trip was a birthday weekend and the hotel made it very special with a room upgrade and birthday balloons. The suite is a fantastic room, modern, spacious and spotlessly clean. I always opt for breakfast in the room and it arrives in a heated trolley, cooked to perfection, a great start to the day. They really are an excellent team at St James and the staff are so helpful and friendly. Can’t wait to return. ",5,2022,02,07
121,Second visit in under 2 months,"We arrived on Saturday 5th February for my birthday and to watch a show which was cancelled in December.
From the moment we arrived we were met by friendly and helpful staff .
We were upgraded to a fabulous suite which was spacious and luxurious.
This hotel oozes charm and character unlike a lot of hotels that seem very bland and unwelcoming.
Hamptons Piano bar is a great place to unwind and relax ,
Breakfast is plentiful with an excellent choice,
If you can try and reserve seating overlooking the amazing garden.
We will return later in the year
Special mention of thanks to Amita and Brenda who booked our room and upgrade.
Also to Charming yes that is her name who served drinks to my wife and I on both of our visits. polite and always smiling 
Look forwarf to our next trip to the Taj London",5,2022,02,07
121,Excellent,"Once again another wonderful stay at Taj St James. 
We arrived around mid day and Anuja  (reception staff)  informed us our room was almost ready which was great. 
They kindly upgraded our room as we were both celebrating birthdays .
Our room was modern, spacious and spotlessly clean. 
We ate in the hotels new restaurant TH@51 which was excellent , especially the surprise birthday dessert, and we also used the bar facilities in both TH@51 and The Hamptons. 
Throughout our stay ALL the staff were friendly, attentive and nothing was too much trouble . 
We very much look forward to returning in the near future",5,2022,02,03
121,Superb,"Great hotel. Really relaxing in such a great central location. Staff were very accommodating. Absolutely spotless. We were in the modern rooms that had been subject to a refurb and were really nice and well equipped.

Only quibble is the room service and it's pricing. Over £20 for a cheese sandwich, plus £5 if you want cutlery and then a 12.5% service charge on top. Is there a more expensive cheese sandwich in the world?",5,2022,02,02
121,Best place to stay in London,"I am a frequent visitor to London and i really enjoy my stay at this outstanding property of Taj. the service, the food, the hospitality and the over all ambiance of this place is just remarkable. Will always come back & stay at the Taj when   I am in London next.",5,2022,02,01
121,Fantastic experience,"From the moment you arrive until you leave, the staff are warm, welcoming, friendly and professional.  The lobby smells devine, beautifully designed and stunning building.  We had a family room, which was a good size, very comfortable beds, lovely bathroom and ideal for 2 adults and 2 teenagers.  Breakfast was pleniful, with wonderful choices.  Our waiter on the first morning, Mohit had fantastic attention to detail and wonderful service, offering us dishes that we would never had chosen ourselves, made breakfast much more of a delight.  The location of this hotel is perfect, just  a few minutes from Buckingham Palace and easy walking distance to many theatres, Westminster Abbey, Parliment Square, The Mall, Parks etc etc.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and we would most definitely stay again.",5,2022,01,31
121,Weekend away,"Lovely hotel very friendly staff
Very helpful with information about the area .
The bedroom was a family room very clean .
Large had a lounge.everything you would need 
In the room .
Bathroom clean ,towels very soft to use.
Would stay here again .
Only thing was that after the show the bra was closed would liked to have had a night cap.
Breakfast had everything you wanted and more the staff was so good clearing table ,topping up the coffee.",5,2022,01,31
121,Simply wonderful!,"From the point of arrival, everything was simply wonderful. Every single member of staff I encountered was very friendly and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. As a female, solo traveller, I felt very safe in the hotel and with the staff I encountered. The room was lovely and very clean. The breakfast options were great, with lots of variety. Definitely take notice of the advised busy periods and plan breakfast accordingly! I was lucky that I had planned on early starts anyway and didn't have to wait for a table to be free for me. Due to how busy my planned days were, I didn't give myself chance to have any other meals here or try out the spa facilities but I would absolutely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to try them out. The location is handy as you're within walking distance of Westminster Abbey, The Thames, Big Ben etc and very close to a tube station, if required. I would highly recommend this hotel to everybody! ",5,2022,01,31
121,Birthday celebrations,"Outstanding service from ALL the staff. 
We booked a Premium room which was fabulous cosy & very clean. They sent up a personalised cake and balloons foe which was a very nice touch. 
We used the spa facilities which were super too. 
Breakfast offered a wide range of dishes and we were offered other dishes for breakfast like masala dosas ….yum! 
Close by to the palace so we got to see the changing of the guards. Highly recommend this hotel for its luxury standard and impeccable service 10/10 from me",5,2022,01,31
121,A home away from home stay!,"I say this is a home away from home type hotel,however my home isn't as luxurious. I was upgraded to King Suite upon arrival which was a lovely surprise. The staff were all very polite and attentive throughout my stay. I called at 6am to request more water and they came within minutes.
I booked a massage at the Jiva Spa which was much needed. The spa facilities were well designed,intimate and clean with a modest sized vitality pool,sauna and steam room. However,the steam room was out of use during my stay which was a bit disappointing. 
The breakfast was wonderful hosted in the courtyard dining area and the room was well laid out with a buffet style breakfast. There is no a la carte menu however I was able to order masala dosa and idli from the kitchen which was delicious.

The hotel is placed in a quiet street from the hustle and bustle of Victoria St which was great for a good night sleep. Well located near Victoria Station,theatres,cinema and restaurants.
Definitely recommend it!",3,2022,01,30
121,"At James’ court, a gem of london","We have just returned from a 3 day stay at this hotel having not visited for 10 years and cannot fault it. Staff were courteous and couldn’t do enough for us. They are clearly highly trained in customer service. The hotel environment is luxurious and classical. We were upgraded to an executive king room and as it was both mine and my husbands birthday we arrived at our room to balloons, cakes and a card. Lovely personal touch. Breakfast is fantastic and on par with top 5 star international hotels. The new bar area was lovely with highly trained staff who took pride in explaining their new cocktail menu concept (which was fab) overall a wonderful stay. We will be back. Thank you!",5,2022,01,30
121,Will definitely come back,"My husband and I stayed last night for a trip for my birthday. We were lucky to be able to check in early and get our room upgraded. The aroma in the entire hotel and our room was lovely. The decor and styling was fantastic. The hidden courtyard was beautiful, and we had a really lovely breakfast this morning too. We also used the spa for a couples massage which was lovely. The under heated flooring was very nice. I would definitely go back",5,2022,01,29
121,Amazing,"This hotel is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The service, rooms and restaurant was 1st class. The hotel staff were very attentive without being intrusive! Breakfast was the best we have had in a very long time. Will definitely revisit when next in London without the Kids. Thank You All",5,2022,01,29
121,Heavenly Honeymoon,We had a quiet ceremony at Chelsea Old Town Hall and then checked into The Taj after a last minute booking directly with the hotel. From first phone call to final farewell we were made to feel so special. The ambience in the lobby is calm and welcoming and the beautiful scents help you to feel very far from the noisy London streets. Both rooms were kindly upgraded to Premium King which were stylish and luxurious. We visited the spa after breakfast and immediately drifted into another world- the dark calming sense of relaxation cannot be avoided as you slip into the beautiful plunge pool. One of the most luxurious stays.,5,2022,01,29
121,"Brilliant Hotel, near Buckingham Palace","The service at this hotel was AMAZING. Like all Taj Hotels, there is a heavy emphasis on the Indian theme, but i could not fault this hotel in any way. The staff were brilliant, very friendly, and couldn't have done any more to welcome us. The Room was very clean, tidy and spacious. The bathroom contained a rainfall shower, and was great. Room was cleaned daily. The breakfast contained a wide range of British and Indian breakfast, along with continental breakfast e.g. yoghurts, pastries, hams, etc.",5,2022,01,28
121,Fantastic stay,"Fantastic experience! Great and very warming stay. I’ll absolutely come back here next time in london!!!

Great people, cool rooms, amazing food, top notch breakfast, with very polite and work friendly environment.

It has really been a pleasure!",5,2022,01,28
121,Perfect hotel in an excellent location. Great staff.,"The service provided was genuinely excellent. Every member of stay contributed positively.
The overall hotel is a lovely place to be.
The room was superb & all the bathroom accessories we ideal.
The breakfast was spot on too. A great range & quality.",5,2022,01,28
121,Excellent hotel,"The staff are friendly and very helpful. The service provided was excellent. There is a good breakfast on offer and the staff will accommodate any special request. Rooms are also of high quality. The hotel is situated withing walking distance for visiting nearby attractions like Buckingham Palaces, West End and theatres. ",5,2022,01,27
121,Overall fantastic experience,"Great room, great service and experience in the restaurant inc the Italian host and the 2 Italian bar staff. All friendly and welcoming. Only thing I would have liked was longer opening hours in the spa, I didn't get a chance to use in the evening.",5,2022,01,27
121,Fabulous stay !,"What a beautiful well run hotel with nothing too much trouble for the lovely staff ! Room was really luxurious and well equipped and the lovely staff sent up some gorgeous chocolates and strawberries as a treat which were amazing ! 
Location of the hotel is excellent, just round the corner from Buckingham Palace and a short walk through green park to the tube station . 
Thank you for perfect stay and we will be back soon !",5,2022,01,26
121,"Wonderful hotel, an uplifting experience","Wonderful hotel, we have stayed here several times in recent years and it is always an uplifting experience. Helpful staff, great decor and atmosphere, quiet location yet close to transport links, shops etc. The room had beautiful decor, enough space and a very comfortable bed. Rooms are all set round an inner courtyard with a fountain. Newly added breakfast rook was lovely, and breakfast was excellent. Our hotel of choice in London. Highly recommended.",5,2022,01,25
121,A fabulous stay,"From the moment we were welcomed at the door to the moment we left, it was a pleasure to stay at the St James Court Hotel.
 It was a weekend away to celebrate my husband's birthday earlier in the week and we were delighted to receive an upgrade to a wonderful room.  There receptionist was very friendly and welcoming as were all the staff we encountered.
Our room was fabulous, so spacious, spotlessly clean and very well appointed - we didn't want to go out!  We had a great sleep in the very comfy bed and loved the Taj toiletries in the bathroom, it reminded us of all our Indian holidays!
Breakfast the next day was equally amazing with a huge selection of items, all beautifully presented and delicious, we really enjoyed it.
The hotel is in a great location and we would love to come back and stay longer next time.",5,2022,01,25
121,Great Hotel in a great location,"This is a great hotel situated round the corner form Buckingham Palace.  It’s a quiet hotel and nice if you want to chill out.

It’s a good walking distance from many attractions and also Knightsbridge 

The Jiva spa is good also some of the facilities were not on offer but you can still unwind.

I also wish the bar was functional as it would have been nice to sit at the bar in the evenings

The food was great I had room service and also ate at the TH @51.  I would describe the food as Indian fusion

The staff were superb and very accommodating",4,2022,01,25
121,Top Notch TAJ,"Having stayed here previously and loved it I booked again for a birthday celebration, we were upgraded to a suite and then further upgraded by Amin to a 2 roomed apartment which was beautiful, thank you .
Breakfast overlooking the courtyard is stunning , we would have loved to have used the spa before breakfast but as it didn’t open until 11am and we were on a tight schedule it wasn’t to be , we will be dining in your restaurant on 2nd February so will see you then and be back to stay with you again asap , thank you again",5,2022,01,24
121,Great stay 😊,"We has a great weekend break at St James Court.
Staff extremely friendly and professional.
We got an up grade and our room was lovely. Very clean and newly refurbished.
Will definitely stay here again 😊",5,2022,01,23
121,1st Class quality of Service and experience,"First visit to a Taj Hotel and I can’t say that I could be more impressed by the level of service, the quality of service and friendliness of all the staff. I could not recommend it highly enough and will return. My congratulations to how Tata develop their business and the ethos that is clear is core to staff behaviour. It started from the concierge to Frderica on reception! Well Done.",5,2022,01,23
121,Lovely but needs to be more sustainable!!,"We visited the hotel with my partners elderly parents and were wonderfully looked after, including an room upgrade! The hotel was beautiful, the staff friendly and really helpful and the food excellent. The one thing that would make me reluctant to return was the lack of obvious environmental considerations. There were plastic cups for water in the spa, and no signs in the bathrooms to indicate that towels will only be replaced if they are placed in the shower as many other hotels do to save water. The shower and hair products were all in single use plastic bottles instead of dispensers. I am sure there are things going on in the background but a luxurious experience should not come without consideration for the environmental impact.  Taj is a prestigious hotel chain and I feel should be leading the way in making the industry more sustainable!

Many thanks
Jo and Kevin Scarpe",4,2022,01,20
121,Wonderful Indian experience,"True to the brand, with a very warm welcome & accommodating staff.
Our rooms were both upgraded, for our niece’s special birthday treat…
It was a Great blend of Indian and traditional breakfast choices.
We will be back!  Planning our next stay soon…",5,2022,01,20
121,Perfect weekend break,"The Taj is a treasure in a tucked away part of Westminster that makes it a haven only minutes away from the London buzz. The hotel itself is gorgeous and classic and the staff are so friendly. The afternoon tea is perfect for vegetarians as there is no compromise on the attention to detail or flavour. But the breakfast for me was the highlight and I haven’t stopped thinking about it!!! Go and try it for yourself, you’ll know what I mean!",5,2022,01,20
121,Fantastic experience from start to finish,"Service and hotel facilities excellent.
Staff very friendly and helpful, service couldn't be better.
Breakfast was top quality both in terms of food and presentation.
Location of hotel was is great for accessing many London landmarks and tourist attractions.  Would definitely recommend the St James Court Hotel to anybody and would definitely look to stay there again.",5,2022,01,18
121,Great hotel at a great location,Our room was  very comfortable. The bed and linens were excellent and afforded a good night’s sleep. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The location of the hotel was both quiet and convenient. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be happy to return.,5,2022,01,17
121,Faultless hotel,"This was our "" must return""trip.  We   considered nowhere else when we planned my husband's birthday and retirement  celebration.  How right we were. The hotel  made such an effort to make his stay memorable.  The hotel is  beautiful, the food exquisite, the   cleanliness second to none  BUT once again it is the superb staff who deserve credit, without exception all were outstanding.  ",5,2022,01,16
121,Wah Taj,It was the perfect place to make our 'stay-cation' special. It was fantastic experience and made our anniversary and Christmas break memorable. the staff made special efforts and went above and beyond.,5,2022,01,10
121,Beautiful Hotel,"Easily the most attractive Hotel in London, stunning architecture,  fantastic service and superb dining facilities,  why stay anywhere else when in London, if you have not stayed here you are missing g out.",5,2022,01,09
121,Very well presented hotel in a fabulous location,"Location great for exploring London, staff very polite and attentive. Disappointed with the price of the mixer drinks at the bar. Cola mixers extortionate at £6 for a 50p bottle. We would have spent more at the bar had it been reasonable. However it is better to walk around the corner to the local Pub, much better pricing.
Overall it is a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay and explore central London.",4,2022,01,09
121,Absolutely wonderful,"Beautiful hotel near Buckingham Palace, convenient to tube stations and short walk to Westminster Abbey/Houses of Parliament. Staff were incredibly accommodating, courteous and professional, especially Duane, Amy, Federica & Anuja. There was an error with our booking (not the hotel’s fault) and Federica was very kind in helping us get it sorted.  The room was very clean & comfortable, and breakfast was very good with plenty of variety.",5,2022,01,08
121,Lovely Hotel,"Six of us enjoyed a few nights at the St James' Court Hotel and we had a super time.  We had the premium rooms and the hotel allocated to us a clutch of rooms together with its own secondary door.  Buckingham Palace is almost next door, as is St James' Park, which we think is the best of the Royal Parks,  and there was a military band playing and the Horse Guards parading.  Taxis to the West End cost about £12, which can be justified as one would pay double the price for a hotel of this quality of hotel in the West End.",5,2022,01,07
121,Lovely experience!,"Unbeatable location! Attentive staff! Great quality rooms!
I was impressed with the quality of the room.  The building is historic and the hotel is 4 stars then it won't affect the level of upgraded premium rooms.  Everyone was attentive and ready to assist.",5,2022,01,05
121,St Jame's Court New Year's Eve Stay,"This is the first time we have chosen Taj Group Hotel in UK.  An excellent location, well presented and very helpful and polite staff.  We were not sure what to expect because of our previous London hotel experiences have been average or poor with very small expensive rooms. We had an a spacious corner room overlooking the courtyard which was well decorated for the Christmas and New Year's Festival.  Surprisingly, it was not very busy.  Breakfast had a good variety of choices including to my surprise Indian dishes such as parathas and dosa.  Ambience was equally 5 star.  There were no surprises or disappointments, New Year's Eve fireworks in the courtyard was entertaining.  Quilon - the Michelin star restaurant was a small disappointment which only served tasting menu at £98.00 per person.  The beer prices could not be justified for its origin or quality.  On the vegetarian menu the staff missed out two dishes and chicken biryani was average.  However, when this was pointed out to the manager, they did apologise and made amends.  This in our opinion was a minor part of overall stay and we rate this hotel as one of the top 5 stars in London.  Will have no hesitation in booking again.",5,2022,01,05
121,Family Stay on New Year weekend,"We just finished a fantastic overnight stay at the Taj Hotel, with my wife and 2 young children. We booked a premium family room (one of the updated rooms) which was very spacious and comfortable. Very friendly staff and atmosphere in the hotel and lovely asian style breakfast and dinner - super location., for central london",5,2022,01,03
121,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at St James Court over Christmas. We were delighted with how well the staff took care of our every need. In particular, we're very grateful to Amin who was very professional and went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable. He helped us make sure our upgrade went smoothly too. We think he is an asset to the hotel. Also, special mention to one of the housekeeping staff Marjana who was among the most kindest, most friendly staff. She went above and beyond to provide me with extra bottles of water, toothpaste and anything else I should need. 
She was very professional and it was a delight to have her service my room. 
We will surely return soon!",5,2022,01,02
121,Top level quality,"There was a genuine feeling of high quality to our stay at the St James Court. Concierge and Reception were excellent, the room immaculate and room service delicious (if not cheap!). The breakfast is one of the best that I have experienced. 
Couldn't recommend it too highly!",5,2021,12,30
121,Staff was slow or completely non-responsive to requests.,"Staff did not handle simple requests for assistance, including the lack of heat in the room, the need for towels, or late check out times. A disappointing experience overall. Pleasant but incompetent desk and concierge staffing.",3,2021,12,30
121,Terrible service at the spa,"Sent my wife to the spa for a massage, confirmed the appointment date/time more than once, yet they were still scrambling for a treatment room 45mins AFTER the scheduled start time (still scrambling as I write this!!).  Hotel reception sound helpless.

You would think that, given the pandemic and hence relatively low occupancy, they would be able to look after their guests to a basic, acceptable standard, but alas no!",1,2021,12,30
121,Like being with family,"I had to book an unexpected 4 night stay in December due to family members getting covid. Needless to say, it was a stressful time for me. The staff at this hotel were so welcoming, accommodating and attentive that I felt like I was with family. This is especially true for Amin who asked after my family through my stay. 

The hotel itself is beautiful and clean with great facilities. I used the gym, vitality pool, sauna, restaurant, lounge and bar and the service at each was consistently great. The quality of the food for breakfast & room service was fantastic and very tasty. 

I booked a Classic Double which is the base category room and it was spacious & well equipped. When I commented that the view wasn’t great, they let me look at two other rooms to see if I would like to change. I concluded that although the views were better in the others, it was quieter in the one I had so stuck with it & slept soundly each night. 

Overall, I have enjoyed staying here so much that I plan to make it a regular getaway through the year. 

I feel sad to be leaving!",5,2021,12,28
121,Amazing Christmas Break,"This was our Christmas break and we couldn’t have picked a better hotel which is very authentic. The staff were the highlight of our stay they couldn’t do enough for us especially Exette,Shuanha and Gondzalos they are a credit to A Taj. Our Christmas dinner was amazing  and the hotel was immaculately clean we would highly recommend this hotel to family and friends. We will be definitely going back …thank you all for an amazing Christmas break. :)",5,2021,12,28
121,The service and accommodations at this hotel were stellar - it was such a pleasant stay!,I will definitely stay at this hotel next time I'm in in London. Each member of the staff was helpful and delightful. The hotel is beautiful and the room was very comfortable and clean. The location is central and an easy taxi ride or walk to everywhere we wanted to go. This hotel is a treasure!,5,2021,12,27
121,Last working trip of 2021,"Stayed at the St James' Court in Dec for 10 night and felt completely at home. Being a relatively long working trip, I  chose the Executive studio which provided me with more room. In general, you would find the rooms of a larger size here as compared to other London hotels - which is good as was working quite a bit from the room. 
Breakfast was a wide spread of cold and hot dishes, with the usual English breakfast served. Being a Taj hotel, you also got good Indian breakfast alternatives, which is a excellent. Looking forward to coming back.",5,2021,12,25
121,VERY RECOMMENDED!!,"I had coronation malai chicken the other day and it was absolutely the best one. The chicken was really juicy and the gravy tastes so good! I recommend you guys to eat the crispy naan with the malai chicken as the combination of both would make you feel like wanting to lick the plate! For the cocktail, the el camino was just fine and the taste of tequila was quite strong. So, it’s not recommended for those who dont really like tequila taste. Whilst the sunscreen on was nice, it’s so refreshing and fruity. For the dessert, the Apple Mouse was okay, not too bad but the Chocolate Mousse was really good!! 

The staff were amazing and helpful! the service was also superb!! please go to this place, absolutely wouldn’t disappoint you!",5,2021,12,21
121,TH51,I went to have lunch with my friends at the new restaurant and I enjoyed most of the food! The interior is so instagrammable! And the view by the window is so cool! Loved the coronation malai chicken with naan so much!!!!! The BEST combo! The bao baji and calamari is amazing too! All staffs were friendly and thank you ankit for helping us with the menu recommendation! Will definitely come again and bring all of my family and friends from Hong Kong! Thank you Zetty and Gonsalo for introducing the restaurant! Will share this to everyone!,5,2021,12,21
121,Not a good experience,"The bed was very hard and I could feel the springs. I made a complaint so they added one layer on the top of the mattress, which was ok but not comfortable. Also, Heater was not working in the room the first night. 

On the other hand, concierge and the reception staff was friendly and helpful but the overall experience was not good",2,2021,12,21
121,Hotel staff were lovely,"With exception of the staff that looked after the spa and swimming area - our stay was brilliant. Everyone was so helpful and polite and very cheerful. Hotel and room was nice and clean and we felt quite save especially given the current Covid climate here in the uk at the moment. Would have been nice if they had sanitising stations in or by the lifts but not a deal breaker as we carry our own. The staff at the spa were unwelcoming and unhelpful which put us off spending any more than an hour there which was a shame. However overall stay was lovely - it’s in the quieter side of London and we found some nice quiet pubs to end the evening in, and a lovely Italian down the road, with its very own authentic nonna. Close to the tube and other sites, but without the crowded noise streets of the central city.",4,2021,12,20
121,Absolutely Amazing!,"Stayed here for my Daughter's 21st Birthday whilst visiting London for the weekend.  The Staff are amazing and they all went out of their way to look after us.  Balloons and cake in the room were awaiting our arrival.  Breakfast the next morning she was sang ""Happy Birthday"" with more cake and Champagne.  The Taj was such a beautiful 5* Hotel with gorgeous rooms, and surroundings, and very clean.  Thank for you making our stay a special memorable one, which we will never forget.  Thank you so much and we will be retuning again definitely.",5,2021,12,20
121,Pre Christmas Shopping Visit,"Lovely hotel in a nice location, near St James Park and Knightsbridge for shopping. Refurbished rooms are immaculate and courtyard breakfast orangerie is lovely for breakfast. Some areas of hotel are slightly dated however this seems to be under renovations.",4,2021,12,16
121,Taj - First class as ever,Nice to be back at the Taj. I have been away for 5 long years and it was brilliant to be back. Despite COVID the Taj spirit remains and nice to be back. The service was first class and nothing was ever too much. You must be proud of what you do and I look forward to be back again soon.,5,2021,12,15
121,Great service and excellent room,We had a really wonderful experience. Enjoyed the Indian breakfast and the Michelin starred restaurant next door. Rimoh at the Bar was also very attentive and helpful; he went out of his way to provide us with great service. We appreciated his attentiveness a lot!,5,2021,12,14
121,Superb Stay,"Hotel of highest quality.
Covid protocols followed by all working staff.
New restaurant TH@51 will soon become widely  known as the food was sensational.
Jiva Spa once again delivered on its promises thanks to highly trained yet sympathetic staff.
Location is just 600 yards from Buckingham Palace, so is an ideal location for accessing most of the top attractions.
Check in / out very smooth.",5,2021,12,14
121,Lovely stay,"I love this hotel so much, first time we stayed was back in July and it was great then this time it was even better we were so well looked after and the attention to detail is just exceptional all the staff are so friendly! The food is also really good cocktails are great too. We can’t wait to come again. Feels like coming home and as soon as you sit in the courtyard it just feels like the stress melts away and you could forget you’re in central london",5,2021,12,14
121,Mr Dean Shearing,"Hotel was really nice. The check in and check out was very smooth. The hotel reception areas, Bar and rooms are all really nicely decorated and well maintained.  The only slight complaint was the bar staff made a few mistakes with our orders. Vodka and tonics minus the vodka and tried to charge me twice?",4,2021,12,14
121,Nice hotel,"The only thing I can fault was the breakfast. The food wasn’t hot by the time you got back to your place it was cold. Need to heat the food up properly. The room was very nice only the shower in the bath let it down not strong enough but was very hot water which was nice. 
The biggest tv I’ve seen in a bedroom.",4,2021,12,14
121,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here last weekend. The hotel is central with plenty of restaurants shops and bars nearby. Not far from Buckingham place and Westminster.
The staff were excellent The hotel very clean. My only criticism is that the help yourself breakfast was cold every morning. More a fault of the way it was kept than the staff themselves, who were courteous and eager to help.",5,2021,12,13
121,Very expensive for what it is,The building is beautiful and so is the location.  The breakfast is amazing however the room is quite small for an executive room.  The view is nothing apart from someone's window and extract fan.  No swimming pool.  I have paid less to stay at the Shard with everything I need and want.,3,2021,12,13
121,Tired…,"This is the list of issue we encountered over our ten night stay: 
Furnace did not work, was response and repair were quick. Very noisy from the residence up stairs - poor sound proofing. Water leak from ceiling in washroom, response was quick. Room mini-fridge did not work, never resolved. Random music playing in the court yard very early in the morning - computer system issues unresolved… turn it off?? 

Clearly from these issues it appears that this hotel is tired and needs significant renovation. The staff however were very attentive and courteous, trying to make due with a tired facility",2,2021,12,11
121,Amazing,"Amazing rooms, and service
Overall an incredible experience - the only negative was a slight delay in bar service.
From check in to check out - all amazing
my only surprise it is not a 5 star hotel - as, it was better than most in london",5,2021,12,07
121,A couple of nights next to the palace,"Great hotel and perfect service with a surprising good breakfast in the heart of London. 
I would have loved to stay at the newer parts of it but still it was overall a very nice experience.  The gym is also fine and I used it a couple of times.",5,2021,12,07
121,Lovely staff lovely stay.,"No complaints whatsoever, the staff were smily helpful and accommodating, breakfast was lovely and location was convenient. Overall a great experience. If one thing I can add, their salad for the inroom dining was a small portion in comparison to what we received in other hotels. Other than that, it takes an A from me.",5,2021,12,07
121,Overcharged and ignored!,"I have contacted the Hotel at least 5 times in the past week, with only one response 2 days ago, promising a rectification by accounting for a whole night overcharge, plus different rate chargers for the 2 nights: I stayed in the same room. Being charged for a night that you didn't even stay, then bizarre charging on the nights you did stay, in addition to one's correspondence being ignored has left a bad taste and a fruitless hit to my wallet. Would not recommend, will not stay again, and will dispute to charges when I return to my country of origin.",1,2021,12,07
121,Good But could do Better,"The Hotel is in a great position, the staff are generally very friendly BUT during our brief stay I have two issues that left me less than impressed.
1. The bar closed at 23:00 on a Saturday night - I was told they ""did not have a licence"" however would serve drink in the room. Clearly not true but  a hotel imposed 'policy'. Many people arrived for a drink around their closing time and even though 23:00 is not 'late' for a central London hotel they would not relent. I think a number of people were (like us) less than impressed. 
2. We book a table for 21:30 in the Bistro (we had chggecked that it served food until 23:00) Very slow service, so much so that the staff were clearing up around us, even though it took an hour to get our starter served!  they started to clear up at 22:00 giving us a very unwelcome feeling. 
3. Whilst this did not effect me, as we left breakfast on Sunday morning the queue was huge and waiting times must have been extensive. Not my problem but not a good omen.",3,2021,12,06
121,Pigeon corpses in my window!,"Such a disappointment for a executive suite!
Not Clean room!
Terrible view !
Mediocre breakfast!
Not worth the money I spent!
At the front desk despite asking for a better view they gave us a terrible room that saw dead pigeons hanging on a net.
The lady at the reception even tried and showed us a worse room!
We chose this hotel cos of the courtyard view and had nothing!
Such a big disappointment!",1,2021,12,06
121,Deserves a fifth star,"We are nearly at the end of our stay and must comment on how impressed we are with this hotel and the staff. From Leo the doorman to Marcos the Porter, Guillaume the concierge and especially the duty manager Sunaina we have had our expectations exceeded. They are welcoming and very professional as well as friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make a stay enjoyable and memorable. The new restaurant called TH is exceptional and Anna gave us a friendly tour being especially engaging with our son. The hotel is incredibly well located for sightseeing and for the visiting tourist. This place is a jewel in the crown. Highly recommended from a seasoned traveller and now with a toddler.",5,2021,12,06
121,Amazing Stay,Yet another amazing stay at the Taj. We stay here everytime we come to London. Amin (the manager) was splendid and helpful. I can never fault any of the staff members on any of our stays. They are always willing to go out of their way. The rooms were just as expected and catered for all of our needs too.,5,2021,12,05
121,Anniversary weekend,"My 3rd visit to this hotel and this speaks for itself in the standard of the hotel. They are welcoming and provide high standard of service. The breakfast was amazing and we loved the masala chai and masala omelette. Our room was extremely comfortable and with no noise disturbing us and the blackout curtains were great! The team were sweet enough to send us a cake for our anniversary. 

It was definitely busier than my last stay and I don't know if this had a slight impact on the service. We had to remind the staff on two occasions our room needed cleaning when we arrived back at 6pm on our first night. On our 2nd night, I needed a plaster and we called room service and they said someone would come straight away but no one came. On our 3rd day, my contact lens case had gone missing from our room after a clean. Taj is known not to miss these small things and I hope these can be improved. It was sad the pool was out of service on the last day of our stay.",4,2021,12,04
121,Overrated Terrible Hotel,"Overrated, miserable experience. Very badly managed hotel. Please don’t fall for flashy pictures as advertised. Basic Indian food is also not available here. Unprofessional and extremely rude staff. This is a very nice heritage property but extremely mismanaged.",1,2021,12,03
121,Fantastic stay,This is the first time we have come here and we're not disappointed. Came for one night only for our wedding anniversary and to have afternoon tea at Kona restaurant. We even had a cake in our room with Happy Anniversary message! Hotel room was lovely had a great night sleep. Staff were so nice and helpful. Great selection for breakfast. Will definitely be  coming back. Shout out to Amin on reception he was very helpful and informative. Great location too!,5,2021,11,28
121,Excellent all round,Excellent all round .. from location to room size and Amenities to service and food and breakfast and concierge service - all very courteous and efficient and tasteful.  Check in was painless as was checkout ..the room was clean and well laid out and large and overlooked the garden . The bathroom worked,4,2021,11,28
121,You need a fork? Pls pay £5,"Awful customer service for the price.
They never pick up the phone, had no reliable internet, did not provide room cleaning services, AND the best part was, they wanted to charge £5 for a fork!
And when we asked to talk to the manager to explain this brilliant policy, we were ignored and they did not call back.
Net net, an impressive waste of money on sub-par accomodation.
",1,2021,11,27
121,THANK YOU GAGAN,"Most comfortable and luxury rooms, world class customer service.

Thank you Mr Gagan Sharma for making my wife's birthday such a memorable one.
All the arrangements were spot on, from concierge to room service. Everyone is super friendly and helpful.

My little one loved all the arrangements and Taj Goodies.

Once again thank to Gagan and his dream team for flawless customer service as always.

One of the best hotels in London, like they say to feel the Tajness one has to experience this Atleast once",5,2021,11,25
121,Trip to London for my husband's birthday,"The hotel is in a fantastic location making all tourist attractions amenable.  The staff were friendly and attentive. The premium deluxe room we stayed in was modern and luxurious. Our lovely room, great staff and complimentary surprise for my husband's birthday ensured we had a fantastic trip to London.",4,2021,11,25
121,Average and not really welcoming,"Good property, but the old section need to be upgraded. The new breakfast area is great. 
Rooms size is exceptional, hotel lobby need to be looked after. Stuff is friendly, but they all new.

Location is very convenient, and green park is near by for good morning walk and run.",3,2021,11,21
121,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is our home away from home I. London. We are treated like family and always with big smiles and friendly faces. Any issues are quickly and efficiently dealt with. Everywhere is very clean, all Covid precautions being met. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable. Special mention must go to the Restaurant manager, Gonsalo, and all round gentleman, who always goes above and beyond in his service to customers.",5,2021,11,20
121,It won’t be my last visit,"Booked last minute for one night, pleased with the cost with an upgrade to an Exec King Room. Well appointed with all our needs met and very clean

Taj, your bedding is divine, which made for an excellent night of sleep. Although we had to wait a few minutes for breakfast, we got a lovely table near the courtyard, fantastic choice available to suit all tastes, if I get the chance to visit again it will be a Dosa!",5,2021,11,20
121,Comfortable and caring,"Room was very comfortable, staff were very attentive, excellent service and the food was delicious!!!  Beds were extremely comfortable, best nights sleep away from home I’ve had I think. Thank you for enjoyable stay",5,2021,11,20
121,"Nice hotel, but far from center but very well connected","Nice hotel beside Buckingham Palace, walking distance to the Victoria line. Good overall experience, just disappointed as they continue using small plastic amenities but then they give you paper straws with that drinks, big contradiction. Most of the big hotel  branches going green with refill amenities to don’t waste. Hope soon they will implement this.",4,2021,11,18
121,18th Birthday Family Stay,"What an amazing hotel!!! Every single aspect was spot on!! 

The ambiance, the setting , the cleanliness... 

The room was so lovely and we had a free upgrade to a studio (much appreciated )

The spa was amazing , really relaxing 

I would like to emphasize that the staff were supa  fantastic and extremely polite and friendly.

I would completely recommend and will be returning",5,2021,11,16
121,Great Service,"The hotel looks fab and the service is outstanding, it was very clean too.  The only parts that let it down was that our TV kept switching itself off, it happened about 8 times which was quite annoying in the middle of a good film. Also the breakfast was really tasty but the beans and bacon were cold.

However the room service was amazing and the burger and fries from there was well worth the money. 

I would stay here again.",4,2021,11,16
121,Disappointing Experience,We booked a suite with a fold up bed for our 16 year old daughter. To say this temporary bed was uncomfortable is an understatement-could literally feel every spring. Our bed very firm and could have one with a mattress topper. After a bad night’s sleep we looked forward to a hotel breakfast but no room in the restaurant so had to go for breakfast in the bar. This hotel needs better management and some targeted basic investment.,3,2021,11,14
121,The place to stay in London,"This extraordinary place is going to treat you like royalty. 
For any reason you travel may be, family, business or anything else; ths is  the place you want to be.
The location is just fantastic , steps away from Buckingham palace and from there anywhere you want to see.
The rooms are just amazing , does not matter what you book because from the simple one to the must sophisticated you will enjoy it.
The whole atmosphere is just fantastic. 
Start your day with the amazing breakfast att the Hampton . Everything is so fresh and beautiful display, just love it.
Dont forget to stop at the Hampton Bar have one of their cocktail and take something from the menú. Everything is just great!
I want to thanks and acknowledge Chef Vinod, Sahaina, Maria and the amazing Gonzalo for such an outstanding Job. You guys are definitely the face of Taj. Congratulations.",5,2021,11,10
121,Everything was superb!,"Super stay from start to finish
Beautiful hotel
Fab location
Polite helpful staff
Felt safe (ref covid)
Beautifully clean including daily housekeeping
Good choice for breakfast

Will definitely be our new choice when visiting London again- thank you",5,2021,11,09
121,Wonderful London hotel!,The St. James Court Taj Hotel is a great location in London - so close to Buckingham Palace and beautiful St. James Park. We had no trouble getting around the city from the hotel - either using the metro or walking. The hotel staff were amazingly attentive and helpful. We arrived mid-morning after a long international flight from the US and they were able to check us in immediately for a minimal additional charge. We greatly appreciated the ability to go to our room upon arrival. Complimentary breakfast was lovely - a wonderful assortment of breakfast options and service was top notch. The lobby bar was a great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing and exploring. I highly recommend this London hotel!,5,2021,11,08
121,Terrible stay!,"Booked Taj in anticipation for an exciting, long due holiday in London.
Stayed for 12 nights. Hopeless service! Failed on all aspects - room service, food, hotel upkeep. 
Sad to witness Taj's spirit abate due to poor management. Never going to visit again.
",1,2021,11,08
121,Perfect from arrival to departure - fabulous experience!,"Everything was fantastic from start to finish. Location, staff and hotel 110%. Can’t wait to visit again! 
A five star experience - staff were so friendly especially Anna. 
Rooms fabulous - all sky channels available and very comfortable.  Will definitely book again.",5,2021,11,08
121,Autumn Trip 2021,"Perfect for a Central London weekend stay.

Walked to British museum, Covent garden, Lancaster gate through the St James Park & Hyde park.

Hot breakfast of Poha was wonderful on a cold November morning. A lemon wedge was missing 🍋 

Will be back to dine in Quilon. 

The heating in the room & bathroom needs to be serviced.",5,2021,11,08
121,Tajness? Not really!,"What a drastic drop in service levels since our last stay in November 2019! We love staying at Taj hotels everywhere, but this is the last time we'll be at THIS hotel! Our room rate included breakfast, and we were quite shocked when we were told that for a dosa we have to pay extra! If you can't offer a simple dosa in a breakfast buffet which includes Indian options, please, drop that 'Tajness' tag. 

Most of the staff can't speak proper English, the Indian food at Bistro was not at all up to Taj standards, and the room was a shoebox. The only saving grace was the service extended by the young ladies at breakfast. While passing by the front office on our way to breakfast, we overheard an Indian couple voice the exact same opinion to the staff, mentioning how they too found the service and quality of stay far inferior compared to other Taj hotels. Never again at this one, that's for sure!",2,2021,11,08
121,Mr Yash Gupta,"My stay was comfortable but would have loved if there was more Indian Veg breakfast options. Taj Indian hospitality is present at the hotel which is lovely.

Room 613 Bathroom Speaker was not working and LED lights used to blink sometimes. Pl get this checked.",4,2021,11,05
121,"Surroundings, staff and service all excellent.","Surroundings, service and staff all excellent. An oasis in the heart of London. We were in a renovated room with contemporary colours and decor. Couldn’t fault it. Beautiful marble bathroom and modern amenities. Particularly liked the charging points on each side of the bed, the zNespresso machine and the high class toiletries.",5,2021,11,03
121,Jam packed visit to London,"Brilliant hotel centrally placed behind Buckingham Palace. Extremely friendly and helpful staff, all of who speak fluent English which helps, they can’t do enough for you.
The rooms are lovely, lots of amenities available, including robes,slippers, razors, toothpaste in fact everything that you could need for an overnight stay.",5,2021,11,02
121,Strong Recommend!,"This was my first Taj Hotel and certainly won't be my last. If I could have given 4.5 stars I would have. Lovely hotel, nice room (we stayed in a premium room which, although small, was very nice), decent gym, nice spa, great breakfast and everyone I encountered couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. It felt like very good value considering the location and how much you would pay for another hotel of this category in a similar area.

The only reason this isn't a 5/5 review was that we were charged £5 for a bucket of ice to be delivered to our room which annoyed quite a lot. Perhaps it is more of a standard practice than I realised but i've never encountered it before.

Other than that, we had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2021,11,02
121,They withheld deposit money paid for room. Keep promising that it will be refunded it’s been over 2 weeks.,"I had no issues with this hotel on my exit, I gave them excellent reviews on booking.com however since leaving I’ve had to chase them for nearly 3 WEEKS for the £50 deposit they took for them room. I have ended up paying over £300 for room that was only meant to be £250. I work in the NHS for modest pay and this is totally unacceptable, it’s so wrong that they are withholding people’s finances. The customer service team doesn’t seem to care any less and keep saying it ‘has been requested’ but they are waiting on the bank.. 3 WEEKS later. 
I’m debating contacting the fraud team to get my money back :( 
Would never stay here again",1,2021,11,02
121,Beautiful hotel in a quiet location,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break on a bed and breakfast basis.  The room was nice but the water pressure on the shower was very poor.  The breakfast was adequate but I'm not a fan of self service hot food, I would have expected a variety of table service options at such an establishment.  We ate in the bistro one of the evenings which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The staff were very pleasant and attentive.",5,2021,11,01
121,Great first time experience in the UK,For this to be my first time in the UK the Taj started my experience off with  5 stars. The customer service is awesome and the rooms were fantastic.  The food  and drinks were fantastic. The staff were absolutely phenomenal.,5,2021,11,01
121,A beautiful escape in Central London,"This hotel without a doubt is one of the best I’ve stayed in, in London.
From the moment you walk-in the staff are already taking the bags out of your hands and do all they can for you. The deco is grand as you’d expect at a Taj hotel, beautiful and inviting. 
The hotel has a warm feeling, something that sometimes lacks in a hotel like this; having visited the Taj in Mumbai,  this hotel is so relaxed with a sophisticated energy floating around. 
Federica checked me in, and the room was ready at 1pm which was amazing! We were upgraded to a room in the new part of the hotel and it was just expectional.

The spa facilities are of the highest spec, beautiful and perfect tranquility. Thank
You to the staff in the spa and especially to Olga and Sylvia; the massage was out of this world! 

All the staff went above and beyond for us and I can’t thank them enough,",5,2021,10,31
121,Simply Excellent,"I'd previously stayed at 51 Buckingham Court (Taj's flagship 5-star hotel in London) 3 times, but this was my first experience with St. James' Court.

I've got to say I was super impressed with everything from start to finish. I was given a large room in the newly renovated portion of the building overlooking the beautiful courtyard. (FYI in case you're ordering, the courtyard here is the real deal, not like courtyards at other hotels where you're looking at a brick wall and the HVAC.)

I checked in here after several disappointing nights at the Waldorf and couldn't have been more pleased. The staff were friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Room was serviced every day by housekeeping despite COVID protocols being in place, which was not the case at the similarly 4-starred Waldorf. Honestly, I don't understand why St. James' Court has 4 stars and 51 Buckingham has 5. This was every bit as good and a superb value.

I'll be returning to London in December for a long weekend and am looking forward to another stay at St. James' Court. It may just be my new favorite London hotel.

My one complaint (and it's not a small one) is with Taj itself. I find their website unintuitive and cumbersome, and occasionally non-functional. Their customer service is also extremely slow to respond and often requests the same information multiple times, which delays a resolution by days or weeks. I have this same problem when I stay at the Pierre in New York. The company is clearly geared toward their Indian and Asian customers and not optimized for Americans or Europeans. But I won't hold this against the hotel itself. They're top notch.",5,2021,10,31
121,Not an expected experience from Taj,"Bit of an unpleasant experience at Taj this time. It felt like hotel staff were struggling to get the things completed and couldn't able pay much attention to the guests.
1. Slow checkin process
2. Always busy service phone numbers
3. Took 45 mins to get water bottles
4. Not fully cleaned room
5. Poor breakfast set-up & service",2,2021,10,31
121,A wonderful hotel,"We booked a family room with two double beds during October half term. Room was very spacious and exceptionally clean. Beds were comfortable, which made an excellent night’s sleep for all of us. Breakfast service on both days was great and the service was wonderful, nothing was too much trouble. This hotel has been a brilliant find for us. We loved the fact that it’s situated on a quiet road, but in an excellent, central location. Will definitely return again and will make this our preferred choice of hotel when in London.",5,2021,10,31
121,Great location,"Great hotel and location. However, the walls are quite thin as we could heard lots of noise and a man snored next to the room to us. The housekeeping did not replenish the toiletries and towels consistently.  Breakfast was good and wish they have more options to order.",5,2021,10,29
121,A very comfortable and enjoyable stay.,"The staff were amazing especially Ifeani (I think that was his name, a Nigerian chap) the doorman and Lakshmi the waitress. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them. The room was spacious and very comfortable. We appreciated the little touches such as the water bottles. We enjoyed the spa but were a little disappointed that the steam room wasn't working. The only negative comment I have to make was that on our first morning we had to wait in a queue for about 20 minutes for breakfast which wasn't a great start to the day. I have a bad back and standing for any length of time does tend to aggravate it. Thankfully on our second morning we were able to go straight in to a table. The food overall was amazing as was the service.",4,2021,10,29
121,"Nice, clean, good location but breakfast hit and miss and overcharged on credit card","Nice, clean hotel in good location. Breakfast was very standard and a hit and miss. Ordered an omelet at 10:10 but did not appear until after 10:30. By that time the entire buffet was gone!! The offered me some bacon but it spoiled my breakfast.
My credit card was charged with the hotel stay PLUS the security deposit. After calling up they said this was normal practice and the security deposit will be refunded. I never had this in any other hotel. Just a wrong practice.",3,2021,10,28
121,St james court hotel Taj,"On arrival was able to check in 1 hour early, room upgrade as well
Whole experience was 1st class, ensure your up early for breakfast as both days there was a queue and a small 15 minute wait for a table 
Highly recommended the jasmine Indian tea as a twist compared to English afternoon tea.",5,2021,10,27
121,Great location and excellent service,"Great location and excellent service. The staff were extremely helpful and interested in you. The breakfast was particularly good and being able order eggs just as you like them, if you didn’t want scrambled from the buffet, at no extra charge was perfect. The conservatory  where we ate breakfast was open, bright and looking into the lovely courtyard. Would definitely stay again",4,2021,10,25
121,"Really great hotel, nice people and great location off the usual beat","Really great hotel, nice people and great location off the usual beat but connected to everywhere in London. Never got chance to try the restaurants however if it's like the rest of the hotel & service I'm sure it will be great.",4,2021,10,25
121,Great rooms and great staff,Great value for the experience provided.   Our room was clean and well furnished.  The service was outstanding  we did dine at the bar the evening we arrived and the food and drinks were very good.   We will stay again.,5,2021,10,24
121,"Elegant luxury hotel, with fantastic service.","Spacious elegant family suite. Excellent service and beautiful facilities. Breakfast was vast and fresh, with the additional bonus of Indian dishes on offer with the usual British hot breakfast. 
Very close to theatres and attractions.",5,2021,10,24
121,Elegant hotel,"Tucked away on a quiet street ,this is  a grand period hotel with a charming courtyard. It has character and old world charm but thankfully hasn't been 'modernised' to cold, clinical minimalism one finds in a lot of hotels these days. The Taj brand is renowned for its service and this hotel did not disappoint in that respect. Everyone from the concierge, the front desk to the bar staff were friendly and very well trained. My room on the 7th floor was clean, luxurious , a little small but the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast , dinner and drinks were first class. There is a mall gym on site and a Spa . It's a stone throw from Buckingham palace and near St James Tube station. I will be staying again",5,2021,10,23
121,Hidden Gem,"I stayed at this hotel last week, was surprised at finding such a beautiful hotel hidden away. The service was great and room was excellent. The staff were very helpful. I will definitely stay here again.",4,2021,10,22
121,Punches well above its weight,"We spent three nights at this hotel, and were consistently surprised at how good an experience we had.  It's not a boutique hotel, and it's not trendy.  However, they tend to details as well as any hotel, and it's an extraordinarily good value:
Check in was smooth, and when we mentioned that the first room was not to our liking they gracefully switched us.
Our room was spacious, light filled and had everything we needed; toiletries, a desk with multiple electrical outlets including US, a luggage tray, and more.  Coffee machine in room, and two packets of shortbread cookies upon arrival.
Complimentary breakfast was outstanding; both buffet and a la carte (including several Indian dishes.), service excellent.
Central location, walk everywhere.
We would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2021,10,21
121,Fantastic stay,"I booked this stay for my mother’s birthday, and the staff left a lovely dessert in our room to wish her a happy birthday! The executive king room was a great size, the bed was large and very comfy. The breakfast was absolutely delicious with lots of options, and the staff were extremely attentive and friendly. A gorgeous hotel and in a lovely location 5 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, and just under 30 minutes to Carnaby and Regents Street.",5,2021,10,21
121,A nice stay,"We had a wonderful stay at St. James.

The staff were Polite, Courteous, Helpful and Professional and always with a smile.

Our breakfast was a wonderful way to start the day,  We were served every day by Stella  who was very Polite and Courteous while serving us.

We had delicious Dinner at Bistro, We were very well looked after by Ivonio on our first visit and by Anushka and Ayala on our second. The Rogan Josh was delicious, missed eating it with Naan which is not on the menu.",5,2021,10,20
121,Excellent just room awful,"Make sure you upgrade your room. Otherwise you’ll get a room that you can feel and hear the trains and have 1 plug socket in the whole room. 

Their saving grace is an excellent location, staff are friendly, spa area is awesome, great treatments. Just they really need to “upgrade” their rooms. Single glazing on the windows allows too much noise to come in. Shame, wouldn’t recommend due to the room issues, very poor sleep. Advised staff, they said they don’t get complaints about the trains, I feel they do just don’t want to have a scene about it.",3,2021,10,19
121,great stay/great location,"excellent service all around, great location to explore the city.  all employees were great especially the concierge (i forgot his name - Giorleme?)
only the bathroom showerhead was not to my liking, otherwise great stay",5,2021,10,18
121,A very Taj experience,"We booked a Premium Junior Suite Courtyard View at St James’ Court for a mini foodie break, and they very kindly gave us an upgrade to a corner suite on check in. It’s a beautiful building, and the renovated room was lovely, but the lobby area is cramped for a hotel of this standing.

Overall, it was a great stay, although breakfast was a bit disappointing. The space was too small for the number of guests, and the staff were up against it trying to keep the tables clear and at the same time provide the required service. Maybe they’re struggling to recruit at the moment - everywhere has the same problem.

Quilon was excellent without being outstanding. 

Afternoon tea at Kona was excellent too - we left with doggie bags for the train ride home.

The hotel offers a 10% discount for guests on food & bev, but this doesn’t extend to Quilon and Kona which are run as separate units. So nothing was included apart from our after-dinner drinks in the bar, making the whole deal pretty pointless!",4,2021,10,18
121,Really nice hotel. Great location,"Really nice hotel. Great location. Staff very helpful and attentive.
Room could have been cleaner. Had marks or splashes of something up wardrobe doors.  
At breakfast seated next to where dirty plates etc bought which wasn’t that great. Only stayed 2 nights so not worth complaining about",4,2021,10,18
121,Beautiful green courtyard,"Renovated rooms are wonderful, well designed, well laid out and spacious.  The hotel courtyard is a beautiful open space on the heart of London.  The only drawback is the dates lobby and the poor access to the new wing, which I certainly hope the management will update.  Service levels are not very high, though check in team is very friendly and helpful.",5,2021,10,17
121,My new favorite London hotel,"A fantastic central London hotel. Staff are friendly and professional. Rooms are new and clean. Tech is new. Bathrooms are large and clean. You can even enjoy light piano music in the bar in the afternoon. Breakfast was busy, so arrive early, but was good. There is a certain Indian ambiance, so take a chance and enjoy some Indian dishes in addition to the full or continental breakfast.",5,2021,10,17
121,St James Court Hotel Exceptional Hotel,"From our arrival at the steps of the hotel to check out or stay was absolutely first class. The greeting by door staff was warm and friendly, check in was a breeze starting with an upgraded room, complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby whilst our room was inspected. The room was perfect and throughout our stay every interaction with the staff was without exception perfection. Nothing was ever too much trouble. This was our second visit and won’t be our last simply this is now our go to place when staying in London.",5,2021,10,17
121,Good hotel - strange policies,"The bar closes at 10:30 pm, no rooom service and minibar is empty. It pretends to be a luxury hotel catering to anglo al clientele. People are jetlagged, have long days, having a bar close at 10:30 pm is ine thing (at the end of covid restrictions) but then either provide room service or stock up the minibar in the room. Nothing, zilch, nada. I find this ridiculous for a place that charges between £250-300 a night for the base room.",3,2021,10,15
121,Disappointing for a luxury London hotel,"I requested a twin room when I booked as my daughter and I were sharing.  I booked a Premier room and on check-in I was told no twin room available.  The receptionist resolved this by “upgrading” us to a family room with two double beds, but the room was not a premier room and it was dark and drab with old worn furniture and had a musty smell - very disappointing.  The breakfast was a buffet and very mediocre.  The morning after check-out I realised I had left my expensive ghd hair straighteners in the room and phoned and spoke to the Head of Housekeeping who said they had not been found!  I asked her to speak directly to the room cleaner but have heard nothing more.  It is obvious to me that they have been stolen by a member of the cleaning staff and this response is not what I expect from a 5 star hotel.  I stayed in the Taj Residence the week before and the whole experience there was far superior.",2,2021,10,14
121,Mrs,Loved our stay from start to finish.  Fantastic hotel & staff.  Wonderful food & drinks.  In an excellent location within walking distance of many of the main tourist attractions.  Would return in a heartbeat.,5,2021,10,14
121,Excellent,"Excellent and professional service. The room was immaculate, check-in was smooth and efficient, our room was not ready, but we arrived early, but our bags were delivered to our rooms when we came back later on in the day. The breakfast was hectic on the weekend and was slightly cool, but on Monday the restaurant had fully opened as this had been closed, and it was a different experience.",5,2021,10,13
121,Lovely,"We loved it, the service was great, the room was lovely. The breakfast was amazing. Great location as well, it was nice to go for a walk to Buckingham Palace which was less than a couple minutes walk. A lovely and peaceful stay, I would definitely visit again.",5,2021,10,12
121,Service with a smile,"We stayed for 3 nights. The room amenities were very good but what raised this hotel above the average hotel was the level of service from the staff
They were so friendly and helpful that it felt like staying with friends
The spa was great too",5,2021,10,12
121,Extraordinary hospitality,"Truly extraordinary experience

We visited St James’s Court Hotel once again, since we had brilliant experience few months ago 

Once again we had an amazing experience particularly from Duty Manager Desmond, Maria from In house dining and Reception staff Valerica, Nauhar and Miriana.

This place caters to all our requirements and i would strongly recommend it for its extraordinary hospitality. 

Thank you once again",5,2021,10,09
121,Very nice stay at the St  James Court. The service was very good and the food excellent.,"I thought the service was very good, everyone was extremely attentive and things were done very quickly. We had lunch which was very good, then tea at our meeting and then dinner which was delicious.  The service in the restaurant in the evening was particularly good. I would definitely stay there again when next in London.",5,2021,10,09
121,Perfect Central London Hotel - Highly Recommended,"We had an excellent stay at the hotel. We were only in London for a few nights so wanted something central and easy to get anywhere, and this hotel was perfect as it is only a short few minute walk from the St James Park underground station and less than five minutes to Buckingham Palace. It is in a beautiful building and the Taj quality of service was exceptional from the moment we entered the hotel. We were working so made use of the business centre which was excellent as the room was too small for both of us on our computers. We unfortunately ran out of time to use the gym and vitality pool, but the facilities looked fantastic. The room was quite small on level 7, but it did the job and made for a very comfortable stay. We would definitely come back in the future and highly recommend the hotel!",5,2021,10,08
121,A home away from home in the heart of London.,"Our 4 dat stay at St James’s was relaxing and enjoyable. Despite the fact that it overlapped with the London Marathon which meant very long queues for breakfast and for the 2 elevators in the lobby, the staff tried their level best to look after the guests and manage the situation. 
My visit to the Taj was nostalgic. I have stayed at the hotel regularly as a Pilot with Air-India and am glad that despite the upgrades, the core of the Taj Group (its wonderful people ) are still the greatest assets.
I was unable to find the room I needed on the Taj website and so had to use an alternate internet room provider.
The room was comfortable and well appointed. We did have a few hiccups in being unable to reach housekeeping reception or room service from the room phone but the staff promised to have it looked into.
The F & B outlets had a good selection and great service. 
The Concierge and doormen were welcoming, ever helpful and attentive.

We had a great trip and look forward to visiting the Taj St James again very soon.",5,2021,10,08
121,City visit,"Firstly the staff were just fab, so friendly & ready to help at all times, special mention to Stella & Ciara. We were upgraded as a special treat as my husband was celebrating his birthday. The room was lovely, comfortable bed & spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was very good. Location was brill, it was on a nice quiet street but close to everything.",5,2021,10,06
121,Admirable,"Hotel located at the heart of city, close to Victoria underground, Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square. Many places to walk around. An admirable architecture and decoration offering comfortable rooms. Staff truly polite and helpful.",4,2021,10,06
121,Excellent as always,"Tajness is a word that seems to cover every aspect of staying at the Taj.
We had a lovely time there last year and decided due to Covid and staycations to stay there again. 
From the time we stepped onto the pavement outside, we were escorted to a world of luxury, encompassing kindness, thoughtfulness and an overwhelming desire to please. There are many luxury hotels in London but there is only one Taj.
The porters who took our luggage, a very heavy one in my case (due to the fact that I had decided to take an entire library with me ) to the Bistro staff ,everyone was wonderfully accommodating. I could not find fault in any member of staff ,even a slight mix up with our booking which meant we couldn't have the room we wanted was forgotten as the room we were given instead was very nice. 
Little touches that made our stay so pleasant were added every,for example I was a little poorly one day, had a back ache, I asked for a hot water bottle. Even though it took lots of searching on their part, housekeeping found me one.
Chocolates and cakes were often waiting for us after a day out and on our last day the staff at the Bistro made us a lovely breakfast of Idli Sambhal ,my favourite and so very kind of them.
I have a very long list of names of people to thank and will attempt to name as many as I noted down but apologise if I have missed anyone.

I would like to thank in order of when we met them:
The porters - Leo, Adam and Ife 
Reception staff
Ciara,Olivier,Anwesha,Beata, Valerica,Duane,Iona, Mariana and Nourhan
Bistro staff
Maria,Vaishev Kumar,Anoushka, Heera, Harsh, Simonas, Nitesh and the Chefs Raj Raha and Gibsson under the very capable hands of assistant manager Gonsala and Hostess Kristine who always greeted us with a smile.
Also Tracy and all the delghtful staff at the Hamptons who always dealt with our requests for glasses,cutlery and plates without hesitation. 
There are probably many many more I have missed but I would like to thank each and everyone one of you,from management to cleaning staff for making our stay so memorable and utterly delightful. 
I shall be returning again to celebrate my husbands birthday in December as both he and I wouldn't stay anywhere else",5,2021,10,05
121,Birthday Celebrations,"Booked as part of my wife’s 40th birthday celebrations. Grateful for the free upgrade on arrival. Room (esp the bed) was v comfortable. Service was excellent, free drinks and slice of cake were a nice touch.",5,2021,10,05
121,"Gracious surroundings and charming service, just slightly marred by staff shortages","In many ways this was the typical Taj high quality experience: a beautiful building and unfailingly courteous and helpful staff. Like many hotels at the moment (Covid, Brexit) there are staff shortages, which meant some waiting to check in and a queue for breakfast, but the staff did their best to keep us informed and provided drinks while we waited. Breakfast was very good when we eventually got a table in the bar. Our suite was very well appointed and clean. I had, perhaps mistakenly, thought I'd seen a reference to 'panoramic views' and was a bit disappointed to find our windows on the 7th floor were frosted! As I say, though, maybe my mistake.",4,2021,10,03
121,Excellent Stay and Service.,"Loved the stay 10/10 for this hotel, nothing was too much and very attentive staff. Great location (on the door step of Buckingham Palace), and great transport links. Lovely quiet spa area, facilities were also 👍🏽, the room was the biggest I've seen in London at a very reasonable rate, the manager upgraded my room because I was celebrating, I thought this was an amazing touch from the hotel and I will definitely be coming back for a second stay.",5,2021,10,03
121,Excellent room but hotel lacking in service and freshly squeezed orange juice!,"It all started so well! Our first impressions of St James' Court London were positive when presented with a beautiful building upon arrival. Once past the excellent door staff we checked in at reception and sadly all wasn't as you would expect of a Hotel of its location and nightly tariff.
 I was advised that a member of staff would locate our bags and bring them to our room. I expressed my urgency to the staff that I had a meeting to attend but found that our bags weren’t delivered for another 40 mins despite a call to reception. Subsequently I had to rearrange one of my meetings for the day.

An evening to relax, after dinner at an excellent restaurant with lovely company we returned to further disappointment that the bar had closed at 11pm. No drinks or food could be offered via room service with no explanation, I assume that the hotel was short on waiting staff. We were advised that a short walk beyond the hotel we could find a bar that was still serving until late.
Unfortunately the stay did not improve from a service perspective the following morning with cold full English Breakfast and a request at the hotel bar for freshly squeezed orange juice before we checked out met with a blank expression and an offer of concentrated orange juice from a bottle. Sadly ten minutes passed without any drinks we decided to check out and promptly visited the café across the road, finally were able to enjoy a very pleasant freshly squeezed orange juice!

121,Poor,"On arrival we went to make a cup of tea and found some black slim in the bottom of the kettle.
Reported this to reception and they apologised and came back with a new kettle and offered to leave some more tea bags which were out of date in July. It’s cost £990 for our stay and we expected better and this was only In the first hour.",1,2021,10,01
121,Good hotel with a great location and great staff,"I had a nice stay at Taj. The only thing is that when I arrived, late evening, the clim was on and the room was freezing cold. I got sick afterwards and it took me a good 2 hours to get the room back to a decent temperature. Was in an executive room, old style, old furniture, but comfortable. The chair by the desk was not comfortable and too old.",4,2021,09,30
121,Perfect Weekend,"The Taj was booked as a gift for Kirsty’s 50th birthday along with Chelsea Flower Show tickets.
The location was perfect and first impressions and greetings from the door staff were excellent.
The receptionist was so friendly and genuinely interested in our weekend plans and even upgraded us as a further treat.
The room, cleanliness, lay out and comfort was amazing.
Every interaction with staff was polite and friendly and all were a credit to the Taj.
Breakfast was amazing with superb service and drinks in the courtyard by the fountain with a peaceful ambience capped off our stay.
We will recommend the Taj to anyone travelling to London from North East and hope to repeat our experience again some time.
Well done to all at the Taj x",5,2021,09,28
121,Mrs Amanda Guthrie,"Amazing hotel, luxurious surroundings, wonderful food, friendly and professional staff.
Have never slept in a bed like it, sooo comfortable.
The hotel’s courtyard is beautiful and peaceful.
Great location, 8 minute walk from Buckingham palace.
Would not want to stay anywhere else.",5,2021,09,28
121,Comfortable stay in a good location,"Nice hotel and area - very close to Buckingham Palace and to St James Underground with access to Circle/District. Buffet breakfast good (Harshill, waiter at breakfast, particularly good/efficient/attentive). Room was spacious, clean and well appointed, including a fridge to use. All in all, a nice place to stay. Would stay there again.",5,2021,09,28
121,Lovely vVsit at St. James Court,"We needed help with quite a few things, from a sore knee to help with visiting famous places. Everyone went out of their way to help us have an enjoyable visit. The food was delicious, also. We would definitely come back!",5,2021,09,27
121,Lack of leadership,In our family stay at 10 pm in the night maintenance technician rang the bell and came in to fix a toilet leak in another room below our room. This is atrocious. They have no business to send maintenance folks at 10 pm in the night especially when just women were staying in this room. A big safety concern. On top of this the duty manager or front office did not respond to any calls for over 30 minutes. Horrible nightmare experience,1,2021,09,27
121,A break away . Escape to peace and ambience.,From the entrance to your room. The whole place breathes peace and comfort. Breakfast is very good. Spacey dining room area. Many staff. Courtyard is a grand oasis for drinks and relaxation.sadly the service charges are too high.  Otherwise it is superb.,5,2021,09,25
121,21st birthday,"Our family visited London for 21st birthday celebrations. When visiting London we always stay at st James court , why would we ever want to stay anywhere else!

We will be back soon st James court!",5,2021,09,25
121,"Very convenient location, close to everything that you need including a friendly laundrette. Friendly and helpful hotel.","I had a 3 week plus stay in the Executive King room which was very comfortable, the first week was for self quarantine purpose and all meals were provided. Food was excellent! Everyone in the hotel was friendly from the concierge to the reception to the room dining. Every morning, I am well received with a good morning when I order my breakfast to the room. I am used to drinking lots of water and was very happy when housekeeping gave me whatever number of bottles that I requested for. Special thanks to Guillaume from the Concierge who went all out to help me when I had trouble with ordering the Uber gift card for my daughter. Binoy from Concierge was very friendly and always asked if everything was OK when he saw me. All the staff who sent food to my room were very courteous and I only managed to get one name, Steven, as there were too many of them to remember. All in all, my stay at the St James Court hotel was really a nice and memorable one. I have no complaints at all. I should say well done to all the hotel staff. :)",5,2021,09,23

121,Wonderful long stay at the hotel,"Dear Mehrnavaz,
Thank you and your team Naveen, Sunaina, Binoy, Aman, the entire kitchen, IRD, housekeeping (apologies if i have missed out anyone) for making our 5 week long stay so memorable at The St.James Court Hotel London. It was undoubtedly your personal involvement which catered to our individual requirements throughout our stay. Looking forward to coming back soon to enjoy your hospitality again.
Warm regards,
Rahul",5,2021,09,20
121,It does the job but it is not great,"Bottom Line:  I tried several Taj Hotels around the world and this one is well below the ones I tried in Dubai and in India. 
 
The good:
The rate was pretty competitive for London and the hotel is in a beautiful historical building near Buckingham Palace.  The room was ok and the bathroom was fine but very simple. There was a Nespresso machine in the room.
The hotel is about 10 min walk from St James Park tube station. 
The front desk and concierge are good and efficient.
This is the good part.  The rest is well below expectation:
Internet is too weak. Come on we are in 2021!!
I gave my shirt to the laundry and they forgot to bring it back. 
I gave my pants to the seamstress and she was supposed to do the job by 12noon but I got my pants back at 7pm.
Somebody, very noisy, was video conferencing next to me at the restaurant and nobody asked her to be quieter or to go somewhere else (I had to tell the Management about this matter)
Each time they refilled coffee in my room, it was decaf coffee.  It asked for normal coffee and they still brought me decaf coffee.
Other issues:
The hotel needs a makeover.  The carpets should have been changed years ago.  Look at the photo I posted of the carpet!
There is no cigar smoking room except outside!
 
The list is not exhaustive but such a low quality of service gives a poor impression of the Taj brand.
 
I may try it again as they realised they screwed up and proposed an upgrade for next time.",5,2021,09,20
121,Great hotel in a great location,"Another fabulous stay at this great hotel .We were surprised with a room upgrade in the refurbished part of the hotel .Gorgeous room and bathroom , a comfortable bed and - the silkiest cotton bed linen l have ever seen in any hotel! Where do they get those sheets from? ! 
Staff excellent as usual , it feels like a home from home and we always stay here when we have a weekend in London .",5,2021,09,19
121,Excellent,"Great position for sight seeing
Beautifully presented hotel with fantastic service across the team.
There were super facilities in our room which was serviced and replenished daily.
Breakfast offered a good choice.
The dinner menu in the Bistro offers choice and was very well presented and flavoursome.
Hampton bar staff we good and there was comfortable seating both inside and out in the extensive Courtyard.
Happy to recommend.  This will be my go to hotel fir future.",5,2021,09,16
121,HIgh class hotel in exceptional London Location,"This hotel is exceptional in quality and price especially because of its prime location just a block away from Buckingham palace and Hyde Park.
The staff is extremely helpful and we had our son and his family stay as well and it was perfect having young children so close to the main sights in London.",5,2021,09,16
121,Best in class hospitality!!!,"Home away from home, excellent property, excellent services and above all excellent people!!! 

Excellent food, with Taj Chamber services openning, it's going to be one of the best business hotels in London!!",5,2021,09,16
121,Great hotel but some things can be improved,"I stayed at this hotel for one night as part of the NHS discount offer. The offer was amazing, a couple of hotels in london are currently offering great discounts for NHS staff. 

The breakfast was amazing especially the paratha. However, there wasn’t much hot food option. They did ask what other egg you wanted and we ordered a masala egg which was amazing but it’s not displayed. The breakfast area got really busy after 8.30, we came down at 8.15 which was just perfect timing. There were massive queues for breakfast so make sure to go super early. The service at breakfast was great as staff would come and collect plates immediately. 

The courtyard in the hotel is beautiful but they have a very small menu and only there chicken is halal so not many options left. The somosas chaat is great and just to make people aware of it the service  charge is £7 which seems to be normal in london. You pay for everything at check out which I did really like-  I wasn’t aware of this beforehand. 

The spa was great, we were given lots of slippers and robes, the pool area was very small and I did expect it to be a bit bigger. I don’t think more then 10 people could relax in there properly. I wanted a massage but was told they are fully booked. The lady her name behind with flore was very helpful- very sweet. I wish the spa opened a little earlier because check out is at 12 and spa open at 11. Although, I should mention the hotel did offer a complimentary late check out so at 13:00 rather then 12:00 but we didn’t do it as we would not have had enough time. 

Upon arrival we were told that we were upgraded to an executive suite, we were so excited. The room was great but very very small. I would call it an executive suite size, the bed and air con were amazing and so were the amenities but the room size was tiny and we didn’t have any view from out window instead our view was of another rooms window- was disappointed about that. 

Before checking in I did request for anything special for my husband as he had a promotion and also it was my birthday the week after and was told I would be provided with a slice of cake or something. We checked in and there was nothing there so I had to call and ask- the reception staff didn’t know about it but later on they did provide me a muffin which was great. 

Overall, the hotel is great but not the ones we have been to abroad, I think the size of room definitely was a big let down. The room was smaller then a studio apartment and had bugs/ flies. My husband had to kill some moths on the wall as well but we didn’t want to go reception and complain for such things so kept quiet and dealt with it for the night. The air conditioner was amazing.",4,2021,09,13
121,Lovely friendly hotel,Lovely friendly hotel very nice breakfast and the lovely night Porter that brought us extra milk and tea bags for my mother and I after sightseeing and theatre all day. Well situated for Victoria train and tubes walking distance to Buckingham Palace,5,2021,09,12
121,Our new London hotel,"Visited London plenty of times over the last decade, but never had a hotel stay quite as pleasant as this one. The staff were all fantastic and greeted you by name whenever they saw you which i thought was a wonderful touch. The rooms were impeccable, spotless and roomy, and the staff couldnt do enough to make sure your stay was comfortable (even down to delivering the types of nespresso pod i asked for).

A particularly big thank you to Valerica, who made check in particularly pleasant and fast, and upon finding out we were visiting for my birthday allowed an early check in so we could shower before heading out.

I usually only use trip advisor to whine about issues with places, so the fact ive felt compelled to come leave a glowing review should speak for itself.

Thank you for a wonderful stay and we will be back very soon!",5,2021,09,12
121,"Wonderful, relaxing stay.","Hotel is nice only to be excelled by its staff, nothing is too much for them. Breakfast best of both worlds - Indian and continental. Indian food is authentic Indian and portions are of a generous size.",5,2021,09,12
121,Family visit / stay,"Family stay during holiday weekend in august 
Service levels and staff support were not up to the levels expected 

frankly the hotel could not cope with basic service required during stay. Felt like I was in the cast for a episode of faulty towers. 

Huge disconnect on service for such a hotel. I did receive helpful service in some areas restaurant manager and backup service personnel Manning phones and did raise concerns with duty manager (responded 2 day later). 

felt I had more faith in ordering a pizza with better customer care and attention than the offering at this great hotel. I normally do not write reviews but feel due to Panademic and other factors service in some basic areas housekeeping and room service are an issue.",1,2021,09,10
121,Nice rooms. Good staff. Give it a try.,Worth a visit. Easy hotel. Decent service. Willing staff. Nice refurbed rooms. Cosy bar to relax in. Lovely staff. Good location. Nothing too much trouble. Lacking a bath in our room. Bistro not great. Overpriced and lacking ambiance. Good brekkie! Try it.,4,2021,09,10
121,Very pleasant stay,"Lovely room. Plenty of room with quality fixtures and fittings and tea/coffee and fridge facilities
Staff super pleasant and polite and extremely helpful. Hotel has a wide range of facilities including a top notch spa, pool and gym facilities. Right on top of St James/Victoria/Buckingham palace area with great dining options in hotel and close by.",5,2021,09,10
121,Taj,"Excellent hotel, great location. Attended a party at the hotel which was very well organised. The reception, garden cafe and bistro staff was brilliantl. Cocktails and food was excellent. Overall, a lovely experience both the times",5,2021,09,10
121,AMAZING Hotel and staff,"This is a wonderful hotel with the lovely friendly staff in a very good location within walking distance to all the best bits of central London. The actual location is quiet but just a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and 10 mins to Trafalgar square and a few minutes longer into Leicester Square and Soho. The rooms are big and spacious and with good quality fittings and furniture and appliances and plenty of sockets for electronic gadgets. We stayed 2 nights and liked it so much I have taken out Inner Circle membership with intention to stay there regularly throughout the year on mini breaks. The only problem was the terrible queueing for breakfast. Saturday morning was ok and we got a table quickly enough but Sunday morning was bad and we had to wait 2 hrs before we could get a table. This needs to be addressed. If we go again then we will have breakfast somewhere outside the hotel. Breakfast itself, at the hotel was decent but not the largest choice buffet I've ever seen but all the essentials were there and additional cooked items could be ordered. Despite the breakfast let down, it's the location, staff and the actual quality premises and accommodation that will bring me back here again.",5,2021,09,10
121,"Came for the brand, didnt deliver the experience. Alright!","The service at breakfast was poor. Servers were busy , but confused, directionless.
Asked me for the cooked option, my preference needed to be checked with the chef... which apparently needed more than 30 minutes that we were there for.
Brought it up with the manager at the end of our waiting period. He took our take away coffee orders and after waiting for another 5 minutes and a reminder- got it wrong. We didnt want to lose our morning waiting, so just left.
Apart from that, had issues with the air conditioning late night where we couldnt get the room warm.. a 'porter' was sent who seemed to be seeing the system first time, who we just requested to leave in the end and sorted it on our own.
Expected better from a Lux hotel!",3,2021,09,10
121,"Lovely comfy, clean and friendly place to stay","Amazing place to stay, room was clean and tidy. The hotel itself is lovely and the staff are very friendly and professional.
The food that we ate in the courtyard was delicious and reasonably priced. Shops and bars are just round the corner which we're also very nice. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,09,10
121,"Fantastic Stay, Exceptional Customer Service",Incredible Staff who catered to our every need. They went above and beyond to make sure we had an enjoyable stay. Beautiful rooms and highly recommend a drink in the courtyard too. Would most certainly return here.,5,2021,09,10
121,Exquisite,"It's hard to find the words to do this hotel justice as nothing seems to be enough. 

Before our visit I had requested some champagne  in our room as a surprise for my partner's birthday and they kindly added a surprise treat bought to our room as well which really made her feel special. I'm so so grateful  for the extra efforts to make the celebrations start with such excitement. 

As soon as you walk in your greeted by the friendliest most helpful staff.

I commented to my partner how it felt like we had already been there, like coming home, being greeted by people you had already met. Comfortable, safe and welcoming. 

The hotel itself is beautiful. I found myself saying ""wow"" a whole lot.

Our room (Premium King) was so comfortable and huge!  We hardly wanted to leave it, with a view of the courtyard, a bed so big you can get lost in and pillows we wanted to take home. Everything was just perfect. 

Breakfast  the next morning was all delicious and staff were, again, very welcoming and kind. Check out at noon is the absolute  best idea as it meant we didn't have to rush off and could check out feeling as if you'd just finished the last bite of your favourite meal. Full, content and happy.

We then ventured to the courtyard for a relaxing lunch and drinks. Our waitress was lovely and so happy it really set the tone for the afternoon, she couldn't do enough for us. The meals we delicious and sitting in the warmth of one of the hottest days, by the water fountain taking everything in felt like we were in another country on holiday. Since things have been up in the air for sometime due to the little issue of a pandemic this trip was exactly what we needed and we are both so grateful for everyone making it such a special time. 

We're  certainly going to be coming back, sooner rather than later.",5,2021,09,08
121,Awful service,Good location and the spa was a nice treat. However the service from start to finish was not good enough. Either the staff looked clueless or didn't care. Service was slow in the bar area and there was no help from the reception when trying to check in. Wouldn't go back,1,2021,09,07
121,Lovely stay but some minor improvements needed,"I booked this Hotel for our 11 year wedding anniversary as we missed our 10 year celebrations. 
We arrived and we were able to check in early and they upgraded us as it was a special stay for us. 
We also had a lovely surprise anniversary cup cake waiting for us in our room. 
Th service on check in/check out and the drinks we had serviced to us in the court yard and bar was brilliant. 
The only thing that let them down was the breakfast, we were seated in the bar area and the buffet was in a little side room. There was one 2 slice toaster and along wait to toast some toast, not sure for such a big hotel this is succient enough?. The buffet was not kept an eye on and ran out of beans and mushrooms, had to wait quite a while to have that stocked back up and no condiments, no glasses or orange juice out or stocked up. I had to raise their attention to all this. This was not what I expected as the rest of the service was brilliant. 
Need to look at the breakfast seating and service, not sure why they don't use the number of big restaurants they have on site to seat a larger amount of guests and staff can concentrate in one area, seems they were running from bar to bistro trying to keep up.

121,At home in London,"Having been wowed by two Taj  Palace hotels in Udaipur and Mumbai we were curious to experience the Taj hotel in London. 

Our first visit was a brief business stay in July. On that occasion I had the pleasure of meeting Sunaina from the front office who warmly welcomed me ( my husband arrived later) and allocated a Premium room for us.  We loved the decor of the room - fresh and contemporary / excellent set up for the wardrobe  which had shelving, drawers  and a variety of practical  hangers. The bathroom design is top notch, with space to place things and an excellent illuminated magnified mirror. The lighting design in the bedroom is excellent ( thoughtful bedside reading lights and side light options. Fridge and good tea /coffee set up with shortbread. Comfortable  bed. Luggage rack.  The video playing on the TV explaining the ethos and heritage of the Taj group is engaging and absolutely beautifully shot! I watched it several times! 

The opening times of the spa/ vitality pool are currently 11am to 7:30pm. Having an interview to attend I thought that I would miss out, but then my interview was cancelled and I was able to experience the sauna, pool and wonderfully warm relaxation area.  The pool is definitely for those who‘s aim is serenity and relaxation - ( perfect for me) . Not set up for serious lengths swimmers! They are careful to  refer to it as a vitality pool rather than swimming pool though to manage one’s expectations! Changing area is well equipped with digital lockers, beauty amenities, spacious showers with good pressure and dyson hairdryers! I think there are dedicated times when children are able to use the pool so do be sure to check with staff if you are bringing younger family members.  

We only ate breakfast at the hotel on that occasion. The restaurant was busy and as the reception team knew I had another interview to attend that morning, they kindly arranged breakfast in Kona at the sister property ( 51 Buckingham Gate) across the courtyard. This was incredibly thoughtful and took the pressure off. I had been nervous that I might be late in departing. 

On the basis of our positive stay back in July, I decided this would be the perfect venue to treat my husband to a belated birthday celebration.
Sunaina and Desmond were incredibly helpful and responsive when I contacted the front office directly to explain the occasion and plan a few surprises. We were again very warmly  welcomed with a glass of Prosecco and a lovely conversation with Sunsina . 

She had very generously upgraded our booking and we stayed in a Family suite room 156 ( This consisted of a sitting room with 2 seat sofa, chair desk, Fridge Coffee/tea corner and guest WC, leading on to en-suite bedroom with dressing table. It was brilliant to have so much space, however there was staining to the carpet near the entry door and marks on the seat of he sofa. Two things I definitely missed in this suite ( that were present in the premium king room We stayed on our first visit) were a full length mirror and  back of door hook in the bathroom. 

We spent the day relaxing, used  the pool and  headed to the bar in the evening for a drink and some bar food. The cocktails we ordered ( Manhattan and a tequila based twist on an espresso martini were both excellent!)  The food we ordered  ( chicken bao,samosa, truffle fries) was extremely tasty and generous portions - representing good value. A pianist arrived to play at around 8:15pm which was a beautiful accompaniment and created a lovely atmosphere. ( I will mention though that the piped music prior was too quiet and the atmosphere seemed a little ‘flat’ prior to arrival of the pianist).

I had requested a decorated cheesecake which they organised to be placed in the room on the evening of our stay along with my husband‘s favourite IPA. This was absolutely beautiful, decorated with berries and tasted delicious! Thanks so much to the chef who created it!  There was a have written card from Sunaina and her team- such a kind, thoughtful touch.

We ordered a room service breakfast - full English (has streaky bacon which was tough- perhaps the hotel could consider using a premium back bacon?) 
I opted for the Mediterranean which was  lovely ( Grilled Halloumi with vegetables - it doesn’t come with egg though so I would order that as an extra next time). The croissant were lovely. The big disappointment though was the toast - I was shocked that this was very basic quality thin mass catering bread.  Not at all in line with the high standards of the hotel. I’d urge the hotel to review this  as a priority and consider offering an artisan thicker sliced bloomer/ choice of white/multi grain/ rye from a local baker?

Sunaina really made our stay, checked in with us to make sure all was to our liking and even offered an late departure ( so kind- unfortunately my husband had planned to visit his family and  I had to head to work so couldn’t take this up!) 

We can’t wait to visit again soon for our anniversary! 

Thanks to the whole team. Your warmth and genuine hospitality have made us embrace St James Court as our ‘ home in London’.",5,2021,09,05
121,5 star service from a non 5 star hotel.,"Arriving at the Taj we were greeted by a warm experience. The doorman welcomed us, opened the door and immediately took our luggage. At the reception desk we were met by friendly and welcoming staff. One member of staff in particular, who we had met on our previous visit was Sunaina. She checked us in. She upgraded our room which was so kind of her and the hotel, she had our bags sent to our room and offered us Prosecco to celebrate my 50th birthday. 
Our room upgrade was amazing. It was a family suite. It had a separate living space with a sofa bed, two arm chairs and nesting tables and also a large screen TV (55"").  It also had a separate wc which is really useful. The bed was very comfortable. I like beds that are soft and make you feel like you are floating. This was very close to that. Another TV. Built in Vanity desk with stool, beautiful en-suite with a bath. Shower was a dual rain dish and independent shower head. Enough space in both the room and bathroom to store closes and toiletries. 

We ate in the bar in the evening. We had the small dishes. Portions were generous and food was delicious. Waiting staff were really attentive and knowledgeable. The bar had a pianist who played varying music which kept the mood. He was happy to have photos taken while playing.

Staff generally very friendly and always greeted us with hello, good mornings/evenings from bar staff, to the cleaning staff. None of this seemed false. 

The hotel is immaculately clean and comfortable.

This hotel gives a 5 star service, without being a 5 star hotel...it should be a 5 star hotel. ",5,2021,09,05
121,Lovely overnight stay,"We had a very enjoyable stay, very comfortable room, delicious breakfast. The staff were very helpful and couteous, in particular Beata on the reception desk.  Excellent location for sightseeing, and overall very good value for money for this area of London",5,2021,09,04
121,Good Taj property ,"Have visited a few Taj  mainly India, and thus if you've been to the Taj Mahal Mumbai the bar is set high. Saying that, this place offers great Taj hospitality which you don't often see in London hotels unless 5*+.

As an Inner Circle member was upgraded on arrival which was appreciated. Room was one of the refurbished ones towards the rear and is well equipped. Liked the spacious bathroom/shower however internal room space was a little limited despite upgrade suggesting a 'king suite'.

Breakfast was good with, at time, social distancing in place. Suggest getting there early unless you book it in your room as it got bus

One point. Unable to grab a late drink at bar to rear of reception as it shuts at 11 00 which was a little disappointing. However, on leaving to get tube from Victoria wife and myself both offered free umbrellas for the walk as it was raining heavily  - nice touch.

Overall a good stay. I'd be happy to visit here again as it is well placed for business or leisure.",4,2021,09,03
121,Good but short of amazing,"This stay will always be special as it was just after getting married. However, some things really bothered me. 
After booking, I called up to notify the hotel that we will be checking in late as we will be coming after our wedding and celebrations and I guess I was hoping that we would be offered something a little special but I quickly realised that would not be the case! So I outright asked what they could do and was told about (expensive) rose petals which I would have normally thought would be added as a bit of a surprise from the hotel following the conversation. None the less check in was ok. 
We had the ability to have breakfast in our suite which worked out amazing on our first morning as we were so tired however finding out what was available was a little tough and the selection downstairs in the restaurant was much better 
I had booked massages before hand and the experience was great up until we were leaving and the receptionist at the spa asked us about tips right infront of the masseuse ... this was pretty damn awkward and felt like we were forced to tip - I couldn't believe it as I've never been put in that position - very unprofessional 
We also had to ask for our sheets to be changed as the first clean seemed a little rushed 
There were a few other things and I think I just had very high expectations and it was a little underwhelming at times however it will always be memorable ",4,2021,09,01
121,Beautiful and Extremely Relaxing Feb 2020,"Beautiful and extremely relaxing.
From Start to finish, the staff member Daiga gave me a warm welcome and was very helpful and informative, the staff at the Bar and in the Bistro restaurant, not to mention the Spa rooms, all made my stay a wonderful and very memorable experience. Thank you. I will definitely come again and recommend St James Court A Taj Hotel to all my friends and family.",5,2021,08,28
121,"Absolutely, fabulous hotel!","My husband and I recently booked at The Taj Hotel, St James' Court to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From start to finish, all the staff were super attuned to providing us with a great experience. They were so attentive - we even got a room upgrade and a cute cake with macaroon was waiting for us in our room when we returned from our day out. This was followed by Prosecco for breakfast! Once again, thank you so much for making our stay so memorable and special!  
A special shout out to Nourhan, who was such a sweetheart and got the ball rolling to spoil us during our stay at The Taj! 
We shall most definitely return and hoping to visit your sister hotel during our stay in India (once we get there!).",5,2021,08,28
121,Amazing hotel experience.,"We stayed here for a night when going to see Hamilton which was just a 5 minute walk away. From the second we walked in until we left it was the best hotel experience, every member of staff was so courteous and friendly, the hotel was beautiful, the room was lovely and the breakfast was excellent. The location was great for sight-seeing. We will definitely book again and highly recommend staying here.",5,2021,08,28
121,Mini break,"I have just had two nights staying here with my daughter as a treat as we hadn't seen each other for two years. The hotel was in a perfect location for visiting lots of areas. A very comfortable hotel and staff really helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. We had two spa treatments  and very relaxing treatments; the staff made us feel very welcome and at ease.
Rooms very comfortable,spacious and lovely pillows and soft towels. 
I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay their again.",5,2021,08,27
121,Amazing hotel,Me and my family stayed here for 2 nights it was fantastic the staff are so nice and helpful would definitely stay here again not far walk to everything the breakfast was great as well cannot fault this hotel.,5,2021,08,27
121,Third review and still as good!,"I’ve reviewed this hotel in the past but this was my first visit after an 18 month hiatus thanks to Covid so I was curious to see if there were any changes. Whatever I saw were only positive - a refurbished central courtyard, sanitiser stations everywhere, masked staff, room service breakfast as part of the package, etc. What has not changed are the good things - the warmth of the staff, the willingness to serve, the concierge noticing I was walking in pain and after learning about my bad back sending ice packs to the room! Also Naveen Sikka’s warm and friendly greetings in the lobby as the Front of House Manager and his solicitous concern for my well-being. But for me the high point is always the Java Spa and my regular masseuse Maria. Her touch is magic and she never shied away from putting in real effort for my deep tissue massages. This time my wife too had the pleasure of Maria’s treatment, not once but twice and she was convinced that she’d found her heaven! If nothing else then Maria and Jiva Spa alone will keep bringing us back to the St. James’s Court Hotel! Keep up the great work Team Taj!",5,2021,08,27
121,Attentive from start to finish,"Great service and atmosphere, worth the visit, they said they upgraded me but I got the room that I booked, Ordered room service but had to wait to see if the chef was still there, (Info says room service until 11pm, I ordered at 10.30",5,2021,08,26
121,"Excellent - first class service, facilities and location","Wonderful three day stay. Impeccable service from arrival to departure. A real testament to management and staff at all levels that they manage this when so many places are struggling to maintain standards. Lovely rooms, many with views of the delightful courtyard. Everything feels new and clean, yet classic. Full breakfast buffet, properly cooked and nicely presented, with an Indian option too. Unless you request otherwise, your room will be fully serviced and complimentary toiletries, tea/coffee etc replaced as needed: the Taj isn't using Covid as an excuse to cut back. Fantastic location too, right around the corner from Buckingham Palace and Victoria.",5,2021,08,24
121,"Exceptional hotel, with great facilities, service, location and ambience","Flawless - one of the best hotels I've stayed at. The service from the off was first class, nothing was too much.

The moment we checked in it was a whimsical experience and everything is positioned to delight guests. ",5,2021,08,24
121,Perfection,"From the moment we walked into the hotel, the staff are on hand to look after you and make you feel special.  we were greeted at reception will a warm and friendly welcome and a special thats to Sunaina & Beata for making our stay so perfect!
The room was beautiful and spaceous and the restaurant & courtyard very classy & welcoming.
The Spa facilities are excellent and the breakfast was too.   An overall perfect experience and its location was great for exploring Buckingham Palace, Victoria, Knightsbridge and walking through St James Park leading to Piccadilly and the West End.",5,2021,08,23

121,Excellent service,"Beautiful hotel and impeccable service. The staff at the hotel really looked after us during our stay.  Our room was spacious and clean.  My only criticism would be that the bathroom felt a touch dated in the room we were in.  I'm sure this isn't the case for other rooms, but other than that our stay was fabulous.",4,2021,08,22
121,"Exceptional Hotel, Great Location!","With so many options available it can be so difficult to find the right hotel for a London City break but we’re so glad we chose the Taj in St James Court.

The hotel just generally looked great, with a vibrant yet relaxing and welcoming feel to it. The staff were great, we had a fab breakfast, and our room was large and comfortable. The hotel offers the added benefits of a lovely courtyard for food and drinks and the fabulous spa, which just made our stay complete.

Beyond the hotel itself is the benefit of its location. 5-minutes from Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Westminster, and a slightly longer but still easy and great sight-seeing stroll to Covent Garden and Knightsbridge (if you don’t want to take the tube). You’ll be Surrounded by tonnes of bars, restaurants, shops, and sights, but for those wanting a more relaxing afternoon then hotel offers that option

Overall we had a great stay and would fully recommend the Taj for anyone visiting London. We shall be back!",5,2021,08,20
121,Overnight stay,"A lovely hotel, staff very friendly and accommodating. Beautiful hotel and court yard. Only criticism we have was the food in the Bistro was over priced for the quality, it was nice but not to expectations for the price! The breakfast in the morning had plenty of selection from cooked to continental and fruits and cereal. The dinning room where breakfast is served is clearly to small for the size of the hotel and guest numbers. It was extremely busy and didn’t seem to be enough staff.  The bacon was very anaemic and had just been shown the grill, clearly the chief does not know how to cook bacon properly!! For a luxury hotel I expected a cafetière of coffee but instead it was served in a mug, no teaspoon and no sugar with it we had to keep asking the poor waitresses who were clearly under pressure.  We would stay there again as it’s a lovely hotel but we avoid eating there next time.",4,2021,08,18
121,Home from home,"Lovely hotel we always stay here, really lovely staff. Great courtyard, lovely spa and treatment massage, upgrade to a suite if you can it was superb and we had room service breakfast which we really liked , well be back..soon ",5,2021,08,17
121,10/10 London hotel without the madness of London,"One of the best hotels in London! We had the most amazing 3 night stay, all the staff were so nice and couldn’t do enough for you!! 
Appreciated them contacting prior to arrival as the studio room I had booked didn’t have walk-in shower access for my disabled mother. 
Room was super super clean, wooden floors were spotless! Only thing would be replacing the shower, it was fairly old. We will 100% be returning to this hotel, thank you for such a great stay.",5,2021,08,17

This hotel was the best hotel I have ever stayed in the UK.

Very clean and the spa was amazing. 
Thank you",5,2021,08,17

121,Central London stay at the taj...,Loved our stay at the hotel - it was brilliant.. staff were great and looked after us very well..  service was excellent too.. dinner at the courtyard was worth it esp as the weather was nice.. central and convenient location. Highly recommend it..!!!,5,2021,08,16
121,A Gem in the heart of London,"An outstanding hotel located at a stone through from Buckingham Palace. Welcoming and warm atmosphere from the moment you enter the hotel. Helpful concierges (Gvillaume, in particular, who was extremely efficient in finding local restaurants for us )and efficient reception staff(Valuica)  who settled us into a lovely Executive room. The room was clean and well presented with all the essentials that you will expect to find in a luxury hotel. The Hamden bar staff were very attentive and served us promptly without any delay. Our only regret was that the bar closed at 2300hrs on a Saturday night and no 24hr room service! The breakfast were excellent with minor variations in menu which in cooperated western, continental and Asian foods and served with smile and efficiently by all the staff; thanks Christine (the coordinator) and A Kumar who  made us feel at home at breakfast! Finally but  not least, we also like thank Ashton, one of the assistant manager at the Bistro who gave us  a warm welcome and remembered us from our previous visits and served us most efficiently. In summary we can recommend this hotel without any reservations to any one; It deserves the 5*.

121,Highest standards throughout hotel,This hotel is fabulous due to the high standard of diligence shown by all staff members.  Nothing is too much trouble for them.  On every occasion staff acknowledge you.  Breakfast was amazing.  We were greated by a very efficient and charming lady who offered to seat us in the Hamptons Bar area due to us arriving for breakfast at an exceptionally busy time This was wonderful with the same standard of breakfast we received on our first morning.  Our upgraded room was extremely comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful but it is the amazing staff which sets this hotel heads above others.  Very easy access to underground and train links.   Our go to hotel in London after an amazing first visit,5,2021,08,16
121,Wedding anniversary stay,"Had a wonderful 2 days in a junior suite at this hotel.  The location is excellent for the sights of London and West End shows.  The staff in particular are very attentive and have a “can do” work ethic.  This combined with the quality of the hotel, quality of food and facilities makes this an ideal place for a stay.
Quilon is a must - the modern SW Indian food is a delight.

Thank you to ALL of the staff at the hotel - you made our stay special.

We would not hesitate to come back in the future.  A hidden Indian-Anglo gem in London!",5,2021,08,16
121,Our go to Hotel in London,"We have stayed here a few times. Ask for one of the newly refurbished rooms.

Only slight criticism is that the wait for breakfast was long and all slightly disorganised. The second morning we ate in our room and it was perfect",5,2021,08,15
121,Business stay,"Oliwia Praszek was absolutely brilliant, from initial enquiry through to departure she was on hand to assist whenever needed. Could not have asked for more.

121,"Beautiful hotel lounge/courtyard,  bland rooms,  amazing breakfast service","Beautiful hotel, great welcome and offered to take bags. easy checkin. Great lounge area. Think they gave upgrade but wasn’t sure what the difference was and if it was actually better than one I chose, as wasn’t explained. Had drink bar which was great service from Tall African Gent. Real shame they have to wear masks, as it causes real disconnect with friendly services and creates a barrier in the experience. 
Room was pretty bland, lacked soul and the lounge area wasn’t really used, usually its better to have open plan Suite. Makes it more approachable and user friendly. Bath was tiny for a suite and the shower head was smaller than mine at home. If the attention to detail and design had been shared from the lounge area to the rooms it would be amazingBreakfast plates outside doors at 6pm evening. Raised with team members twice before it taking over hour to clear. Evening outdoor was lovely and relaxing. Service took 30mins to get a drink, which I tried to make a joke about it with the staff but not sure they got my humour. Didn’t really apologise or do much about it.We had lovely bottle wine which came before our initial drinks ordered. A Vodka lime and Soda with no lime fruit. We had some food to start than decided on that experience to finish our dinner in a different restaurant. Early morning breakfast with Aish(very long name), super attentive and best breakfast service I have had in years. It changed our whole experience and we went home smiling. Great easy check out. We will be back despite the points about but maybe a different room.",4,2021,08,15
121,Fabulous Hotel in Fantastic Location,Spent two nights here and really enjoyed our stay in room 248.  The room was clean and furnished well.  The staff were attentive without being overwhelming. Nothing was too much and you were not made to feel bothersome.  The courtyard was lovely and relaxing to spend quiet time in away from all the hustle and bustle of Westminster.  Breakfast was fresh and plentiful and again the staff courteous and attentive.  The concierge was knowledgeable and familiar with travel routes and best options for our needs as tourists to the city.  We really enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend the Taj St James' Court to anybody wishing to visit.  Thanks to all for making our stay so wonderful.,5,2021,08,14
121,Absolutely fabulous hotel.,"From check in to check out, every member of staff we met were very friendly and welcoming.
The hotel is not only a fabulous building, but also in a very central location.
Our room on the 6th floor was so quiet, we thought the bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in.
There was an issue with queueing for breakfast on the Saturday, however we were kept informed an seated very quickly. The staff at breakfast were very accommodating of our requests and nothing was too much trouble",5,2021,08,13
121,luxurious and cossetting,"From the moment we arrived we treat with dignity and respect.
Nothing was beyond the staff and they were always attentive and understanding.
Room was lovely with a beautiful courtyard view.
Spa visit is highly recommended.
Quilon restaurant is outstanding, and is obviously the real deal judging by the amount of Asian clientele.
Food and beverage around the hotel was nice and reasonably priced.
Concierge desk was a good place to be with all the staff willing to not only sort out your needs, but also willing to spend a little time chatting and joking with you to put you at ease without overstepping the mark.
We were so impressed that we have booked up for a return visit in the christmas run up period",5,2021,08,12
121,Another perfect stay!,"I can't recommend this hotel enough! I now can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. 
The staff are so warm, friendly and welcoming. Nothing to to much trouble and they go out of their way to make your experience exceptional.
It really does feel like a home away from home.
The hotel is beautiful and in such a good location.",5,2021,08,11
121,Excellent hotel,Probably the best hotel we have stayed at anywhere in uk.Exceptionally friendly and attentive staff and a lovely suite.Situated in a really good position for access to lots of places.Only very small complaint was the charge for a bottle of water with meal in Bistro.At £6 plus service charge of 12.5% we thought was a bit much.Also had to return the fillet steak as it was very tough and could not eat it but an alternative was immediately offered and was fine.Only trouble with that was my wife had finished her meal by the time I got mine.We are in London in a few weeks and will be staying at St James again.Would definately recommend.,5,2021,08,11
121,Excellent Location & Hospitality,"We stayed out at the hotel to celebrate my wife's birthday. Exceptional service and excellent and spacious room. 
Kids enjoyed and lot as well. 
The Michelin star restaurant Quilon had the very best of the food. Overall a 5 star stay!",5,2021,08,10
121,Excellent!,This was one of the best hotels ive ever been to. Service was amazing and all staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are really nice and we were selected as guest of the day so got a free upgrade and discounts at the bar and restaurant!,5,2021,08,10
121,Great break in London,"Selected this hotel because we have stayed in two Taj hotels previously and because of its location close to Buckingham Palace. Decided on a short break in London as we haven’t been able to travel abroad due to difficulties associated with the pandemic. Our stay lived up to our expectations and reminded us of the hospitality enjoyed previously. From the time we arrived until we left, we felt looked after and able to fully relax. All staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. We enjoyed an upgrade to a newly refurbished suite which had all the amenities we needed including a Nespresso machine. Unfortunately, we forgot our swimming costumes and did not use the spa. Thank you to all staff for a lovely stay. We’ll be booking again.",5,2021,08,09
121,Experience at Taj,"I am pleased with the experience at Taj. I would like to emphasise on 

Mrs. BEATA’s 

customer service. A lovely woman, brilliant approach towards the customer. As we walked in to the hotel she checked us in, she provided us a brief tour around to makes us comfortable with the hotel building. She took a great care of us. She is a very warm person and a very professional one. Taj hotel is very lucky to have her. 

The hotel is a clean and well maintained place. The vitality pool and jacuzzi is a great place to relax at and calm down your soul. 

It was a pleasant experience and definitely looking forward to another visit and for sure I will be turning to Mrs. Beata on my next stay.

121,Loved every bit of the stay,"Came for a birthday with a few friends. The hotel was beautiful and lovely spacious and clean rooms. The brekafast was lovely so much to choose from. The hotel staff go above and beyond to make everything so special. They had some extra birthday treats added. Definitely reccomend this hotel.

Only thing that i would say is for the spa. We had 30 minute spa treatments booked in however the treatment wasn’t actually that long. This included changing getting in and out etc. The actual spa treatment in the end probably was only around 10-15mins. The treatment itself was lovely but its a shame the actual treatment wasnt for 30minutes. The spa however does have a pool and a sauna which we really enjoyed. If i were to come agahin inwould skip the treatments and just enjoy the pool and sauna.",5,2021,08,08
121,Wonderful,"We are members of the Taj loyalty scheme  (Taj Inner Circle) and have stayed in a few Taj hotels in India. This hotel did not fail to live up to our expectations. We were upgraded to a Premium room, which was fabulous  as it was my husbands birthday. They even left a small birthday cake in the room. The staff are so hardworking and our thanks to Valerica on the front desk who was very helpful with our queries.
I would recommend to breakfast early as the restaurant is quite small and becomes full resulting in the need to queue. Breakfast itself is glorious.
Would highly recommend a stay here",5,2021,08,08
121,An exceptional property with an exceptional team,"This wonderful property in central London, headed by the charismatic and charming Naveen assisted by his dedicated and hardworking team.
We spent a wonderful anniversary week staying at this iconic property central to everywhere .
One of the star features of this beautiful property is the team!, even when busy the staff welcome you with a sincere smile and genuine purpose to ensure everything is taken care off.
While all the team we met from the reception and door personnel were great,few outstanding team members I would like to highlight are the Breakfast team Kristine,Bolonas , and  not forgetting the super dedicated hard-working Kumar, who dealt with all our breakfast requests with a happy spirit, and insured everything run smoothly along with the rest of the team to ensure we had a memorable breakfast.
I have one particular highlight, it was the team went out of their way to produce an Indian style breakfast when I expressed how much I enjoy Indian food, it really was above and beyond, and not forgotten.
A great place with great people . A winning partnership.
Thomas Noblett.",5,2021,08,08
121,"Fantastic stay, a minutes walk from Buckingham Palace.","We stayed with our seven-year-old son, he received a gift bag with crayons, colouring book and a teddy. When we got to the room he had a balloon with a personalise note, it made him feel very special. 
All of the staff were great and our room, the premium courtyard suite, was extremely nice. We ate at the restaurant one evening and the food (Malabar prawn curry for us and fish and chips for my son) was very good, my son wanted to eat there every night. We would definitely recommend based on service, look, feel, cleanliness of the hotel and food in the restaurants.",5,2021,08,07
121,Couples stay.,"Just a lovely hotel in a superb location with great staff.
Upgraded to a Premium room and what a room. 
Beata on reception, thank you for your service it was most appreciated. Your recommendation of room was first class
We will return soon for a slice of luxury.",5,2021,08,06
121,Excellent Hotel,"Just back from St James’s court, only a one night stay but a great experience.

Check in very fast with complimentary upgrade, the room was spotless with a very comfortable bed.

The staff were all very friendly & professional, would definitely book again.",5,2021,08,01
121,Beautiful hotel,"Spent 2 days at the hotel staying in a king premier room which overlooked the courtyard. This hotel oozes colonial luxury. The staff are incredibly helpful, friendly and cannot do enough for you.
The spa was so relaxing and again, the masseuse couldn’t be more kinder.
Breakfast was very good with a large variety as well as dinner at the Bistro (very tasty)!
Love this hotel and will be going back again very soon!",5,2021,08,01
121,Amazing hotel from a trusted brand.,"It was our first visit to St James' Court, although we have stayed in other Taj properties in India. We have visited Quilon and Bombay Brassierie many times over the years to celebrate improtant occasions. The stay was comfortable and the staff made us welcome. The room was spacious with all the usual amenities.  The Jiva spa was very good and the therapist Olga was amazing. Overall, a truly pleasant experience and hope to visit the property again in future.",5,2021,08,01
121,A new world of experience,"We are not wealthy or from a priviledged background and were bought this stay as a special treat by our children. 

To have our luggage taken at the taxi door and not to see it again until we got to our room was a new experience for us.

FOr teh reception staff member to recognise it was my wife's 70th birthday and to tell us that we had an upgrade to one of their ""new rooms"" was a new experience to us.

To arrive in the room to find a Brthday Cake on a tray with ""Happy Borthday"" written in chocolate was a new experience to us.

To have bathrobes, slippers, a shower the size of our bathroom at home, light switched that we could not find a reason for and lighting in the bathroom that we could not turn on or turn off but was always there for us was a new experience for us.

To have a coffee making machine in the room as well as a kettle for tea of many sorts was a new experience for us. We had to ask the bell boy who brought us our case to show uis how to work it. To then get a call form re3ception onthe room phone to make sure we knew how to do it was a new experience for us. ""Just call if you are having problems"" Mariana said, and we knew that she meant it.

We had been treated to a five course fine luncheon so did not attempt to use the in hotel ""Bistro"" until well into the evening. We noted that it closed for orders at 10.00pm so went along at about 9.30pm. We were delighted to find on the menu ""small plates"" very reasonably priced at £6 each and selected four f these to share between us as a light supper. We were delighted and had a very sifficient meal. 

Breakfast was included and on entering the Bistro in the morning we were greeted by a staff member who asked whether we wanted any eggs cooked. I ordered two fried eggs, ""sunny side up"", my wife declined the offer. I have never experienced that before. The eggs came to the table on a hot plate which I was then able to supplement with the ingredients of a ""full English"" from the hot buffet. I was very pleased. My wife served herself with various cereals and fruit form the cold side of the buffet. The choice was splendid. Fresh decaffienated coffeee was served at the table. WHen we left teh re3staurant we were bid ""goodbye"" by name. I haven't experrienced that before.

We were not required to check out until 12noon. Another new experience but packing our overnight things did not take long and we took our keys back to the reception. The bill had already been paid up using previously supplied credit card details and an invoice emailed. Such efficiency. 

We were offered a taxi at teh door but declined preferring to walk. The doorman gave us directions and we stepped out into the London sunshine for a beautiful stroll past Buckinham Palace, through St James and Green parks and through Mayfair toward Marylebone Station and our tr4ain home. We felt like royalty.

Thank you to the St Jmes COurt Hotel staff who made our stay a very special time and full of good memories.

The only problem, which we did not report: there did not appear to be enough bandwidth on the internet connection to stream programmes from BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub. We managed to log on via our mobile phone but could not catch up on our box set of ""Silent WItness"" or an espisode of ""Poirot"". We just got teh rotating blue thing! It did not detract from our stay. We read our novels instead and then slept like logs in our king size bed.

Health and Safety: there are no handrails on the three full width stairs down to the room (757) on the signposted route from reception. The safest transit on stairs and steps is one step at a time, holding with one hand in to the handrail. Not possible without one!",5,2021,07,31
121,Nice hotel in ideal location,"A pleasant stay at the St James court, staff extremely helpful and courteous. Breakfast was lovely, rooms spacious and clean. If I were to be super picky I’d say perhaps the bathroom was a little dated. Ideal location with just a couple of minutes walk to the palace and Green Park.",5,2021,07,31
121,Fantastic stay!,"I stayed on for business and the facilities for both business and leisure were superb. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, food and drinks were fantastic and the bedroom was really comfortable with both a dressing table and a desk for working at. The hotel was a short walk from my business meeting but also only a short walk to St James Park and Buckingham Palace, Horse Guards Parade and Trafalgar Square etc so ideal for making the most of my downtime. Would definitely recommend and will certainly be returning - hopefully next time purely for leisure!",5,2021,07,30
121,Fabulous stay with extremely helpful staff,"Everything was perfect. We stayed 2 nights to celebrate my daughter's birthday. She was given a small cake as a surprise which was a really nice touch. And, at breakfast she was wished a happy birthday by the staff, which was nice. Our rooms were faultless;  very nice and comfortable. Staff go the extra mile to make your stay really nice. Will definitely stay here again in the future. Five stars!",5,2021,07,28
121,"Welcoming, relaxing and smart in every respect","Me and my girlfriend stayed here for a night and everything was sublime. Here’s the timeline:

We checked in just before 2pm, the door and reception staff were so welcoming and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble and our room was ready early. The lobby was beautifully decorated and has a welcoming air. 

The hotel room was decorated more simply but it still looked good and was so comfortable. It was a good size but the bathroom was large and the shower itself massive. It also just had everything you’d expect in a hotel room; plenty of towels and flannels, shampoos and soaps, a selection of teas and shortbread, bottled still and sparkling water, a fridge, an iron and ironing board, towelling robes and slippers, a safe and sizeable smart TV. A lot of this sounds pretty standard but so many hotels fall short of the small things. 

Next we ordered some cocktails. They were good and arrived super quick. We also enquired about spa treatments and although we didn’t do it in the end, the over-the-phone concierge once again couldn’t do enough to help. 

Later that evening we went down to the spa area which is in a separate part of the building. To get there you traverse through the gorgeous courtyard which has drinking and dining tables surrounding a playing fountain. The flowers compliment smart architecture to create a really pleasant environment. So back to the spa area, we found a small pool with parts of it doubling as a jacuzzi. We also found some sun loungers, (despite being in a basement), a sauna and a steam room. All of this was of amazing quality and just what we needed. Again, the boring fundamentals were also there; not too crowded, attentive staff, easy-to-use lockers, drinking water on-hand and an abundance of towels. 

That night we slept so well as the bed was so comfy. So much so that we slept in way too late and were slightly late checking out the next morning. Checking out was quick, easy and the staff were more than happy to hold onto our bags for the afternoon, as we weren’t leaving London just yet. 

I won’t go into details but that evening we returned to the hotel to pick our bags up, absolutely soaked through to the skin. (It was London in the height of summer after all). I was expecting the staff to hastily handover our bags and send us on our soggy way. But no, they invited us inside asked if we needed towels and directed us to the restrooms to change. Bearing in mind this was six-odd hours after we’d checked out. 

I’ll stop this story there as you get the picture. The staff couldn’t have done more for us. The place looked great and was just as comfortable. It wasn’t cheap per-say but priced accordingly for what you got.  If I had to nitpick I’d say that the cocktails were a little expensive, and that the corridors leading to the rooms looked slightly shabbier than the lobby and the rooms themselves. These things aside, I’d recommend this place to absolutely everyone.",5,2021,07,26
121,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights in July and couldn’t of wished for a better stay, every single detail was perfect, from the moment we arrived to the second we left, we were so very well looked after it was the first time I honestly didn’t want to leave. The staff are 5* all the way, incredibly attentive, friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, so clean, very comfortable and peaceful, the bedding was as nice as ours at home which is unusual, we slept soundly. The bathroom was very well appointed and the shower was powerful and exactly what we needed after a sticky trek around town.  Breakfast in the bistro was divine, I paid to have the waffles as an extra, they were worth it although i was being indulgent as there is plenty at the buffet and eggs cooked to your liking, everything was perfect. The Hampton bar served great cocktails and snacks, we really enjoyed an afternoon there between lunch and dinner out. 

It’s in a great location, minutes walk to Buckingham Palace and St James Park, not far from Westminster and the south bank, really great location and easy to get taxis and Uber’s from the door, the doorman will get you a taxi with ease. 

I want to go back now! It’s a lovely hotel, I can’t see how anyone would be dissatisfied, if they are, then nothing would please them to be honest.",5,2021,07,26
121,Fantastic stay from start to finish,"This hotel was absolutely beautiful. The service of the staff was excellent. It was a special trip for my birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make it extra special, a birthday card and cake in the room as well as complimentary early check in and a room upgrade. The breakfast in the Bistro was great with a big selection and variety to be offered. We visited Quilon during our stay which was a nice addiction to our trip. Location is great too, very close walking distance to Buckingham palace. Above all, it was the lovely and attentive staff that made this hotel a great place to stay.",5,2021,07,26
121,Fantastic Hotel!!,"This hotel will not disappoint so do not hesitate to get it booked! 

Where do I start……. From the moment of arriving at the hotel we were greeted at the door with a big smile. The ladies on reception were really helpful and polite and meaning it was my birthday offered us late check out which was absolutely brilliant as our train home wasn’t until 6.30pm. The ladies on reception recommended the Quilon restaurant and that never disappointed either so thank you!! 

We stayed in a Premium King room and was very modern, Clean, big bathroom and very spacious. The breakfast is also a must as the quality of food was very good and with a great selection. The only slight negative I would have with the hotel was the price for the drinks. 2 cokes £13! 2 cocktails £36, unfortunately it’s London but yes it’s pricey 😬🤣.

The SPA facilities were very good. We stayed in the large Jacuzzi pool for well over an hour using the steam room and sauna also. Again the lady on the desk at the SPA was very helpful offering a great service. 

Location for this hotel is brilliant with Buckingham palace being only 5 minutes walk down the road. ST James tube station is also a 5 minute walk which was very handy for ourselves. 

Overall this hotel is a must. Please do not listen to any negative posts about this hotel because believe me it’s well worth the money. Every single staff member were a credit to this hotel. We will be visiting again on our next stay in London!",5,2021,07,25
121,Excellent unforgettable weekend getaway,"We initially booked only for one night but because the experience was great in every way, we decided to extent the stay by another day. We got the same room at the same price which itself was discounted for an upgraded suite as a good gesture by the hotel since it was my wife's birthday. The staff were extremely helpful in answering every query we had about the bar, service, breakfast, pool facilities and more. 

Shout out to Shahanad, Duane, Daiga, Vaishnav (breakfast) and Heera (breakfast) for their wonderful customer service skills as they made us feel at home and feel important. That's Tajness for you and as a fellow Indian, I am proud to see the hospitality heritage being put on the world map. All the best folks!

121,lovely stay very helpfull,Lovely stay breakfast was lovely and the room was amazing. only wish the breakfast had a pancake/waffle option and that the tv in the rooms had Netflix or amazon prime tv. it was a lovely stay and everyone was so nice,5,2021,07,21
121,Lovely stay,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriends birthday, when we arrived it was very warm welcomes, we got a welcome drinks and roberto upgraded us to a junior suite free of charge which really made the weekend for us! Our room was lovely with great amenities and view of the court yard , and a lovely birthday cake in our room also. everyone around the hotel was lovely and friendly and always said hello and goodbye , one of the best hotels I have stayed in! 

We had drinks in the courtyard which was lovely , breakfast was amazing with lots of choice and you could go up for seconds! Staff are so accommodating. 

Spa was okay , it was a hot day so was quite hot down there and the pool was quite loud and did have a plaster in it which was a bit off putting, it would be good if the jets worked in the pool as they were off when we went down! I think it’s the only area of the hotel which I would say needs a bit of an upgrade. 

The male manager outside who ran the courtyard outside in the afternoon was shouting and swearing at the ladies working , you can see they were busy and the ladies were trying their best and I overheard him getting angry at them, so maybe he should be nicer to the women on a 30 degrees hot day! 

Special thanks to roberto who really made our stay for us ! We will be back soon.",4,2021,07,20
121,EXCELLENT STAY,"I chose St james court taj hotel, having previously stayed at the Taj in Dubai, I had high expectations and they met it, from the front desk staff that provided me with the room I initially viewed, walking into room was just so warm,bright and I was glad to have the same room,the housekeeping and the court yard staff, I really enjoyed the Glow drink, it was very refreshing, the breakfast was also lovely and most importantly I had a lovely Chai Masala Tea. 
Thank you for a pleasant stay and I will be back again.

121,Epitome of amazing service,"We stayed at the Taj for a night for my birthday and everything was amazing. The check-in was smooth, the spa wet areas and the treatment was immaculate, the room and the bathroom were huge and clean, and the dinner at the courtyard was the highlight. However, we did face some problems with my birthday cake even after quite a few calls and emails before reaching there but they didn't take long to rectify their mistake the next day by sending an even better and bigger cake than we asked for, they also offered a complimentary late checkout as a gesture of goodwill. Overall the staff were very friendly and approachable and always happy to go above and beyond. Thank you to the entire team for making us feel so welcome and for making our stay so special. We will be going back again!",4,2021,07,20
121,Pathetic rooms with some good staff,"I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. started with uncleaned toilets in a studio suite, followed by AC filters not working and then eventually the toilets being blocked completely due to lack of maintenance. We came to stay in central london and a Taj hotel so that we can minimise any risk of covid related interaction but what we got was completely not that. I had staff coming in and going out as and felt like I was in some ordinary hotel. The bed in that room was very hard as if sleeping on a stone and the child bed was of very poor quality. Good staff who most of the time apologetic because of the lack of management's interest on getting any client. The floor manager Suniana spoke to me at the very end as just a formal lip service to recommend other probably to look for more business from my banking circle. Overall an pathetic experience and unnecessary hassle and tension for me. Rather a covid unsafe hotel is what I would say. Nothing that I ever experienced in a 5 star/ 4 star hotel of Taj brand especially. I will let me business teams know that this is the best hotel to avoid.",1,2021,07,19
121,Amazing experience,"We had a beautiful staying for a night at A Taj Hotel.

121,"Nothing special, this is not a luxury 5 star hotel.","For a 5 star hotel this was not 5 star service. Booked a weekend here with my partner mostly to use the spa only to be told they had over subscribed the spa and had to cancel the booking. The food itself is some of the most basic I have seen and not worth what the prices they are charging. Lunch and breakfast orders repeatedly had things missing, the service in the courtyard was painfully slow. Looks good from the outside, that's about it. Would recommend booking elsewhere considering the price of this place, a real shame.",1,2021,07,18
121,Birthday weekend,"This hotel is immaculate. The staff are impeccable and our every request was no problem. We had two premium rooms which are worth every penny. The location is central and convenient for so many places. Beds were soooooo comfy.

The rooms were clean and fresh.
The Hamptons bar serve tasteful cocktails, only issue is it's small and had difficulty getting a table.
We booked a Taj restaurant, the Bombay brasserie. Whilst the food was wonderful it was 20 minutes drive from the hotel. We booked it  thinking it was in the hotel and the advert on the website is such you think it's in the hotel.",5,2021,07,03

121,Amazing 40th Birthday Stay,"I would highly recommend this hotel, we had a amazing stay. The room was lovely and spacious with modern interior. Location is excellent, Buckingham palace is up the road and lots of shops and restaurants local to the hotel. 

The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble for them. Sunaina at the front office went above and beyond to make sure our stay was extra special. She welcomed us at check in & wished my husband a happy birthday, which was a lovely touch. With less than 24 hours notice she arranged some extra touches in our suite for my husbands 40th Birthday. 

Spa facilities were nice but not so big so numbers are limited. I would recommend booking access and treatments well in advance. Breakfast was wonderful and the option to have it in our room was nice (at no extra cost) 

We will defiantly be visiting again the the near future.

Thank you to all the team at the hotel for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2021,07,02

Very quick check in, staff very helpful, room really good everything very clean and an incredibly comfy bed
Breakfast service was good and again staff very helpful food was good

121,Customer of the day- excellent service,"I arrived after a very tiring work day to be told congratulations! Apparently I had been chosen as the guest of the day :). The manager was called and explained that I was selected to have a free room upgrade, glass of whatever (chose prosecco!!) in the bar and discount when eating in their restaurant. Brilliant!
The foyer was lovely and the courtyard with lots of green and a water fountain in the middle of london was a lovely little paradise.
The service throughout the hotel was excellent and they seemed to anticipate your need which is to me the best type of service.
The room was spacious, well decorated and the smellies were really nice. Shower huge. The room was also nice and cool and I could hear the water fountain outside as I had my full length windows partially open.
As the guest of the day I had a sweet treat waiting for me in the room :) I also had fruit and a nespresso machine.
Pillows and mattress really comfy and seeing as I have stayed in about x6 different hotels this month that is saying something.
The room service was excellent and they had specialty indian choices if you wished which did sound good.
Really lovely experience and many thanks to all the staff in the hotel. I will be boking again.",5,2021,06,30
121,"Fantastic hotel and staff, impeccable service","Really lovely hotel where the staff cannot do enough for you. We had a wonderful short stay, and really could not have asked for more. Fabulous rooms, cleanliness to perfection, literally nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely be returning. Small kitchen in our room could do with a few extra items in order to make any use of it.",5,2021,06,29
121,Home away from Home,"I & my wife are NHS frontline doctors. We stayed in this place as a short break. 

Everything in this place is excellent. We will definitely go there again & would recommend this place. Truly amazing and satisfying experience.

Duty manager Desmond, all staff from front desk, in room dining, house keeping, concierge, Bistro, Hampton Bar & Courtyard were excellent in service, very polite and helpful. 

Food, cleanliness, comfort, hospitality & everything was of Taj Group standards.

Location of the hotel is close to Buckingham Palace & many tourist attractions. 

Thank you Taj Group for this awesome experience.",5,2021,06,29
121,Every bit as fantastic as we imagined…,The hotel staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The afternoon tea and breakfast were delicious and evening drinks by the beautiful fountain made you feel truly on holiday. We can’t wait to revisit this beautiful hotel.,5,2021,06,28
121,The best place we have stayed,"From arrival we were treated so well , our room was upgraded we were over the moon with the apartment we were in, the kids were treated to personalised cookies left in our room on our return from an amazing day out, the courtyard is gorgeous as is the whole hotel 
We will definitely return 
Thank you so much for making our weekend so special",5,2021,06,26
121,Great to be back!,"This was our second stay at St James Court having visited in the summer of 2019 & our experience was even better this time. Right from check in the experience was first class. The staff member who checked us in (I,m ashamed to say I don’t recall her name) was lovely, she casually asked if our stay was a special occasion, & I mentioned it was my wife’s birthday, I,m not sure if it was planned anyway but she said we had been given a free upgrade to an Executive King Room which was fantastic ( Room 530). After an afternoon seeing the sights we returned to freshen up before dinner & had a lovely surprise birthday cake in our room....a really nice touch. We had a drink in the bar before going out for dinner & loved the ambiance with the live pianist. The room & bed especially was super comfortable & the breakfast in the morning was superb. What makes this hotel so great though is the friendly professional attitude of all the staff, they really are a credit to the hotel.
We look forward to returning again soon.",5,2021,06,26
121,Dishonest and highly unreliable,Booked on the telephone for 4 night stay and requested a quiet area to stay which was promised Also informed my room would overlook the courtyard Which it didn’t The latter promise I did not request Rougish and lacking in integrity to say the least would never revisit or recommend Avoid Room 251,1,2021,06,25
121,Taj Group Class in London,"We stayed for 2 nights in June during a period of sunny weather.

Easy distance from Victoria station either walking or by taxi.

Understated, classical exterior with a warm and welcoming old school reception area. As would be expected from the Taj group, a very smooth, pleasant and efficient check in process.

Internally, as to be expected from a building of this age and character, it is something of a rabbit warren, but is clearly signed.

We had a refurbished king room, which was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The Nespresso machine was very welcome for the early morning kick starter. The bathroom was spacious enough, with the shower over bath. Clean and well equipped with good quality fittings. Decor was somewhat bland for our ‘old school’ preference, but was bright and fresh feeling. Perhaps on our next visit we will try one of the unrefurbished classic rooms, despite some adverse reviews.

Breakfast served in the Bistro was of excellent quality, with plenty of choices. The staff provided similarly excellent service on both days given the Covid constraints. We didn’t dine in the Bistro as it has been refurbished in a very bright, and to our taste, clinical fashion. Fine for breakfast but not our evening meal choice.

The patio garden is still a work in progress, but am sure that this will provide a welcoming and calm outdoor experience. We’ll return once this is completed.

The bar and lounge area adjacent to reception are proper old school, exuding class, charm and comfort. Perfect.

Excellent concierge service for dining reservations.

St James Park, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace are within a few minutes stroll. Perfect for  early morning/pre breakfast strolls.",5,2021,06,24
121,30th Birthday Celebration,"I booked for me and my boyfriend to stay at this hotel for his 30th birthday weekend. The staff was excellent and made sure we felt special during our stay. Everything was great, from the room, to the delicious breakfast, and the excellent spa. Everyone was really lovely and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2021,06,21
121,Excellent service!,"From entering the hotel to leaving the hotel we had excellent customer service & extremely friendly & helpful staff. Rooms were very clean with lovely decor & spacious. Decor throughout the hotel was very nice.
The breakfast was very nice with a good range & again excellent service. The Bistro restaurant food was very nice. We really enjoyed having cocktails at the Hampton bar.
 This was a weekend treat for my husband for Father’s Day and he thoroughly enjoyed it. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2021,06,21
121,Birthday weekend,"An amazing hotel with staff that go out of their way to make sure every attention is given, we celebrated my husbands Birthday and every staff member was aware of this and made it extra special with champagne at breakfast, a complimentary cake and hand written birthday card! Would highly recommend this beautiful hotel in a great location - we will definitely be back again soon . Thank you",5,2021,06,20
121,Visiting for friends wedding,"Fantastic time at Taj! Really accommodating and very beautiful room, lounge areas, courtyard and spa! Valerica, on reception was really friendly and accommodating - so a particular mention to her :) Will definitely be visiting again.",5,2021,06,20
121,Mrs Barot,"5 stars 

Had an amazing stay at the Taj for my special birthday,  could not fault anything from the staff to the ambience. Sunaina, the Duty manager and all other staff were so welcoming and made our stay super special. Breakfast was varied and all options were offered. Our Room  was super comfortable.  Thank you Taj, will be visiting again for sure to experience your warm and unique hospitality",5,2021,06,16
121,Wonderful place to stay,"Just had a wonderful stay at st james court hotel I really can't fault it ,the room was spotless bigger than most london hotel rooms very well appointed  with everything you may need. We didn't eat at the restaurant but the breakfast was excellent table service  which I think is far better than buffet was very attentive. We had drinks on the terrace in the evening with the pianist playing it was idyllic. The best thing about the stay has to be the impeccable service from all the staff nothing seemed too much trouble from the check in to the goodbyes ,from now on this has got to be my number one hotel to stay whilst in London.",5,2021,06,15
121,Lovely hotel  in perfect location,"Hotel is beautiful and spotless, staff are welcoming, polite and extremely helpful.  Our room was upgraded which was fantastic.  Outside courtyard is a lovely addition to the hotel.

If I had to be picky I was slightly disappointed with the breakfast - I had the full English a couple of times and the bacon and black pudding were both extremely hard and tasteless. On 2 mornings the service was quite slow with tables who ordered after us being served their breakfasts before us. As I said, this is just being picky and wouldn't put me off returning.",4,2021,06,15
121,"Great Hotel, Excellent staff.","I was very impressed by the service received. From the moment we stepped out of the black cab and were greeted Leo at the door, right through to check-out. The service was of a very high standard throughout our stay. The duty manager and her colleague who checked us in were of particular note as they were very helpful, friendly and professional - they made us feel very welcome. The suite we decided upon (having kindly been given a choice of three) was beautifully furnished and very comfortable. The newly reopened courtyard was a lovely space for a couple of afternoon drinks.   The hotel was very clean and looked well kept.  Having stayed in many hotels I think the value for money is excellent here. We will certainly be looking to stay here again when we are next staying over night in London.",5,2021,06,15
121,DOCTOR,It was an amazing and wonderful experience staying at Taj. The reception at the hotel was excellent. The staff was very courteous and was very caring. The acknowledged to the needs very quickly and effectively. We stayed in an executive suite.  The suite was fantastic. The breakfast in the morning was superb and had lot of variety. Overall I would strongly recommend and I enjoyed my say as a family thoroughly .,5,2021,06,14
121,"Fantastic hotel, with great staff and facilities!","My partner and I stayed here for our anniversary. We made them aware of that before booking the room and what can I say, they went above and beyond our expectations to make our stay memorable! The team were warm and welcoming and were always there to meet our requests. I'd like to specifically mention Anita, Beata and Sunaina who really went out their way to their way to make our stay special. The room we had stayed in was very modern and very roomy, which is welcomed when staying at a hotel in the heart of London. The spa facilities were great to take some well needed R&R. All in all, I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2021,06,14
121,Much needed stay but the hotel could improve in some areas!,"The overall experience of staying at this hotel was very good! Check in was smooth and I felt pleased with the room that I was given. My friend and I couldn't wait to use the spa facilities and have a head to toe spa treatment as there is a very unique theme at the hotel and spa. The spa facilities and spa treatment were wonderful and very relaxing! However, my experience did feel ruined when the spa therapist who did my treatment ended up making me feel incredibly insecure. While attempting to sell spa products to my friend and I, she made some very insensitive comments about the acne and scarring on my face. I understand that she was trying to sell skincare products but this approach was very unnecessary and insensitive. If I wanted to have my face or skin texture analysed - I would've went to see a dermatologist! My friend and I politely declined to buy any spa products. Straight after, the same spa therapist had the audacity to ask if we would like to pay a gratitude tip after she made those comments about the flaws/imperfections on my skin! I felt so disheartened and insecure after. Despite this awkward incident, I had a lovely sleep after and the hotel staff were great and quick when I asked for small things like more water bottles and extra sugar in the room. We had to wait a long time for breakfast in the morning as there was a long queue and it took a long while for someone to take our order even after we were seated. The hot breakfast meal was average - it would've been better if there were more pesciterian options. We did enjoy the drinks and sweet pastries though. Lastly, the check out process was smooth and the staff behind the desk were always so nice and polite. Despite the end of my spa experience being an anti climax, the overall experience at this hotel was pretty good!",3,2021,06,13
121,Perfect Hotel,"The staff was so warm and welcoming, the food was out of this world and the facilities was so clean and perfectly decorated. Thank you for my amazing stay! I will be coming back to experience paradise again.",5,2021,06,13
121,"Spa is lacking, leaves much to be desired","I booked two nights at this hotel to enjoy a post-pandemic spa day. Unfortunately the spa was disappointing as during my two hour massage and one hour facial, I heard doors opening, closing, and slamming the entire time (hundreds of times to be exact...I counted as it was the only thing I could focus on). I mentioned the noise to the masseuse and to the spa receptionist, both of whom were aware of the door noise issue, apologized to me, and said there was nothing that could be done about the noise. After I complained multiple times, I received 10% off of the services at the spa, but I feel the discount was not enough as 1) I was completely unable to relax at the spa, 2) the treatments I chose were not inexpensive and 3) most of the staff were very aware of the noise complaints. So my first spa day in over a year was hugely disappointing. I am writing this review to warn others, as I had not read anything online about the noise in the spa. As the staff are aware of the issue and informed me that the door noise cannot be fixed, I believe the hotel should put a warning on their website so people can know about the noise before they choose to spend hundreds of pounds in a noisy spa where one is unable to relax.
Book spa services here if your idea of relaxing is laying in the middle of any major train station for a massage because that's about how much traffic travels through the spa at St. James Court. I will not stay at this hotel again, and I definitely will not patronize the spa ever again.",3,2021,06,13
121,Extraordinary stay,"Wonderful staycation. As soon as we arrived at the hotel the service was fantastic. We were well looked after and as it was my husbands birthday they made the stay extra special. Special thanks to Nourhan, Lisa, Desmond, Ciara and Shahanad who looked after us and our kids. 
The food was lovely; a fab breakfast. 
We had a family room with two double beds very spacious. The hotel is in a perfect location so close to the sights. The courtyard was beautiful. Highly recommend and definitely be back again.",5,2021,06,11
121,"Stellar spa and staff, hotel not so much","The staff at this hotel are fabulous, Very attentive but not intrusive. The spa is amazing, again the staff are fantastic. I cannot fault the spa or any of the staff.
The room - I was told I had an upgrade. It didn't seem like it. The room was a very odd shape and so all free standing furniture seemed to be at an angle. The bed and pillows are super comfortable. Room service seemed to be a challenge. The 1st morning was ok. Nothing special though. The 2nd morning half of our tray was wrong and items were missing. The juice is out of a carton and not freshly squeezed. The inside rim of the coffee pot was peeling away (btw, we hadn't asked for coffee) the palma ham was too 'brown' for me to risk my health, the grapes in the fruit salad were clearly over a week old..they had that brown dimple at the stalk end, and the berries were badly bruised.    For an Asian based hotel there were no vibrant colours, no pictures on the walls. The room was almost sterile. Shame really, but we won't be staying there again.",4,2021,06,08
121,"Very good hospitality, great food and nice location","We have been here a few times for a staycation. Love the breakfast, nice premier rooms with coffee machine and good amenities. Gym sufficient and good to see steam room and Jacuzzi now opened. Great service from all employees.

We have another staycation booked there, hopefully they will remember us as returning clients..",5,2021,06,06
121,Out of the world experience,"Do not have enough words to describe the service and experience received. Cant thank enough to all the staff - Desmond, Lisa, Leo and everyone else, made our anniversary celebration very very special......Will surely surely visit again, a proud TATA employee !!!!!!",5,2021,06,06
121,Fantastic stay,"My husband and I stayed for two nights for a double celebration. The hotel made it really special for us and the service was impeccable. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating and the hotel itself was cleaned to a high standard. 
It was situated a stones throw from Buckingham Palace and only a half an hour walk into central London.
We would recommend this hotel to couples",5,2021,06,06
121,"breakfast service ,misleading information and advertisement about  access to pool and spa and being charge  twice","i won't recommend this hotel , as i had bad experiences,i booked this hotel trough booking .com to have one  relaxing night , when i entered hotel i ask receptionist for booking spa and pool and they told me it is closed which i specially request from booking.com , also when we went for breakfast they don't give us any choice except three options and ask them to have just egg as i am vegetarian but they told me i have to pay extra , and they worse part i have been charged twice for room which i found out trough my bank statement and i immediately call them and refuse to take my word in account and then they mentioned that the usually keep the money after checking out and admitted in the end that the will release the money later but they don't want give me any indication when will this happen.

The room was immaculate and very comfortable, we had a free upgrade which was a nice surprise and ordered breakfast to our room at no extra charge. The hotel is located near to Buckingham Palace, with many tube stations near by. Would highly recommend the hotel for the ambiance and attentive staff. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.",5,2021,05,27

121,"Great hotel, great location and fantastic staff","I recently stayed at St James Court hotel and had a lovely time. We were upgraded to an executive room, had a small cake delivered to our room for our anniversary and received fantastic friendly service from the hotel staff.

We were excited to go in the first weekend post lockdown restrictions and you could see from the staff they were very excited to welcome guests to their hotel.

Breakfast was tasty and understandably no longer buffet to stick to covid regulations. The spa area was very clean and rightfully limited to 6 people at a time so you have a relaxing experience whilst still feeling safe. Please do book in advance if you'd like to use the spa.

Sunaina in particular was very friendly, introducing herself at breakfast and being able to resolve an issue we had with our spa booking.

A great hotel experience and thanks to all the staff for making it so welcoming!",5,2021,05,25
121,Done the Job,"We had a night in London away from the little one, paid 134 pounds for the night which included breakfast.
Arrived at the hotel first thing in the morning and room was already ready, very plush lobby area and polite staff. Check in was straight forward. 
We were on the 7th floor, good size room with plenty of cupboard space and a good sized bed. 
The decor is someone dated and all a bit worn - I do find this is a standard 4* hotel, the public areas are very grand and the rooms are a bit underwhelming. However it was clean, tea and coffee in the room, however they did forget to give us milk. 
Bathroom is good size but does get very wet from condensation and awkward getting out the shower due to the toilet and the shower screen position. 
The breakfast was nice, but if we didn’t get that included in our deal it was £35 per person for a small fry up which is shocking even for London. I have had cheaper mains in a Michelin Star restaurant. Drinks in the bar are too quite pricey too.
I would stay again if in that part of London and couldn’t find anywhere else that took my fancy. In",4,2021,05,24

The hotel is perfectly located, very close to Buckingham Palace and all the big/beautiful royal parks... 15 min walk from the Big Ben as well! 
The service was great, our 2 kids got some amenities that they loved. The family room was very comfortable with 2 separate rooms and toilets... Room service fantastic as well. My only comment is that I should have asked for a bigger cot for my little one as it was too small, but I'm sure they would have accommodated... She slept with us in the extra large bed at the end :). 100% recommended! ",5,2021,04,08

121,Exceptional People Make for an Exceptional Stay,"This hotel has marvelously thoughtful staff that make the experiences here exceptional.  All of the staff were immensely helpful and friendly in every conceivable way from the first moment I arrived until the day I left.  I was so pleased with my stay, which occurred during the tier 4 period in London, that I purchased a room for a family member and his guest to celebrate New Year's Eve there.  And the staff went above-and-beyond for them as well.  I could continue praising the staff and hotel all day.  I will stay there whenever I can.  I suggest you do the same.  ",5,2021,01,11
121,A well located comfortable hotel ,"I know the Taj chain from India, where its flagship property in Bombay is a veritable institution in its own right.  The Taj’s London property, while not on the same scale and without the same range of facilities as the mother ship, is nonetheless a good base for a comfortable stay in the heart of the city.  I stayed there over a long weekend in August, just after the first UK lockdown and the hotel was careful to observe all sanitary protocols.  My room was spacious and comfortable, as was my bathroom.  The gym was well equipped, though sadly the spa was off limits due to the virus.  The service at breakfast was polite and well intentioned, though harried, chaotic and shambolic the first couple of days.  It got much better after I pointed this out to a restaurant manager who took great pains to ensure excellent service from then on.  The hotel is well located, just a few minutes from Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park, a short stroll away from Mayfair, St. James and Knightsbridge.  ",5,2020,12,24
121,Break the routine ,"Because of lockdown the hotel was only running at a basic level. However the staff were so very obliging and helpful. The room was on a corner overlooking the courtyard. I would imagine in the summer this must be a wonderful place to sit and drink. The hotel is an unusual design, spread across a number of buildings.  Unique as with all the Taj hotels. Would recommend.

The staff at breakfast and at the reception was friendly. Especially Roberto was very welcoming and made our stay carefree.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,12,04
121,Very comfortable room. Awful breakfast,"Every member of staff was very courteous.  Leo on the door, Ione on reception and the manager who introduced herself and gave us her card.  We really liked the complimentary valet parking as we did not want to travel by train into London.  Our premium king was spacious with a super comfy bed & pillows. Lots of storage space& a great shower. Modern & refurbished.  Good coffee maker.  Seeing as the hotel was so quiet it would’ve special to have received a complimentary upgrade & I think, as Silver member of Hotels.com we did not receive any the benefits we should’ve done.  Also, if a hotel has a higher room available then why not give the upgrade as it costs no more to do this and makes a fab treat.  My husband appreciated the beautiful birthday plate in our room.  The big disappointment was the breakfast- rock hard fried eggs, awful bacon, cheap orange juice. All been cooked rather a long time before it was served.  ",4,2020,11,06
121,Thank you,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay -  as always. Incredible room, food and special touches. Staff impeccably polite and etiquette just spot on. And of course, COVID safety measures being adhered to perfectly.

Our birthday dinner was of the highest quality with a special touch of a Birthday cake, we were made to feel very special.

Miriana was a delight and was a constant smiling welcome every time we saw her. Lisa. At booking was also very helpful and friendly. These were just a couple to mention as there were so many wonderful experience. The hotel its self was Stunning too. I would recommend anyone to stay her for a luxury experience.",5,2020,10,29
121,Great Family Stay,"With luxury hotels, it is always difficult to tell if it will be a good hotel for a family with young children as you don't know how your children (who may be louder than the average train) will be received! I can say, with pleasure, that our stay at St James Court with a 2 year old and a 5 year old was an absolute delight. Although our children were loud at times, the staff were so kind to them and treated them like royalty. They brought out presents and balloons and always spoke to them when we walked out the door. It really was amazing service for our family and we never felt like we were ruining the experience for anyone else. We booked the family room for four nights and it was also a great space for all of us. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2020,10,28
121,Fabulous!,"Beautiful hotel - loved staying here. Felt very clean and COVID safe. Breakfast was table service but equally lovely and the rooms were impeccably cleaned and decorated. Nothing was too much for them, brilliant service.",5,2020,10,27
121,It’s all ok but it’s not really a Taj ,"So the plus is that this hotel is in a great location, the staff are universally excellent and the housekeeping is first class.

The rooms are really quite small but comfortable. Clean sheets etc and as I say the housekeeping is impeccable. 

I do wish the management would take a look at the bathroom design. Someone added cheap basket shelving in a location that makes showering very uncomfortable and then they added a grab bar at the perfect height to bang your knees on. Common sense should have rendered both those decisions into the bin. 

We had a B&B deal and with regret I have to say breakfast is really not very good. We were there 4 days and on two days the breakfast was returned as it was cold. Given this is a Taj it’s reasonable to expect a decent standard, but the hotel has cut corners and it shows. Cheap bread, cold toast, bad bacon and poor cooking has reduced the overall mark here.

I’ve stayed with Taj a few times in India and the standard there is completely different. Alas, this Taj was a bit of a disappointment.

121,Lovely stay,"Impromptu weekend in London, found this hotel on booking.com and so pleased we did. Lovely people, nice modern premier rooms, can’t fault it at all. Lots of small attention to detail things! Highly recommended and will stay here whenever we are in London if we can!",5,2020,10,24
121,Fabulous birthday celebration,"We absolutely love this hotel so was the perfect choice to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We stayed in a junior suite for 4 nights which was fabulous. All of the staff are super friendly, taking the time to speak to you whenever they see you. We felt extremely looked after at all times. The hotel is beautiful and elegant and in a superb location. We had breakfast in the Bistro which was outstanding. We look forward to visiting again in the not too distant future.",5,2020,10,19
121,Family weekend in London,"We had the most amazing time in London and to top it off we stayed at the beautiful St James Court A Taj Hotel. Its location is amazing and has so much near by to see and explore.
Our room was fantastic and when we asked for another bed they were putting it in there before we had even gotten to the room. It was clean, tidy and comforting.
We decided to have dinner in the restaurant and it didn't disappoint us. The children had pizza and we had the Thai curry which was amazing plus some wonderful deserts. We also had a good night's sleep which is sometimes hard with 2 young children. 
We also had the full English breakfast and the kids pancakes and waffles and again we weren't disappointed.
Thank you to all the staff who made us feel warm and welcoming. It even comes down to little things like them opening doors for us.

We will be back again and thank you xx",5,2020,10,18
121,Perfect romantic break,"Great location in heart of london.
Beautiful hotel with gorgeous courtyard great setting for outside drinks and dining.
We stayed in a suite which was decorated to a good standard, good amenities, unfortunately swimming pool closed due to covid, hotel is very clean and staff very friendly and attentive which helped make our stay perfect!",4,2020,10,14
121,Great Three Night Stay,"Superb hotel, superb service. Superb Staff.

Lovely clean and well appointed room, the best stay we've had in London for many years.

Quiet location away from all the hustle and bustle of London. However, Buckingham Palace about 5 mins away and Westminster Abbey 10 mins.

Many Thanks!!",5,2020,10,12
121,Best bed we have ever slept in,"Stayed for my birthday weekend and they couldnt of been more helpful nothing was too much trouble, on arrival without asking got a lovely plate of goodies sent to my room for my birthday a lovely touch. The bed is the best we have ever slept in we even asked what mattress it was and they found out for us. We would stay here again for the bed alone. Great location to.",5,2020,10,11
121,Excellent hotel but exceptional staff,"This hotel is fabulous but the staff make it amazing.  From the minute you walk through the door the staff team make you feel special with their exceptional customer service.  The hotel itself is in a great location for exploring London and the rooms have most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in.  They are carefully adhering to COVID safety guidelines and cleanliness is good with face masks being warm and provided for guests.  Thank you to Sunaina for making my Birthday extra special.
Really can’t speak highly enough of this hotel and it’s staff.",5,2020,10,10
121,Fantastic stay,I stayed there with my husband for a birthday getaway. Staff were very welcoming and accommodating. Treated us like royalty. Couldn’t do enough for us. Food and room were excellent. Will definitely come back and recommend to friends and family. Great job guys. You all do a wonderful job. Hope to see you soon.,5,2020,10,06
121,Disappointing,"We stayed here for three nights recently and were disappointed to find the huge difference in the standard of this hotel to the Taj hotels we’ve stayed at in India. The room was clean but small and on one day because we hadn’t left the room until the afternoon it wasn’t serviced that day. This is not what is expected of a hotel boasting its star ratings. The breakfast was very poor with food clearly having been cooked and kept warm for hours, you could hardly get the knife through the hash browns they were like leather. Tea was served from a thermos flask which had been stood for ages until I asked for a teapot. The staff seemed badly trained too. There was no atmosphere around the hotel or any entertainment. Very disappointing stay and would not be staying there again!",3,2020,09,28
121,Taj St James,"for a day and night as a tourist visitor the Taj made for a great day in London. We enjoyed a free upgrade ,the room was perfect with excellent facilities and the breakfast Mediterranean was scrumptious.Will definitely stay again as we live west of London we travelled by train so the instance of the hotel not having a car park was no issue .",5,2020,09,28
121,The most wonderful stay!,"My husband and I booked a rare night away from the children and we were blown away by the quality of service and standards throughout the hotel. From the friendly concierge who made us feel special from walking through the door, to the front of desk staff who upgraded our room to the most amazing suite FOC, and not forgetting the thoughtful staff at breakfast who were extremely helpful. The COVID-19 safety measures were adhered to with care and respect throughout. Even our visit to the gym felt safe with strict aderehance to numbers and sanitation stations. We had dinner at Quilon which was the icing on the cake for what turned out to be the most loveliest of weekends. All in all the staff went above and beyond during a very tricky time and made us feel very special. We look forward to returning soon.",5,2020,09,27
121,Very smart but friendly hotel,"We spent one night at the hotel, booked last minute. The hotel is smart and clean, well situated for central London and many attractions. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, in particular Beata on reception. The room was quiet, very clean and well presented, breakfast was excellent. Would highly recommend.",5,2020,09,25
121,A special hotel,"A last minute getaway, in between covid restrictions. Hotel building is absolutely stunning. The courtyard on a warm evening is incredible to sit in. Rooms are top quality with all needs catered for. Staff were very attentive. It felt very safe in these strange covid times. They made us feel special on our wedding anniversary to. ",5,2020,09,22
121,Wedding Weekend,"Stayed here for a couple of nights to attend a wedding in London.  Spotlessly clean, spacious room, stunning courtyard, attentive staff, nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfast was cooked to perfection, would recommend the full English.",5,2020,09,13
121,Excellent location and very clean in line with COVID,Staff are very attentive and welcoming. In particular Daniele at concierge was very very helpful and helped us find amazing restaurants to dine at and booked them too! The in room dining team needs to be more trained in taking orders and delivering room service on time. We had our breakfast orders delayed and items missed out on both days. Beata and Tatiana were also very kind and always ready to welcome us and play with our child!,4,2020,09,02
121,"Quiet, pleasant, relaxing stay over.","We have stayed here before and really wanted to return to London after these last six months. So our first venture out and St James Court didn’t let us down. Covid restrictions in place and yet you hardly notice unless in the hotel building itself where face masks are required. Although for some reason, some still insist on ignoring them and get in the lift with you. Always an idiot somewhere. We stayed overnight but had to be away by 07:00, so no chance to relax in the morning for a breakfast, maybe next time. The room was spotless and as good as I remembered. We had a couple of drinks in the reception area and outside at the fountain, which I feel are a little on the pricey side, but it’s a Taj and London! This was a Monday evening and London was incredibly quiet. Our local town was ten times busier. A strange feeling, but we loved the stay.",5,2020,09,01
121,Hidden Gem ❤️,"Just back from a 1 night stay in this beautiful hotel. Our room was upgraded complimentary, lovely surprise! We were above the spa. Nespresso machine and plenty of coffee pods, toiletries and even masks and hand gel sachets. Room was so clean. 
The reception staff were lovely and very helpful. There is a beautiful outdoor area bar, comfortable seating and very relaxed. Didn’t feel like London at all... Perfect location too. We walked around the corner in the evening and had dinner in The Ivy which was lovely. 
The breakfast was good, but a little boring, plates seemed half empty. But overall, the staff make this hotel a must! Will definitely visit again. Thankyou ",5,2020,08,31
121,Best staycation ever,"A break at the Taj
As soon as we stepped out of out taxi the porter  Daniel took our suitcases and led us to the reception area, we had a short wait before being shown to our room.
As it was not quite what wanted I rang down to reception to request another room, this was facilitated almost immediately by Suzanna at the front desk along with Mohit Verma who oversaw the process. We were shown two rooms even though they were very busy the room I liked was immediately prepared. Our luggage was brought up by the head concierge Nelson Mendez and Daniel,  all done with a smile and  effortless ease which couldn't have been easy as my bag in particular was very heavy. 
A friend of mine was coming to visit unexpectedly, as I hadn't booked anything and the high tea was only being served at two times due to Covid I was at a loss as to how entertain her. The staff at the Hamptons Bar were so kind and got us a platter of  scrumptious cakes and some tea to serve to her , I would like to mention them and thank them,Silvan and Matauze,the Bar supervisors and Karan and Tatiana, the Bar waiters. 
Thank you to room service for delivering our breakfasts everyda ,especially Aman but also all the waiters, cooks and those that took our orders. I will mentionMohit Verma again who ensured we got a table at the Bombay Brasserie by phoning ahead to the manager there. Thank you  to all the reception staff who were always polite, professional and courteous and went out of their way to be of service. ",5,2020,08,31
121,Absolutely perfect!!!,"This is a truly beautiful hotel, located just a six minute walk from Buckingham Palace. The rooms were exceptionally clean - in fact the whole hotel looked as if it was brand new.  There was not so much as a spec of dust to be found.  I also had the best night's sleep here than I have had in a very long time.  The beds and the pillows were amazing.  The staff were so helpful, respectful, efficient and professional.  Can't speak highly enough of this hotel. In future this will be my number one hotel choice whenever I am in London because I know we won't find better elsewhere.",5,2020,08,24
121,Birthday stay,"We booked 3 nights for my husbands birthday. The hotel was very accommodating and the premium room we stayed in was beautifully designed and modern. The location is great, walking distance to Buckingham palace and Green Park. Our friends and family joined us for the Alice in Wonderland afternoon tea and I could not rate it highly enough. It was fantastic! The scones were delicious and they did a full vegetarian spread. The cakes were also very impressive and the whole thing was mouth watering! Probably one of the best afternoon teas we have had! The hospitality was really good and nothing was too much trouble. I felt the breakfast was a slight let down for vegetarians but apart from that I have no complaints. On my husbands birthday they decorated the room with balloons and cake and it was really appreciated. We will definitely be back! Thank you Taj for a wonderful stay.",5,2020,08,24
121,Brilliant hotel .. brilliant location..brilliant service ,"A superb hotel with great service and attention to detail 

The outdoor area is tremendous and rooms are superb 

The location is really excellent 

Breakfast was superb and team were really helpful 

Definitely recommend a stay there absolutely first class ",5,2020,08,23
121,Disappointed,"The hotel and room were very good  and spotlessly clean. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The food however was extremely poor, a luke warm breakfast (£26 each), and the Michelin starred restaurant was not what I would have expected. We had the brunch which was very filling but lacked the finesse and spicing that I was anticipating. I would say that the food overall was very bland. Drink prices are also massively inflated. A bottle of prosecco coming in at £55.
I don't think that the hotel was good value for money at £323 for a triple room.
There was also an issue with booking.com  , the price booked for 3 people occupying an executive king room was £274 nonrefundable. When the confirmation came through the booking showed double occupancy. Despite showing the hotel reception the screenshots of the booking rates where double occupancy was £223, I was asked to paythe additional amount and take the issue up with booking.com  , I am awaiting their response.",2,2020,08,23
121,21st birthday stay ,"Thankyou so much for the amazing stay, me and my fiancé stopped here 2 nights for my 21st birthday staycation. Firstly want to stay the location of this hotel is spot on !! Close to 2 tube stations, walking distance to Buckingham palace,  Covent Garden etc. Secondly this hotel is beautiful, modern British with an indian twist , we loved the vibe 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Rooms are beautiful, very clean with everything you need. The finishing touches are to a high quality and much appreciated, including good quality soaps shampoos etc. 
We also made us of the 24 hour which which was an added bonus 😊
Not a negative but something  I think the hotel should maybe look into... the size of the breakfasts , yes luckily for us ours was included , but the sizes are extremely small considering it’s £35 for a full English , 1 sausage seems very stingy , and very small slices of cheese as the continental selection ... was left still hungry but not the end of the world. 

Was made to feel like this was a second home, very welcomed and a friendly goodbye. Can’t wait to return ",5,2020,08,23
121,Wonderful historic property,"Very nice stay.  Lovely combination of historic property but modern interiors and facilities.  The interior courtyard is treat given the very urban setting.  Only a few blocks from Buckingham palace, Parliament and Big Ben so very walkable location.  Staff exceptionally attentive.  Spa and pool closed by COVID unfortunately.",5,2020,08,21
121,Just perfect,"A fabulous hotel, worth every penny spent. The staff were amazing and so accommodating especially in times of Covid-19. The courtyard view was beautiful and even nicer enjoying drinks by the fountain and the birthday treat left in our room was most appreciated. The waiter in the breakfast room remembered my drinks order and food preferences each time we visited which was a nice touch.",5,2020,08,20
121,Great Stay,"My usual hotels are still closed so chose the St James Court from a booking website as the photos looked good and the price was very good.
I stayed for 3 nights and had a great time. Excellent room with many unexpected amenities, very good breakfast and very friendly staff.
Just a couple of minutes walk from Buckingham Palace on the Victoria side and perfectly located for my work this week.
Definitely recommend.",4,2020,08,20
121,2nt stay St James Court ,"We were one of many couples who had our wedding and honeymoon postponed this summer so a 2nt break in London was a welcomed trip. I told St James court this on the ‘special occasion’ section prior to arrival so we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a premium room which was a nice start to the break. Upon returning from sighting seeing the following day we entered our room to find a cake, card and balloons! A really nice touch. Although some of the facilities are still closed we enjoyed the luxurious atmosphere and attentive service. Breakfast is delicious with a nice choice for all. The courtyard is beautiful for drinks pre dinner. 
All in all a lovely-relaxing-forget the world stay 
Well done and thank you Taj hotel x",4,2020,08,17

Such a quite place you wouldn’t believe you are in a big city!.",5,2020,08,09
121,The Taj,"Great location and fascilities.
Due to C19 pool and spa not available.
Great modern room but in my particular casewe had a room with the buildingclock and the noise kept us all awake at nights.
We where offered a replacement room but did find them to be suitable.
So we staying in the room.
No hospitaly was offered or requested.",4,2020,08,08
121,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!,We stayed here with our two children. Desmond was so professional and took care of us throughout our stay. He didn’t let us down. Younis in the restaurant was brilliant for breakfast and made us feel happy. The staycation was one of the best and this is a 5 star property. I was impressed with the service all round. We will be coming again.,5,2020,08,01
121,A memorable stay,"We stayed at The Taj Buckingham suites London with our two boys to celebrate my husband’s 50th Birthday.We were thoroughly impressed with our stay here and the service we received at this luxurious Hotel. On arrived we were given a very warm welcome and our room was upgraded to a suite. The room was very spacious, clean with great views. The room service was excellent, the service and food at the restaurant was amazing and the Birthday cake just perfect! The hospitality we received was outstanding and everyone at the hotel made our celebrations very special and our stay a very memorable one.",5,2020,07,21
121,Very well stay,"I liked my stay in this hotel very much the room was clean, spacious and comfortable.the hotels feels of a high class and it is very well located within a walking distance to many worth seeing places and 2 main tube stations. Additionally don’t forget that Buckingham palace and it’s beautiful gardens are also some minutes away. In the evening the streeet feels very quiet and dark but safe in general. My stay here was worth it and will try to come again .",5,2020,06,09
121,"Excellent location, polite British service","The St. James' Court Hotel is located a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and the St. James's Park Underground station. A fine location to base a trip to London. Each staff member we interacted with, from the front desk to the people at the door to the concierge,  was exceedingly polite and helpful in true British fashion. 
I was with a friend and we each had our own room. Initially my room had furniture that seemed dated and tattered, but my friend found it lovely and traditional, so we switched rooms. I was glad to be in a smaller room with more updated furniture and she was happy to have the larger room and traditional furniture. The bed was comfortable, good lighting in the room, plenty of space for unpacking clothing, and a fine bathroom. No problems with noise from the corridors or outside, although there must be an Underground line right below the hotel, as you could hear the sound and vibration of trains, but it was quiet enough that it didn't bother me. 
The only reason I'm not giving the St. James' Court five stars is because one evening after a long day of touring, I could not get the bathroom lights to go on. I called the front desk, and they were convinced that I was not using the different switches properly (there is a master plus individual switches). Finally they sent maintenance and the two gentlemen were able to replace a fuse in the ceiling and then things worked.
Overall, I recommend this hotel.",4,2020,04,04
121,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"Spent 2 nights in London before heading to Africa - and we loved staying at the Taj St Jame's Court. The room was lovely and spacious and the staff was welcoming. 

it was just a short walk from the St James underground stop which made it easy to get to and from the airport. 

Was also just a short walk from many of the sites such as Buckingham palace. We would definitely consider staying here again",5,2020,03,22
121,Overnight stay,"What a wonderful stay we had last Saturday, a lovely visit to see our daughter and a trip to the theatre was topped off by the loveliest of stays at this fabulous hotel.  A very warm welcome from all of the staff (especially the lovely Naomi who showed us to our room) at this hotel on what was a very strange time in London.  We were lucky enough to get an upgrade (a first for us) which meant there was plenty of room to relax and enjoy the complimentary petit fours.  We enjoyed a drink in the bar and listened to the pianist.  Breakfast was just as delicious as we were expecting with free flowing coffee and fresh smoothies and a lovely pot of hot chocolate for our teenager.
The only downside was that we didn’t have time to use the pool and spa area!
Thank you all for making our short stay feel like a mini break.",5,2020,03,18
121,Excellent hotel and location in central London,"Excellent hotel, friendly, service minded staff, excellent location central London, 10 min from central gate of Buckingham Palace. Several unique old neighbourhood pubs within 500 m.
I took train from Heathrow to Paddington, and taxi from there - both ways.",5,2020,03,18
121,hotel needs major updating. Worst bed I have ever slept on. I could feel the springs jamming into my back. The whole bed,hotel needs major updating. Worst bed I have ever slept on. I could feel the springs jamming into my back. The whole bed Sunk in the middle. Bed size was not true to size. Window cleaners banging on the windows early in the morning. ,2,2020,03,17
121,A Great Stay,"What an great hotel. We really enjoyed our time here. The hotel was in an excellent spot and had a really nice feel about it, an oasis in the middle of London. What really lifted it was the service, every member of staff were just excellent and made our stay memorable. We will be coming back to stay again.",5,2020,03,17
121,Excellent,"Repeat stay... no upgrade to a suite, but wonderful large room. 
Will stay again every time there's an offer of... otherwise it's out of my budget!
Worth the extra money when you can afford it... you wouldn't find anything else like that in London. ",5,2020,03,16
121,Would recommend!,We had a great experience staying at the Taj. Everyone was very friendly and helpful during our stay. We did the bed and breakfast package & it was wonderful.  We stayed in a ‘family room’ and had more than enough room for 3 adults. The hotel was within walking distance to Buckingham Palace.,5,2020,03,15
121,Appreciation ,"I want to compliment the GM of the hotel for the excellent hospitality. I also want to mention , Mr Karan Menaria , Associate at Hamptons . He is an asset to the organisation due to his warmth and professionalism towards his work and his attitude towards the guests . I wish him all the very best .",5,2020,03,13
121,Excellent hotel,"Lovely hotel. Everything you could possibly need in your hotel room, from toiletries to sewing kit and shaving kit.
Comfortable beds. Lovely staff, everyone speaks to you and they are all so polite and friendly yet professional. Beautiful public areas. Lovely relaxing bar. Bistro restaurant pre theatre food was lovely. We booked breakfast with our stay and I have never seen so much choice. Buffet breakfast but they cook your eggs to order and the young waiters will get you anything you need. Nothing is too much trouble
Hotel is in a lovely area and very near to Buckingham palace and Churchill’s war rooms. Also just a short walk to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Leicester Square.
I would come back in a heartbeat.",5,2020,03,11
121,Can’t wait to return,Excellent in every way. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a  hotel in central London. We were looking for a relaxing spa experience to celebrate a special occasion and were really impressed with the calming spa facilities. The interiors and decorations are so opulent and beautiful too - if you like a little luxury this is a great choice. The staff were warm and friendly. A great cocktail menu too! It’s also a real novelty being so close to Buckingham Palace.,5,2020,03,11
121,A WONDERFULLY  PEACEFUL AND FRIENDLY STAY,"Great quiet location.  Excellent service, very friendly employees.  Very clean rooms.  Handy access to the tube as well.  We had a suite which made our stay much more relaxing and comfortable.  Our six night stay was just the right amount of time -- although the weather was quite chilly.

We would be happy to stay there again.",5,2020,03,09
121,Very enjoyable stay,"A hotel who went the extra mile to make sure that my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our wedding anniversary and my birthday. All the staff we met were very pleasent, attentive and very helpful. The breakfast is excellent  and the bedrooms equipped with everything. We would stay again.",5,2020,03,08
121,Absolutely Appalling.,We are staying at the taj hotel - and we can’t explain how horrific it is. There is a function on and the music is vibrating throughout the hotel. We have been told it will finish 1am. Even though several floors high its blaring. The reception staff have been no help. The manager on duty even less help. We have booked into what is meant to be a luxury hotel with a young baby and can honestly say it would have been better in a travel lodge. The senior management need to seriously get grips on their management team and the customer service they are providing to high paying customers.,1,2020,03,06
121,Brilliant! A first class hotel,"The rooms, the staff all great. If you are considering this hotel for your stay you will not be disappointed staying here. 
Fantastic location, close to the palace and a nice suburb to walk around if that’s your thing.
A true home away from home can not recommend this hotel enough 5 stars.

P.S. have also stayed in the suites and residence. If your looking for a little extra luxury definitely worth it but don’t get put off the hotel.",5,2020,03,04
121,Service was Top Notch,"Our service at the St. James was very good.  Starting at the Front Desk where we were placed into the newer section of the hotel in a beautiful room.  The restaurant service was very friendly and helpful.  The bartenders were very friendly as well, although, service here was a little slow.  The hotel is just a short walk from Buckingham Palace.",4,2020,03,03
121,Amazing hotel,"The Taj hotel in Westminster is a stunning, warm, comfortable hidden gem just a short walk to many of the top attractions. These include Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. 

It was immaculately clean and offered a lovely pool and sauna.

The service was five star. Everyone was very professional and friendly. Special mention to Erol who looked after my mum and I so well for breakfast. He went above and beyond and is a credit to the hotel. His staff are so well lead by the way he looks after everyone and makes you feel very well looked after. Nothing was too much trouble. Thankyou Erol. ",5,2020,03,02
121,a must stay in the heart of london,"Beautiful hotel with very pleasant staff. Very near Buckingham palace and a 2 minute walk to nearest underground.
Beautiful restaurants . Stayed in premium king, gorgeous room.
not giving a 5 as long delay in our breakfast order .. but were in no rush so no harm done",4,2020,03,02
121,A disappointing Kinder Egg,"Looks great from the outside. Photographs well, but on check in hugely disappointing. The lobby is very old stylish, but beyond this place is tired. It's a rabbit warren of dirty corridors. The room was terrible. Not fit for rental. On the positive side the staff were attentive and the linens were good.",1,2020,03,01
121,Not up to the expectations set by the website,"My son and I were in London for a special occasion so I booked the Saturday night here.

We were kindly upgraded to a Queen bed, room 733. I appreciated that gesture and care. However, I would like to share that this room still wasn't up to the expectations that I had, which come from your website. 

The photographs you have of ""classic room"" are much more spacious, new, and luxury looking than the room we had. Our room served its purpose, but was tiny and not particularly nice to spend time in. It got very stuffy in the night and we did not sleep well. A Travelodge would have served the same purpose.

You might say that our actual space in the room was reasonable, however the odd layout of the room saw the 2 chairs in a small nook, immediately facing a wall at the end of a small corridor. There is really no point in putting chairs in the room at all, nobody would sit on them. It was laughable. In terms of useable space, the room was quite claustraphobic. This was disappointing compared to the photos on the website. I understand it's an old building so some rooms will be a little idiosyncratic but maybe they should exist in a different category.

Also disappointing was the fact that my son was not allowed to use the pool as he was under 16. This was not clear to us from the website, and the pool was a large part of the reason we booked at the Taj. He knows how to behave in adult environments. 

The members of staff were very nice indeed, and the breakfast was superb. It was also nice to see good quality soap products, with nice natural ingredients.",3,2020,02,29
121,Wonderful overnight stay,"Spent one night with my daughter. Absolutely wonderful, we were customer of the day with room upgrade, cocktails and lovely pudding bought to our room. The spa is amazing, cannot wait to stay here again",5,2020,02,28
121,Beautiful place and great staff,The hotel is very nice and beautiful but what really stands out is the great service provided by the staff. Duane from reception was particularly helpfull with our special requests and very kind. I would recommend this hotel and will come back here for my next visit in London.,5,2020,02,28
121,The best hotel experience we could’ve dreamt of!,"Wow! I don’t even know where to begin. To say we stumbled upon the St. James’ Court Taj Hotel was a complete blessing is an understatement. My mom and I came to London for our first time only to find out our Airbnb we had rented was not what it seemed to be, leaving us basically stranded in a new city. We were fortunate to be able to cancel our reservation and book at the St. James’ that same day. Little did we know this hotel was what MADE our entire first London experience. The staff is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve stayed the Montage, St. Regis and Ritz around the world. Particularly amazing was the manager Beata who not only treated us with the upmost service but went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and by then end of the trip, like family! We couldn’t have dreamt for a better experience, often times coming back from a day of exploring just to hang out in the beautiful lobby, talking with our favorite bartender, Taj, and sip on Tea and enjoy the best little cookies! We were in paradise and this hotel checked all of our boxes! A beautiful gym and spa, and delicious breakfast every morning were just a few of the great amenities. Our room was stunning, we were lucky to be upgraded and fresh fruit and chocolates were delivered daily. I would 100% come back and stay here, I don’t think any other hotel could top our experience - from amenities to customer service and everything in between, we loved this hotel and will definitely come back in the future!",5,2020,02,27
121,A very comfortable stay!,"I booked an overnight at St. James' Court Hotel as we were going to see 'Hamilton' just around the corner. We were hoping for a slightly early check-in but this wasn't possible. However, the Receptionist did the paperwork and said she would call us as soon as the room was ready - no call arrived but it wasn't an issue as by this time we had travelled over to Chelsea to do some shopping. When we arrived back we were given the room key to one of their suites. Admittedly, it wasn't a refurbished room and as the hotel had a power cut, there was no wifi or heating in the room until 5pm. The suite was on the 1st floor and we had no complaints  as we had loads of space in a comfortable room with a separate sitting room and large, excellent bathroom with a powerful shower. The staff were very obliging and friendly even to the extent that the breakfast Maitre d' offered to make me some toast when he saw me sit down with my scrambled egg - now that is service! The breakfast generally was of a very good quality and consisted of a range of cold meats, quality cheeses, hummus and guacamole together with a range of cereals, fruit, yoghurt, croissants etc. The hot selection was very well cooked and unlike some buffet breakfasts, actually hot. The public areas of the hotel looked to be very nice but we didn't use them as we returned to the hotel late and used our spacious room to relax until check out time the next day. It is worth calling in to a fascinating old pub called 'The Albert' just around the corner for a drink and to admire a piece of London pub history where Queen Victoria is alleged to have visited. It was also a regular haunt of MPs and Prime Ministers as illustrated by their signed photographs displayed on the stairs. All in all, we had a comfortable overnight stay at the St. James' Court. It isn't the best hotel we have stayed at by any means but it suited our purpose perfectly for this brief visit to London.",4,2020,02,27
121,Beautiful hotel and great location,"Went for business and stay as well for a weekend. Rooms were renewed, but still a bit small.

Desmond on check in was very welcoming and informative.

We arrived at 09.30 am to drop our bags and go touring but they offered us checkin, our room and a complement upgrade. The hotel was spotless and rooms very comfortable. Great location 5 min walk from Buckingham palace and 10min from the Thames attractions. If we could change one thing is to make the bistro bigger for breakfast. Arrived at 09.45 to face a 15min wait and it only go longer by 10.15. We are looking forward to our next visit to London and a return visit to the Taj Hotel.",5,2020,02,23

121,Neighbors to the Queen Elizabeth II,"We arrived at 54 BuckingHam Gate, St.James TAJ Hotel, on rainy windy afternoon, the staff were delightful and provided 1of the 2 rooms we had booked ahead of the check in time frame. Albeit the classic rooms were fine: we asked to be relocated to the executive rooms and our wish was granted. The staff are abundant and all aim to serve all visitors alike. Breakfast was terrific, beginning with in room nespresso coffee including sparkling and still water gratis. We recommend this beautiful hotel as well as it’s location, a block from Buckingham Palace and central to London’s activities.
Cheers..

The service is 11 out of 10... pretty hard to beat.. well done!",5,2020,02,23

121,"Incredible, out of this world","St James court made our stay incredibly special. I had lived in London for years and was returning for a birthday celebration and the hotel and staff did everything to make our night there so, so special. I was blown- away by the service, facilities and am really looking forward to returning-m everything from  the room, spa, food, drinks, ambiance, music was AMAZING! Thank you for making our stay so so special!",5,2020,02,22

On arrival we were upgraded and had a lovely room. The hotel was very clean. Would highly recommend!,5,2020,02,22
121,The Best Hotel In London,"We stay at the hotel about 3/4 times a year and each time we stay we love it more, we love the staff and we are always well looked after.

Our children love the hotel too, having an autistic son, it’s hard to find something he really loves and staying at the Taj and looking at the cabs and buses is something he loves. 

Easily the best hotel in London!!!",5,2020,02,19
121,Simply outstanding 5 star experience.,"As a traveler from Canada with my nine year old daughter, this place has completely eliminated my stigmas about hotels in England. In August 2019 my then 8 year old daughter and I spent a week at The Midland in Manchester. We found it snobby, Roles Royce pretentious, and flat out unaccommodating and rude. 

St James Court in London is the opposite, SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!! The hotel is beautifully appointed, with very classic design, but the staff is simply unbelievable. Extremely friendly. Extremely courteous. Warm. And very helpful. My daughter and I came to London for a Madonna concert and we checked on Thursday February 13th. Jetlagged and having arrived early, and needing to catch a desperately needed nap before the concert..... The incredible girl that we checked in with (I wish I made note of her name she was definitely European from outside the UK) found us an early check in room, but was just so polite and wonderful to deal with. This place is simply amazing. My daughter and I spent four nights here. I didn’t even need to rent a car from Heathrow airport. Location of the hotel is simply amazing. Right beside Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. Punch in your destination on your GPS, and you’re using Hyde Park as your shortcut secret LOL. We loved Soho, we loved the entire area, we got lots done and we seen many things in our four remaining nights after the Madonna concert. I have already booked concert tickets for Taylor Swift in July at Hyde Park, and we are absolutely staying here again. This place is amazing and I wish I could find more words to best describe how incredible I feel about this place. Awesome experience. Five star hotel with a five star staff everyone from top to bottom. I just wish I woke up in time to deal with this breakfast I keep hearing about, and got to use more amenities at the hotel because I hear they’ve got quite the impressive spa and restaurant situations going on. That’s OK we have July. I think in July we’re coming for perhaps a full seven days.

On a side note, their room service and food options are very good. Some of the food items we had are definitely up to par I would say. But the fish and chips at this hotel are to die for. Better than Poppies. My daughter and I must’ve had the fish and chips here at least 6 times in four days. Perfectly battered, with almost a whipped tasting tartar. Lol my goodness. Outstanding!",5,2020,02,18
121,Great Hotel and staff,"We book a standard classic room which was good the largest tv we ever had in a room. All the free extras water fruit etc were a lovely surprise.

The staff were so professional and could not do enough to make your stay any more pleasurable.

Breakfast was excellent selection of cold and hot buffet.

Thanks for making a stay really nice and we see you soon.",5,2020,02,17
121,True professionals!,"Every time I check in to the St. James Court I feel like I’m a member of the family! From the moment you walk in the door you are welcomed back with a friendly smile and professional service from the doorman, concierge, bellman and the check in staff. Naveen, the general manager, and his team, including Yunus and Diego are exceptional. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious, and offer amenities such as a safe and a small refrigerator. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Underground stations, Victoria and St. James’ Park. The bar/lounge is great for afternoon tea or a nightcap, and the Bistro is an excellent choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",5,2020,02,17
121,Fabulous fabulous ,"This hotel really is one of the best 4 stars in London. 
It is incredibly spacious and their room in particular their- was a truly beautiful spacious room with modern tea/ coffee making facilities, widescreen TV and great lighting , luxurious 3 piece bathroom suite, Comfortable bed and nice furnishings.
The breakfast on offer is definitely one of the best I have had in London hotels-Such a good variety of food, porridge, pastries and cakes, cheeses and omelettes made to order as well as fresh fruit. 
Friendly polite and accommodating staff across the board. 
The hotel is incredibly clean and of a huge size- I believe 700 rooms in total. 
Piano player in the evening, good selection of wines beverages and champagne at the bar, good coffee and a relaxing atmosphere. 
It has a lovely outdoor courtyard with fountain and the spa although quite small it was clean and has the use of sauna steam room and small pool. 
Particular thanks to Irene who was an absolute wonderful member of staff and all the breakfast staff were fantastic considering how busy it was ,they were so accommodating, Erol in particular at breakfast was incredibly lovely. 
Definite return.

121,Awesome Taj,The legendary Taj Service is well and alive in St. James Court. From early check-in to extra towels - no request was too much trouble for them. The treatments at the Jiva Spa was outstanding. A special mention for Nutee. She has magic in her hands. Parts of the hotel seem to have been refurbished. We were in an unrefurbished suite. But every thing was neat and clean and in good working order. We also had dinner in the Taj restaurant Bombay Brasserie which is in another part of London. A gracious and elegant place with good vegetarian food. Would definitely stay with them again.,5,2020,02,10
121,"Great stay, great location and superb welcome!","Highly recommend this hotel adjacent to Buckingham palace, saint james park and Hyde park. The hotel staff was most gracious and as I checked in, they broke the news to me that I was the guest of the day. A great perk as I got a free glass of wine and an upgrade of my room. Staff was gracious and the hotel was pristine. If you have limited time in London, this is the place to stay at a reasonable price. Thank you very much for your hospitality. I had a lovely stay.",5,2020,02,10

In the room is complementary water, and a Nespresso machine which is a nice touch. Breakfast was fantastic and all of the staff are really friendly. Would very much recommend staying here.",5,2020,02,03
121,Good hotel - with a couple of niggles,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay of four nights at the hotel. Our room was quiet and comfortable. It could have been improved by the addition of a power point for the second bedside table though. 
The bathroom was small and had a bath with shower over. The shower power was pretty minimal but (and this became a bit of a bugbear) the shower head was so loosely fitting in its holder that it’s default position faced the ceiling, which caused a small flood on the first use. We eventually managed to force it into an acceptable position for the rest of our stay.
Housekeeping was variable. Each day was different with some items replenished where needed and some not. No rhyme nor reason for this it seemed. 
Breakfast was good with a fair choice and freshly cooked eggs to order. However, there were several occasions when items were missing and one morning they had ‘run out’ of breakfast rolls by 7.40 am.  Really?
By far and away the best asset of this hotel is its staff. A huge thank you to them for their friendly and helpful ways. 
Despite a couple of small problems we would be happy to return for another stay in the future.",4,2020,02,03
121,Lovely,"The Taj is lovely from the second you walk up to it. The staff are so kind and friendly  a credit to the hotel. The room was big with a huge bed, tv and bathroom plus a nespresso machine. Best breakfast I have ever had and the spa was a peaceful hub in the midst of hectic museum days in London",5,2020,02,02
121,Superb staff,"From the moment you walk into the hotel you know you've picked right. Ionna on the front of desk is great and made us feel very welcome, thank you Ionna. The room was fantastic and if we hadn't already had a booked night out in front of us, I think we would have probably stayed in. Breakfast was everything we'd hoped for and more. We'll definitely be back to this great hotel. I think I've just found my favourite hotel in London. 👍",5,2020,02,02
121,Great location and amazing staff,"The St James Court offered a great spot to explore London from. Close to the tube, and also walking distance from a lot of great sites. 

The room was nice, and updated. It had modern touches like speakers in the bathroom from the TV and all the other amenities you'd expect. 

However the true highlight was the staff and level of service. From the moment you walk in everyone is smiling and friendly, but not overly so. What drove me to want to write the review was how the staff went above and beyond to help me on a special request I had made. When I asked the girl behind reception, she quickly got her manager, Sunaina, and the both of them were genuinely excited to help out with my request. It was for a simple birthday surprise, however they really took the time to make sure it was extra special and thought out. I send my thanks again to the staff for being so helpful during our stay.",5,2020,01,31
121,Hotel is recommended to stay,"A cozy and cost effective hotel with a very convenient location - walking distance from Buckingham Palace. Lively and comfortable area, various cafes and shops are close by. Hotel staff is very helpful, friendly and smiling. The rooms are a bit 'tired' which is normal as the hotel itself is not new (it's a former Crown Plaza) but the rooms are spacious (unusually for London) and clean, and also equipped with all the necessary (cosmetics, bathrobes and slippers).  Beds and pillows are very comfortable and quiet. ",5,2020,01,31
121,The best hotel. Period,"I don't even know where to begin with how wonderful this hotel stay was. The best stay in a hotel, ever. The breakfast was made fresh and warm every day, and the staff were ready to take your egg and coffee order as soon as you sat down. The quality always fresh, and the service was incredible! The rooms were spacious, the beds comfortable, the robes, slippers - everything was the highest quality and most luxurious. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place, and was sad to leave honestly!",5,2020,01,30

Brilliant welcome, staff so accommodating and gave us a few surprises along the way. Beata on reception was lovely. The hotel itself is stunning. The courtyard is very pretty. Best hotel room we have stayed in too. Newly refurbished and spacious. Fruit on arrival to room. 

We will definitely be back. ",5,2020,01,26
121,An amazing experience,"I stayed here for a spa weekend for my mother’s birthday. The hotel were kind enough to make sure that our spa treatments times were together since it was initially booked at two different times . They also allowed us to check in early as out treatment was at 12.

Staff went the extra mile and took a photo of us in the courtyard and when we arrived back in our room after our treatments they had printed 2 copies of the photo they took as well as a lovely card for my mum wishing her a happy birthday. 

Our full body massage treatments were done by Maria & Hanjit and they were amazing. Best massages we have ever had. All staff were extremely attentive and helpful throughout the weekend.

Later on the evening staff also brought a small birthday cake to our room for my mother. The whole experience was definitely worth the price and We will definitely be visiting again.",5,2020,01,26

The room was very good. I love that bed! Room is spacey enough. Bathroom is big and everything was working perfectly(!).
Breakfast sort of as usual, but staff makes the difference. Once you look around the waiter is already coming to you.
Very good place! Thank you Taj!",5,2020,01,24
121,Super Fantastic Stay......A Big Thank You.,"We stayed at the hotel for a weekend break and boy were we surprised! What a lovely hotel with a top notch service levels to match.  A quiet location and very close to Buckingham Palace and all the other main London attractions.
We met up Sunaina, the hotel's relation manager after a slight issue; and she could not have been any better in attending to our issue and promptly resolving it. She was very professional and could not have done anymore to make our stay more comfortable; going above and beyond what was expected.
Certainly ALL the staff were very pleasant and always happy to greet us with a smile.
The breakfast  staff were very attentive especially Errol who could  not do enough for the guests. The variety of food at breakfast was very good and catered for all tastes; good value!
We usually stay at a another high class hotel chain and we have been converted to stay at St James Court for all our future stays.",5,2020,01,21

121,Wonderful hotel in central London,"Our weekend stay for 6 people in three rooms was a birthday suprise treat for our mum. I contacted the hotel before hand and explained the reason for our stay. 
On our arrival we were greated in such a friendly and professional way by all the staff. Our rooms on floor 2 had been recently refurbished and were absolutely superb. They were spotlessly clean, warm and provided us with many little unexpected luxuries. On arrival our room was decortated with ballons and during the afternoon we received a visit from the conciege who delighted us with birthday  delights on plates.
During our time from the room, our beds were turned down and our towels and cups were replaced without requesting, which was so kind .  
During the night a delightful Birthday card from the Hotel staff was delivered under the door for our Mum, which she was so pleased to receive.
Booking in and checking out  was speedy and all staff were very polite and efficient
The whole weekend stay was absolutely wonderful and we will most certainly be returning to St James Court hotel the next time we visit London.",5,2020,01,20

Thoroughly delightful.

121,Nice hotel - but horribly carpets,"In general the hotel have many positives, but sadly the carpets in the hallway outside mye room, and in the room, were old, dirty and smelly. The food in the bistro was ok. And the service too. Beautiful interior.",2,2020,01,20
121,Amazing hotel! Staying here made our trip away 🖤,"I booked the hotel for my husbands birthday and when I arrived I was greeted with cheer and smiling faces, my husband had already gone to a football match but I checked in and the General Manager greeted me to wish Tommy a happy birthday although he wasn’t there it was such a lovely thought. When I checked in we were told that because it was my husbands birthday we got an upgrade!!!! when we got to the room it was absolutely STUNNING we stayed in 353 and well what a treat there was balloons, a little sweet treat for us, fruit and a card by the house keeping team, such a lovely thought!

We decided to goto the bar for some drinks that night and we were greeted with a pianist and a bass player such a treat again staff very friendly if we hadn’t had dinner reservations else where I would stayed there all night it was such a lovely atmosphere!

On a quiet street with a few good places to eat and within walking distance to most everywhere we needed to go. The staff was fantastic and very attentive. The hotel rooms are nice - not spectacular- but they did not disappoint. The bar at the hotel was a solid hotel bar. It was never lively, but the drinks were good. The concierge were the best. They helped us with futbol tickets and were very responsive to our questions. If there was any negative to the hotel it was that the cleaning staff did not always restock our coffee or waters in the room. I would stay here again. ",5,2020,01,19
121,Wow! St James Taj Hotel,"Wow! What a fantastic stay and hotel. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. It's in a  great location and close to everything (Thames, rail stations, coach station, theaters, shopping). We stayed in the newer section for 9 days. Our room was large and very nicely decorated and well maintained. The hotel staff was very friendly, polite and helpful. We were escorted to our room and everything was shown and explained to us. They even had a bowl of fruit for us. They also left us chocolates and a desert as the days went on. Housekeeping was fantastic too. We dined at Quilon and it was fantastic. Their breakfasts were good. We had afternoon Christmas tea and it was great. They even have a wonderful spa and hair and nail salon. Thank you for such a wonderful and fantastic stay.",5,2020,01,18
121,"We have a new favorite hotel in London, The St, James Court","We traveled from Florida to London and Paris three times in 2019 and now have a new favorite hotel in London, The St, James Court.  

Each vacation lasted two weeks and the third time we discovered the St James Court.  

We were in Paris for Christmas and London for New Years so we traveled by Eurostar from Paris to St Pancras International Station In London, a short cab ride to the St James Court.

From the moment that Valerica at the front desk checked us into the hotel all the employees we encountered were perfect.  They displayed a balance of professionalism and expertise that met our every need.  

I would like to specially mention Valerica as she made a special effort to book us New Year’s Eve dinner reservations at the Hotel.  In my judgement, routine events at a 5 Star Hotel such as The St James Court are promptly administered but the true test of excellence is when a guest needs the impossible. 

We enjoyed the morning dining service and our daily encounters with Errol the dining manager, Nurgi and Kumar our waiters.   All the employees mentioned and more secured the St James Court the number one spot as my new favorite hotel in London.

We are already booked at the St James Court for one week in April 2020 and will bring four more friends with us from Florida.

Thank you again

And the adjacent Michelin-star Restaurant lived up to expectation too. We spent a night in Manchester and hotel graciously kept our luggage until we checked back in for our last 2 nights in London. Taj Hotels are consistently great!!!",5,2020,01,11
121,A truly wonderful stay,"My husband and I have stayed here for 6 days recently at St James Court. Hotel staff are very attentive and most polite.The hotel itself is centrally located to many places of interest.We were able to walk to many  attractions.You wouldn’t find a better location.The room was a recently renovated room which was very comfortable. We spent the first night in an ‘older ‘ room - described as a classic but don’t bother.Pay the extra as we did and we enjoyed coming back to this beautiful room each day. The buffet breakfast is sufficiently set up ,food is on the better side of most and staff are very attentive.The Bistro, where we dined at for three of the six days serves up really nice food ,well presented and at value prices. The fish and chips duo ,highly recommended  but not something we would usually order .But when in London ! I My husband ordered at each night as he absolutely loved it !I certainly would recommend staying here and will certainly do so again when in London next. We felt very honoured to be guests here at St James Court.",5,2020,01,11
121,Festive luxury,"We stayed here the weekend before Christmas and loved the feel of this beautiful hotel. Location is excellent for visiting the Palace, parks and shopping.

We dined at the Bistro and the festive menu was excellent. Every member of staff was warm, friendly and professional. 

We will return!",5,2020,01,08
121,Terrific Stay,Stayed with a friend at this hotel over New Year and what a great experience.  Hotel was busy however everyone went out of their way to make this a great stay.  Nice size rooms with extremely comfortable beds made for a great sleep.  Hotel large but rooms and passages very quiet.  Bar area had jazz pianist at night which was great.,5,2020,01,08
121,Tajness-That’s what they call Indian Hospitality,"I have spent the better part of December 2019 and early January 2020 in London due to a family members illness and final demise. So I’ve had lots of time to sit back and observe unlike a typical tourist. 

I’ve yet to come across a finer hotel in London, where I spent abt 15 days, where they truly understand that the guest comes first!  Perhaps that’s what they mean when they say Tajness or indian hospitality! The staff went over and beyond to accommodate every single request without a single complaint. I have not heard to word NO or we cannot! 

Naveen Sikha, Sunaina, U accommodated us knowing the family trauma we faced. U allocated the most comfortable rooms, offered room service beyond the norm, catered for special meals, and gave out free hugs.

The breakfast staff at Bistro, the older man Errol, u remind me of my dad with ur care every morning, concerned that we’ve eaten.  Antonio the tall young boy...U go out of your way to prep and request special Hindu meals. The 2 Indian boys as well, at your beck and call watching if u need a knife or extra juice. Diego the front bellboy, he addressed me by my name when from a previous visit when I checked in. The ladies at reception with an ever so friendly welcome after returning after a long day. Those little things are priceless! 

Location is absolutely convenient with St James and Victoria Station a few min walk. Food is readily accessible. Shopping a street away. Marks & Spencer and Nandos are 350m away. I would sit at Buckingham Palace almost daily and ppl watch barely 500m away. I walked to Westminster on Parliament Street to watch the London Parade on NY day. In fact I even walked to the River Thames and London Eye abt 15 min walk. Everything is easily accessible and safe...I even walked alone outside after 9pm-10pm. 

I would always come back to experience my Tajness! ",5,2020,01,05
121,Superior service and great location,"My husband and I stayed at the St James, Taj Hotel for several nights in mid December, before the Christmas crush. The hotel staff from beginning to end was fabulous. So welcoming and friendly.  Even as I was leaving the hotel for the airport, a very thoughtful female door assistant held an umbrella over me as I carried handbags, etc. all the way to the car door. I certainly hope the staff is truly as happy and satisfied as they all appeared to be. The breakfast staff even remembered the names of small children who were traveling during this time. The hotel was spotless and is located on a very quiet street only two blocks from Buckingham palace! We had requested a ""quiet"" area of the hotel as we were not sure about any street noise. We got a wonderfully recently renovated room which was much larger than we typically see on our travels. Definitely quiet. The hotel appears to be comprised of several very old adjoining structures so there are some winding hallway walks to and from the lobby. We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay there again. Also, the St. James Underground is a block or so away from the hotel door. Well Done, St. James Hotel!",5,2020,01,05
121,Wonderfully friendly and helpful staff,"Staff were really lovely throughout the hotel, choice of food at breakfast was great, room really comfortable and the location good - cocktails went down a treat! 
Will definitely book to go there again",5,2020,01,05
121,Cosy and Comfortable Stay,"The hotel is well located in the heart of London in the close vicinity of Buckingham Palace and Westminister. The closest tube station is St. James' Park, all within the walking decision. The service and hospitality is very good too. We were lucky to find it cheap when we booked it a week back.",4,2020,01,05
121,"Great location, stay in the new wing","The new wing is quite lively, very quiet with modern rooms, albeit they are typically for London, small. The place is a bit of a maze, but it's kinda fun exploring it. Service staff are good. Location is very good. I'd have rated the hotel 5 stars albeit for a problem that meant we had no running water on the morning we were checking out. We had to walk across to the old wing in bath robes in order to shower in an old room (which is why I say to stay in the new wing - experienced both). Makes me wonder how a hotel can actually lose water and what that says about its engineering, when the old wing seemed fine. 
The Bistro downstairs has lovely food (pictured is an amazing dessert they served for NY Eve); it impressed far more than most hotel bistros do. Overall pretty impressive and despite the water problem, the hotel is a good one. ",4,2020,01,03
121,Great spot for nightcap cocktails,Although we stayed at the hotel next door we were sure to end our days of touring London in the lobby bar at the Taj.  Beautifully decorated for the December holidays.  Just festive enough atmosphere with comfortable seating for conversation.,4,2020,01,01
121,"Lovely hotel, great food, great spa, SPECTACULAR service!","My family of 5 just finished a stay at the St James Court and we had a splendid time. The hotel is wonderful. The food and restaurants are fantastic. The spa was great (ask for Maria - she was great). And the Service was spectacular, especially the concierge. We arranged for tours, car rental, and mail service through the concierge. They made our trip even more enjoyable. I would definitely go back. ",5,2020,01,01
121,"Christmas Stay, Elevator Was Being Serviced","Stayed here 12-22 to 12-28, over the Christmas holiday. Here's the low down on what I experienced.

Elevator Out Of Service: There are 7 floors and two front elevators service all 7 floors. We only had two working elevators about 3 hours worth of time when we were there. A sign in the lobby said 'Preventative Maintenance' at first and then just that it was out of service. In the 6 nights that we booked 4 rooms, I never saw anyone attempting to work on the elevator. This meant very long wait times, sometimes 8-10 minutes to go up or down depending on the time of day. Luckily we were at the top, but regularly we'd stop with a full elevator on the 2nd floor and the people would have to wait. It totally sucked.

Maid Service: I used all of the bars of soap so I left for the day to have my room cleaned. I was out of soap so I expected a new bar to be left. Nope. They cleaned the room but did not refill my soap. I had to ask the front desk. Never happened at a hotel before.

Breakfast Buffet: Included with the price of the rooms was a delicious breakfast buffet. Probably one of the better hotel breakfasts I've ever had and it was ready early in the morning for us every day.

Shower: The shower was positioned weird. I could not turn the shower on and adjust the temperature without being in the shower. Made it difficult to get a good temp setting before getting in.

Location: Very close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Street, and a ton of pubs and local dining options. The river was a short walk and I felt like we were connected to everything without needing a taxi.",3,2019,12,31
121,Beautiful hotel in central London,"We had a wonderful 2-night stay at the St James Court just before Christmas. Loved the hotel--room was modern, spacious and comfortable, lobby areas very festive and decorated for Christmas, and a superb  breakfast buffet. Hotel staff were very attentive and tried to accommodate every request. Great communication before our stay. Location is great--short walk to shopping, dining, and sights.I thought the pricing was very fair for what is essentially a luxury hotel. Recommend highly!",5,2019,12,29
121,Good but a fee snags,"I stayed here over Christmas.  The hotel was very good but taking the price into account maybe not excellent.  All the staff were charming and helpful.  One of the lifts at the front being out of order the whole time was an irritation as although there was at least one more at the back I couldn't find it from the inside and the member of staff who offered to help took me all the way back to the front one.  It sounds rather snobbish but I felt there should be a separate staff/luggage lift, with one out of order the lack of one was very noticeable.  
The breakfast  buffet was good and I thought well managed in times of high demand.  Getting some snacks on arrival was also appreciated.
The vitality pool was a bit strange and I would have preferred a standard swimming pool.
I was surprised not to be able to get BBC4 on the room TV as it is a freeview channel.",4,2019,12,28
121,A dream,The staff took amazing care of my husband and me during our stay at the hotel. There was not one form of service that we had any complaints or disappointments about. Beautiful and central to everything in the city! Perfect honeymoon.,5,2019,12,28
121,Underwhelmed sadly (but lovely staff) ,"This hotel was lovely in so many ways and in a gem of a location, but it just didn’t hit the mark for the price point / star rating. Let me say however that all staff were great including Beata at Reception (thank you) and clearly working their socks over over the busy festive period. 

The main lobby / reception area was beautifully decorated. The price of a coffee at Hamptons a bit crazy (£20!!). 

The hotel owned restaurant Quilon is great. 

Executive rooms furnished well but rather on the small side and a badly sealed shower door meant a wet floor. No turndown service but that’s not a big deal. Full suite of channels on TV was good. Good lighting too. 

The second floor smelled bad - a damp, dank, sulphurous odour. 

One of the two lifts was out of service throughout. 

Breakfast was not brilliant though I appreciated the Indian touches such as the parathas. Cold and hard bacon, limited pastry and cereal choices and slow (though friendly) service made it a bit of a poor overall experience. 

If management raises the bar a bit I’ll return! ",3,2019,12,28
121,Highly recommended,Highly recommended 👍 bistro Waiting staffs service are excellent. Gym is 24 hrs. Jacuzzi is ok. Lovely courtyard. Experienced the Alice in Wonderland at Kona restaurant. Will definitely book again  soon ,4,2019,12,27
121,Just the PERFECT hotel for my 1st London trip. Superb location and amazing staff all around the hotel.,"Its just an amazing hotel!! Though its an Indian group, everything about it is English. The service is par excellence and their breakfast spread is just TOO GOOD. I had a long stay at this hotel for 10 nights and hence the buffet breakfast got a tad boring after a few days. But the staff made it sure that i was offered one Indian dish of my choice every day. Food was excellent at their restaurant.
The location is very nearby to Victoria street at one end and Buckingham palace at the other. Uber was always available in a couple of minutes. Its in the heart of London and nearby to Underground as well as bus stops.Hyde Park, Westminster, Oxford etc. all nearby.
I was there to celebrate my wife's birthday and they made it sure that the cake was in my room at midnight though i informed them at 10.30 pm in the night.
There were few drawbacks in terms of bathroom maintenance and air conditioning.",4,2019,12,27
121,Staff are obsessed with Customer satisfaction,"Booked a stay here to celebrate our first anniversary, initially was disappointed with the room as I requested a room on a higher floor, when I notified Mekdes about my disappointment, she has gone out of her way to find a better room in a newly refurbished wing and to make our stay and anniversary memorable. Great customer service seems to be an obsession of the staff here, and was evident in every step of the way at this establishement. Now I'm looking forward to more visits here and at their other Taj properties.",5,2019,12,23
121,"Comfortable stay at well located St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel","The hotel is well located near a Tube Station and close to Buckingham Palace and nearby parks. It is well managed. The staff is courteous. They provide complementary drinking water in the rooms in glass bottles which reduces plastic use. A traveler should politely ask for what is required and not hesitate. They responded to most requests. 
However for just empty plates for use during stay the hotel staff wanted to charge an exorbitant amount . This is surprising. During frequent travel across many countries over 20 years no hotel has ever proposed charging a fee for empty plates to be used during stay. 
It is suggested that the Hotel focus less on flashy decoration and opulence and more on the requirements of travelers.",4,2019,12,22
121,Truly magnificent!!,"First time at this beautiful hotel but definitely not the last. The manager upgraded us on arrival to a beautiful modern suite. The hotel itself is a bit magical, the staff are completely professional as well as being, kind thoughtful. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,12,22
121,Fantastic 50th,"I booked a night at the St James as a surprise for my wife's 50th birthday and it was everything and more than i hoped it would be.

We arrived around lunchtime and were greeted by the doorman who asked for our details and on giving our names I was told we were ""guest of the day"" This included a certificate (a nice keepsake( and a free champagne cocktail each in the bar.

The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. We were on the first floor and had a lovely view over the courtyard and fountain. The bed was amazingly comfortable.

We had afternoon tea at the Kona which was superb. The breakfast the following morning was also excellent and before checking out we used the spa which was a great way to wind down after a busy day the day before.

For a special occasion I would highly recommend the St James.",5,2019,12,22
121,A Lovely Property!,"All in all, a wonderful stay.  This is a beautiful hotel.  The lobby is posh, comfy and inviting.  The restaurant offers a bountiful breakfast. Zoltan was so professional, yet cordial and welcoming.  Ksenia took wonderful care of us each morning...we never had an empty teacup.  Our Room was spacious, well appointed, immaculate and wonderfully quiet.  We were in a newly renovated area of the hotel, and although it was a little bit of a walk from the lobby, it was worth it!  The hotel location was fabulous. The front door staff were always helpful and kind.  The hotel is a short walk from almost anywhere....either by tube or attractions.  All in all....the St. James Court was an excellent choice!",5,2019,12,18
121,Christmas shopping ,"A friend and I had an amazing time at this hotel, we were upgraded to a bigger room and received complimentary drinks on arrival,the staff were all so helpful and the service exemplary . We will be returning ",5,2019,12,18
121,A short stay,"The room was lovely. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel, staff of the hotel was helpful and generous.The Christmas decoration inside the hotel was mesmerizing. The hotel gives you the vibes of British culture and living. ",4,2019,12,18
121,"Cold showers, broken coffee machine etc...... otherwise a very nice hotel if everything works","Check in was good, received an upgrade. Wanted to have a coffee in the bar but due to a venue no coffee machines was in the bar (!!!).
Had a workout in the wonderful gym, however had to go via the courtyard as the internal corridors were a labyrinth.
After my workout I wanted to shower (obviously) however the water was cold. At reception they mentioned I would be fixed asap.
Went to bed, slept like a princess, however nobody called me for my wake up call, then I wanted to make a coffee and the coffee maker was broken.
Well, then a shower...... that was ice cold. AGAIN!
At reception I had to move heaven and earth but no rooms available so I had to get dressed, pack my bags and had to go outside to an adjacent appartment building to take a shower. 
4 star hotel and everything went wrong. They promised to refund me but I am still waiting for that to happen......",2,2019,12,18
121,Perfect London location and great service,"I really liked this hotel and loved the location. They are upgrading rooms.
A really good value and easy walk to buckingham and close to parliament/Big Ben.
A+ concierge services.
Rooms were spotless but on the small side which was not unexpected.
Close to Victoria station which made getting out to Wimbledon to visit friends very easy and convenient to trek out to premiere league game at London stadium-
Fantastic experience.
I was nervous about getting tix delivered to 
Hotel- but, no worries with this concierge staff....
I will come back for sure. Great hospitality-as it should be-in a nice and quiet location.",4,2019,12,15
121,Very nice London hotel,"What a lovely hotel. We were in a new area of the hotel and the room was lovely very spacious ,clean & comfortable bed. Our room overlooked a very nice courtyard and it was very quiet all night unlike most London hotels. 
There was a very good live jazz band playing in the bar and we also got to enjoy the Spa in the morning. I hadn’t expected this hotel to be as nice as it was a nice surprise. 
Easy to walk to from Victoria station",4,2019,12,15
121,"Such a great welcome, great room service and stay THank you","I was using this hotel for an overnight stop from Toronto to Tel Aviv I received and upgrade and the best of everthing.  Shower was excellent comfy bed and a great bell boy service. 

Dont be put off by the location and the size its very freindly and personal.",5,2019,12,15

121,A Taste of Buckingham Palace,"The service was excellent and I received a discreet attention all the way through. I was pampered and cared for as a King. The location was well suited for business within the centre and well serviced by taxis and the underground trains. The underground station is very close and convenient. The area is pleasant for a walk on the Green, for shopping and for a variety of good restaurants. ",4,2019,12,13
121,"Good location and hotel, with an old-fashioned touch","The hotel has a great location and is hosted in a beautiful building. Staff are extremely nice and service is excellent. The room was very clean and spacious and the toiletries of extremely good quality. The style is a bit old-fashioned though, and I prefer more modern hotels. But overall very pleasant experience.",4,2019,12,12
121,Luxury hotel,"We stayed here a number of years ago and loved everything about it.  The rooms are comfortable, the building is quite historic, the restaurant serves great food and the courtyard is enchanting. It’s so nice and close to everything and really convenient to the Underground",5,2019,12,11
121,Pre Christmas break for two.,"We have stayed at this lovely hotel before and received a very warm welcome back .
On arriving at the hotel our car was taken to a secure car park by a very nice gentleman and then we proceeded to the reception desk. Our room was on the top floor, the seventh floor and we were not disappointed. There was a small entrance where on the left hand side was a long mirror and places to rest our suitcases. Also a wardrobe with adequate hangers. Straight ahead was the excellent sized bathroom with plenty of toiletries, a bath with shower, wash hand basin with a mirror and additional magnifying mirror and a WC. The bedroom was on the right hand side and it had very comfortable pillows, really soft!. Alongside was the bed with two bedside tables, lights and a small reading light on each side and a dressing table with chair and mirror. The television looked new and the sound and picture quality was very good.

There was bottled water and a small coffee machine and also a bowl of fresh fruit for us as well. During our stay we had breakfast at the hotel which was very nice. I had breakfast from the a la carte menu which I enjoyed very much. We enjoyed the apple juice and Eggs Benedict especially. We also dined in the restaurant twice and I really enjoyed the Lamb Curry with rice especially. It wasn’t too hot, just right for my palette., yet very tasty!.

All in all the staff and hotel were excellent . We look forward to returning once again.",5,2019,12,11
121,"Good location, gorgeous hotel","The location is good as it's not far from St James Park and a fairly short walk from Hyde Park.  Near some local tourist attractions (Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster) with some decent restaurants and local pubs around.  The hotel is beautiful and staff are very friendly, professional, helpful and courteous.  Price was reasonable for the area and definitely justified the value.  Overall, I'd recommend it if you're planning on visiting the area.",5,2019,12,11
121,Surprise for my 20th birthday,"We went to the hotel from the 9th of December until the 10th (1night). It was for my 20th birthday with my grandma.
The welcoming was wonderful with the concierge and after with Irene (receptionist). We waited the room for 15m because we were here around 10am. The hotel putted 4 ballons in my room with a amazing text. We also had a free cake in our room with ""happy birthday"" on the plate.
The room was amazing, very clean and huge. The hotel is fantastic with amazing staff : very polite, kind etc.the breakfast is huge : bread, English breakfast, hot drinks, fruits... 
I recommended 200% this hotel and I hope to come again one time.

Thank you everyone!!!",5,2019,12,10
121,Excellent,We had a wonderfull stay at this hotel. Renovated rooms are big and spacious. Service is excellent. But breakfast area too small. Long queues in the morning. But the quality of the food was excellent.,5,2019,12,10

121,Amazing Hotel,One of the nicest hotels I’ve had the pleasure of staying at. Extremely close to all of Londons top attractions. Very kind staff who are very willing to help with any questions. Easy check in and check out process. Would absolutely recommend.  ,5,2019,12,08
121,Very nice hotel with great ambience in London,"The hotel has a very efficient check in and out process.
Breakfast selection is great.
There is also a spa at the hotel with sauna for free.
The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated.
Since I have stayed at this hotel before I was offered an upgrade for free to a junior suite by Duane upon check in - very much appreciated (this room was awesome)!",5,2019,12,08
121,"Superb hotel, very competitive pricing and excellent location","This is our first choice hotel in London. We have stayed several times and have sampled all rooms from the standard to the superb Master Suite, and all are spacious and comfortable.
The staff are excellent and can't do enough to help. The included buffet breakfast in the Bistro is very good, but be aware that if you arrive after 0930 at a week-end you may have to wait for a table.
If you would like a 5* luxury hotel in London, superbly located, at significantly less cost then the Ritz/Savoy (but just as good) then this is the hotel to choose.",5,2019,12,08
121,Best staff in London,"Excellent stay, beautiful hotel, exceptional staff. What stood out the most was the service we received. Ciara at reception performed a tiny miracle to get us a spot at an already-booked high tea, which was the highlight of our trip. And Richard at Kona helped set us up a gorgeous high tea  in a creative area, which just warmed our hearts. Also shout out to Amit and Gabriela for taking such good care of us as well. We will certainly be returning to the Taj, solely because of the work by these exceptional people, who have managed to turn us into long time loyal customers. Thanks for the experience!",5,2019,12,08
121,Wonderful experience,"We last came to this hotel 24years ago to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was wonderful then and even  better today. We arrived early and were told that we were the guests of the day and received an upgrade to our room along with a complementary cocktail or wine and lots of other goodies. What a treat. Our room was beautiful and spacious and throughout the hotel the level of service and attention to detail was second to none. 
We arrived back to the hotel quite late from our trip to the theatre and took advantage of our complimentary drinks. Excellent selections of wine and generous glasses. Breakfast in the morning was excellent. Attentive but not pushy waiters and a wonderful selection to choose from the buffet. The food was delicious. Cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. I hope we will be back soon",5,2019,12,06
121,Yes - could get very used to this.,What a gorgeous hotel. The service was exceptional from the reception desk to the waiting staff at breakfast. The room was well equipped and the bed was so super comfortable with the highest quality sheets. I’d be back in a heartbeat.,5,2019,12,06

What a truly amazing hotel, room was above expectations, food was scrummy and the staff were welcoming and very attentive. I would highly recommend this hotel.

121,First Taj stay hope not last,All staff were great. Very friendly and went out of way to help. Good location away from hectic areas but easy walk to them. Loved ending each night at the lobby bar .  Rooms not spectacular but good value.   Breakfast buffet good and well run ,5,2019,12,03
121,Perfect in all ways,"Great location. Great food. Great service staff. Great value.  This was an outstanding hotel. We had one minor issue: Our room lights failed one morning and by the time that we returned from breakfast, everything was working again. ",5,2019,12,03
121,Fantastic diamond in Taj crown,"First time visit to the Taj hotel in London but have had the lucky experience of staying at the Taj Excotia in Maldives some years ago. This hotel had the same relaxed feeling as soon as we arrived. Really pleasant staff, nothing too much for them. Biggest surprise was that they serve at breakfast chicken sausages which for patrons that are non pork eaters is fantastic. Bravo to the Taj!
Perfect location around corner from St James underground station. Well done Taj",5,2019,12,03
121,Fantastic experience,"We highly recommend a stay at the St James Court Taj Hotel. Our stay was an absolute pleasure from arrival until our departure. Door man, concierge and reception staff made for an excellent greeting. Bar staff and breakfast staff continued our positive experience. The room was a very high quality and little touches made our stay even better. Location also perfect for our visit. ",5,2019,12,02

very good stay, very good home desk, a very comfortable standart room a very good breakfast, can not be sweet enough! Special mention to a manager of the breakfast room who advised us a great store to find beautiful wooden Christmas items.",4,2019,12,02
121,Home from home,"I have stayed at this hotel on at least a dozen occasions now and it’s just lovely. Old fashioned in some respects and classy in others. 
Once one has worked out the renovated rooms are bliss and avoid the old rooms it’s fine. The reception is vibrant and friendly. So many are in comparison new, Stark and characterless. 
The ladies at reception are always helpful and welcoming, particularly Irene and Nihitha. They have made the difference between a pleasant stay and a truly memorable one. 
Location is ideal for both knightsbridge and the west end. Parks close as well. Car parking isn’t ideal but that’s to be expected with an old building with no basement facility. 
Having done the homework on alternatives I rarely stay anywhere else.

121,Felt like a railway hotel,"Although 51 Taj(in the same premises) is one of the fantastic hotels, this the other hotel in the same compound and of the same group isn’t anywhere close to it. There is a railway line going under it and in certain rooms you will hear train sound and vibration every 2-3 min. So you need to be very careful in choosing the room. I couldn’t sleep for 2 hours and then finally my room was changed.",2,2019,11,30
121,A gem of a  hotel.,"We were absolutely blown away by the whole experience of our stay in this delightful hotel.
The atmosphere was very welcoming and the customer service from being checked in, to our last breakfast in the Bistro and then checked out was outstanding.
Every member of staff had a friendly greeting for us even just in passing.
We loved the room, loved the staff, loved the breakfast.
We will be back!",5,2019,11,30
121,Great Experience in London,"We stayed three nights at the St. James Court and enjoyed it very much. We are walkers and the location was very good, right near Buckingham Palace and St. James Park, as well as the St. James Park tube station. The hotel staff was extremely welcoming and the check-in process very easy. We were accompanied to our room by a member of the hotel staff and our bags appeared shortly after. While not the largest of rooms, it was quite nice and enough room for our needs. The lighting was quite good (unlike the hotel we stayed in when visiting Porto earlier in our vacation) and the bathroom was very nice and not too small. One very nice feature was a variety of plug types so I could plug in my phone and iPad without a converter. The bed was comfortable but, it was a fake king size. Two twins put together with the resultant crack down the middle. Very noticeable when sleeping. One thing we were not thrilled with were the pillows. Way too soft, as seems to be the common theme with European pillows. We had booked theater tickets in advance of our trip and were mortified when we checked to see which show was for that evening and which for another evening that I had accidentally booked both shows for the same evening. I ran down to the concierge desk seeking help, but not expecting success. The concierge calmly noted my predicament and called the two theaters on my behalf and, to my total surprise, was able to talk one of them into changing the date of my show without extra charge. He was wonderful! We pre-paid for breakfast each morning and it was very good although the selection could have been better. Overall, we were quite pleased with our stay and would not hesitate to stay there again on our next visit (our daughter now lives in London so we will definitely be back), but would like a real king size bed and not a fake one.",4,2019,11,28
121,Wonderful stay at this luxury hotel in great location,"I was already looking forward to experiencing a stay in the hotel having walked past many times on my way to work. When I arrived I was very happy and lucky to have been selected at random as the guest of the day!!! I was lucky enough to receive an upgrade to a junior suite and greeted very warmly by the duty manager. The room and everything about the hotel, including the warmth and politeness of the staff was amazing. This is a glorious, wonderful, classic style hotel with lovely staff.",5,2019,11,27
121,Avoid,"Just a warning that you need to be careful when selecting the type of room at booking. 
We apparently booked a classic room and this translates as very old fashioned, pretty shabby, run down and clearly not had a refresh in many years. 
We moved rooms after complaining to hotels.com, but it’s exactly the same as the first- just this time with a view of the terrace. It stinks of old cigarette smells. The bathroom was just so bad. Pictures attached. 
We stayed in room 637 and the noise coming from the pool was terrible until it closed but this was replaced with a loud noise which sounds like a generator pulsing every 30 seconds or so. The bed also vibrates a long with the noise. Not sure if it’s the lifts or air conditioning units?
As soon as I walked in I called down to request a more modern room but they wouldn’t help as we had apparently booked a classic room.
It’s usually a treat to stay in a 4-5 star hotel but I wish I’d stayed at home. A premier inn would be a better bet. 
I’ve also started itching........",1,2019,11,26
121,This place was wonderful!!,"I highly recommend staying at St James Court. Service was wonderful and rooms so comfy. Also, everyone was friendly and helpful. Nice part of London. We will definitely stay there again when returning to England.",5,2019,11,26
121,2in1 vacation - being in UK and India at the same time,"The hotel has very luxurious at first impression - the facade, lobby, staff, location. I enjoyed it very much but there are a couple of things that need more attention or reconsideration in my opinion. 
Our room was really nice, but the thing that didn't fit in the atmosphere were the thin, not very insulated windows, that made the room really cold. I know the answer to that would be to turn on the heating, but in today's energy-sufficient mindset, the windows should be reevaluated.
I loved the idea of the gym being in the hotel experience package and it had really good equipment also. Considering that people who stay there are on the wealthier side and presumably take care of their health, meant that the gym was really packed around 8 am. So I would make a suggestion to enlarge the gym space so people don't have to go back to their rooms after entering the gym, because there is no free equipment to use or enough space.
Being a vegan it is always interesting to see what the hotel's morning buffet has to offer for me. I did not have to dissapoint - there were fruits, hummus and even vegan crossaints! Although I had to wonder, were the pastry selection in top of the crossaints also vegan because they were also seen in the non-vegan pastry selection. The thing I missed in the morning, was some plant-based milk that I could have had with some cereal and in Europe I don't usually come across it being missing.
These are the few and only things that bothered me a bit, but not to the extent that it would ruin the lovely, care-taking, 1st London experience I had :)
And lastly, thank you to Duane for a lovely welcome at the reception and for upgrading our room!",4,2019,11,26
121,Fantastic!,"A fantastic experience from the moment we arrived until the time we left. On arrival we were greeted by Irene who advised us we had been chosen as “the guests of the day!”. Irene explained what this entailed which included a free upgrade & a welcome drink at the bar….what a result!
Every member of staff we encountered were the most polite & helpful kind you could wish for, nothing was too much trouble. 
The room was stunning, comfortable, clean & looked almost brand new. If ever we
go back to central London for another break we would certainly stay here again. Could not fault anything about this hotel",5,2019,11,25
121,A Pleasant Place,"I love staying here. It is very close to Victoria which allows me to move North or South quite quickly and reach all central locations. I like the quiet character of Buckingham Gate with little bars and cafes on hand and you can reach high street shopping easily. The hotel is an oasis of calm with an air of luxury and old style charm inside.
the staff is efficient and everyone courteous and respectful. The executive room was well furnished with a beautiful bathroom and I felt 'at home'. I could stay longer but usually it is one night only. I return often and will do so in future. ",5,2019,11,25
121,Excellent,"The hotel is great, and on top of that the service was perfect. I have been received by Duane who was so nice and helpful while checking us in. Thank you so much, we'll be coming back with my family next time !",5,2019,11,25
121,Excellent service in beautiful historic setting,"Our group of 6 adults agree that the outstanding service at this hotel tops all hotel experiences! Each employee/all roles/ day and evening, provided seamless, efficient, friendly service. Standouts were the Concierge group- readily available for acquiring tickets and reservations, the doormen and front desk- so welcoming and efficient, the servers in the Bistro and lobby bar- once again friendly and prompt. The rooms are large, immaculate and furnished beautifully. This historic hotel and courtyard are preserved to highlight the past, while updated for a clean and bright aesthetic. The management people were very visible and hands-on, adding to the friendly and competent environment. ",5,2019,11,24
121,THE BISTRO AT ST. JAMES COURT,"My name is Jim Hohmann, and I stayed from 11/13/19 to 11/18/19. I am writing this review under my wife's travel account.The Bistro has an excellent breakfast buffet. The food and service are superb. Errol was particularly courteous and helpful with seating, food, coffee refills, and a newspaper. This is a breakfast not to be missed.",5,2019,11,24
121,Excellent location and staff ,"Arrived early morning after a long cross Atlantic flight. Was greeted by Valerica who owned our checkin process and made sure to followup w housekeeping and others to get us a room to rest after a long journey. 
Excellent location w proximity to everything you want to do or see in London. ",5,2019,11,24
121,Perfect Stay!,"I have been telling all of my friends and family about this hotel! What an enjoyable stay; extremely well organised and clean, staff are very friendly and polite, the room size is good and the price is very fair for central London! We are definitely booking again! 
Ps: I don't actually work there, promise! Just been very impressed!",5,2019,11,22
121,Great Hotel,"Phenomenal Experience. Good Food, great service and relatively economical. Very friendly Staff. Would highly recommend this hotel. Quilon is a South Indian Michelin star restaurant which is right next to the property.",5,2019,11,22
121,Disappointed ,"We had pushed the boat out to stay at a smart hotel but honestly think we’d have been better off in a Premier Inn. Our “classic” room was small, in need of redecoration and down a nasty corridor. Our cutlery wasn’t cleaned properly and even the loo paper was cheap - unlike the breakfast which was £25 unless booked in advance. Tip - go the Pret just opposite for a good breakfast for £7. Not a happy experience, but redeemed in part by lovely staff and a great location.",2,2019,11,21
121,Superb Service and Great Location,Last week we enjoyed an extended weekend in London. St. James’ Court was the perfect home base. It is ideally located near the St. James’ Park tube station and is a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Sloane Square. Westminster Abbey is also nearby. The service at the hotel was top notch - our room was spotless; the concierge helped us to get theatre tickets; everyone was helpful. We also loved the complimentary breakfast buffet - a great way to start the day. I would stay there again I in a heartbeat. ,5,2019,11,19
121,Fantastic Hospitality,"I arrived outside the hotel and was warmly greeted by the doorman. Upon arriving at the reception desk, I was immediately taken care of by one of the many helpful receptionists. Check in was quick and easy and I had my room upgraded as part of the process. The room was outstanding, clean, hi-tech and very comfortable. 
The bar staff again were very polite, helpful and efficient. 
The hotel is located very close to Westminster. I would have no problem recommending this great hotel and intend to use it again myself.",5,2019,11,17
121,Best Service and Food in the center of the city,"Taj is always great experience and it was again proved the same way. I can't imagine staying anywhere else if I am in London and it was proven again that it delivers be it service, food or experience. The location is in the center and going around as a tourist is very east",5,2019,11,17
121,Amazing Stay,"Amazing overnight stay.  On arrival we were informed we had been chosen as ""guests of the day"" giving us a complimentary upgrade to a beautifully refurbished room and a drink in the Hamptons bar.  The hotel staff were all excellent and we have to give a special mention to Eroll in the breakfast room - so friendly, welcoming and attentive.  St James' court will definitely be our choice of hotel next time we travel to London.",5,2019,11,17
121,Overnight stay,"Wonderful stay in a fantastic hotel.
Staff were welcoming and helpful.
Rooms were Absolutely spotless.
We were Guests of the day so we were upgraded to a newly refurbished room which was immaculate and had a free drink in the bar.
We faced the inner courtyard so no street nose.
Huge shower 
Will definitely return to this hotel as perfect location for Victoria Station.",5,2019,11,16
121,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel is fabulous!!  It’s very clean and the staff is friendly, and very accommodating, they can’t do enough for you - they truly want you to have a great stay while you’re with them. Errol, in the Bistro, is the absolute Best!!  Each morning he would seat me, put a cloth napkin on my lap, bring me coffee, juice and toast!  A truly Great Hotel!!",5,2019,11,16
121,Conveniently situated for Westminster and Buckingham Palace,"Very pleasant place to stay. Very professional and pleasant staff at Reception and restaurant.
Very happy to accept a room upgrade again!
Room was very nice, clean and quiet.
Breakfast was either English breakfast or continental, and sets you up well for the rest of the day.
I have never been disappointed when staying here.",5,2019,11,16
121,A good experience,May family and I have enjoyed staying at this hotel. I liked the staff most. They were very helpful and kind. Reception desk people were always helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good as well as the service staff. Location of the hotel is good too.,5,2019,11,14
121,Great hotel in a fantastic environment,"Nice place cole to Buckingham Palace, in the very center of London. Easy to arrive using public transport. The rooms are quite modern but yet keeping the english flavour.
The best of all was the employees attitude and kindness",5,2019,11,13
121,Pleasant stay in the heart of London,"Great hotel in a fantastic location. Easy access to the tube with both St. James's Park and Victoria Stations within short walk and there are lots of shop and restaurant offerings near by. The food outlets at the hotel are great and would highly recommend Bistro. The facilities of the hotel are great, especially the gym and business centre, both of which were well equipped. The in-room Wifi was for free and was reasonably fast. Cleanliness of the hotel and facilities were excellent. Last but not least, the staff were always wonderful and very accommodating.",4,2019,11,12
121,Awesomely Classic & Wonderful,"It was a great experience. Wonderful stay, superb location and super staff. Took great care of us. Looking forward to visiting again. Nice room, convenient check in and check out. Could have had a much better placed floor & view. We were put up on the 9th floor and the room was very much inside the long lobby.....",4,2019,11,12
121,An okay stay...,"The hotel is in a good location and generally the staff/team were friendly. Was persuaded upon check-in to 'upgrade' my room for an additional £105 which I did, but I am not convinced there was much of an upgrade that happened. Strange smell in the hallway on my floor (6th floor). Bed was comfy. Bathroom amenities were nice but shower wasn't great with shower head covered in limescale. I liked that you could choose whether or not your mini-fridge was stocked by them or if you just wanted to leave it empty to fill it yourself. Wish I had been asked upon checkout 'how was your stay' - I appreciate their speedy checkout process but it would have been nice to give feedback personally.",3,2019,11,12
121,Lovely relaxing hotel for business trip,"Elegant, friendly and relaxing hotel in heart of the city; great location for meeting at the QE2 Centre.

Staff are very welcoming and professional. Room was cosy and well equipped.  
Comfortable bed, quiet hotel...good nights sleep!

Breakfast selection was very good; in choice and quality 

Spa (free for residents) was small but atmosphere very calming and relaxing.  One of the ladies also offered free hand massage in the hotel lobby; very nice.

Would highly recommend for business or couples mini-break",4,2019,11,12
121,Expensive for quality of room,a disappointing visit - the standard of room was poor as was the spa facilities - the steam room was not working and there was no shower next to sauna - excellent personal service in the hotel from staff -  the standard of room was a let down and with no preparation for us - the breakfast was extremely good and with excellent service                                                                                            ,3,2019,11,11
121,"good staff, rooms dull and dark, good breakfast","Location ist very good. it is quiet area, close to underground, bus, train and local attractions as well as shopping and pubs.
the entrance is good and inviting, staff very friendly, especially at the restaurant and concierge. Breakfast is very good.
When you come into the corridors though you see how dated the place is and the last renovation is not realy visible. We had 2 regular rooms and both had been on second floor. Very small room, windows glass milky, which makes the already small room very dark. Bathroom as good size but shower not really clarn (mould). the room just was quite a let down, as the price of the room is not a bargain at all. Yes, London prices, but at that price the room needs to be up to standard.",3,2019,11,11
121,Superb,Lovely welcome and check in and very impressed with our room. The hotel has a great location and there was no noise. Staff are friendly and the Indian hospitality gives this hotel great character. We had existing plans for our weekend but would want to come back to visit the adjoining Michelin star restaurant specialising in Keralan cuisine.,5,2019,11,11
121,Mr. B. Gaggar,"Very comfortable stay, centrally located, great supportive staff, no hassle in check in and quick check out. Very good restaurant 'Bistro' for breakfast. Good to find some of the Indian specialities like Poha, Upama, Pongal and Kachori in Bistro. Very good restaurant for Indian dining. Value for money.",5,2019,11,11
121,St James’ Court was heavenly.,"Everything about our stay was terrific. Will definitely be at the top of the list of our recommendations when family and friends stay in London. Cannot beat the location. As we travel in the future, we’ll most certainly look to see if a Taj Hotel is available. ",5,2019,11,10
121,Excellent hospitality!,"Without doubt its one of the most favorite hotels I stay in London! The staff was extremely friendly. Food was great, ambiance was amazing. All respect and special thanks to Ms. Suniana, a true sample of excellent hospitality!",5,2019,11,07
121,Seems it used to be a luxury hotel,"Shower floor was stained, appeared dirty. Pillows on couch appeared worn/tattered. Painting was falling off wall. Seems like a hotel that used to be luxurious and now has trouble keeping up with things.",3,2019,11,06
121,A truly wonderful stay at an exceptional hotel to mark a very special occasion,"My wife and I and her parents were attending Buckingham Palace to collect her CBE award from the Duke Of Cambridge. We chose to stay at this hotel due to its exceptional reviews and close proximity to the Palace and booked two rooms…. Boy did they not disappoint. 

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel very, very special and were lucky enough to be selected as ‘Guests of the day’ and received a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite. We were also invited to their lovely lounge bar to enjoy a free drink each before we headed out for dinner. What a lovely touch this was from the management and really started off our special occasion perfectly. Every member of staff at the hotel made such a great effort to make you feel welcome and were all so helpful with anything we needed during our stay. The manager greats you personally which is particularly nice and make you feel very special. 

The location of the hotel is perfect with all of the main London attractions pretty much on your doorstep and walkable from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is literally a stone’s throw away. The rooms are immaculately clean and modern and so comfortable. Breakfast was fabulous with so much choice and the quality of food was second to none.

We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and hope to make a return visit in the very near future. Thank you to all of your staff for such a perfect and memorable visit.",5,2019,11,06
121,Amazing stay,"All was perfect.
Informative staff, wonderful place, delicious restaurant.  The room is modern yet has the charm of classy luxury hotels. And my wife loved the spa and her massage.  Our address in London. We will come back soon",5,2019,11,05
121,Treated like Royalty,"Our visit to London for our daugther's CBE Investiture was magnificently enhanced by our stay at St James where were 'Guests of the Day'. Everything was perfect - for welcome at the door and at reception where we were met with kindness, smiles and respect.
We were given a guided tour of what was important to us and a complimentary evening drink!
Our room was perfect, clean, fresh fruit with all amenities. Breakfast was plentiful. Service was excellent. Nothing but praise and we would definitely return! A pity we could not stay longer!!
Thank you Sonia for making out stay 'extra special'",5,2019,11,05
121,First class hotel,"It’s hard to find anything to criticise in this hotel, everything is first class.
We were made to feel very welcome, even made ‘guests of the day’ with upgraded room, drinks, chocolates, photo......very special.
The room was exceptional, the bed extremely comfortable, super breakfast (if a bit pricey)   The public areas are beautifully appointed, but the outstanding feature of his hotel is the staff.  Every single member of staff ......friendly, professional, smiling,  A rare thing in such a high class hotel.
My only slight niggle is that all paperwork was in my husbands name, even though I made the booking, the payment etc.  I find this really annoying!
Would highly recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2019,11,05
121,Great trip. Great hotel experience.,"We were visiting London for the first time and based on price and location chose St. James Court, A Taj Hotel. We couldn't have made a better choice. The room, amenities, staff, and location made it a memorable trip, particularly having never been to London or the UK before. 
From the hotel's location we were in walking distance to Buckingham Palace, two tube locations, and generally able to walk to and from almost every location we visited; Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, British Museum, Natural History Museum, National Gallery, Sky Garden, Trafalgar Square. There's also a nice, and very loud, pub on one end of the block, then quickly realized there's a pub on nearly every block in this part of London, and a wonderful Italian restaurant down the other end of the street from the hotel. We expected closet sized rooms, and instead pleasantly surprised with the room size. We clearly did not look the part of high end business guests, which we saw quite a bit of at the hotel, but noticed how the staff treated everyone, tourists and business travelers alike, the same which made quite an impression. In particular we can't say enough about the hotel's staff and the service afforded us during our stay. We plan to return to London and stay at this hotel on our next visit.",5,2019,11,04
121,Amazing hotel in a fantastic location,"Staff - 10/10
Rooms - 10/10
Cleanliness - 10/10
Breakfast - Best hotel buffet breakfast

Really, a great experience with fantastic staff and attention to detail. And you really cannot beat the location and setting.",5,2019,11,01
121,"Definitely recommended. Location, food, rooms, service, bar. Zero complaints.","And on top of all this; during check in they brought a gift package with a balloon, a toy and coloring pens to our son, who was tired from the flight, which made him very happy. Definitely recommended.
One improvement could be to enlarge the breakfast room because there is a line in the mornings. (Buffet is amazing)",5,2019,11,01
121,Perfect in every way ,"Impossible to exaggerate how wonderful our stay was. Service was superb. We would single our Ciara one of the reception staff who treated us with such care and kindness. The hotel staff, ALL staff we encountered were so attentive. Room was gorgeous and bed linen particularly luxurious. But the stand out was the service at the hotel, cannot imagine how it could be improved. They made us feel at home in the luxury. We’ll be back. ",5,2019,10,31
121,Fabulous London base,"I was visiting London to attend a special event and it was made even more special by staying in this wonderful hotel.  The staff were without exception friendly and attentive and helped to make the stay as enjoyable as anyone could wish for.  The room was beautiful and guest areas of the hotel all very well appointed.  I was also lucky enough to be selected as 'guest of the day' making the whole experience even more special, I would absolutely return here is I come to London again.",5,2019,10,31
121,Bistro and Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel in the heart of London right on Buckingham Gate. From the doorman, Marc, to the concierge Daniel, to Yunis and Errol in the Bistro, the service was incomparable. The ENTIRE staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. It was an absolute pleasure to stay at the St. James Court Taj Hotel, and we would go back again. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2019,10,31
121,Amazing Hotel and Staff,Clean and spacious rooms. We stayed in the recently renovated room. The staff made us feel welcome and made our stay special. The breakfast was really good with lots of options. We stayed with young kids and the staff went out of their way to help us. ,5,2019,10,31
121,"Pleasant stay, great location","I stayed here for several nights while attending a conference at the QE Convention Center. The hotel room was small but pleasant, reasonably quiet.  My window barely opened - because it overlooked a teeny alley - but allowed me some fresh air.  The hotel is located over the subway (Tube) and the sound and vibration of passing trains could be faintly heard/felt in my room.  Didn't bother me but could bother some light sleepers.  The lobby is nice; the hotel breakfast room is excellent.  The restaurant next door, Quilon, is outstanding.",4,2019,10,30
121,Overnight stay,I stayed overnight at this hotel on a business trip. The hotel is ideally located. The service is good as expected from Taj and the room was comfortable. The Indian restaurant is excellent. The problem is the breakfast. At 8 am the restaurant was full and there was a queue to get into the restaurant. It took me a wait of 20 mins to get a table. This is not expected of a Taj hotel. Obviously the restaurant is not designed keeping in view the number of rooms. It reflects poor planning. This was the only issue in an otherwise perfect start. ,4,2019,10,30
121,Great experince,The location is perfect ... the Buckingham palace is walking distance .. the overall hospitality and experience was impeccable. The food at bistro was also really good ... truly felt like I was in India experiencing the countries warmth and hospitality. ,5,2019,10,28
121,Wonderful hotel in great location with perfect service!,"St. James' Court is perfectly located for travelers who want to walk to sites. It's quiet but accessible. The employees are extremely friendly, helpful and bend over backward to make you feel welcome and taken care of. The breakfast was awesome - the best mass produced scrambled eggs ever! There was a good mix of Indian cuisine and regular breakfast fare. Maintenance staff had to repair our shower and did so immediately while we were away for the day. Everyone in Concierge was truly helpful in getting us tickets to skip lines, etc. Overall a great place to stay!",5,2019,10,27
121,A nice hotel,"As Taj patrons within the country, our expectations from this property were sky high, obviously. The check-in formalities were handled smoothly, and because our room wasn’t ready (we arrived much later than our check-in time though), we were asked to make ourselves comfortable in the lobby over some coffee and cookies. It didn’t take too long, and we were taken to a nice and spacious room on the second floor. A word of advice to the people in-charge – there is a slight bump under the carpeted corridor which should have an alert sign nearby. 

The room met our expectations, though there were certain housekeeping glitches, big and small, which we have shared with the management and feel there’s no need to mention those here again. What we will say is that we know Taj hotels pay particular attention to every minute detail, so when a celebrated property like this one didn’t do so, it wasn’t a great feeling. 

On the plus side, their chicken biryani hit the spot as we were craving some tasty home food. And the express checkout option was quite a timesaver.",4,2019,10,26
121,St. James Court,"Wonderful facility would highly recommended. Great location in Westminster, Buckingham Palace was 2 blocks away. Great rooms and staff. Would highly recommend this hotel.  Comfortable, clean and very helpful",5,2019,10,24
121,Return to the Taj,"We first visited the Taj London in July 2019, we were allocated one of the newly refurbished rooms which was very good having just returned for a 1 night stay once again the Room was even better, the service & friendliness was of the staff was First Class. Having visited a number of Taj Group hotels around the world, London does not disappoint !!",5,2019,10,23
121,Beautiful properrty; very pleasent  stay,"Beautiful building, we have been upgrade in a very beautiful room; completly rénovateur. Excellent services, we enjoy the breakfast, the room, the situation of the hotel ; 5 min Walking from Buckingham palace.
Staff are lovely, we received amenities as guest of the day ; we really appréciante our stay to Taj St James,..thanks a lot!",5,2019,10,23
121,Beautiful ,This hotel is beautiful. The location is perfect for sightseeing and getting to the west end. The staff make this hotel nothing is a problem. I would definitely recommend the breakfast ( room service it’s well worth it) ,5,2019,10,22
121,"Very comfortable, great location","I'm glad I stayed here, a hotel which is not in one of the primary tourist neighborhoods one thinks of in London. It's around the corner from Buckingham Palace and a short walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament, but it's not overrun with crowds or heavy traffic in the streets. My room was updated and very comfortable, with a downright gorgeous bathroom. The buffet breakfast (included with my room, but I don't think it always is) was plentiful enough, and in pleasant surroundings. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,21
121,A wonderful hotel in Central London,"Our family had a wonderful stay there earlier this month. A short walk from Victoria station, and very close to the tube. 

All the staff we met were welcoming and helpful. The large family room with two bedrooms and two bathrooms was spotless and perfectly equipped. 

The breakfast was a highlight of every day, the waiters were so warm and welcoming and always very helpful. The food was absolutely delicious and with plenty of different choices, everyone found their favorite. The Indian dishes made it even more special, we loved the masala omelette!

We are looking forward to our next stay, hope to see much of the same staff, they really made the differance for our experience! ",5,2019,10,21
121,Perfect stay in the heart of London ,"My wife and I stayed here, and we were both very impressed by the staff and the quality of food here. The breakfast was excellent and Erol and the staff were very friendly and made our stay here very pleasant. We will definitely come back! The room was very spacious and 2 TVs in, both with chromecast. Useful for watching netflix. As you'd expect everything was very clean. Door men were very attentive which was very welcoming. I'd highly recommend a stay if you're in London. ",5,2019,10,20
121,nice short stay,"good hotel, nice and spacious room
clean even if the shower need a small refresh and turn the handle (can t open the door entirely)
i recommand even if the price for one night was high (everywhere in london when i went)",5,2019,10,20
121,Exceptional hotel and location.,"Our stay at the Taj was exceptional.  Our room was an executive king suite and had a separate bedroom and living area with lots of seating. Room had a refrigerator and great closet space and coffee and tea machines. We had an end unit with great views. 509. The room and hotel had everything we could ask for. Close to stores, restaurants and St. James underground. Close walk to Buckingham palace and Westminister abbey. Great location. We are very happy with our choice to stay at the Taj.",5,2019,10,19
121,Back...once more!!,"Back to my London 'home' once again, and had a lovely stay. From the check in, to the upgrade, to the service, to the overall experience, everything was just perfect. Thank you...Digvijay Singh, Geeta Panjabi, and the whole team at the Taj...always love coming back to you'll. Must not forget my lovely conversations on every trip with that legend, Chef Sriram.",5,2019,10,16
121,Lovely Sophisticated Hotel But Too Many Small Disappointments,"Lovely lobby, spacious room but too many small disappointments. Paint peeling & splashes of mold in shower - unacceptable. Pool closed for the 3 days we were there. (Obviously need a better pool contractor - no reason that a competent pool company so messed up the chlorine formula). Electrical outlets in room don't match our modern needs & no plug-in for women's hair appliances. Get with it - we women travel for business & pleasure! The outdoor courtyard is a lovely area to sit at night & have a drink but my friends & I were unable to enjoy it because of all the smokers. It was a cloud of smoke. The St. James should've had smokers elsewhere instead of ruining the outdoor sitting area. The spa & saunas are nice but having male staff roaming around going in & out of the staff door while you're sitting there in a towel is disconcerting. Lastly the check-in person told me I'd receive 20% off food, beverages & services because I'm a priority member. But that was not the case when I checked out. Either I was lied to or there was poor staff communication & coordination regarding hotel patrons.

On the plus side, lovely in-room tea service. Very comfortable twin beds & bed linens. Helpful & respectful doormen. Great location.",3,2019,10,15
121,A very pleasant and comfortable stay,"We were very well looked after from arrival to departure.

The staff were friendly, professional and polite.

Breakfast was excellent with a big choice  and well served. Hamptons Bar was a great place to relax after an exhausting walk in the city, a variety of choice in Cocktails and alcoholic beverages, well served.",5,2019,10,15
121,Special birthday!,"This was our 2nd stay and I wouldn’t stay anywhere else !  This stay was for me and my husband and our 3 daughters so we had booked 2 rooms which on check in were quickly upgraded and  greatly appreciated.  We had drinks in the evening with some lovely live music in the background . We just love this hotel, it has such a nice feeling and the courtyard is lovely ! We will be back for our Christmas visit soon . ",5,2019,10,14
121,BED BUGS!!!!!!,"VERY very very disappointed. I booked this hotel based on the reviews and pictures and I was not happy with my stay. Aside from the fact that my bed sheets had makeup stains on them and the rooms were moldy and old, I have pictures of bed bug bites on my legs!!! This is NOT okay St. James Court. I paid for a vacation in London, not to leave with itchy legs because you can’t keep a clean room!! I’ve never had such a horrible experience with a hotel until staying here. The only nice part of this hotel was it’s location - but I could have found a dozen other hotels that wouldn’t result in me dry cleaning all my clothes in the case that bugs crawled into them! Save yourself the trouble, stay somewhere else.",1,2019,10,12
121,Taj Hotel racial profiling,"During my check out at 5:30 in the morning, the Taj front desk agent looked at my name and asked me : ""are you a jew ? ""  

This was greatly offensive to me.

Is it Taj Hotel policy to inquire guests religion or ethnicity ?",1,2019,10,12
121,A hem of a hotel!,"A fantastic well presented clean and smart hotel. 
Good food and facilities - well equipped gym and smart pool 
Room was well serviced and housekeeping was excellent. 
Highly recommend to anyone on business or pleasure. ",5,2019,10,11
121,Great Location Wonderful Staff,"Our stay at the St James Court culminated a month long tour of France, Spain, Morocco, Portugal and the UK. We left the states with all of our accommodations settled except for London. For 3 weeks as we traveled we kept trying to settle on a place to stay in London that fit our needs. Somehow we stumbled on the St James Court and little did we know that our needs would be surpassed. Service, location and the food were fantastic. The room was large and comfortable, it was hard to leave it to tour the city it was so comfortable. ",5,2019,10,10
121,"Great Location, wonderful service","This is a fabulous hotel.  Situated very close to the Palace and well within walking distance to many of the main tourist areas, Westminster, Leicester Square, Regent Street, Covent Garden, Southbank.  You are welcomed by the doorman & offered assistance with luggage.  Taxi rank is outside.  Reception staff are professional & friendly.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a newly renovated room on floor 7, which for London was a reasonable size, beautiful decor and standard of finish. I guess they are working their way through upgrading the rooms. I saw one of the older rooms which I’d still have been happy with. The bed was so comfortable, good sized fluffy towels too! Lots of gorgeous toiletries. We ordered room service which was delivered quickly, good burger and excellent curry. Not stupid expensive either, you get what you pay for at a quality hotel. Breakfast was one of the best I’ve experienced in a hotel, the service brilliant.  The hotel was very busy, we had to wait for a table but only a few minutes, tea coffee regularly replenished at your table, offer to make fresh eggs, omelette etc.  Our group was 16 in total & everyone was impressed with this hotel.  No complaints.  We were always at concierge for one thing or another, they are more than happy to help.  I would not hesitate to recommend it. You have a lot of hotels to choose from in London, I’ve stayed at many, I personally felt my custom was valued here & it’s my new go to hotel. The friendly professional manor of all the staff we encountered just makes all the difference. Thank you Taj, will be back.",5,2019,10,09
121,Excellent Experience!!!! LOVE this hotel!,"Loved everything about this hotel. The location, concierge services and advice, front desk staff and housekeeping staff. The hotel is tucked away on a quiet side street yet steps away from Buckingham Palace, Victoria Palace Theatre and great shopping . Easy walk to all London attractions.. Westminster Abbey, The eye etc) Can’t wait to return to London and to this beautiful hotel.",5,2019,10,09
121,Excellent hotel with exceptional customer service throughout.,We would highly recommend this hotel. We were offered an upgraded room as ‘guests of the day’ including free bubbles at the bar. Special thanks to Sunaina Guest Relations and Erol and his staff in the Bistro for looking after us so well. We will definitely visit again!!,5,2019,10,09
121,"Bed bugs, mold in the showers, blood stains on sheets, faulty locks.","First and foremost, our room looked nothing like the advertisement. When we asked the concierge if they made a mistake, they said the only option was for us to pay $600 and upgrade our room. The bed had blood stains and make up stains on it and worst of all, BED BUGS. I have photos of my wife’s legs covered in bites and of the rooms dirtiness. The ceiling of the showers have small black spots on them - MOLD. On top of it all, out room lock had a removable wooden block where the lock went which basically made the lock pointless.  It’s ridiculous that we were not given another room after bringing this up to management. I’m absolutely baffled by their rating on trip advisor. How can a place that is clearly so old and in poor condition have such high reviews? We based our booking on these reviews and they completely let us down. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone due to the lack of basic cleanliness and service. This ruined our holiday. I’ll be sure to review the hotel on trip advisor and on google. ",1,2019,10,08
121,Excellent Hotel,"Great value, great location, and all the things you would expect from a Taj Hotel - luxurious, clean, and great service.  The Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.  The building itself is beautiful.  The rooms were spacious.",5,2019,10,08
121,Outstanding,From the moment we arrived we felt utterly spoilt. The stunning location and presentation of the beautiful property thrilled us before leaving our taxi. A warm and professional welcome eased our travel weariness and made us feel very special. This welcome continued with reception and housekeeping. The staff and facilities here are outstanding. Breakfast was perfect and the coffee is GREAT. A thoroughly professional and well managed property. We can not thank the Taj St James Court and it’s staff enough for our introduction the the beautiful city of London!!,5,2019,10,07
121,Stunning!!,My husband and I treated ourselves for our anniversary and what a treat it was! We stayed in the newly furnished quarter which was stunning - I didn't want to leave! We also treated ourselves to spa treatments which were absolutely heavenly. The breakfast  was also divine with continental and Indian selection. We also ate at the neighbouring Indian restaurant which was delicious!,5,2019,10,07
121,London trip,"the room was awesome and the staff was very helpful and friendly. will definitely stay there again next time we are in London. The location was central and within walking distance to most sights, also close to the tube.",5,2019,10,06
121,Older rooms are terrible,There was a window in my shower that had to be left open because steam can set off their smoke alarm.  Half of the glasses in the room were dirty.  A sweater from a previous resident was left in the drawer.  The room looked nothing like the website.  Great location but not worth the cost.  The phone in my co-workers room didn't work.  Housekeeping left a pile of towels in front of her TV and a hair clip on the night stand.  Her breakfast order card had already been completed by a previous resident.  The shower head had no water pressure - just mist - so she had to unscrew it and us the hose end.,2,2019,10,04
121,GIS and PEI meeting ,"Good facility with courteous staff in the heart of London.  Just 2 minutes walk from Buckingham palace and 1 minute walk from BMGF London office.
Clean rooms and great food especially my favourite(steam rice  with curry chicken masala)",4,2019,10,04
121,Nice & cosy,"St James’s court is a nice hotel centrally located and easily accessible. 

Although the regular rooms are old, their refurbished rooms are better, but would cost you £45 per night more. 

The staff isn’t flexible on time and work by the clock making it slightly annoying for those who’d like a late night coffee at their in house bar “the hamptons” nevertheless had a great stay there, the front office team was extremely polite and accommodating to other requests we had. 

Highlight of the hotel is the beautiful courtyard they have! ",4,2019,10,04
121,Excellent Hotel in a great location,"This hotel is beautiful and located in a very nice neighborhood and 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. Near nice cafe and pubs. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The staff was super friendly, at check in, storing the luggage, directions and hailing cabs. There was jazz on Saturday night in the pretty lobby and the place was very fun. I would highly recommend this hotel and I plan to stay there again soon.",5,2019,10,03
121,Best hotel at a reasonable price,"Wow, talk about service, these people know how to treat you special.   From the front door to reception to our room everyone was friendly, courteous and very helpful.  Ended up just eating at the restaurant at the hotel as it was extremely good and reasonable priced. Room view was not great but the room itself was fantastic. Modern and updated amenities.   Good walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.  Will stay here again when in London.",5,2019,10,03
121,5 Days in London,"I finally took the time to visit London with my wife after many visits on business. We stayed at the St. James and it was a great experience. A great location in SW1 with excellent standard room and reasonable prices. We enjoyed the happy hours and even a meal in the bar. 
",5,2019,10,03
121,Very delightful and tranquil stay in ideal London location,"

The hotel’s location is ideal both from a work perspective as well as for dining, entertainment and recreation purposes. It’s proximity to St James Park is a huge plus. The check in process was quick, and the bell captain and others offered gentle help without being overly solicitous, which is perfect. The hotel rooms are very nicely appointed, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is beautifully modern, and the rooms are quiet and well insulated and properly climate controlled. These are all difficult to find in heritage properties in central London at any price. All staff were very polite and would greet and recognize when passing through the lobby and it felt intimate compared to other busy hotels. A lovely warm stay overall. Highly recommended as a hotel when visiting London.",5,2019,10,02
121,Great Location for London,Clean hotel with friendly reception staff and great location to visit all the major sites of London.  Buckingham Palace was a short 7 min walk. Hotel Bistro was very very pricey so I recommend dining out.,4,2019,10,02
121,Overnight stop before holiday abroad,This was a really excellent hotel for our stop over stay before going to Gatwick airport the next evening. The staff were great and very obliging apart from one waiter at the bar who didn’t seem helpful or bothered. Can’t remember his name.:The food at breakfast was excellent and staff in the restaurant were excellent. Room was lovely with a beautiful bathroom and so many toiletries to choose from and good coffee and tea facilities. A very enjoyable overnight stay and excellent location for Victoria station and for the parks and tourist areas. A great stay,5,2019,10,01
121,Excellent stay as always,"One of the best and also I think for the price point underrated hotels in London.  But still Taj hospitality and service levels and everything provides for a smooth experience.
The food is also excellent especially the set lunches and in room dining.",5,2019,10,01
121,Great housekeeping,We stayed at the Taj and we had a lovely stay in one of the Classic rooms on the 5th floor and the cleaning was very good. Special thanks to Akos who helped us out to find our way to Buckingham palace and explained that we can have treatments in the hotels lovely Jiva spa for a very convenient prices.,5,2019,09,30
121,Getaway,"Our accommodations were wonderful, very nice and clean.  Staff were very polite and did a wonderful job.  The location was walking distance to Buckingham Palace.  I would definitely stay there again if I go back to London.",5,2019,09,30
121,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel.  Food, room, spa were great.  Close to everything.  Very attentive to all our needs.  Hotel was right near Buckingham Palace and major transportation.  Staff was awesome.  Would definitely recommend if going to london.",5,2019,09,30
121,Another fantastic visit,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. The check in process was smooth and efficient. The staff are friendly. Both breakfast and dinner are of an excellent standard. In Room Dining has a good selection on the menu and the team is very prompt with delivering any food or drink requested. Staff are very polite and seem happy to deal with any requests. The Premium bedrooms are of a good size with very comfortable beds.  The Jiva Spa is a great way to spend some time relaxing. The pool is a lovely temperature and the spa is extremely clean and tidy. Many thanks for a great stay.,5,2019,09,30
121,Shilpa Agarwal,Did not meet expecations one has with Taj hotels. Bathroom in particular was very small and shower did not work properly despite complaining twice. Even Suite was not upto the mark. Food quality was ok but breakfast was served in a very small Bistro.,3,2019,09,29
121,Very Nice Hotel,"The hotel itself is beautiful. Its very grand from the outside and even better on the inside. The rooms are spacious and modern. I was upgraded from a double room to a king room, the service of the staff is very good. They go to high means to make sure your stay is comfortable. 

The TV however is a let down in the rooms. They have bad channels, half of them are the News from India or other countries around the world and the other half had no service or signal so we couldnt watch them. I expected a movie list you could rent from as its a 4* hotel. There was nothing so the room entertainment was a massive let down. I also got charged £60 for the free wifi. This annoyed me massively, luckily I got it taken off my bill. Other then those two points, its a lovely hotel.",4,2019,09,28
121,Overnight whilst seeing Hamilton,"We came here during a trip to see Hamilton. 

They staff were very friendly and the room was small but had everything you needed. We went outside to the courtyard for a drink before we went out. 

Breakfasts was in the orangery, which was bright and airy. Standard fare for breakfast but attentive waiting staff. ",4,2019,09,27
121,"Superb service, handicapped friendly","Our family stayed at The Taj during a recent weeklong trip to London and can’t praise the staff enough for making us so comfortable. My dad, who is 87 and has limited mobility, was treated like a king. The manager reserved a table at breakfast every morning for us so we would not have to wait, bistro staff brought him food from the buffet so he would not have to get up, the doormen helped him and his electric wheelchair in and out of cabs, and everyone was extremely helpful and kind.

Our accommodations were first rate, breakfast buffet was fantastic, staff were wonderful. Would highly recommend!",5,2019,09,27
121,PERFECT in every way possible!,This place was amazing. Upon arrival we were greeted at the entrance by a wonderful team member who helped us with our bags right from the cab as we proceeded to the front desk. From there the magic of the stay only increased. We found out our room was upgraded to a Jr. Suite and we were so happy. Little did we know upon walking into the room how magical that was going to be. This room was amazing. I have never stayed in such a nice place in our travels to London. We arrived late so we called it a night but little did I know how great the next day would be when we started it off with breakfast at the hotel which was included in our package. It was wonderful. Again the team that greeted us to the people helping us in there were amazing. The food quality and variety was above and beyond. Going out and coming back for the day the housekeeping team had every attention to detail possible taking such good care of us during the stay. As you can tell there was never a miss to detail and service while we stayed with you for the 3 nights. I cannot thank your team and the management for the leadership it takes to keep that going enough. What a wonderful stay!! WE WILL BE BACK!!,5,2019,09,27
121,Prepare to be pampered,"We brought my elderly father with mobility issues to London from the US for a once in a lifetime trip after the passing of my mother.  We were anxious as to how this would all work but determined to give him something to remember and bring back home to talk about at Senior Living!  The Taj absolutely made that happen for us.  Without the comfort and extra care they provided, this trip would not have panned out as it did.  We are all amazed at how well he did.
I phoned the Taj in advance to make sure they were aware of his mobility issues and requested a walk-in shower and also advice for a wheelchair or motor scooter rental facility.  Upon check-in we had found they upgraded him to a room with a walk-in shower, with plenty of room to get around without tripping.  Upon arriving at breakfast (included with stay!) the first day they manager insisted that we call down each morning before we arrive to breakfast so they could have a table waiting for him, the housekeeping staff provided him extra water, the door staff made sure his scooter got up and down the ramp and when he used his cane made sure he didn't fall and that he got into the taxi safely.  Everyone, just everyone at that hotel, is a star.  They are 100% making sure they are accomodating and providing the best possible experience.  This is what a hotel is supposed to do, but the Taj excels at it.  The breakfast buffet was extraordinary, with eggs to order and multi-cultural food choices.  The croissants were crisp, perfect, the goat cheese was delicious (yes, goat cheese!), and I could go on and on.  At the end of the day we congrated in the outside garden area for cocktails and a snack.  I couldn't have asked for better accomodations especially when comfort is a top priority.
",5,2019,09,26
121,Great location and excellent service,"The hotel is conveniently located to be able to walk to numerous tourist attractions. It's only a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace. There were many, many breakfast options at the large buffet stations. They also offer custom omelets plus fried or poached eggs. We were quickly seated and it was so nice not having to leave the building to get a full hot breakfast before starting our busy day. We had a 2nd floor corner room with a comfortable bed and nice size bathroom with heated towels. We had a wonderful experience here and the service was excellent in every area.",5,2019,09,25
121,Excellent,"A very luxurious and affordable hotel, staff went out their way to make you feel welcome and were really friendly!   Rooms are spacious and fully equipped and the beds a comfy also, will be staying again in the future and would recommend highly.",5,2019,09,23
121,Excellent service received,"I stayed at your hotel recently and had a fantastic experience from A to Z. I was greeted by Huran at Reception who was very professional and friendly. He went extra mile to help me with my needs. The room was nicely decorated and spacious enough.

The breakfast was also very good with many choices. I needed some help from Concierge and they were also very helpful towards my requests.

The hotel represents the old Victorian style culture with a mixture of Indian culture which was great to experience.

I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2019,09,23
121,A very comfortable hotel,"A very comfortable hotel, near to Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament.
Quiet, clean and spacious rooms. Abundant and varied breakfast.
Friendly and attentive staff. I want to especially thank Diego and Valerica for their treatment and attentions. ",4,2019,09,23
121,Daughter's 21st birthday,"It was my daughter Hannah's 21st birthday. My family and friends were completely in awe of how special Saroush and his team made us feel. From delicious starters in beautiful and iconic courtyard to dinner at Bistro restuarant. From our private celler room to common room which was specailly made available for us. Since then we have been regulars.

Saroush thanks again for all your hardwork and help.

Best regards, 
Saleem and Mariam Khokhar",5,2019,09,21
121,Excellent service and location,"My family and I spent 6 nights in the family room. From the moment you arrive at the hotel you encounter their excellent service and attention to detail. I have a toddler who was excited to be presented with a bag with crayons, a stuffed teddy bear and a balloon upon check in. The following day a treat was left in the room for her as well. The family room is spacious with a semi separated living and sleeping area. Breakfast was good with a wide variety of choices. The location of the hotel is excellent and is close walking distance to attractions, such as Buckingham Palace, as well as the tube. I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again next time I'm in London.",5,2019,09,21
121,A Jewel in the Crown,"From arrival to departure, the professional and highly trained staff, from the doormen to the hotel manager, look after you. 
The genuine desire to optimise your stay is visible in their attitudes, attention to detail and little extra’s,such as fresh fruit and water bottles in the room. It is a beautiful hotel with a spa,pool and pretty courtyard. Although pricey, the location could not be better. A stones throw from St James Park and a £7-8 trip in a taxi to Victoria.
Walking distance minutes to Buckingham Palace. If the price is in your budget, you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,09,21
121,Excellent Hotel,"Hotel is excellent in everything; quality, comfort, service.  For sightseeing location is perfect. It is a superb hotel - just perfect. Value for money - you are made to feel very important even though i stay at this hotel for business. ",5,2019,09,19
121,"Long-time Taj customer, extremely disappointed.","InnerCircle member for several years, stay at the Taj every time I'm in Mumbai and Delhi. Didn't book through website this time, and had a chat with manager named Desmond Fernandes about points. He said I couldn't get points for the stay, which is fine. Here's where he went wrong: 

A) I mentioned it was my birthday on the last day of my 4-night stay. I shouldn't even have to mention it: the hotel should be aware of birthday stays at check-in. But I did mention it to Desmond, and there was nothing from the hotel. I didn't expect a cake and fireworks, just a note would've reflected the warmth and hospitality for which the Taj Group is famous. A note, or some chocolate, or a discounted breakfast, there are dozens of ways you can make someone feel special if it's a birthday trip at your property. Far smaller hotels have been far more thoughtful.

B) Desmond was not at all gracious through our conversation. He was arrogant, cold and prone to robotic responses. He could benefit from some training. Every customer should be treated with warmth and empathy at every Taj property.

C) Staff at front desk just not as warm and courteous as the Taj hotels in India. I stay at the Taj hotels because I feel welcome there. I go to London about once a quarter for work, but won't be returning to this one.

D) They've cramped a lot of massive furniture into a tiny room. Small rooms are normal in London. But some thought into how to optimize space and comfort in small rooms goes a long way. Swap out the massive desk/chair for smaller ones, mount the TV screen on a swivel etc.

E) Minibar was empty!

Mostly, though, it was the warmth -- that the Taj Group is known for -- that was lacking. And Desmond Fernandes just put a really bad taste in my mouth, shocked the Taj Group would hire someone who is all-smooth-no-substance.",1,2019,09,18
121,Bad customer service for a 4-5 stars hotel,"Good morning,
I booked a room at your hotel through the supplier ""AMOMA"" which is bankrupt now! I called your hotel and I received a written confirmation by mail (reference 76077993) from one of your employees for my stay from 23rd to 25th September! Just to be sure I again called two days later and the gentleman informed me that my booking has been cancelled in the meantime (reference 76852727)! He offered me an other room for twice the initial price! This isn't an accurate way for a 4-5 stars hotel to treat their customers!
First it would have been your turn to inform me about the cancellation as your hotel was aware of my situtation with AMOMA. Secondly you could have been more obliging concerning your price! Hence I booked an other hotel. 
Thanks to your way of behaving you lost a new customer!
Stéphanie Faber",1,2019,09,17
121,Very nice hotel at the heart of great London sights,Hotel is steps away from Buckingham Palace.  Staff was always very friendly and helpful. Our stay here could not have been nicer.

121,1st wedding anniversary,"Stayed here for the first time celebrating our first wedding anniversary, we felt very welcome and were treated by the hotel with celebratory drinks and cakes. the staff were very attentive!

We will definitively stay here again - the spa was wonderful and the room spacious and very clean!",5,2019,09,16
121,Customer incentive trip,Stayed with a group of customers who we took to the cricket. From start to finish the hotel could not do enough for us. Looked after from the moment we arrived until check out. Great experience. Highly recommend The Taj!,5,2019,09,16
121,Good hotel in a great location but has its flaws as well,"Stated here for an official visit to London.

Feel it does good job as a 4 star property but few shortcomings.

Lobby is small and looks dated and todays times, still good and check in process is smooth.

Room is well sized but view outside is absolutely nothing.
Offers variety of veg and Indian dishes so good for people from India.

Towels were smelly and even the washroom is cramped.

Morming breakfast is an average spread keeping Taj standards in mind.
Restaurant quilon offers nice costal cuisine.
They dont have a pool in property.

So in all a likeable property for a business trip but not a great choice for relaxation and holiday.

Again location gives it an extra star.",4,2019,09,13
121,"Excellent service, decor, and location","- Top-tier customer service and satisfaction.
- 3 blocks from Buckingham palace
- 2-3 blocks of two train stations
- 3 blocks from red route Hop On, Hop Off bus tour
- Near plenty of restaurants and shopping on Victoria Street
- Many other attractions (London Eye, Westminster Abbey, etc are walkable)

Seriously, these are the kinds of conveniences that can make a major difference in travel experience.  I don't know if it's the best hotel in London, but we had no complaints.",5,2019,09,12
121,Very attentive housekeeping team,"I have stayed at a Taj hotel in London just recently for my business occasion. 

Very attentive team and special thanks to Akos from housekeeping who was explaining all the room features and asked us about our welfare. The bed was stunning with fresh and fluffy linen and towels. 

I am happy to have my next stay at the Taj on the next business occasion.",5,2019,09,12
121,Excellent service and great location.,"We recently spent 5 nights at the St. James’ Court, A Taj hotel. Without a doubt the hotel and the staff far exceeded our expectations. 

Check In: As we got out of our car, a Taj employee was prompt to grab our luggage and provide direction to check-in in the lobby. We were greeted by Nishant at the front desk. Nishant was professional, prompt and informative to our requests and needs. We had sent the hotel an email a week prior requesting an early check-in due to our flight landing early morning. Nishant was aware of our request and the room was available immediately (9:00 am). 

Nishant showed us a map of the area, places to see, and things to do. He also provided our two kids goodie bags which was a nice surprise. Nishant walked us around the property to show us the lay of the land. Once in our room, he mentioned our luggage would be delivered shortly. Our luggage arrived 5 minutes later, followed by a phone call from Nishant asking if everything was going alright and if we needed anything, he would be available till afternoon. Honestly, Nishant set the bar high and the staff at Taj continued to meet the same daily. 

Room: We were travelling with our two children (7 & 9) so we booked The Premium Family Room. Please keep in mind that the hotel is going through renovations, so, if you want a new room be sure to book the “Premium” version. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the room was split into two. The first area was where the sofa bed was laid out along with a half-bath. The main bedroom was plenty spacious with a beautiful full bathroom. Both rooms had separate AC/HEAT controls. 

Housekeeping: Our room was cleaned, staged and ready by the time we would return from our day out. We would head out for dinner and come back to a nightly turn down service. We had reached out a few times regarding some additional requests which were promptly met within minutes. 

Breakfast: We booked our stay with breakfast included. Breakfast seating was prompt and service was great. Plenty of staff on hand to meet any special tastes. The buffet selection had something for everyone. We were asked if we would like any special eggs cooked and if so, would come directly from the kitchen. 

Bar: We grabbed drink’s a couple of nights at the lobby bar. The menu had a good selection of cocktails and our server Shivam was pleasant. He greeted us promptly as we sat down in the cozy lounge area. He was attentive and open to providing suggestions. The bar staff all around was quick to ask if we would like refills and check upon us. 

Location: The reason we booked Taj was due to its proximity to the places we planned to visit. The Buckingham Palace is literally a 2-minute walk. Westminster Abby about 15 minutes and from there you can head straight over to the London Eye and into the heart of the city Trafalgar Square. The tube can be accessed via St. James station or Victoria station. 

We are spending the next 4 nights in Windsor and are completely missing our time at the Taj. Taj and it’s staff do really set the expectation bar high and spoil you. We will be staying at the St. James Taj on our next visit to London. Additionally, St. James’ Taj will be our recommendation to any family and friends that plan to visit London.",5,2019,09,11
121,Beautiful hotel,Absolutely beautiful hotel with a great courtyard. The staff was wonderful and the room was comfortable and clean. This has the best location in London. Loved the Hamptons staff - they always looked out for us  - greeted us and remembered our preferences. ,5,2019,09,10
121,A huge letdown,"What a letdown of a hotel.  This is a far cry from a proper 5 star property, and I was thoroughly disappointed by the look (and smell!) of the corridors and the room itself.  This is an old property and is not up to today's 5 star standards.  The location is excellent, but even so I am not planning to return.",2,2019,09,10
121,"Centrally located, room was horrible","Room was old and in desperate need of updating. The bathroom tile was cracked, bathtub chipped, carpet stained. I would not live like this at home, I definable did not want to live like this on vacation. For the money, the room was not worth it. Very disappointed.",2,2019,09,10
121,Excellent!,"It was my first trip to London and for sure not my last. Beautiful hotel, perfect location, amazing food and very kind people. We were staying in a Taj appartement and the rooms are very stylish. Perfect for a business trip or citytrip!",5,2019,09,10
121,The best hotel you can hope for,"The St. James Court Hotel is, quite simply, the finest hotel that you could hope to fine. From impeccable rooms to courteous staff, this hotel excels in every way. Location, dining, amenities are all fantastic. Already scheduled our fourth visit.",5,2019,09,10
121,Wonderful hotel & Excellent Service,"The St. James Court met all our expectations. Room was comfortable and the staff friendly and polite. Breakfast was perfect and met all our needs.
I would like to mention one staff member in particular who served us every time in The Hamptons Bar. Mr Hiren Agarwal made us feel welcome and was very attentive. He was very friendly and always ready for a chat. We wish him the very best for his future in Hospitality. It's people like Hiren that adds to a pleasant stay.",5,2019,09,10
121,Luxury stay.,"The hotel is in a nice area, the location is ideal for everything, you are very close to the Victoria Station. The breakfast is a high-end for the stars of this hotel. The room itself is big for what London offers, the price was worth it.",5,2019,09,09
121,how check in and check up should be - room technologies could use some work.,"Check in can be such a soul destroying experience - get grilled at the desk; your reservation mysteriously different than what you'd booked and the room - well the room can be such a let down.

But NOT TODAY! today we were met at the door by a concierge who held the door, confirmed we were checking in and lead us to a person at the desk to check us in.  

THe checkin process was pretty smooth: no surprises with reservation (conference rate for hotel - no breakie included) - a few cock ups on titles and first name but otherwise dandy and the person who checked us in was professional.

the room (classic king) is for London suprisingly large - with a sitting area, emptied fridge (for all the marks and spencers groceries one brings for supper) and has a view into a quiet courtyard.  The bathroom is small but well appointed; the toilet requires cranking like a small dusenberg and by the desk 2 out of 3 plugs do not work; nor does the phone. The TV's while new and large and bright are quite slow to load menu systems - will see if they let one access the hdmi ports later. but really really SLOOOOOW experience on the TV. 

On the human side:  much to our surprise - a housekeeping staff member - the remarkable Akos -knocks on the door to check if all is well since we checked in - he will get the pump action on the toilet fixed! would we like to change rooms? Were we aware of the various amentiities like the jacuzi and gym; how far the wifi reaches outside around the hotel - 

So, so far - the features - like plugs for computer etc, and the TV service - and the ""classic"" bathroom - could all use some work - but the human beings we've encountered so far delivering the service - Akos in particular - have exceeded expectation.",4,2019,09,09
121,Hotel stay in London,"A lovely hotel with the most pleasant staff ever.  From the front desk to the barista, the wait staff, the household girl, the concierge - everyone was helpful, friendly, courteous - exceptional.
Our experience with the ""Alice in Wonderland"" tea was a delight as well as eating and having a drink in the beautiful courtyard.",5,2019,09,09
121,A relaxing luxurious stay,"Excellent service, location and food.  The room was simply luxurious and well spaced for the 4 of us.  The children would have liked to swim, However there isn’t a pool on the property.  A short walk to Buckingham Palace and  Westminster Abbey as well as a number of delightful restaurants makes for a really comfortable and convenient base for your London holiday or business.  ",5,2019,09,08
121,Beautiful hotel in the best location,"There couldn’t be a better spot to stay near Buckingham Palace, Westminster and the theater. Near to a few good pubs and restaurants too. All of the staff was super friendly and helpful. They always greeted us and escorted us to our favorite spot outside - even if it wasn’t in their station. (Loved the happy hour in the Hampton Bar)",5,2019,09,08
121,Very poor room and food,"Room and food was very poor. I would not stay at this hotel again. Apart from location nothing works about this hotel. Room interior is very poor, outdated. I felt sense of disappointed as soon as I stepped in room and food made it even worse",2,2019,09,08
121,Luxury London Staycation,I really enjoyed my 2 night stay at the hotel. All the staff - from reception to the Jiva spa - were great. The staff were all very accommodative and provided 5 star quality service. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,09,07
121,Amazing Stay in London,"We ended up booking St James' Court the same day we arrived as we decided we'd rather not stay in our originally booked hotel. Somehow, we were able to get an amazing deal & checked in maybe 20 minutes after we booked. 

The hotel itself was a little outdated, but the room was comfortable, clean, & quiet. Plus, the bed was comfy & we slept like babies every night. 

The breakfast buffet was well-stocked & the staff were very accommodating & friendly. 

The only (minor) complaint was that the WiFi was a little iffy from the 7th floor (worked great on the lower floors), so we would occasionally get booted off, but that didn't cause any issues as we still had service on our phones.",5,2019,09,06
121,London Called and I answered,"First time to London and the St. James Court was awesome.  The hotel was great, the staff was great and the location was, well, great!!! I loved it here and next trip to London, I will definitely stay at the St. James again.",5,2019,09,06
121,Treated like Royalty ,"My wife and I are seniors traveling to London for the first time. The entire staff at the St. James treated us like royalty the entire 17 day stay. The hotel is a classical beauty located near Buckingham Palace and walking distance to Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. The restaurants on site are superb. This hotel puts to shame the five star hotels we have stayed at in the United States. Make sure to use their spa and steam room after a long day of sightseeing for a relaxing sleep. 
We 100% recommend this hotel  !",5,2019,09,05
121,Nice Hotel,"My wife and I and our two adult children recently stayed for 6 nights - two rooms. Pros - location, buffet breakfast, service by all employees. Cons - some of the rooms are dated, plumbing issues.

My kids room had serious issues with the toilet. They were finally moved into a refurbished room, which was beautiful. Our room had some similar plumbing issues but we stayed in that room.

All of the personnel were very nice and helpful. We took a day trip to Liverpool which required us to leave the hotel very early. The hotel prepared breakfasts to go for us to take with us.

Hotel is very centrally located in Westminster within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Westminster Abbey, Hyde Park, etc.

Would stay again but hope that the rest of the rooms are refurbished by that time.",4,2019,09,04
121,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"We had a wonderful stay. The hotel is beautiful, clean and well-maintained. The food and staff were superb. We spent a lot of time in the lovely courtyard. You can’t beat the location! It is a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and Victoria St. Other key attractions are within walking distance. We had a great experience at the St James Hotel.",5,2019,09,04
121,Wonderful experience,"We stayed at the St jame’s Court Hotel for a short visit in London before ending our trip in England . We absolutely loved the Hotel and the area, Irene at the front desk was brilliant and very helpful, she gave us a nice upgrade to the renovated room  (really appreciated), everything was perfect ! Thanks",5,2019,09,04
121,Great Hotel,Excellent location- very near to major attractions in central London. The complimentary breakfast buffet had a  spread spread . Recommend the Indian restaurant - offers a great 4 course meal with drinks,5,2019,09,03
121,Great hotel!,"It was my first stay at St. James Court and everything was great. The location could not be better for visiting tourist attractions. It was a comfortable walk to Buckingham Palace, the Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye. The hotel service was very professional, rooms clean and comfortable and breakfast was great. I will definitely stay there again given a chance. ",5,2019,09,03
121,A Pleasant Experience,"From the Bellman's uniform to the charming room; this was a most pleasant stay.  Only two nights but a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, this piece of history was a delight to behold.  The concierge arranged for our trip to the airport and happily  assisted us with the storage of our bags after check out until our late night flight.  Everything was clean and working perfectly.  The bar however comfortable, was disappointing because the service is less than desirable.  The waiters were more interested in each other than in the customers.  Both afternoons it took 10 minutes to get table service even though there were four workers and only three patrons in the whole place.  This definitely needs attention.  We are planning on returning on our way back from SA mid September.",5,2019,09,03
121,Simply Brilliant ,We had a very enjoyable 3 nights at the the St James’s Court Hotel.  Check in was fast and the room fabulous this hotel is spotlessly clean.   We used room service on first night food was excellent and fast.   The hotel is well situated close to Buckingham Palace Westminster and a short tube ride from the Theatre District.  A Taxi back from the theatre area to the hotel is approx £12.  Staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful right across the board.   We would definitely stay here again on next London Trip.  We used the express check out the final invoice was delivered to our room which we signed and dropped off at a box in reception with the keys simples ,5,2019,09,02
121,"Beautiful and spacious rooms, excellent service. Great location near Buckingham palace. Family friendly.",Our family suite was very well appointed and comfortable. We only stayed one night but wish we could have stayed longer. Complimentary water and WiFi and great concierge service. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. ,5,2019,09,01
121,Luxurious Hotel Let Down By Breakfast,"Luxurious and relaxed environment. Incredibly disappointed to discover at check-in that the table we had reserved that night in The Courtyard was not available, especially having cancelled an alternative. However, the hotel made up for it by making me Guest of The Day ( or in other words, a few freebies to pacify the angry hotel guest ). The staff were brilliant. Upgraded us to a good room, gave us free drinks and discounted the bar food bill. 
The real disappointment was breakfast. No gluten free crackers and gluten free pastries only available if you order 24 hours in advance. Omelette like rubber, cold grilled tomatoes and poor cheese selection. We were a table of two but put so close to another table it was almost like having breakfast with another family.",3,2019,09,01
121,Another great stay at the St James' Court,"This was my third stay at the St James' and this time I had my family with me. We had 3 adjoining rooms on the 4th floor. The hotel is very attractive in all the public areas and in the individual rooms. For sightseeing the location is the fantastic - easy walking distance to the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, London Eye, Buckingham Palace, Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall and more. If you want to go further a field the tube station is close by. But the best thing about the St James is the friendly and helpful staff though-out the hotel.",5,2019,08,31
121,"Great staff, location and a piece of history","The quality of the staff showed from the moment we pulled up to drop off our luggage to reception, bar staff and house keeping. All were so keen to assist in any way they could. 
The hotel is anoiece of history, in a brilliant central place in the middle of London close to heaps of tourist destinations.",4,2019,08,30
121,Holuday,"Hiren and Tjin were absolutely fabulous. They made us feel so welcome and went beyond what was required to give us excellent service. Two extremely friendly, happy waiters with wonderful personalities. The Taj is very lucky to have them.",5,2019,08,30
121,Wonderful stay!,My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed our stay here during our first trip to London. Amazing value for a very convenient location and high end facilities. Very clean and welcoming environment and courteous staff members. Highly recommend!!,5,2019,08,30
121,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,"Absolutely LOVED this hotel! The service was impeccable! Everyone from the front desk (Ms. Miriana) - to the lovely breakfast and host, Mr. Yunus, who was always smiling, and came up to my daughter and me to tell us he had a better table for us - to Ms. Doina, a sweet house-keeping lady who saw me shivering by the fountain and brought me a blanket!! Even the concierge helped give us directions and information. The room itself was simply AMAZING!! Actually, there was nothing simple about it! It was STUNNING!!!!! So many, many thanks to St. James Court!!! We will definitely be staying with you again!!",5,2019,08,28
121,Close to perfect,"With few minor (personal preference) exceptions everything was perfect. Beautiful hotel and large room. Service was excellent. Entertainment in the courtyard was very fun and relaxing. Highly highly recommend, will definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,08,27
121,Fantastic,"

The trip was awesome hotel was located in the prime location of London and easily reachable .once you get into the hotel you feel really amazing and the credit goes to the professional staff and captain of the ship Mr.Digvijay Singh.",5,2019,08,26
121,A Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I took a short, 4-day vacation in London and stayed at St James Court. We had an absolutely lovely time and the hotel was just perfect for us. It is walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Parliment, 10 Downing St, Westminster Abby and the London Eye. The concierge was very helpful and made tour bus arrangements for us and was available to answer all our questions. The bell staff and the doormen were also very helpful with getting cabs for us and taking charge of the luggage. The room was a very basic room with a double bed, but it was very comfortable. We ate at the buffet every morning. They didn't have pancakes or waffles on the buffet, but it was otherwise very good. We had a late dinner at the pub in the lobby that was also very good. There is an Indian restaurant a couple of doors down that is connected to the hotel. Our meal there was excellent! In sum, we had a great time in London and the St James as a big part of it. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,08,25
121,Must stay!,"Beautiful hotel, excellent and friendly staff. Free entertainment each evening. Within 2 blocks of Buckingham Palace, Green Park and St James Palace & Park. Such a lovely well appointed room with comfortable bed. I will never stay anywhere else!",5,2019,08,25
121,First Class,Stayed 1 night but we were v.impressed by the friendly & polite staff. Excellent location only a short walk from Buckingham palace & other sights. Breakfast was v.good with lots of choice. We will definitely return.,5,2019,08,25
121,Fantastic Hotel,"Spent 5 nights at the A Taj Hotel which was charming, friendly, and excellent value. Ate at the fusion bistro on 2 nights and can highly recommend the menu and the top nosh.
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be back again very soon. 
With warm regards, 
Scott",5,2019,08,25
121,7/10 hotel,"i like everything in this hotel but service is s*** here, i called the housekeeping and pressed the button “make my room” still nobody shows up. this hotel in kind of a little far away so that’s a no.",2,2019,08,25
121,Great experience,"Love this hotel.  Normally stay at the Taj in India.   This location surely shows consistency with the
chain.  Great South Indian restaurant.  Little pricey, but great food.  Rooms are clean and
the travel representative did a great job organizing our day trips around London.",5,2019,08,24
121,Great position and all that you need !,"We have been to the hotel a few times now. It cannot be beaten for position and price considering the very good standard of rooms , staff and overall experience!
A niggle for us is the lack of power from the showers but that said the towels are of great quality and the bath sheet is a bath sheet !! and toiletries provided are great 
Will always consider staying here for a London trip ",5,2019,08,24
121,two night stay for my son's wedding,"We stayed at the hotel for the night before and night of my son's wedding which was being held in Westminster. We had booked 3 suites and 1 double room. Two of the rooms were not ready when we arrived at 1:45, resulting in some of the bridal party being late for the wedding rehearsal. Eventually, they were ready for 3:30pm. The deputy manager (Desmond) excused the delay by saying it was due to the fact we had requested the rooms all on the same floor. If we had known this would have resulted in a delay in entering the rooms we would have foresaken this. As it was my son's wedding, we had a number of requirements and it would have been far better for me to have one telephone contact rather than have to arrange all our requirements via email to whoever was on duty in concierge. I felt it lacked the personal touch.

My future daughter-in-law even had to struggle to leave through the front doors with her wedding dress and train, because no-one in concierge had the foresight to help, other guests were pushing past her to get into the lobby!

Two of the suites were in the newly renovated part. I wouldn't really describe them as suites as they comprised one room and a bathroom. The sleeping and sitting areas were divided by a partial wall. My husband was shown around one of the hotel's apartments next door and if we had seen these earlier would definitely have booked them.

The bar area is quite small for a hotel of this size. Although the very helpful bar manager (Samir?) did let us use the Cellar room on our first evening so we could host our guests for a drink and some bar food (service was very slow however).

Plus points were :-
1) the company that does the valet parking are excellent, really friendly and helpful
2) the hotel location is really good, just a few minutes walk from Westminster in one direction and Buck house in the other direction.
3) the hotel Mercedes drivers were really lovely.

My recommendation to the you is when a wedding party has booked to stay, provide an allocated member of staff to deal with all the extras required for this type of stay. We just didn't feel that you were very bothered to help with our special occasion.",3,2019,08,23
121,"Disappointing, location is not safe","Overpriced hotel even by London standards for the quality of the rooms and food. Location is also not the safest. Service is excellent per Taj standards but rooms are old and small and dark. Quality of the food is also not good for the prices charged, room service is especially horrendous food at outrageous prices. Bistro is good as an alternative to room dining. ",2,2019,08,19
121,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"All was wonderful at this hotel but I wanted to mention that the chocolate squares that they leave in the room every night are NOT FREE.  You will be charged for each one that you eat  but there is no mention of that anywhere, that they are NOT FREE.

Again, DONT EAT THE CHOCOLATES unless you want to pay for them.",5,2019,08,19
121,Pleasant stay at prime location in quiet area,"I booked the Superior Suite for 5 nights.  It's 7/F (top floor) and the rooms are spacious. Although there is no dividing door between the bedroom and the living area chamber, t night when I was using the writing desk in the living area, it did not affect my kid who's sleeping inside.  

Breakfast buffet is not the English style breakfast and it provides sufficient choices; the staff will ask whether you'd like fried eggs or omelette and the kitchen will prepare it.  The breakfast area has floor-to-ceiling glass windows and the dining was indoor.  The dinner in the open-air court was also pleasant, and this TAJ hotel has great Indian cuisine. 

The St. James's Park station is the nearest Tube station.  To walk towards Victoria station, you'll pass by the Cardinal place, and a bit further is another dining spot ""the Nova"".  After full day tour in London, to be able to have a dinner nearby and then walked back to the hotel is an advantage.  

The staff are helpful and friendly.  Due to my sickness on the first night, I requested for doctor visitation, and the hotel arranged the doctor coming in on Sunday morning (with the prescription, my stay in London was not impacted).",5,2019,08,18
121,"Fantastic location, beautiful property","We could not have asked for a better location for our three nights in London. Lovely neighborhood, yet quiet; literally down the street from Buckingham Palace and a few minutes' walk to Westminster Abbey and the Thames. In fact, we walked everywhere during our stay, only taking the ferry back from London Bridge to the Westminster stop after a long day. Accommodations were excellent, and we enjoyed our breakfasts in the beautiful Conservatory restaurant downstairs. Highly recommend.",5,2019,08,17
121,Great Location,"We enjoyed our resent stay a A Taj Hotel, the location is great, tucked away in a quiet street but still central to some of Londons most icinic attractions: Buckingham Palce, Westminister Abbey, Hyde Park, London Underground and so much more.",4,2019,08,15
121,Very pleasant and courteous approach and great location for sightseeing,"Besides the great location (very convenient, especially during shorter stays as  it saves lots of time to be able to shorten travelling times to sightseeing places) we appreciated the very warm welcome, professional and courteous approach of reception (a very special thanks to Ioana! for her impeccable customer care) and also concierge/restaurant staff. The only minor downside seem to be the older elevators that break quite often - so you either have to take stairs or walk to the renovated part of building and take the ""newer"" lifts. Overall a more than pleasant stay.",5,2019,08,13
121,Awesome experience ,Having a lovely stay a warm reception and a lovely stay...sunaina soares made it a very pleasant stay and mohit pherwani at Hamptons was an amazing host and made our evening memorable this felt like home away from home would recommend this hotel to everyone ,5,2019,08,11
121,Great Hotel," Great buffet breakfast, was included in our room rate.Great location, it is walking distance to many sights.The staff was very friendly. Hotel Concierge booked day trips for us thru Even and Evens. Wonderful tour guides, we even went on a day trip to Paris. Chris is a archeologists, he knew everything. Simon took us to Paris also great ",5,2019,08,11
121,London stay,"Very good Location , especially if you on the short stay in London.  Close to majority of attraction. Rooms are good and spacious for London standart, we got renovated room, but rollout bed very uncomfortable. Breakfast good , but not changes every day, so if you stay longer then a three days that could be an issue",4,2019,08,11
121,TAJ London St Jmaes Park,"The rooms were clean. The staff at the front desk and concierge were friendly and helpful. The location is perfect too. Close to St James station. Very close to Buckingham palace, St James Park, Green Park, Piccadilly Square, Parliament house, etc. ",5,2019,08,11
121,Loved this hotel!!,"This hotel exceeded my expectations.  The room was terrific - felt like we had our own apartment with the hallway, leading to a separate bathroom, bedroom and living room.  Loved the bed, linens, towels, robes, deep bath, and the free water by the bed each night!! Nice touch! We loved the breakfast too- fresh salads, fruit, traditional English breakfast items including terrific scrambled eggs, baked beans, grilled tomatoes and sausage. It was so fun and delicious to try the traditional Indian Breakfast offerings and the pastries and croissants were to died for.  The breakfast dining room was bright and sunny - a great way to start the day and we never had to eat lunch.  After at least 8 hours of sightseeing each day we would go to the Hampton Bar for cocktails and piano music, both top notch!!!!  Try the date sticky cake - so good. Finally, you couldn't beat the location - a short walk to both Westminster, Parliament and the Thames in one direction and Buckingham Palace in the other direction. I want to go back to do it all over again! Thank you Taj St. James Court Hotel!",5,2019,08,10
121,"Nice Hotel, nice People and perfectly located","a wonderful hotel that has completed our honeymoon.
The room was very nice and cosy.
The location of the hotel is just perfect. Quiet and yet very central.
Two underground stations in the immediate vicinity through which you can easily reach all attractions.
Buckingham Palace is almost on the doorstep. Only five minutes walk away
I definetily  want to come back.",5,2019,08,09
121,Wonderful Hotel Great Location,"This hotel has everything! Rooms are comfortable. Bathrooms are small but very modern. Our maid  was amazing keeping our room immaculately clean and organized.for the week we were here. Both restaurants offer great food and premium service.

You could not find a better location. A short walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, and Victoria Station. 

An exceptional value for all you get when you stay here.",5,2019,08,08
121,Can’t beat the location ,"Everything about this hotel is a positive experience. From the doorman, to the desk staff, to the amazing breakfast, to the room service...everything is great. From a location perspective it’s very hard to beat. ",5,2019,08,08
121,Variable......,"I have stayed here quite a few times on business over a three year period.

Communal areas are great, lovely outdoor bar in summer, nice indoor bar area which often has a pianist playing during the evening. 

I’ve eaten in the restaurant a few times and the food has always been great.

I find the bedrooms to be very variable. Occasionally you get a nice modern well situated one but for every time you get that there are at least two other occasions where you get an old fashioned pokey room at the end of a soulless corridor.

It’s convenient for business but when I travel in my own time I choose to stay elsewhere.",4,2019,08,07
121,42 Wedding Anniversary,"We arrived at the St James Court a Taj Hotel early and had a lovely welcome from that doorman and bellboy, who stored our bag.
Nishant the receptionist couldn't do enough for us, he had a very pleasant approach to the checkin process and wouldn't let us leave until he had shown us our room, ever though we were early for checkin. He also made us ""guests of the day"" which came with some nice surprises and made us feel very special.
When we returned later in the afternoon, we found that Housekeeping had left us an Anniversary card and decorated the room with balloons, glitter and a cake.
The Bar staff where also very attentive in the afternoon and evening when we had drinks.
The breakfast was also very good with plenty of choice and good service.
The St James Court is the 3 Taj Hotel that we have stayed in, after experiencing the Taj Lake Palace and The Taj Mahal Palace, we were wondering how St James Court a Taj Hotel London would fair and it was brilliant with very attentive, helpful, pleasant staff like we had experienced in India.
Check out was also very pleasant again with Nishant, we also had the pleasure of meeting Sunaina Soares Guest Relations Manager who spent time with us discussing this stay and previous Taj stays.

We will return and would recommend St James Court a Taj Hotel.",5,2019,08,07
121,Anniversary Stay,"The hotel itself is beautiful. Really tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. The staff were so friendly and professional and as it was our 25th anniversary, they upgraded us and made our stay extremely special. 
Will definitely go back and recommend.",5,2019,08,07
121,London center hotel luxury,"The St james court staff are every bit as attentive as the Taj 51, the sister property on the complex, but without the 51’s butlery level service. That said, it’s still good when the bar’s set high.

Our breakfast was fantastic, and they had perks for kids( a wee plush bear for ours to keep). 

It does need a bit of refurb in some of the older hallways, they do show their age and a tad “shabby” but given the odd layout of old london buildings, i expect this is a logistical challenge too. 

Ours was in a more renovated area of the st james court building so i have no real worry, its a hallway, and you’re not in there for THAT long! 

Taj 51 and St james are becoming our preferred london hotel when we can swing it. Its always a treat.

And the location’s fantastic for sightseeing too.",4,2019,08,07
121,Conference in London,"The Taj was an excellent venue for thos years International PPP Finance Summit in JUne.  The facilites were very good, the staff responsive and the catering was also enjoyable.  An importnat feature is tgat teh seating was comfortable - important when you are tnere all day.",4,2019,08,06
121,A different experience,"Having never stayed at a Taj Hotel before, I found it a worthwhile experience. The hotel caters to a lot of guests from India which provides another, more relaxed atmosphere than other major hotel chains. Add this with the splendid oriental look of the hotel exterior and the lovely courtyard to complete the picture. 
We stayed with the three of us in a spacious courtyard junior suite. I personally liked the room baecause I happen to be fond of older style rooms with hints of former glory. But many contemporary travellers will probably find the rooms run down, out of date and badly in need of renovation.
Breakfast is served on the ground floor in a space that is too small which is causing regular cues at the entrance. However, we didn’t have to wait all that long and the waiters are very kind and helpful. Eggs are made to choice.  
The location is close to Buckingham Palace but the immediate neighboorhood is filled with dull office buildings. Victoria street is nearby, as are several dining options. 
All in all I can really recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a different experience and can appreciate the special characteristics.",4,2019,08,06
121,Be very careful,"Hotel advertises newly refurbished rooms and luxurious finish, but we were given a room so old and tattered we would have rather checked out if it were not raining and cold outside. The principle of it was horrible and we felt cheated and conned.",1,2019,08,04
121,"Great location, fantastic staff","Family stay, from the moment of arrival nothing seemed too much trouble. Friendly greetings, excellent service in all areas of the hotel. We all enjoyed the outdoor bar, the excellent buffet breakfast and the comfy beds. Some of our party also enjoyed the gym.",5,2019,08,03
121,Nice hotel&great location,"We had very nice stay in this hotel, first of all great location, walking distance from the Buckingham Palast, near metro station.in the center but in quiet area 
Very helpful staff, check in was super fast thanks to very professional Nishant, who personally showed us two rooms and we could choose which one is better for us.
Highly recommended 
",5,2019,08,02
121,Nice experience and Nishant at the check in and check out was exceptional in his professionalism & customer focus attitu,"Nishant who checked us in and did our check out was exceptional. He was customer focused and so professional in his approach. The rooms need desperate renovation, barring which the hotel is exceptional",4,2019,08,02
121,Lovely hotel,"nothing was too much trouble, we had a lovely time. staff very helpful. was selected as guest of the day so complimentary upgrsde, cocktails and discounts on food, lovely place, ground are pleasant and peacefull, we had to pool to ourselves, very relaxing",5,2019,08,01
121,"Great location and staff (at breakfast) but as a repeat customer, wasn't made to feel like one.","Great location. 

But...

Staff was clueless about the Taj Kids programme at check-in and I deliberately did not ask them just to see if they remembered. I reminded them on checkout and then they realised and offered to give some goody bag for my kids. Not great. And the AC in first room did not work. Switched to a second room that was supposedly in the Executive category but it was a lot smaller and for three of us with three bags... a bit of a squeeze. The staff at The Bistro was new as we were told so they definitely didn't know what it was like to provide Taj quality service - were a bit off-handish at dinner when we asked for a table on the first night. And the new manager was apologetic and confirmed that most of the staff were new.  The hotel was crowded and one good thing was the staff at breakfast. Very efficient and polite. Saving grace. 

Finally, the bags were not brought down in time at checkout so we wasted a good ten minutes reminding them and waiting for the bag resulting in us rushing to catch our Eurostar with the Uber waiting. 

For the price you pay,  you should expect better especially as an Innercircle Gold Member. 

Given all these issues, I am still willing to stay there again but the Taj really needs to up its loyalty programme in terms of perks for upper-tier members. ",3,2019,08,01
121,Extra weekend in London,"Our plan to Gothenburg was cancelled and we got an extra weekend in London.
I bokked St James Court very late in the evening and we arrived around midnight.

121,Fantastic once again,"Staff were simply amazing, every member we came in contact with were the best
Those on duty on Weds 24th at night in the courtyard were brilliant 
The tall lad from the Netherlands, the young Romanian girl and the young Asian lad I think his name was Chivan they were the best, they looked after us and nothing was too much trouble
The only gripe was room 218 we had the air-con fans outside our window humming all night which disturbed our sleep
The breakfast was not to the high standard we have experienced before, bacon was hard and crispy, no beans on the menu, it was simply not as good 
But overall fantastic job ",5,2019,07,26
121,Great hotel at great location,"St. James Court is a great hotel in a great location. An easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Green Park, St. James Park, the Underground and other London sites. Great staff. Great food. Great drinks in the bar. ",5,2019,07,24
121,Terrible stay at St James Court,"This is not a 4 star hotel and terrible value for money. Our suite was literally falling apart (dish soap falling off the bathtub wall, toilet flush not working, stains on the suede furniture. Room service did a terrible job cleaning leaving behind trash in the room. Lobby staff at check in was extremely incompetent making us wait several hours for our below average room without even calling us when room was ready despite having promised to do so. ",1,2019,07,23
121,"Pleasant atmosphere, good location","Nice room (deluxe), attentive staff, good location. Clean and new room design (in the new block of the building - blue), nice breakfast included. Spacious room with well furbished bathroom (shower). Tasteful interior with a touch of Eastern delight.",4,2019,07,22
121,"Definitely a ""must-avoid"" property in my list","Had one of the most lousy stays in London after ages. I am a Platinum tier member with Taj Hotels and one would expect the team to go out of their way to make you welcome. I somehow missed out on any form of courtesies from this property. I reached the hotel at around noon and was told that the room was not ready. I even reminded the receptionist that I was a Platinum tier member and if some sort of upgrade could be possible - perhaps to a Junior Suite. She told me that she would try. My wife and I then decided to go out for a while and come back later and we left the luggage with the concierge. When we returned at around 5 pm, the same receptionist was there and she told me that they had ""upgraded"" us to the newly renovated room and that the room category which I had booked was in the older section. When we reached the room, I was taken aback as it was rather small.The one I booked was an Executive Studio room which was 40 Sq Mt as per their web site. The ""upgraded"" room they had allocated us was the Premium room which is shown as 24 Sq Mt on their web site. Not only that, the room they gave us was also shown to be a lot cheaper than the one I had booked. What really angered me was that they claimed to have given me an ""upgrade"" whereas they actually gave me a smaller room which was to cost cheaper than what I had booked so how come this is an upgrade?
I went down to speak to the receptionist and she called the duty manager Desmond. He tried to explain to me that the management had every intention to upgrade me and they felt that this room was far better than what I had booked. I told him to explain to me how this was an upgrade and a better deal for me. He then looked up on the computer and saw some basic Suite available but he said that it needed cleaning. I asked him to take me to the Suite so that I could take a call. It was one of the most badly planned room I had seen and gave a claustrophobic look. I clearly told him that the Suite was not acceptable to me and that I would reluctantly accept the one they had allocated. I then also told him that they ought to give the breakfast for us on complimentary basis and he agreed.
The breakfast spread and the service turned out to be rather lousy as well. Two days in a row we were not served the beverage after even asking two separate servers. The first day, my wife was served what she wanted and they forgot to bring mine which was a hot chocolate. I then reminded another server and she told me that she would get it asap. I finally told a third server and he was rather apologetic but he too disappeared and never got the beverage till we had finished and left. The next day, it was the other way around where I got my beverage but my wife had to remind two separate servers for her Cappuccino. Never showed up.
A day before our check out, I went to the reception and requested that we be allowed a late check out till 3 pm but I was told that it was not possible and that the best they could offer was till 2:00 pm. 
As we were checking out, the lady asked us about the stay and I told her about the room fiasco and also the beverage issue. She simply asked me if I had complained to the restaurant manager. She seemed least interested to possibly call some senior person to speak to me.
Seeing all this sham and lack of genuine warmth and hospitality, I am definitely avoiding this hotel during any future trips to London. In view of the room related issue, the duty manager could have tried to show genuine concern and sent across a good bottle of wine to our room or offered us some perks to show their remorse but no such thing happened.
I also wonder what is the real benefit of being a Platinum member of a hotel chain if this is how they treat the guest and play around with the room reservation. 
I also wonder why they are not pricing their upgraded rooms higher if they are indeed that much better than the Executive Studio. I specifically chose that room as it was big and openly planned.
One more thing I want to add is that the hallways are far too narrow as one walks from the elevator to the rooms. In most countries this would be deemed hazardous.",1,2019,07,22
121,A classy boutique hotel,"My stay was excellent - the ambience and the service is excellent. The location is very good - oxford street, knightsbridge, etc is walking distance.

However if you are looking for a fancy, modern and yet a classy boutique hotel that has old world charm this is the place to stay. I can bet that once you stay at the st James court, you will find it very difficult to stay anywhere else in London. Reasonably priced, it is very well located to the Victoria station , tube, Westminster Abby, The Buckingham Palace, etc. If you love walking then it’s 20 mins walk from Piccadilly circuit and trafagar Square .. the ambience the service and the food is excellent. Rooms are not too big but practical & there is courtyard to soak in the English summer . You will feel at home on every visit . Highly recommended. ",5,2019,07,20

121,Wonderful First Trip,"This was our first trip to London and Taj Hotel ensured it was memorable in every way. 

After exploring various accommodation alternatives, we chose Taj yet again and as expected it didn't disappoint us. 

We enjoyed the peace and quiet we needed, coupled with the excellent service of the staff in every segment of your hotel.

Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive, kind and professional from receptionists to room service, restaurant, front desk, house keeping. A special mention for Mr Naveen Sikka, Ms. Nihita, Mr. Nishant.

121,"Absolutely Fantastic, Lovely hotel.","This is the most wonderful stay I have had in London.  After a minor glitch with the room upon arrival, Mr. Desmond Fernandes, Assistant Reception Manager, rectified the situation immediately. He deserves much praise.  He was always polite, kind, friendly, efficient---absolutely the perfect kind of person you want on staff running a hotel!  He has done well for the Taj--most certainly on account of his manner, the Taj will now be my go-to hotel while in London. Further, the rooms are beautiful, the surroundings are beautiful--there is magnificent courtyard where one can eat or have  drink. The food is fantastic.  We ate at the hotel 5 times over a 7 night stay.  I was with my grandson, so granted, it was easier to eat at the hotel after a long day, but I would not have done it had the food not been up to par.  Everything we had was delicious! We ate at the Hamptons, the Bistro and Quillon, all excellent.  The Conservatory, where the breakfast buffet is located had a beautiful view out to the courtyard, and the food was bountiful.  The Maitre d', whose name is Erol, was again, a brilliant staff member--always friendly, helpful, ensuring that things were run perfectly.  The hotel is a dream.  I cannot find one thing wrong. The staff is the creme de la creme. Finally, it is in a perfect location for touring.  It is  just down the street from Buckingham Palace; a short walk to Parliament, Big Ben & the Churchill War Rooms, as well as the Underground. Go--you won't be sorry!",5,2019,07,13
121,Home away from home,"We spent a week in July this year at this fabulous hotel. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. Everything was modern and stylish. The staff were always helpful and friendly.  We certainly will be back to this gem soon.",5,2019,07,12
121,Wonderful!,"The staff was friendly, professional, and went out of their way to be accommodating. The rooms were very clean.  The breakfast buffet is a must before a day of touring.  Within walking distance of most major attractions. The piano added a nice touch. I was able to purchase all of my tickets on site. I would definitely stay there again!",5,2019,07,12
121,Outstanding Service,"We booked for one night, we hadn’t stayed at this hotel before. The reception staff are very good indeed, especially the female staff, and Beata who looked after us was fantastic.   We were selected to be Guests of the Day and upgraded to a beautiful new bedroom with the most comfortable bed. The room was well equipped and immaculately clean.  
The hotel is very well positioned and we walked everywhere we wanted to with ease. 
The outside bar area was a little disappointing from a cleanliness perspective but this is just a minor point. 
We had a truly lovely experience and will return.",5,2019,07,12
121,Mixed emotions,"Stayed here for 1 night at the start of a London trip and was excited to try the Taj brand, although unfortunately a few issues meant that it wasn't the knockout experience that I had hoped for.

The check-in was extremely slow and after a 3 hour trip I had to wait more than 30 minutes to even reach the check-in desk. When I finally got to the room the view was simply of a brick wall, albeit a pleasant and clean room with a bath and a very nice Samsung television.

Cocktails at the bar were very well made and the service from everybody involved had a welcoming and professional feel.

It wasn't until I'd checked into my 2nd hotel that I faced my largest issue, being that upon checking out of the Taj hotel they tried to debit my card for the cost of the stay a 2nd time. This resulted with my bank blocking the card leaving me at the beginning of a trip without access to my funds. When I called the hotel upon the advice of my bank, I was eventually told that a trainee had tried to bill my card in error rather than billing hotels.com. I lost an entire morning of my trip on the phone to my bank, the hotel and others trying to resolve this mess. So whilst a simple mistake it still meant my schedule was turned upside down.

Overall a beautiful hotel with fantastic staff, maybe just a little unlucky in my case.",4,2019,07,11
121,Very nice!,"The hotel is quite nice, clean and the room was larger than I expected.  Service was friendly and well done.  The location was hit or miss depending on what you wanted to do.  It is quite close to the St James tube station so it was very easy to get around.  However, because it is on the other side of Buckingham Palace, it is a little removed from shopping and restaurants... but then walking around London is also very easy so if you are a walker than it is no problem.",4,2019,07,10
121,So Lovely and Charming,"We stayed for several nights and had a pleasant stay at this lovely hotel. Room was nice and clean but a bit outdated. We had our daily breakfast at their restaurant. Breakfast choices were good, lots of variation on the buffet tables, but then decided to have the last one in our room as we had an early morning flight. We did not chose a lot as we thought it just for a quick breakfast, then felt so sad as the breakfast set came in a beautiful arrangement, but we had limited time to enjoy it. Oh well.
The lobby lounge area was so charming and cozy! There was a live piano performance at (I think every) night to accompany your relaxing time after being out all day. We just hang out with our friends there and ordered wines.
We also had a theme afternoon tea, Alice in wonderland at their tea room and had a blast! Location is just perfect, within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, and Westminster area. We definitely will stay again.",5,2019,07,09
121,Lovely stay,"We stayed in one of the new rooms. The room was very spacious by London standards and accommodated our family of four with two young children. The room was nicely decorated and very luxurious. 
Breakfast was lovely and the staff were professional and attentive. The location of the hotel was fabulous. It was walking distance to Buckingham palace.
All in all, a very pleasant stay.",5,2019,07,09
121,Customers service,"They over charge me, at check out  i had to ask them to review the charges,  i used the phone for a local call  they also over charge me.

121,Great stay,"Truly a wonderful hotel, staff incredibly attentive & friendly. Elegant settings, superb location location in west end of London. Just a short walk to Buckingham Palace & St James Park. Kept our bags for us & were kind enough to let us check in early when my companion became ill. One of the very best London hotels. ",5,2019,07,09
121,Excellent,Excellent facilities with great staff. Made us feel welcome. Amazing hospitality. Restaurants on premises were out of the world. Great central location. We could walk just over to most of the London attractions.,5,2019,07,09
121,"Great Location, Rooms Good, Patchy Service","Stayed here with the family in June 2019.

The main reason to stay here is the great location...as many have said before, several important sites are a short walk away. Access to the tube is also great and there are several station options nearby. We walked all the way from the Theatre District (Coventry Garden) and also West End a few times. There are several parks near by as well, which also makes for a pleasant location. 

Our check-in took an extremely long time, as the room was under maintenance...this was at almost 7.30pm in the evening. The reception staff were great with explaining and  handling the situation but not what I would expect, especially when arriving so late in the day. 

We had an Executive King on a high floor, which was pleasant. The room was spacious compared to other London rooms I have stayed in. There was also a large bathroom and a separate dressing and storage area. The only complaint I have is that the ceiling in the shower is too low...I am just under 6ft tall and could barely stand in the shower...plus the water would splash on the light fixture above the shower, which seemed odd and dangerous. 

The Breakfast setup in the Conservatory was nice, but getting a table was a real struggle...mainly because the hotel was full of Indian cricket fans, and on the one India game day it was terrible, as there was a huge rush for tables. The hotel had highlighted this before, so expectations were managed but maybe they need to open more restaurants for breakfast during such events. Service was up and down at the breakfast. 

We had one meal in the Bistro, and again service was extremely “leisurely” despite the restaurant seeing relatively low occupancy. 

Overall, the hotel is fine and the pricing is decent as well. However the service really let me down...which is surprising given that’s the USP of the Taj Group. 

I would probably stay here again, but mainly for the location.",4,2019,07,07
121,A lovely stay,"This was my first trip to London, but the staff at the St. James Court made me feel so at home. From their knowledgeable and helpful concierge staff (found me a ticket to the Chelsea Flower Show when it was sold out), to the very polite front desk employees, to housekeeping who kept the room well tended - they just couldn't have been nicer or more professional. I liked the location - easy walking distance to many places of interest and the underground, and there's a fantastic South Indian restaurant right next door.",5,2019,07,06
121,Just perfect!,"We stayed 2 full weeks so it felt like home
Perfect location...walked to Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square, Victoria Station and if you are a walker, even more.
The St. James is beautiful with a wonderful lobby and entrance.
 Front desk and concierge (especially Justin and Matthew) were wonderful.
Breakfast had so many choices...hot and cold dishes, muffins, breads, cheeses, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals and more. Wait staff was attentive and helpful.
Bed was super comfortable and large (king) and the towels were huge. Every other day we received either some fresh fruit or sweets...and bottled water each day.
 Room always cleaned are arranged for the evening. And we never saw cleaning staff waiting outside our room with a cleaning cart.
Our travel agent arranged our stay and it was perfect. Returning to London the St. James is where we would stay.",5,2019,07,06
121,Had high expectations but left with mixed feelings and a little disappointed ,"Check in was easy and friendly, we were delighted when we were told our room had been upgraded however on entering the room I couldn’t help but feel quite disappointed. There were lots of dirty marks on the walls, the furniture was quite dusty, and the lampshades were stained, they looked like they have been immersed in water at some point. The bed sheets also had prominent staining. We switched the bedroom lights on and had to switch them of as they flashed so much it was like being in a disco. The service at the Hamptons Bar was really disappointing we took a seat and were totally ignored for twenty minutes while others around us arrived and were served swiftly and attentively, there were quite a few staff members and none were rushed off their feet. Eventually we got up and went to the staff and asked be served 5 minutes later someone came to take our drinks order. It then took another 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, this is really not the service I would expect. I have to say though the breakfast was lovely and the breakfast staff were very attentive and friendly. One thing that does concern me is that my card was charged £80 above the Nightly rate as a pre authorization, nobody informed me of this at check in and I had to call after I left to check i hadn’t been overcharged. Whilst I was assured in a few days the charge will drop off  I really don’t think this is acceptable practice Would I stay again? I really don’t know I think for the nightly price there are probably much better options.",3,2019,07,05
121,Superlative,"Loved everything about it.  Easy walk to Buckingham Palace so that we could beat the crowds for changing of the Guard.  All staff were very helpful and friendly.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Expensive, but worth it.",5,2019,07,05
121,"Decent hotel, great location, stretched staff","Visited the place for a short business trip. The location of the hotel is ideal for a family or business trip. The hotel is just a short walk from the Buckingham palace. 

The hotel rooms are not so cramped up as is the case in other London hotels.

Given that we visited the hotel during peak cricket World Cup season the hotel was fully sold out to most Indian travellers given the Taj linkage.

The breakfast was pretty average though, with very limited options especially for fruits. And the wait time for breakfast was almost 30 mins every morning. The staff was struggling to manage the large occupancy.

When I checked on my room ac was not working and after several complaints I realised that the issue persisted when I came back at 1 am and then only the staff realised the flaw but was courteous to change my room.

On check out my cousin who was there to pick me sprained his leg and requested the hotel to provide a balm or sprain spray and after almost 30 mins of struggle the front desk came back saying that this isn’t available in the hotel. As he had sprained his leg and had a swelling he couldn’t wear his shoes so I requested for a shoe horn but again the front desk kept calling people in house keeping and never came back.

While the hotel is pretty decent in terms of location the staff really needs to be higher on ownership and responsiveness.",3,2019,07,04
121,Great location but pricey and too busy,"Little too busy for us.  Some of the staff could have been friendlier.  Room was small for what we paid but bed/pillows were superbly comfortable, great nights sleep.  Breakfast was excellent. We used the spa for a treatment, it was clean and relaxing, therapist was good.  
For exploring London the location is fantastic.  Charged 20.00GBP per hour for early check in and late check out!  We declined, have never stayed anywhere and been charged that before.
It was nothing special compared to other 4* Hotels and for the price we paid - definitely paying extra for the location. ",4,2019,07,04
121,Fist time visit to London,"The hotel location is amazing!.Walking distance to many attractions. Also very close to the underground/metro.
The breakfast buffet were delicious and had a good variety. 
The room was very comfortable and clean!
Also, love the outdoor patio were you could  relax with a wine glass and enjoy the weather.",5,2019,07,03
121,Fantastic Group Stay!,"I really loved this hotel! I am an event and trip planner and I brought a group of 54 people to stay here in June of 2019. I chose it for my group because of the newly renovated rooms and bathrooms. It was beyond what I expected. Everything was perfect (for me). I am usually very uncomfortable in hotels, but I felt right at home here. It was clean and new. The hallways were clean and modern. Inside the room, the entry way had a hard surface (no carpet) which was very nice. The green/purple/gray color scheme was a nice choice/design. The bathroom had a huge walk-in shower and plenty of hooks/shelves. The lighting in the bathroom (and throughout the room) was very nice. There was a makeup mirror and a warming towel rack which were nice touches. The coolest part was you could watch tv or play music from the internet radio (on the tv) and it was connected to a speaker in the bathroom! They also had multiple power outlets at the desk -- including usb outlets and an american plug, so no need to bring your adapter! Since I was working for the entire trip, I ordered a lot of room service and all of the food I ordered was amazing. I was really surprised by how good the food was -- and it wasn't too overpriced like many of the hotels. The fitness center was private and had plenty of machines/weights. Also, the staff was so accommodating and friendly. Every single staff member. The doorman, concierge, front desk -- and just anyone walking in the halls. It was luxurious, but it didn't feel pretentious like so many of the 5 star hotels. I felt like everything we paid was completely worth it. The only thing I wish they had was a self-service laundry room, but everything else was so perfect -- this was something I could overlook. (Note: If you book a suite in Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences -- the hotel next door, they have a washing machine/dryer in the kitchen).

I am happy we chose this hotel and it made my time in London (while working) less stressful for me. Thank you all so much!",5,2019,07,01
121,Classy & Stylish,"My Daughter and myself stayed for 4 nights in a Jr Suite while a couple of my other relatives stayed down the block.  We loved it so much. I booked a Alice in Wonderland Tea for 8 of us and it was the best Tea I’ve ever had.  Every tea I go to, I compare it to the St. James.  They made us feel very welcome staying there and if we have another reunion in London again, I would definitely stay there.  We met with family, but stayed in different hotels and went sightseeing. They were in a great location to see all of the sights and great shopping like Harrods and Selfridges.  Definitely recommend staying there.",5,2019,06,27
121,A POLITE EXPERIENCE,"Following an overnight flight, we were politely greeted by a well trained doorman and front desk staff.  Throughout our weeklong stay, we encountered an efficient housekeeper, helpful telephone operator and delightful food and drink staff as well as tasty food.
The concierge staff is anxious to please and the fine manners of the entire staff are a refreshing change from some spots in the US.  I wish I had a dollar for every smile, ""Thank you"", ""Please"", ""It's our pleasure"", ""Anything we can do to help?"", and I would have paid for the trip.",5,2019,06,27

121,Dr Luzze's feel of the TAJ hotel following an overnight stay,"Following the 13- hour trip from Uganda to London, I was warmly received at the entrance of TAJ hotel in Central London. The men at the entrance struggled among themselves to ensure that I safely accessed the hotel entrance. This was a kind struggle! At the reception desk, I was met with a kind lady, by the name Taiwo. From the name, it was easy for me to tell that she has connections in Nigeria. Unlike most Nigerians, she was so soft spoken and clear accent. It took only 5 minutes to check me into the room.",4,2019,06,27
121,"Great location, somewhat questionable staff","I can say nothing wrong about the location of this hotel. If you want something centrally located, this place is perfect. However, do not trust the pictures you see online. A very significant portion of the hotel has not been renovated yet, but all of the pictures I found online only showed the newly renovated rooms. When my husband and I checked in for the start of a 3 week trip around the UK, we found ourselves in a room full of mold that smelled horrible. I have a severe mold allergy, so this was problematic. I spoke with a manager who apologized and put us in one of the renovated rooms, but she said that the room we were originally placed was never supposed to have been rented out. Why we were put there is beyond me.

The rest of the stay was fairly uneventful until we tried to order a bottle of wine at the bar. They kept bringing out the wrong bottles, even to the point of bringing a pinot noir when we had ordered a sauvignon blanc. After bringing out 3 different bottles of wine (all wrong), someone finally brought us the correct bottle. 

Overall, for the price I am not sure it is worth it. We have had much better experiences at the Grosvenor Hotel (comparable price), which isn't as convenient, but we never had mold issues or incorrect orders.",3,2019,06,26

We wanted to ship some parcels home and Danniello was able arrange this for us.
We did not eat in house but the facilities looked terrific.
Location is very close to Buckingham Palace and lots of other attractions.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a central location.

121,Absolutely perfect hotel for a London visit,"The Taj is a welcome , serene enclave in the heart of St James London , just literally around the corner from the park and Buckingham Palace .
We walked through the park to the West End theatre in about 15 mins .
The room looked to be recently updated and had good Aircon , a great size and a modern bathroom with bath and shower facilities.
There’s an outdoor courtyard bar and an indoor bar , a Michelin star restaurant on site and a fantastic staff to look after you .
The maid found my sweater in the room after we left and posted it back to us for free .. unbelievable customer service.. 
we will definitely be staying again !",5,2019,06,25
121,Nice hotel,Nice hotel but unfortunately our room had issues. The heater/a/c did not work. The toilet  didn't work well. The shower door didn't close so the bathrm flooded. TV won't turn off. The staff tried to accomodate but too many issues. On the more positve note the location was great.,4,2019,06,24
121,Good Hotel but incapable of resolving customer complaints,"Have enjoyed stays at this hotel previously but found that it is incapable of resolving complaints.

Had to stay for more than 24 hours in a room with faulty air conditioning - issue was not resolved in spite of several complaints
After agreeing to move to another room, it took several calls and 2 hours to get everything organized.
The maintenance team took 2 hours to repair a broken toilet seat cover of the new room after first reporting that it has been fixed without actually fixing it.
The front desk and the barmen were clueless about the Taj innercircle/epicure benefits and we were denied benefits during the stay. 
Booked a porter with the front desk for 530am for an early morning check out - porter did not turn up

Unfortunately, the managers were not very helpful and the staff is not sufficiently trained to ensure complaint resolution. And the senior managers find ways of passing the buck back to the customer.",1,2019,06,23
121,Experience the Royal hospitality,"We have had many experiences at Taj properties. The people of Taj never stop to amaze me with the dedication they show towards their guests. ""Athithi Devo Bhava"" - Guest is God.

Shout out to Binoy Nair - He is an absolute gem of a person and the best concierge you could dream of. His knowledge of the city is mind blowing.",5,2019,06,21
121,EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATION,"Sunaina .Soares, guest relation manager did a excellent job in making arrangements for our 25th Marriage anniversary on 8th june. She exceeded our expectations from a taj hotel in London. It really made our day. 
As we were checking in late at 22.30 , our rooms were ready and next to each other as requested.
 
Location : the hotel is situated within walking distance of Buckingham Palace.

",5,2019,06,21
121,Delightful staff and lovely hotel,"Immediately impressed by the lovely lobby and the building itself.

Only 2 small things to improve on, one would be to focus on presentation of the area outside the conservatory, chairs were piled high, so the view wasn't as enticing as it could have been.  Also another person on reception as even at 11:30pm, there was a queue to check in (c. 20 minute wait)

It was lovely to have such a wide choice for breakfast, including curry and both reception staff and concierge worked really hard to make guests feel at home! Would like to visit again.",5,2019,06,21
121,Home away from Home.,"Superb Hotel. I dont know how you do this; but the staff etiquettes & grooming is the same be it India or London. Neve felt I was in London; the term ""Athiti Deva Bhava"" is truely in the DNA of Taj. Hats Off. The food and even breakfast was superb. Cant wait to be back soon. ",5,2019,06,20
121,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience. The room service ruined all the breast milk i pumped (10days worth) and sent to keep in the freezer. The guy on the phone at the room service was unpleasant and unhelpful. And clearly incompetent as well. They returned the entire milk at check out straight from the fridge, not freezer. I had to throw it all out. Breast milk is not something they should be so callous with. 

I even went to several shops to find freezer packs. And i sent them to room service to keep in the freezer as well. So that i could have the milk cold till i got to the flight. I explained everything to the rooom service guy on the phone twice.  He was rude and said everything was understood. But at check out the freezer packs were not given to me. 

The concierge wasn’t very helpful as well. And sent me on a wild goose chase (house of Fraser, Argos, boots) for the freezer packs when i actually found it in a shop quite close to the hotel (Peter dyer).

I’ve stayed in the apartment side of the Taj twice before and its been wonderful. The hotel side was a huge disappointment.  

Such bad service is not expected from the Taj brand.",1,2019,06,19
121,Stunning hotel with 5* service,"Stayed for a birthday weekend in London. Upon check in we were welcomed and introduced to the customer relations manager. A lovely touch combined with the cake and balloons in the room- made it feel special. 

Upgraded to a premium room for £25 extra per night- worth it as it had a big TV and stunning bathroom. Our 8th floor room had a view of the Eye and Westminster Abbey! 

Bistro in the hotel was super, again with excellent service on Friday night. 

Excellent location for exploring the sights. St James’s Park is a must visit and only a couple of min walk away. 

Overall, a 4* hotel but should be a 5*! Only slight disappointment was that pancakes and waffles at breakfast were chargeable on top of the £22 each for breakfast we had already paid... perhaps including breakfast  in the room price would make guests feels happier and not eat so much to get ‘value for money’ oops!",5,2019,06,16
121,Second visit to St. James,"I checked into the St. James hotel and was greeted by Duane. He was very kind, helpful and had a back pack a a bear and fun activity book for my daughter. We checked in at nearly one in the morning and he was alert and cheerful.
Sunaina- the guest relations manager was beyond helpful when my mom left a sentimental necklace in her room after check out. She sent security to see if it was still there and within an hour called me to say they located it. My mom was very grateful as was I. she also gave my daughter a bag full of goodies as we checked out. This occupied my daughter in the car ride and at the airport. Fun toys and craft book. Nishant - checked us out and he was very gracious. We had an amazing time and it was our second stay.- although it would be fun to stay at a different hotel, we won’t. We are too happy at the st. James! All staff so kind especially the morning breakfast staff.",5,2019,06,16
121,Premium service now matched by the new Premium rooms,"Fabulous stay thanks to Nishant at the the front desk and the new premium rooms.  Nishant is a revelation, the best first impression a hotel could ever hope to make.  As for the new rooms, the St James' Court is now essentially two hotels in one. The section housing the new rooms has been completely remodeled and can compete with most five star hotels for comfort and luxury.  The Taj group has a golden location on their hands and will hopefully follow through and renovate the entire hotel.  Until then, enjoy the upgraded section as well as the excellent proximity to many of London's best attractions.",5,2019,06,15
121,Fabulous stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights on a dinner, bed & breakfast basis in one of the premium king rooms. The room was spacious and the bathroom was excellent. The selection of toiletries was also very good. The room was quiet and we slept extremely well both nights. 

The choice at breakfast in our opinion was of excellent quality and the food choices were extremely fresh. Staff at the breakfast service were extremely friendly and gave excellent customer focused service. The breakfast service times are very good taking into consideration those that are working in offices close by. 

The selection of options for evening meal in The Bistro is plentiful and once again top quality. 

Used the Spa only for a Facial. The Spa is a very calming place with a fantastic selection of treatments available. Staff amazing as with rest of the hotel. 

Check in and out were smooth and efficient compared to other hotels my husband and I have stayed in recently.",5,2019,06,15
121,Not worth the money,"Arrived at the hotel at 7pm to be told I would not be able to check in until 8p, during this time I was offered a complimentary drink... Reservation clearly stated I could check in from 4 but obviously not the case.

The room was far from great and was sub par for hotels where I have paid a lot less. 
The TV was small and useless, the bathroom had a hole in the ceiling and rust or other substances running down the walls in places. A view of an internal roof and finally a door that mean I heard everything that happened in the corridor outside my room.

I would actively avoid staying in this hotel in future. 

1 +ve, the food in the Bistro was very nice and surprisingly reasonably priced!  ",2,2019,06,14
121,Summer vacation trip with family,"Everything was perfect except breakfast. Very few options for vegetarians.
Need to add more items in veg category. They should not put potato wedges with sausages. 
Rest of things were good. I hope they will take my advise in a positive manner.",4,2019,06,12
121,Nice hotel but not an easy stay on this occasion ,"I am staying here on business and just want a comfortable quiet night. I am on the 7th floor which is good in theory for noise but as it it the top floor is by the air con units, so not good. The TV does not work and the room is small and dated. Nice bar but they add 12.5% on top of already high prices just for a drink. Additionally although the company have paid, they took what I thought was a swipe of my card and after this said “that is a credit card yes” I said “no a debit card” at which point I was told they took £50 and it will take a week to get it back. Really not happy. I would be happier in s Premier Inn right now as am missing the news as someone tries to fix the TV. Poor ",1,2019,06,11
121,Good Hotel,"It’s a 5 star property closer to Victoria Station and Buckingham palace, rooms are small, then the service is top class and food is excellent. it’s walking distance to major attractions and subway station",4,2019,06,10
121,"Splendour everywhere, but in the room","The service at this hotel is seamless and the staff friendly and helpful. The public areas are magnificent. The gym very good.  It comes down to the question of which is more important to you in a hotel, the public spaces or your room.  In this hotel it requires a choice not an answer of both.  With a rack rate for the room we occupied of in excess of £500 per night, our room was not in proportion to the rate nor the splendour of the public space. The room was in good condition and adequate but that is all. The wi fi was intermittent, the towel heater did not work and the shower curtain was plastic and in the way of all plastic shower curtains, worked from time to time. Some of the toiletries were not replaced on night two.
Breakfast was good but in no way extraordinary.  Location is perfect and this is its greatest selling point.  Overall it was a slight disappointment due to the room.",4,2019,06,10
121,Gateway to UK,"Breakfast can be improved with better variety.
The overall service and the staff is the best that one can expect. 
The new suites are very well done and very comfortable. 
Rooms are very quiet and the quality of the beds and the linen was very nice. 
",5,2019,06,10
121,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights Friday 7th - 9th June. The hotel and staff were absolutely faultless. The suite we stayed in was absolutely spotless and had everything you needed for a very comfortable stay. The spa treatment was amazing and the facilities there were brilliant, especially after a busy day sightseeing! Mariana who checked us in and out on reception was lovely and very helpful also Angelo the manager on duty made it possible for us to stay in one of their fabulous suites!! All staff around the hotel were very polite. The location was perfect, literally around the corner from Buckingham palace, yet the street was away from all the hustle and bustle. My one tiny criticism and I really don’t want to criticise as the hotel was so fabulous! When we left the hotel reception to go across the beautiful outside court/bar there were a few people stood right on the door smoking, not being a smoker it was pretty unpleasant being greeted with and having to walk through cigarette smoke, I think management team should look at a designated smoking area outside as I’m sure it’s beautiful out there on a summers evening, but certainly should ban smoking by the main door leading out of the hotel to the spa and rooms. Would not hesitate to stay at this hotel in the future though, and I don’t often bother to leave reviews but couldn’t not review how great this hotel is. Thank you St James court for a wonderful stay",5,2019,06,09
121,Excellent choice,"Three nights here were delightful.  We enjoyed the 10% discount on bar and meals by being a member of their free InnerCircle club (but you need to have your club number and reconfirm the discount when you check out).  The light jazz duo in the bar area were fun to listen to.  I paid an up charge from the InnerCircle rate to move to the new premium rooms.  We were delighted with our room:  spacious, wonderful large HD tv great for watching Roland Garros tennis, large shower with dual heads.  Best was that it was quite near the back elevator that goes straight to the Spa.  Loved the free Spa facilities:  steam room, sauna, and large pool/whirlpool.  Very nice!  Breakfast was great too, as long as you eat before the rush hour of 9:30-10:30.",5,2019,06,07
121,Perfect,"It’s not my first time staying at the Taj and it won’t be my last!  On this occasion I stayed with my 16 year old son.  The room in the 7th floor was modern, comfortable and spacious ( by London standards).  Everything was easy - something I crave when I travel!  Staff were wonderful and everything just worked...I shall be back yet again x",5,2019,06,04
121,A wonderful hotel with an amazing staff,"The room was spacious, the food excellent and the staff exceptionally accommodating. Will go back next time in London. The courtyard provides an escape from the bustle of the city, while the location keeps you in the heart of London.",5,2019,06,04
121,Hotel Stay,"I was there on business having stayed there previously. The atmoshere is relaxing, the service and staff are friendly and efficient. The location is ideal if your there for hoilday and sightseeing. From a business point of view the facilities are excellent.",5,2019,06,01
121,"Terrific, Punctual, Easy and Safe",Excellent stay.  Hotel is terrifically located.  Highly accessible.  All staff were courteous and helpful.  The room was extremely clean.  Evening snacks and cocktails in the lounge were delicious.  We loved our spacious family room which offered two rooms and 1.5 baths.  We were in the newly renovated area.  Outside courtyard was delightful.  ,5,2019,05,30
121,Our comfort zone,"We stayed at St. James Court for a week (May 18-25) and I must say, it felt like home. The staff was very friendly, especially Noemi (who looked like Anne Hathaway), we arrived a bit early for check-in but she found a way to give us a room for a much-needed rest! Breakfast was great! All the table attendants, everyone was great and friendly. You can ask the chef to cook you an omelet or fried egg with your pre-paid breakfast. For the third day, they surprised us with a plate of white and dark chocolate, and on the 5th, a plate of fresh fruits. The daily complimentary water (still and sparkling) in glass bottles was a big help to keep us hydrated after a long day's walk. My only issue was the half glass shower door, and they scrimp on facial tissue :) 
The hotel is strategically located in Westminster. In fact, the hotel was a cool 2-block  away from the Buckingham Palace. Step out of the hotel, turn left and walk up straight to the palace. We enjoyed walking in St. James Park or the Mall and worked our way to Piccadilly Circus, Chinatown, and Trafalgar. In fact, from the hotel, you can walk to Westminster Abbey, the Churchill War Museum, and the Horse Parade. Step out of the hotel and go right- straight up to the main road, turn right and you will reach Victoria Station Underground. Ok, just a tip: The London Tower, London Eye, London Bridge, and Borough Market are located in the City of London. Meanwhile, The Buckingham Palace, The Abbey, Churchill War Museum, Trafalgar, Piccadilly, and Chinatown are located in the City of Westminster. 
Whether you stay in the City of London or Westminster, you can use the Victoria Station tube to go either way :)
Meanwhile, worried about getting a black cab? Don't be! Black cabs patiently await just across the street for passengers. I would highly recommend this place and the next time we return to London, we will surely stay at this hotel.",4,2019,05,30
121,Great location close to a lot of major sites,"Initial room we were given was very dated and not that nice. We were offered an upgrade to a premium room and took it for additional money and that room was nice.
Breakfast was offered and was ok for selection. We ended up finding a nice cafe across the street that we ended up eating in. While the hotel was a fairly nice hotel and in a nice location would not stay here again",3,2019,05,29
121,Great hotel near Buckingham Palace,"Great rooms, awesome service, Good breakfast.. check-in & check-out was smooth. Try to see if you can get newly renovated rooms. they are called premium rooms and have more contemporary decor. We'd definitely stay here again on our future visits",5,2019,05,29
121,"Good value, nice setting","Stayed one night, good location more or less equidistant Buckinham palace, Westminster and Victoria. Door staff,concierge and reception all very efficient and friendly. We booked through a booking agency as I could not get the hotel's booking site to respond (my prefered way of booking) so possibly did not get the best room in its class. However I have no complaints. It was a resonable size, air-con efficient and quiet. Bed linin seemed to be a very high thread count. Bathroom small but well equiped and very clean (even the difficult corners which many hotels miss).
Room 436 was next to the ventilation/air-con chimney (for the kitchen???). This presented a continuous but low hum all the time. This was not a problem, but may disturb very light sleepers. There were no smells as this vented above roof height.
We ate in the Bistro, both  the risotto and curry were as good as I would expect from dedicated Italian and Indian restaurants.
The central courtyard would be a very nice place for drinks and relaxation on a hot day.
Perhaps the only dissapointment was the breakfast. Instead of croissants and pain-au-chocolat e.t.c. we had doughnuts and jam tarts!!! Could not see any bread or nice fresh rolls. On the other hand coffee was very good and NO 'sprinkle' abominations on the cappuccini.
I would almost certainly use Taj again, in preference to our usual choice, a French run hotel on the other side of St James' Park",5,2019,05,29
121,Awesome Stay !,"Superb property..A very central location close to Vistoria, Trafalgar Square and walking distance to major attractions! Excellent service & hospitality ..We stayed here for 7 nights and were really impressed with everything ..The staff took special care of us keeping in mind we were travelling with our 2 year old baby, the breakfast spread was superb with excellent quality of food. 
We had booked the junior suite which was spacious & well kept however the shower and basin need upgradation!
We had complimentary access to the spa facilities like Steam, Sauna,Whirlpool etc..
All in all a great stay and looking forward to visit again 😊👍👌",5,2019,05,28
121,Gr8 Hotel @ the heart of London,"Good ambiance . Good food & Service . All good places in central London just nearby .

Center court is amazing -- Good heritage hotel.

Breakfast is good but needs some more variety to make it worth.

Evening piano @ Hampton's was superb !!",4,2019,05,28
121,Amazing hotel,"Would strongly recommend this hotel. Very friendly staff, excellent location and overall very nice experience. 
Right in the heart of London and very clean. Would defiantly advice to use the courtyard. ",5,2019,05,27
121,Premium Service and Experience,"Great place to stay. Very near Buckingham Palace. Super friendly and helpful staff, nothing too much trouble. Room facing courtyard a must. Superior sleep quality, bed was so comfortable. I travel a great deal and never had such a great first nights sleep. Can recommend the Alice in Wonderland cream tea. Overall 9.9 out of 10 ",4,2019,05,27
121,Absolutely Great Hotel with Wonderful Friendly Staff,"We stayed here 4 nights and could not be more pleased with our experience! Excellent location with first class rooms and common areas. Staff were terrific to deal with, especially Nishant at Reception. He could not have been more pleasant or helpful. And the Concierge team was great, too. We look forward to a return visit to this fine Hotel.",5,2019,05,27
121,"Amazing hotel, great staff and excellent location","Amazing hotel, great staff and excellent location. The staff was really helpful and flexible regarding our needs. The location is really amazing, you can basically walk anywhere in the city center. They also provide good breakfast.",5,2019,05,26
121,Service above and beyond,"The only reason I give a four to this hotel is the small room and ours was super noisy as it was facing a school. The location is fantastic, the concierge was fantastic too. Binoy is truely one of the best concierge I have ever met. Loved the restaurants. Most importantly though, they went above and beyond to not only manage but also meet the guests' expectations. Sunaina their guest relations manager personally solved one of our small issues very promptly. I was surprised to know that the front office manager, Naveen also knew about it and came up to talk to me. Not many hotels will you see the front office manager taking the effort to answer a small issue. I stayed at this hotel more than 20 years ago, and decided to stay here again because I was nostalgic. I sure was glad I decided to do so!",4,2019,05,25
121,Bad bad bad,Please don’t bother with this major rip off hotel. Nothing but problems and bad service since we’ve been here. Hating that I ever considered this place. Bad breakfast. Bad service in the lobby bar. Front d so staff seems helpless and hopeless.,1,2019,05,25
121,"Great location, friendly staff","This hotel is in a great location and within a short walking distance of St James Park underground and Victoria underground. Staff are incredibly friendly, rooms good size (especially the upgraded rooms).  The standard rooms are adequate but perhaps dated,  the upgraded rooms are lovely. Breakfast was good although some tables were very close to each other (which we avoided). The outside courtyard area is a delightful and relaxing space. The Quilon restaurant next door is excellent, well worth a visit. This hotel is well worth staying at, it could teach some of its high end hotel rivals a few things. We had a great stay, Thank you to all staff.",5,2019,05,24
121,Great Location and Wonderful Service but only cubbyholes,"St James’s Court is almost a heritage hotel. The location in Central London is outstanding. I could easily go for my morning constitutional to St Jame’s Park and also walk to a conference near the Westminster Abbey. Tube stations too are nearby. The Taj Service stands out everywhere.
My only problem with the hotel are its rooms. Mine was a cubbyhole with no windows. It was at an end of an endless and winding corridor. The room seems to be designed to keep the guests outdoors as much as possible!!!",4,2019,05,24
121,"Nice hotel, great service","Hotel was well appointed.  The location was just a little south of trafalgar, just off Victoria.  Easy walk to st James park, green park, Westminster abbey, Buckingham, Big Ben, eye.  You can take the Gatwick express to Victoria and walk from there.
Positives:  staff is top notch.  All working hard willing to help and very approachable.
Workout room is fine
Breakfast is good as is the afternoon tea.  Breakfast can get crowded at certain times but they work hard not to make you wait.
Check in was delayed but they offered us drinks for the few minutes we waited.  Service was a positive here
Rooms are fine.
Negatives:
The shower was an open part of the bathroom and if you didn’t prop towels on the edge, water would leak out of the room.  We got a disabled room type so not sure if this is common.
We paid in pounds and for some reason the amount hitting our card after conversion was not accurate.  The hotel has not been very helpful and has shuffled me to the processing company they deal with.  It’s adding about 4%to the bill for no other reason than the exchange rate is less than competitive.  I haven’t had this issue come up with other hotels",4,2019,05,23
121,Perfect location to see London! ,"We stayed here on the first 3 nights on our honeymoon. We loved the location of this hotel, staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We could easily walk to Buckingham palace, Hyde park, Westminster, church hill war rooms etc. When we needed the tube it was a short walk away which was perfect to get to the airport and the national rail services. We will definitely be staying here again! ",5,2019,05,23
121,Lovely place to stay and wonderful staff,"This review is to highlight Yannick who did his very best to assist our family upon check-in. Not only was he efficient but extremely hospitable. We needed to get in fast as we had reservations at Kona. He helped us get checked in quickly and went above and beyond in the realm of customer service. This entire staff, including those at Kona, reminded us that some people really do take pride in their work.",5,2019,05,22
121,A wonderful stay as always,Wonderful old world charm and hospitality with modern convenience .. So close to all the vibrancy and very central.. The staff are very helpful and the Concierge can do anything from reservations to getting tickets to sold out shows! ,5,2019,05,22
121,"Beautiful hotel, very attentive staff","We spent 3 nights at St,. James, celebrating my husband's birthday; we enjoyed our stay, beautiful hotel, very attentive staff, nice bar with delicious cocktails. We got an upgrade to the newly refurbished rooms nicely decorated and comfortable.
The hotel is very well located on a quiet area, close to public transport and parks.
From arriving to leaving our stay was wonderful.First time staying here, but will be back.",5,2019,05,22
121,a comfortable and relaxing experience,"i have nothing but praise for this hotel the ambiance staff and room were of the highest standard and i cant fault the hotel at all, I would strongly recommend it to business and leisure travelers the only criticism is that it is an enormous place to find your way around",5,2019,05,21
121,Proper London Hotel,"Great location for main Westminster points of interest. Direct Circle line from Paddington.
Proper Hotel, with doorman and air con that works quietly as well.
Good breakfast across road to the left. Good Italian resteraunt as well. Buckingham and Albert pubs very near for decent pint in London pub. ",5,2019,05,21
121,Beautiful hotel with nice amenities ,"The hotel is centered in a quiet location away from the touristy areas. We’ve had amazing encounters with all of the staff- they were incredibly helpful and friendly. One downside is some of the rooms tend to be on the small side. There is also an academy next to the hotel, so it does get quite noisy when the children are outside. The gym was fantastic and the steam room was a great way to start the day. ",4,2019,05,20
121,Wedding anniversary,"Enjoyed every minute of our stay, beautiful hotel, amazing staff, room was very clean and comfortable 
Will definitely be returning 5*. Got a free upgraded room and guests of the day, highly recommend.",5,2019,05,19

121,Amazing Facility,"amazing experience  facility was very nice and staff are amazing.. friendly and helpful.  you can easily walk to several tourist attractions  Buckingham palace  Westminster Abbey  Big Ben/parliament  churchhill war rooms.  St. James tube station is very close and can access all over london easily  Westminster station is also walkable...and the river cruise dock is right there also.  breakfast was a very nice, large choices and will make eggs/omelets etc to order     We were very pleased with the facility and staff ",5,2019,05,18
121,Excellent hotel in central location. ,"I stayed for one night and whilst visiting London for business. From the moment I stepped through the door the experience could not have been better.  Helpful staff, the foyer had plenty of class and atmosphere and my room was exceptional.  This will be my go to place when visiting London.  ",5,2019,05,18
121,Great stay,Fantastic hotel near Buckingham Palace and some great pubs.The Bistro food and service was outstanding.Had my mothers 80th birthday there and it was awesome.The rooms are spacious and check in was smooth.The only thing we didn't like was the lounge service everything else was perfect.Will stay there again.,5,2019,05,16
121,Royal retreat,Our 2nd visit. Stayed 2 nights for a Queens Garden Party in Buckingham Palace. Got upgraded to a superior room. Nice decor in a bijou room. Fab service levels in a right royal location. Breakfast v pricey and no Indian options. Bed moved away from headboard when sat upright. Great staff. A must visit.,5,2019,05,16
121,One of the best hotels of London,"Indeed the most well located hotel in London. The hotel beats majority of its competitors in terms of service, food, facilities and the staff. This was my second stay and I shall continue to stay only in Taj on my next visit. The location let’s you cover all possible attractions on foot.",5,2019,05,16
121,amazing hotel and location,"amazing hotel and the rooms where big high ceiling. 3 girls sttayed on the room supper confortable and clean. Lovely spa and interior spa pool. Stuff supper friendly and attentive. Locations is amazing beyond words...love it, love it, loved it...",5,2019,05,14
121,Wonderful Experience,"This was my first time at the Taj St James and it was Asian service at its best. Check-in was smooth and super friendly. I was upgraded even though I had never stayed with them before. The room was well appointed and clean. The hotel has a beautiful spa, a very nice bar area and a lovely courtyard. The latter might benefit from some heaters, as London tends to be chilly even in spring, for patrons to be able to make full use of it.

Service was impeccable and staff very friendly - definitely would come back.",5,2019,05,14
121,Amazing,Excellent hotel right near Buckingham Palace. The service from the staff was fantastic and the rooms greatly improved since I last stayed there 4 years ago. Plenty of places to go eat with Victoria market halls a 10 minute walk away. I would happily stay here regularly,5,2019,05,13
121,Super ⭐️ ,"Booked this hotel for a weekend visit, it was our first stay at this hotel and was not disappointed, it was absolutely perfect and we were upgraded at check in which made it even more special! Already looking to re-book for a special birthday in July with my whole family ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2019,05,13
121,Fantastic service in a great location.,"Friendly helpful staff everywhere in the hotel. 
Room was large and very comfortable bed and pillows. TV could be updated. Bathroom towels were a grand size which is much appreciated. Newly renovated breakfast area was bright and faced the beautiful hotel garden courtyard. The breakfast buffet spread of hot and cold selections with fresh cooked egg and porridge options was more than ample and staff are a morning delight. 
Enjoyed the bar cocktails and the high tea where both food and staff were again exceptional. Loved the location to everything central.",5,2019,05,13
121,A home away from home,"Its a very good hotel , very close to the Buckingham Palace and Victoria station. Also can have a good morning walk or run in the green park. and can walk down to the oxford circus and area in the evenings. Even my workplace is quite close to this venue. Had a good time at the hotel and every time you return its the same experience. The new shifting of the breakfast in the conservatory area is a welcome move in the summers and feels really great to have breakfast there. Overall its very good very comfortable and central location and a soothing experience.",5,2019,05,13
121,Great service and location,We have stayed at other Taj Hotels and one thing is consistent and that is their excellent service.  The word “no” is not in their vocabulary.  We arrived from the states worn out and were not completely happy with our room. The manager Brendan was patient and kind and showed us other rooms until we got exactly what we needed.  The vibe is lively and diverse.  The buffet breakfast is perfect and can be included with your room.  The concierge staff booked us great tickets to the new Tina Turner musical and got us reservations at several dinner locations as well as recommending some new places. Every staff member we had contact with was first rate.  Plus the location is on a quiet street just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park.  Won’t stay anywhere else.,5,2019,05,12
121,Experience a traditional English style Hotel,"Nice Hotel in the Center of London close to many attractions and St James Park, good for the morning exercise if that is needed. All  amenities are available in the Hotel, the rooms are nice and clean, a good size but some to the back might be little noisy due to a school in the backyard. 
Breakfast was ok, but I had expected a little more from a Hotel in this price range.",4,2019,05,10
121,Recent stay,"Beautiful hotel with many amenities.  Restaurant Bistro & bar area were all great.  Had to ask way too many times for simple things that were problematic, missing or not replenished on a daily basis.  Promised the daily paper and never received it.   ",4,2019,05,09
121,Very nice experience!,"We had an amazing experience the minute we stepped foot into the Taj.  Friendly and helpful staff checked us in, very nice room with all the amenities and extras you do/and don’t expect.  It was our first time staying at a Taj location and do plan to be back.  Thank you ",5,2019,05,08
121,Excellent choice,"Nice and comfortable room (standard double), clean and large enough. Concierge helpful and very professional. Restyled rooms available at a reasonable price. Great location, taxis always available on the corner. Bar and restaurant are very good, lobby large and comfortable. Recommended",4,2019,05,07
121,Great hotel.,"Superb location, wonderful staff, helpful and welcoming. Good facilities, easy walking distance to palace, Thames, Westminster attractions. Highly recommend.takes too long to write a review of 200 characters",5,2019,05,07
121,Well-Located Feels-Great London Hotel,"Let me first explain the baseline in London hotels.

An ""average"" London hotel tends to be in a building that is quite old and thus the winding pathway to the rooms a bit of an adventure. The rooms themselves tend to be a bit musty (popping open a window does the trick unless it's winter) and the decor and furnishings a bit tired.

The St. James' Court hotel is in a GREAT location, for sure. If you're into walking the city this is an excellent home base. The bellman turned me onto a wonderful pub very close by that served as my roost for watching some of the World Cup (a real bonus for me).

The lobby and the rooms are easily a step or two above the typical London hotel. A quick-and-easy way to know if you are staying in an ""average"" hotel is when there are flight crews from many airlines in residence...not the case with St. James' Court. The lobby was pristine and the restaurants well-staffed and interesting. All guests were treated with genuine care and regard by the staff, and both check-in and check-out were a breeze.

Now, the ""money"" part: Forget the notion of ""value"" with London hotels; you're in one of the world's major cities so, like NYC and Hong Kong and Tokyo, most hotels are quite pricey. The St. James' Court is no different. But, at least the experience made it all feel worth it.",4,2019,05,06
121,Amazing stay at St James' Court,"From the moment of arrival until departure staff courteous, friendly and really welcoming
Hotel beautiful and a very high standard of furnishings and cleanliness. We were upgraded to a beautiful twin room and guest of day. Enjoyed delightful cocktails in Hamiltons bar.  Breakfast superb with great choice",5,2019,05,05
121,Opulent and Majestic Hotel in Central London,"Stayed at this lovely hotel in central London. Within walking distance of many tourist attractions including Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and the shopping and theatre districts of Piccadilly Circus,  Oxford Street and Shaftsbury. Check in was smooth in a lobby remiscent of the luxury hotels of the Orient, and the smell of fresh jasmine filled the lobby and elevator areas. The room was decent size and well appointed and so was the bathroom. Toiletries were lemongrass- based which is one of my personal favourites. Constable behind with Egyptian cotton bed linen. Large screen LCD TV with a good array of cable channels to suit all tastes. All in all a very comfortable and luxurious stay. ",5,2019,05,02
121,Exotic food in an English frame,"Location is perfect - walking distance from Victoria station and other stations, main attractions (Westminster, Buckingham palace, etc...) rooms are small but comfortable, equipped with ironing board to be foldless at your business meeting. Business center is open 24h- perfect to print your last minute boarding card. Sockets in the room are UK standards only. The restaurant (Bistro) offers a good selection of Indian-European-fusion food. I found the curry really tasty. The staff is helpful and polite, clearly well trained and under careful leadership. The room housekeeping is perfect.",5,2019,05,01
121,Great hotek,"Amazing hotel, we had a brilliant stay here, would definitely come back. Steam room and pool are just what you need to make you relax even more. Breakfast is nice but could do with vegetarian sausages. ",5,2019,04,30
121,Delightful,"Impeccable and attentive service with the attention to detail you expect in Asia - all in London! A great property which is well located. I will only stay here when I come to London! The Quilon restaurant is exquisite, my Suite was very comfortable and everyone was pleasant and helpful. I loved this hotel and I travel a lot. In terms of value for money, this hotel is excellent.",5,2019,04,30
121,Not nice this time!,"We stayed at this hotel for the second time and hoped that the whole hotel offered good quality (it is a 4* Hotel and should meet some requirements for that.) since this time we booked the classic room, thinking that the difference would refer to surface and maybe less furniture, etc. We have not expected to receive a room above the air conditioning system which prevented us from sleeping for three nights. 
The whole room was shabby, dirty and had a bad moldy smell. We had to send our cloth to the cleaner's when we arrived home. So if you book, ask at the reception if you are above the air conditioning and go to the room to smell it before you agree to sleep there. 
The personnel are not quite friendly and with the exception of the breakfast room (service excellent there, nice, prompt and friendly!) a bit of training should bring some change in the service. The reception was really unfriendly and seemed to have to think a lot every time we asked for something. 
At our arrival we asked Beata to give us a nice room, since we were “good customers” and she answered that we booked classic room this time, somehow implying that we cannot expect anything special for the money. We are not the ""complaining type"" and hate spending the day with moving around from room to room. This was the reason we did not ask for another room. Just took things how they were and made the decision never to return.  And never to recommend the hotel to anybody.
So, this was our last time here, even if the location of the hotel is excellent.",1,2019,04,30
121,excellent hotel with exceptional service,"We had a lovely room, great breakfast, location superb. Highly recommend this property and their helpful staff. First class accomodations, attentive housekeeping, concierge helpful. Definitely going to come back to stay here again!
",5,2019,04,30
121,Returning Guest,"We have been here five times.  Should we again be in London, there will be a sixth stay.   Our requirements are simple: a quiet hotel with comfortable rooms in a location convenient to our interests and activities.",5,2019,04,30
121,Taj is fine wherever,"I stayed at the St, James Court Taj in mid-March, 2019, with two granddaughters, ages 14 and 12.. I waited until 2 days before flying from New York to book a hotel, after constantly checking with Hotels.com and Hotwire on prices, which generally were falling. The wait enabled a good rate, $239 for a room for all of us, which included a large bed for the girls to share, and a rollaway bed for me in a parlor. I've stayed at a number of Taj hotels in India, and loved every one. This Taj was somewhat less personal than those in India, but still fine. The staff was friendly and helpful. Best of all, the location was a block from Buckingham Palace, which the grils especially liked. I'd stay there again -- the hotel, not the Palace. The highlight for the girls was the Tower of London.",4,2019,04,29
121,Very comfortable 4days / 3nights,"Comfortable and spacious rooms (certainly for one person). Comfortable bed. Clean bathrooms. Newly renovated. Service was excellent. From check in to in room dining to house keeping. 

Only complaint is that breakfast was crowded and then staff where a bit overwhelmed at breakfast, but the hotel does warn you about this with notices in the lifts and in the room TV. Once you sit down or order breakfast in the room, this problem goes away. 

Overall very pleasant. ",5,2019,04,29
121,Amazing stay,Had a lovely time at this beautiful hotel was in a perfect location and had a stunning room. It was unfortunate that we could not try the restaurant but the bar and live piano was a perfect end to our Friday night. The staff were excellent and very friendly making our stay even better. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will certainly be staying here again soon.,5,2019,04,27
121,Excellent service and responsive management,"We stayed at St. James in April for 5 days and had an excellent stay in the hotel. This was our first trip to London with kids and grand parents; they all had to say good things about the property and service. The staff  especially management is responsive and took good care of some minor issues we had. They went beyond their responsibility to make our stay comfortable. Special thanks to Sunaina and other management team members for their help. Breakfast choices are good, service is usually great but their can be some delay as the space is limited but the staff tried their best to make us comfortable.  Like all Taj hotels, the service here is top notch. My only suggestion would be update rooms, they are not up to the standard one expect from Taj.",5,2019,04,26
121,Guest of the day experience!,"Just returned from an amazing visit to St James Court where we were chosen as guests of the day.  We were given a welcome drink of our choice, taken to have a photo in the beautiful courtyard, and upgraded to a suite, with a Krups coffee machine and a fruit plate, given a voucher for a free drink each in the Hampton bar, and we were entitled to 15% reduction on food at the hotel Bistro, as well as a discount in the Spa and a late check out.  We found the staff to be particularly open, charming and helpful, always commenting on what a pleasure it was to help us.  Our visit could not be faulted in any way, very smooth and elegant hotel, outstanding food in the Bistro, altogether an excellent experience.  We'll be back!",5,2019,04,26
121,Great location. Great staff. Beautiful new rooms,"We love this place. The new rooms are awesome and you’re super close to some great parks. Live music with a great piano player in the evenings and the staff are kind and helpful. 

We got upgraded to a new room and loved it.",5,2019,04,26
121,perfect location!!,"st james court has been an extremely satisfying experience. me and my husband were both celebrating our birthdays during our week in London, and the hotel took utmost care of us during and made us feel very very special indeed. the people there are very easy to talk to and always a smile on their face..whatever time of the day or morning doesnt matter.. the welcoming smile never wavers..Agnelo Lobo checked us in and did his best to settle us in and feel comfortable! Duane checked us out early morning at 5am and the check out was as pleasurable. commendable staff, nice clean rooms, excellent location!! coming again for sure!! :)",5,2019,04,25
121,Great location. Excellent service,"Very close to Westminster Abbey, Parliament and St. James Pak
Walk distance from Victoria station
Very good and safe location to commute across London at any time
Hi quality and good service standards 
All employees are kind and available to support
Perfect choice for families who exploring London by walk and tube",4,2019,04,23
121,Amazing Staff & Services,"Mr. Nacho Ramos, the Assistant Reception Manager Met us at the front desk and treated us as the ""Guest of the Day""... This upgraded our room, complimentary free drink at the bar, VIP turn down service; and, a special Easter treat left in our room while we were away.   What a great first impression and what a fantastics hotel and stafff.  Everyone was extremely proffesional and courteous.  The room.......absolutely flawless. Crisp, clean, and so so classy!  We will be back for sure.",5,2019,04,22
121,Good stay in London,"Good location, solicitous staff, reasonable size room for London. Good mattress, average shower pressure, good Nespresso machine. Reasonable storage, excellent outside seating area. Breakfast is good but does not excel.",5,2019,04,22
121,Great place to stay!!,So close to all the major tourist attractions. Staff is super courteous. Good restaurants in the hotel and so many great restaurants within in walking distance. Walking distance for Victoria station which is plus if you come through Gatwick airport.,5,2019,04,22
121,Super.,"Everything was great, only the wellness was not  for kids. Very pleasant staff at reception and also waitres in Bistro restaurant. They helped me also with some kids things that I could not take from home. We enjoyed the stay and we would like to come back when it is possible.",5,2019,04,22
121,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"We arrived to a very warm reception from the staff. They were extremely helpful and friendly and couldn't do more for you. The room was lovely, modern, clean and spacious. 

Great location and we would definitely stay there again. ",5,2019,04,19
121,Theatre trip,We stayed here when we were staying over for a birthday theatre trip and the staff at the Hotel couldn't have been nicer and more helpful....10/10. We were lucky enough to be given one of the newly refurbished rooms and they were excellent...a great nights sleep!,5,2019,04,18
121,Good Hotel if you have a good budget,"Stayed in this hotel mid April 2019. It is a quality hotel and enjoyable stay.
Location is 10 - 20 minutes walk from  Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and !0 Downing Street. Really the best parts and must see parts of London . I paid £240 a night which included breakfast ( priced at £30 !!! ) 
Other hotels eg Strand Palace Hotel on the STRAND is smaller but better value and also a great location ear all these landmarks .

Would recommend The St James Court but bring lots of cash with you",4,2019,04,18
121,Definitely not upto the Taj Hospitality,"This was my second stay at this hotel. This time in a four bedded family room and since I was with my children the shortcomings were felt even more.
The shortcomings started soon after the check in :
1) When we were taken to the room, the person who dropped us suggested to provide an extra luggage stand. We readily agreed and kept on waiting until our check out for him to bring the same :)
2) The wash basin was blocked and water was not passing through. The maintenance team came and put in some chemicals but could not resolve the same. We were told that the contractor would come next early morning to rectify the same. We kept on waiting until our check out 2 days later for him to turn up :)
3) After our first night we requested for the room to be cleaned and went out. When we came back in the evening the room was not attended to. We called up the house keeping who sent an angry lady to clean our room who did a pathetic job with it and that too in our presence.
4) The breakfast spread comprises of mostly cold spread and the hot items are taken on order. There is no menu for the same and depends upon the person taking the order. The first day french toast was readily given to us at the breakfast table while the second day we were told that it would be chargeable. It would be better if a menu of items that can be ordered could be placed somewhere.
Thus, overall not upto the mark hospitality that one would expect from Taj.",3,2019,04,17
121,Beautiful and wonderful service,"I would like to say a big thank you to all the staff, but particularly Geeta and Aveek.

The night at your hotel was nothing short of wonderful start to finish.

You had kindly even arranged for a halal breakfast but unfortunately I couldn’t make it due to some emergencies.

The decor, ambiance and warmth is overwhelming.

Thank you for your hospitality ",5,2019,04,16
121,A Trip to remember!,"Spent 8 nites here at the Taj St.James Court! And was very happy to see that the Taj hospitality extends world-wide. I expected nothing less.  A seamless check-in, which after a long journey is just what you need! And an equally seamless check-out! A special mention for Mr. Agnelo Kobo, Ms Nihita (front desk), Svlen at Hampton. No request was to small for them, in fact when I complained that the bed wasn't comfortable, they got the mattress changed immediately. Their afternoon tea at the KONA, a lovely themed spread combined with Taj hospitality is a wonderful experience! A special mention for KAPIL, who was so patient while we kept asking him to click pictures!!
That said, the property is very well located, with the underground a stone's throw away, even the bus is a 5 minutes walk, so connectivity is sorted. The Buckingham Palace is a short walk so is the St. James Park, the area is very touristy but at the same time a quiet and beautiful area. The hotel is happily busy, so vibrant and lively to come too. So, next time you are in London, try the Saint James Court, you feel you're coming home.",5,2019,04,16
121,Excellent Hotel in London,"The experience was excellent. Great location - 6 minutes walking for Buckingham Palace and not far from a Metro station.
The staff is extremely good, principally Naomi. She gave us all the important information and good tips for our stay. 
Highly recommended",5,2019,04,16
121,Horrific room,"I booked through Hotels.com and was given a room where nothing worked. It felt like Taj wanted to punish me for not booking directly with them. The room was really pathetic: the power outlets didn’t work, the bathtub didn’t drain and the furnishings were ancient and grubby.",1,2019,04,15
121,Great hotel and even better customer service ,"My partner and I stayed in this hotel - part business and part pleasure, it certainly did not disappoint! 

When arriving, we were greeted by such welcoming staff, given helpful information and had our bags taken for us. 

When checking in we had a complementary upgrade due to it being a special occasion, a wonderful surprise it was! Again the staff (Brendan in particular) was fantastic, each and every time a member of staff came across you - whether it was walking through the lobby, standing in the lift or walking past the bar, we were greeted with a huge smile and warm welcome, something that really makes this hotel stand out for us.

The hotel itself, the rooms and the spa were all spotless. We highly recommend this hotel! 

We are off to stay in a Taj hotel in Sri Lanka this coming week, and we honestly can’t wait!",5,2019,04,15
121,my trip to London,"Location is good.close to the Palace and St James Park station and 30 minutes walk from Piccadilly circus. 
However lesser number of food joints on the weekends.Staff are very pleasant and warm and very helpful. Fitness center and spa center are very good as well.",4,2019,04,14
121,Their new rooms are excellent,"I was only staying for one night m, and got upgraded for free to one of their new rooms.
The room was/is outstanding! Extremely comfortable with no noise, window to the back yard, fresh interior and good quality bed.
I’ll recommend a stay here for anyone.",5,2019,04,14
121,Ernest ,Outstanding service and great location. Rooms immaculate. Best value for the money of all hotels I have stayed at in London. I visit London regularly and this will be my go to hotel for all future visits. ,5,2019,04,14
121,Stayed here in 2 times.. 11 to 15 March and 27 March to 4 April,"We had occasion to stay here in 2 tranches.
Both times we had a fabulous experience. 

 Nishant and Lobo at the front desk were very helpful in taking care of any minor issues we needed settled. 

Matthew at the Concierge desk was very efficient in getting us tickets to various plays which we wanted to see. As was Justin. 

We got an upgrade, thanks to the TIC card I have. The room was in the new refurbished wing, and very comfortable. 
The only minor issue was the long and winding and confusing walk to the rooms on both occasions.. But that is the way the hotel is constructed... Cannot be helped, I guess. 

I would definitely recommend it.",5,2019,04,14
121,Excellant stay as always,"This hotel is my home from home, I have stayed here many times in the last six years with my husband when coming back to my home town London.  There is so much to praise the hotel on, the rooms spacious and clean, quiet and for us always if possible looking out on the beautiful courtyard which is lit up at night. The staff who are so helpful and the little extras in the room like the fruit and delightful chocolates being brought to your room of an evening.  Then the relaxing hotel bar The Hamptons with the superb pianist Ed Bentley whom as a professional singer I always do some numbers with and guests and staff all enjoy this.  Location is another reason for staying at the St James Court it is just round the corner to St James Station which is only a few stops to the West End and easy to get to many attractions and also close to Buckingham Palace and St James Park.  I look forward to my next stay at my favourite hotel.",5,2019,04,13
121,Wonderful place for a weekend break,"A really classy hotel with first class staff.  Nothing was too much trouble, and they were friendly and helpful throughout.  The hotel is well located - a perfect base for a weekend break.  Breakfast was a little uninspiring, but the onsite Indian restaurant is not to be missed",5,2019,04,13
121,Great hotel,In a very convenient location. They are refurbishing the hotel and when done I think will be magnificent. Comfortable. Great service. A truly typical old world hotel with all the mod cons make the stay wonderful. Staff very pleasant and nothing to too much of an issue. Great little rooms to have coffee or meetings in. Well worth a stay,5,2019,04,13
121,Great Taj Service but Uninspiring Room.,"Our stay at the Taj was made special by the warm and personal attention of the staff. The receptionist wished us for our wedding anniversary and there was a handwritten greeting card and cake placed in our room which was a lovely touch. Breakfast was very high quality with a good selection.

However I felt this property was not up to the standard of other Taj properties I have stayed at. The lobby area was dark and small and the room decor was very bland. Although comfortable, it did not feel at all premium - similar standard to a Premier Inn - which is no bad thing but it's not THE Taj!.",4,2019,04,13
121,Incredibly disappointing and overpriced,"Wish I hadn’t booked here, incredibly overpriced and sub par service and amenities. Our room was dingy, walls scuffed, the outdated furniture was banged up and there was scratched and peeling paint on everything. The bathroom smelled like paint and there was mold in the grout. We never received housekeeping services (even though they were requested) and when we asked in room dining for plates and water, it took them over 35 minutes and they got our order wrong. The service downstairs is overly pushy, save your money and stay somewhere else at a better price, or at least a better value. ",1,2019,04,12
121,Silver wedding treat,"We last visited this hotel two years ago and were disappointed with the experience, but the general manager apologised and hoped we would return. We decided to do so for our silver wedding anniversary as we love the location and the Michelin star Indian restaurant Quilon next door, which is part of the group.

On checking in the customer relations manager approached us and upgraded our room to a beautiful suite, very comfortable and spacious, and clearly recently refurbished. There was a spacious sitting area, large bedroom and large bathroom with a deep bath and a large shower booth.

Service in every area of the hotel was efficient and polite, including room service and the bar.
 Breakfast is served until 11am so no rush in the morning. Having given up meat for Lent, a full English was out, but plenty of other options, excellent fruit and yoghurt selection, charcuterie and cheeses and delicious bread selection as well as pastries &c. 

Checkout was very efficient and we left having had a memorable stay and looking forward to coming again sometime.",5,2019,04,12
121,Excellent hotel,"I have had the pleasure of staying at the St. James' Court hotel on many occasions both for business and pleasure. My most recent stay this month was for my birthday. I have always found this hotel to be of an extremely high standard, impeccably clean and made that much more special by the wonderful staff. Upon check-in, as per usual, the reception desk staff were extremely welcoming, warm and polite. I was asked if I had any special plans for the evening and mentioned it was my birthday. The member of staff checking me in, his name was 'Nishant', couldn't have been more welcoming and offered me a complimentary upgrade to my room. Nishant was also extremely helpful in arranging breakfast which I had wanted to add to my booking and immediately made sure I received the best possible deal. He also wished me a happy birthday, and it was nice to receive such a warm welcome.  Later that evening when I returned to my room the hotel had left balloons and a birthday card, a very thoughtful gesture. I believe this was courtesy of the Customer Services Manager 'Nial' instigated by Nishant I assume - please forgive me if I have inadvertently got the name wrong - whoever, it was it was a nice gesture.
The breakfast at the hotel is always second-to-none. I would like to stress that 'all' of the staff at the hotel are extremely professional, and the breakfast staff are no exception. During my recent stay, I had the pleasure of meeting 'Madelina'. Upon being seated at breakfast we were greeted by the wonderful 'Madelina'. Madelina greeted us with a wonderful smile, was polite, professional and again couldn't have been more helpful. I asked Madelina if she minded me making a note of her name with a view to writing a positive review about her exceptional service and personality. It is the people who make a business/organisation they ARE the Brand and it is those people that make the 'experience'. That said, all too often people like 'Madelina' can often be inadvertently overlooked as they are not overly visible. But, a thank you goes a long way and I would encourage others, those who also receive the highest standard of service from whoever it may be, from the Manager to the cleaner, to say a thank you, it goes a long way.  I am grateful for my recent encounters with 'Nishant' 'Madelina' and 'Nial' but am also grateful to all of those staff that all work towards making the hotel what it is. Thank you! And I look forward to my next visit. Best regards. Nigel",5,2019,04,12
121,"Great location, great service, great stay!","Absolutely amazing service at the Taj during a recent business trip - staff behind the desk were fabulous. I would specifically like to mention Agnelo who was friendly, helpful and professional in making my stay enjoyable. Couldn’t recommend enough!",5,2019,04,10
121,A three night very enjoyable break. ,"Never having stayed at this hotel before I wasn’t totally sure what to expect. I needn’t have worried!  The minute I arrived in Buckingham Gate I realised the hotel was situated in a nice, quite area but still close enough to the West End and a number of London attractions. The hotel itself is something to be savoured from the friendly greeting by the doorman to the warm welcome from the reception staff. I was fortunate to be upgraded to the newly refurbished area on the first floor.  The room was large, air conditioned and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom was equally impressive with its large walk-in shower. A nice touch in the bedroom was the plate of handmade chocolates and the excellent bowl of fruit. Being a person who enjoys coffee it was nice to find there was a Nespresso type of coffee maker for my early morning coffee.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this excellent hotel and look forward to visiting again hopefully in October this year. ",5,2019,04,07
121,Highly recommend,"Lovely historic building, friendly, courteous staff. Spacious and well decorated room.
Great central location close to Buckingham Palace, Downing St, Houses of Parliament & Trafalger Square.
Would certainly come again.",5,2019,04,07
121,Lodon Hoiday,"St. James Court is nicely located, I do not have any reference to what other hotels in the area have o offer.  Our Premium room was small, as compared to the photo's of the room.  The Breakfast buffet was average, service was above average.  I would recommend the hotel.  Knowing now how small the room was I would have reserved a larger room, and we had to have a room with a walk in shower, that narrows down the choices of hotels to chose from. There is a school play ground below our room the children are rather loud, as kids will be kids.",4,2019,04,06
121,Oasis of Calm,"An excellent hotel, situated in the heart of the attractions, close to Buckingham Palace. Fantastic value for money and the team really make you feel regal. The cleanliness and comfort was outstanding, an amazing large double bed with crisp white cotton bedding, a wonderful bathroom with a huge walk in shower. Eating in the bar is also outstanding value for money with plenty of options.",5,2019,04,06
121,Perfect location,"4* hotel with a 5* service perfectly located within a 3 min walk to the Buckingham palace and a 5 min walk to the St. James Park underground station. Clean room, good value and an impressive gym for a hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2019,04,06
121,Great location,"Luvly hotel! Clean, warm, classy and friendly welcome, just bear in mind if you are driving and need parking its off site and valet service at extra cost. Great hotel, only stayed one night as i was there for my dads MBE at the palace which is just round the corner. Would certainly stop there again",5,2019,04,05
121,Here’s to the next time,"Amazing stay, even for one night. The hotel is a short walk from Victoria station and was perfectly placed for my business meetings in and around Victoria/Westminster. 
Taiwo and Valerica were great at reception. Taiwo in particular ensuring I had a good stay. Food was good and some excellent cocktails. Spa is also excellent. ",5,2019,04,05
121,Splendour and luxury away from home,"I was lucky to stay at the Taj, a splendid hotel with amazing hospitality. A very attentive Duane helped me during check-in making it a very personable experience. 
I stayed in the older part of the hotel, rather than the newly renovated one.  nevertheless the room was spacious and comfortable, with nice touches like free bottled water. 
Fantastic gym and wet area, a rare thing in central London. 
A definitely wonderful experience ",5,2019,04,05
121,Very good location and value for money,Stayed here in Jan 2019. The location is very convenient especially if you want to go sight seeing in London. Staff are very courteous n helpful especially reception. A special shout out to Mr. Brendan for making our stay at the St. James Court special. Housekeeping do an amazing job at keeping the rooms and the public areas clean. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,04,05
121,Outstanding,"GREAT hotel experience!
I have stayed in many hotels throughout my life and found this one in London, UK to be one of the best, if not the best, I have ever stayed in.
Accommodations clean, staff exceptionally polite and attentive.",5,2019,04,04
121,A Vintage & A Quality,I have been staying here for the last three years now in November and really enjoy the service and the convenient location of the hotel. It's like a small luxury boutique hotel in the middle of the city jungle. Isolated it feels but after a few steps so vibrant. I love the attention to details and the service.,5,2019,04,04
121,Good find,"Overall we enjoyed our trip, Great find, good location for where we were dining, shopping and visiting museums. Easy to find way around and places to eat, lunch/dinner drink and have coffee and/or breakfast ",5,2019,04,03
121,"Good,But Can be better !!!!","Location wise fantastic, you can enjoy the charm of central London staying in this hotel,most landmark are at walking distance.

Coming to to staying experience , after 17hrs long flight reached hotel at midnight , check in was smooth, without any upgrades inspire of asking for it, after checking into the room to my dismay i saw claustrophobic shower with Tub and non flushable toilet,looks like they allocated some old style room, housekeeping was responsive to fix the toilet in the midnight, but it was embarrassing situation.

Next day asked for change of room , the team was polite enough to accommodate the request and checked into a better furnished room with walk in shower, felt good, but the overall room size was pretty small,hardly place to move around, then believed being central London can't expect bigger rooms.

Breakfast was good, tasty toast with spread ,basic buffet spread for 15 pounds, pretty reasonable, they do have few indian dish on the menu.

In-room dining messed up one night, it took more than 2 hrs for food to arrive, had to follow up to get the food, their indian dish could be more indian, i felt it was too bland to my taste , inspite of special request to make it more spicy.

Decent bar, but only two varieties of draught beer, that too local brew.

Overall stay was good, warm hospitality , great team but rooms need renovations and few upgrades of facilities.",3,2019,04,02
121,"First time at London Taj, not the last","Excellent service, clean everything, comfy bed, coffee and tea in room, room service delicious, gorgeous courtyard, can’t wait to come back ! All of the staff were so attentive to us. Even the hallways smelled like a high end spa. ",5,2019,04,02
121,Family-friendly hotel and AMAZING service!,"We were very impressed with the service and accommodation. From the moment we stepped foot on their property we were treated with such kind and phenomenal service. Everyone was so friendly, courteous, and professional. We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment and had a very nice stay - everything you need is provided. I loved that we received fresh fruit daily, still water, and even delicious chocolate. We came with our 19 month old son and he was provided with toys, play mat, and they even baked him a cookie. Service was absolutely amazing! The location is unbeatable as well. Victoria line was near by, Boots, M&S and Waitrose and great restaurants. We look forward to another stay with Taj. Definitely recommend anyone to say here, you won't regret it!",5,2019,04,01
121,ELNY. St James Court Hotel,"Having stayed at the St James Court for a decade, I appreciate the service, the rooms and the neighborhood. One can eat at the hotel or at a nearby pub or a small Italian restaurant. The staff is very pleasant and tries its best to meet one's needs. ",5,2019,03,31
121,Terrific hotel with great service,"This hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of London. It's walking distance to most of the major sights, with Trafalger Square a scant fifteen minutes away. The thing that sets the hotel apart from others is the exemplary service offered by all the staff. From the front desk to the bar employees, everyone was routinely and genuinely nice. The reason it does not get four stars is that the elevators need to be serviced better and the paint in the rooms and hallways is definitely dinged up. With a little refresh, this could be a five-star place. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended.",4,2019,03,30
121,Spring Break trip with my grandson,"Dr. Scherry F Johnson
I was with my 16 year old grandson and I had a bad accident. I was taken to the hospital for five days and my daughter had to fly over from America. The hotel was most supportive for my grandson and my family while I was incompacicated. I cannot thank the staff enough! 
Sincerely, 
Scherry Johnson",5,2019,03,29
121,Great stay,"Excellent all round experience.  Rate the hotel highly in every way.  Service, Amenities, Room service, restaurants, easy check in check out -- everything was perfect. Excellent all round experience.  Rate the hotel highly in every way.  ",5,2019,03,29
121,very good location and service,Location and service is very good. Bed is small and bathroom is not very convenient when you should take a shower staying in tiny bathtub. Shower is fixed on the wall and it is not movable. Furniture is not modern but is clean.,3,2019,03,28
121,Great experience,"We stayed in a two room suite. Enough room for a rollaway for our daughter who is studying abroad. Convenient to tube and bus. 4 blocks from Westminster Cathedral. We had to look at several rooms before we found one that could actually fit a roll away. Plenty of room and great service. Lifts and lobby restrooms need renovation. Some rooms completely redone, some partially redone and some rooms in need of work. Front desk went the extra mile to find the right room (completely renovated).",5,2019,03,28
121,Elegance and Hospitality,"Our family enjoyed a fabulous, albeit short, stay at this fantastic property.  The rooms were comfortable and well-appointed and the bathroom was luxurious and updated.  

We especially enjoyed the lively lobby bar and the live music we were treated to to accompany our cocktails and dessert.

The staff took exceptional care of all of us and made us feel welcomed and special.

We will most certainly visit this property again on our next stay in London!",5,2019,03,26
121,Beautiful hotel,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful hotel at a great location nearby Buckingham Palace. Breakfast was nicely organized with eggs a la carte and a buffet. The people were very friendly. 
We were upgraded to a newly renovated room that was very comfortable .",5,2019,03,26
121,Happy Anniversary,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel to celebrate our anniversary. It was a complete surprise to my wife and somewhat also for me - we both have never stayed at a Taj Group Hotel. 

From the moment we walked in I knew I'd be pleased with my choice. The place exuded quality. The reception staff member who checked us in was immaculate, professional and very friendly. She immediately made us feel at home. When they found out we were there for an anniversary we were  upgraded to a better room. On arrival in the room we were treated to complimentary chocolates on the house. 

Our premium room was stylish and contemporary in design. All the little extra's and attention to detail were all present as you'd expect from such a quality hotel. 

The piece de resistance was the newly refurbished Jiva Spa.  Simply divine. An oasis of calm and tranquillity. As with reception team,  the Spa staff were very polite and helpful. 

Breakfast buffet in The Bistro was sumptuous and satisfying.

Both my wife and I remarked that although we only stayed for one night it felt like we'd been away on a longer well-deserved break.

Our overall experience was such that it was the best Hotel we've ever stayed at and we both can't wait to go back. Taj Hotel St James's helped to make a special day unique.",5,2019,03,26
121,An excellent classic hotel with flourishes of luxury,"My first 4-star stay in London felt much more of a 5-star experience. For a short break on the night of our marriage, it was everything we could have wanted it to be at St James' Court, with the splendour of the location and room matched by all staff members too. The room upgrade (a multi room junior suite) and very thoughtful cake were perfect additions to our wedding night too!

Add breakfast to your stay and you can enjoy it in your room at your leisure. 24 hour in room dining is available - including the Michelin-starred Quilon restaurant served to your room most of the day too, incredibly. The only negative would be the cost of the Bistro menu was very expensive - comparable to the Michelin-starred restaurant prices (for example fries £8 and a 200ml bottle of coke £6). It wasn't an issue for us on a special occasion but I know it may be prohibitive for others on more standard visits. 

As others mentioned, the locations within and quality of the building and its rooms are fantastic. ",5,2019,03,25
121,Character hotel with a lovely spa in Victoria London,"Friendly staff, lovely room, we really enjoyed the steam room and spa pool. Good breakfast and a handy central location.Would recommend, it was just what we were looking for, would love to visit again.",5,2019,03,25
121,Convenient location that's it!,"Booked it because of fabulous experience with Taj hotels. This one is nowhere near the Taj experience.
Very Small rooms and average staff...when i complained I was categorically told that this is a 4 Star hotel - for the Taj experience I was looking for I should have booked a 5 Star hotel!
Room Service was below average. Room cleaning poor. The only respite was pleasant front office and very helpful concierge. 
Not at all recommended for a family planning to stay long",2,2019,03,25
121,Wonderful London Experience,Beautiful rooms and great location. Easy access to tube stations. Staff was awesome. Newly refurbished rooms were very comfortable. The only con we had was the televisions used the same remote so when in the bedroom area it would change channels on the living room one. ,5,2019,03,24
121,Great hotel in the centre of London,"Very surprised to get that quality of service in London. Maybe its because of the Taj brand! Comfortable room, delicious breakfast, very helpful staff. The interior garden was beautifully maintained. Appreciated the touch of having the room redone when we came back in the evenings. Very conveniently situated.",5,2019,03,23
121,"Great Location, Great service, Great Breakfast","Location is my #1, and this hotel has a great location.  Walkable to south bank, parliament, westminster, london eye, buckingham palace, etc.  

The service was great and the rooms were clean.  Although we got a first floor room that was not quite dated, but it appears that the majority of the hotel is remodeled, so we just got unlucky.  The rest of the hotel looked must better.

The breakfast was amazing!  Much more than just a continental breakfast.  The food was excellent and so was the service.",4,2019,03,20
121,Magical!,"This property is magical... it's beautifully maintained inside and outside. The staff is focused on customer service throughout the property. The food was delicious.  I had such a lovely experience here and will be returning next year as I felt ""at home"".  Hanging out in Hamiltons with friends was memorable... the piano and trio in the lobby was lovely... cannot say enough wonderful things! ",5,2019,03,20
121,excellent stay,"had the occasion to stay at St James court, London. the breakfast menu was great, with wide variety of choice for an international traveler. the rooms were clean and comfortable, with a great bath tub in the bath. the staff, right from the front desk to the janitor, were very friendly and forthcoming to help. 
overall, an excellent stay. looking forward to going back there!",5,2019,03,20
121,Great Hotel and Location!,"I stayed at the hotel for 4 days and I liked everything about it. The room was clean and spacious, compared to London’s standard sizes. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was fully equipped with everything needed. (The hotel provides any toiletries needed.) The “Bistro” restaurant offered really nice breakfast with all necessary options. Location was great, 5 minutes walk from the Buckingham Palace, 5 minutes walk from St. James station and maybe 10 mins from Victoria Station. Finally, the staff in every area made everything easy, from check in, concierge, check out and the staff at the restaurant. Thank You All :)",5,2019,03,19
121,A great choice while visiting London,"I fully recommend this hotel. The staff is more than kind, doing always their best for you to feel comfortable. We spent four days at this hotel before going to Maldives, and we had to spend a few more days in London before going back to our country. Of course, our first choice was the St. James. They welcomed us and they even upgraded our room (again) to one of the fully remodeled one. Breakfast is amazing, and their bar at night is a great way to end the day. This hotel was a very important part of our fantastic honeymoon.",5,2019,03,18
121,quite and luxurious in the center of London,"Between two metro stations in an area near the St. James park  walking distance from  Buckingham  palace,Big Ben and London eye.Very old and luxurious bulding fully renovated still keeping the old atmosphere",4,2019,03,17
121,Always a smile and excellent service!,"We have stayed here whenever we have popped to London,its central location for tourists cannot be beat as you can walk to Buckingham Palace Westminster Abbey and Cathedral, Big Ben, Houses or Parliament and all the beautiful parks. This time it was a Birthday treat and some Art Gallery visits.Our room on the 6th floor was spotless , stylish and had lots of places to put your clothes.The shower room was pristine and large with those extra special touches like marble flooring and illuminated make up mirrors. Breakfast was excellent and as always the staff are smiley and helpful .We came back to our hotel room and a lovely birthday desert with"" Happy Birthday! ""written in chocolate on the plate.Well Done Taj ! We wil be back!",5,2019,03,17
121,Sadly disappointing,Very nice and efficient arrival at the hotel however first room was dirty ( red wine marks - filthy walls) and I understand needing renovating but it was not clean. Moved to another room with a nice card and some fruit ( sadly not for me though!!) and the shower did not work properly and the walls again were very less than pristine. So they offered to move me again......which unlike me I did! But what a palaver - the staff were all very nice.......but I never got a card to apologize - they did agree and apparently they are in between house keepers.....moving rooms 3 times for a 2 night stay isn't ok.............but with no apology or effort to win me round for my inconvenience. Its in a handy location. It was also extremely cold in all the public areas maybe I was just very very unlucky but with so much to chose from in London .....,3,2019,03,17
121,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed 6 nights recently at the Taj.  It was a great experience.  Special thanks to Daniel the concierge who assisted us with tours, restaurants, etc.  he was such a pleasure.  Next trip to London will be a return stay at tenTaj.",5,2019,03,16
121,Excellent but needs some improvements,"I stayed at the Taj in a suite in their new wing with my parents for about a week. The new wing has been beautifully renovated and everything is completely updated and modern. I loved the room finishes, amenities and the beautiful courtyard between the hotel lobby and the new wing. The hospitality was very warm. A special mention for Nishant at the front desk. He was very accommodating and helped my family with out requests. 

The extra bed provided was not comfortable and the mattresses for these need to be improved. The lobby and the lobby bar need to be desperately renovated. The areas are old and dated. The coffee shop where breakfast is served is elegant and tastefully designed. The breakfast is sumptuous and the inclusion of 1 Indian food item everyday is a great touch. Although I was disappointed with the quality of the Indian item. The Vada and Rotis were just not up-to the mark. Furthermore up-charging for items such as pancakes, eggs Florentine and waffles is really unacceptable at a 5 star luxury breakfast.",4,2019,03,16
121,Disappointing,"At the Bistro,at breakfast, i did get a racial discrimination feeling, other nationalities appear to be given better treatment than Indians, which was not expected in a Taj property, an Indian chain of hotels..  Until the day of departure, i was not even made aware that there is a variety of Indian food available on special request.",3,2019,03,15
121,I’ll let you know when I’ll be back!,Had a great stay here. The hotel is very near Victoria yet away from the hustle and bustle. Staff very friendly and the room was perfect for three of us. Had a scrumptious dinner in the restaurant too!,5,2019,03,15
121,Taj at St. James' Court,"Stayed here for one night, and I would choose to stay here again next time I need to spend a night in London.

My room was modern, immaculately clean, and quiet.  The staff were all very helpful . Location is excellent . Nice gym.",5,2019,03,14
121,Flawless,"My stay at the St. James was flawless - check-in went smoothly and was handled by a very friendly employee (I think her name is Mariana); my husband and I were given chocolates because we recently got married (and we loved the chocolate, we thought is was from Laederach, our favorite chocolate manufacturer) which was such a nice gesture. The room was spacious, clean and room service very good. We particularly loved the Nespresso Coffee Machine and the quality of the towels. 
We'll be very happy to come back.",5,2019,03,12
121,Special birthday overnight stay,"I booked St James Court as a special treat to celebrate my sisters birthday as we were going to the theatre.
It is a beautiful hotel in a great location near Victoria. Vey easy to get around London either walking or by tube and 5 mins fromBuckingham Palace.
We arrived early expecting to leave our luggage but were told we had been upgraded and selected as guests of the day so our room was ready! All the staff we encountered at reception and around the hotel were very friendly and helpful.
We were in a refurbished room in the new wing and it was lovely.....really spacious with a lovely bathroom. We were even treated to cake, chocolates & fruit in our room which was a lovely touch!
We didn’t eat at any of the hotel restaurants but had a drink at the bar and a late night snack after a visit to the theatre. All good!
This is a charming hotel and the service was excellent. Would love to stay again as a special treat and possibly for longer next times we can enjoy the facilities a bit more.",5,2019,03,11
121,Comfortable and Relaxing Stay,"Thank you to all at St. James’ Court, A Taj Hotel, for making our stay so wonderful, comfortable and relaxed. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi to be greeted by a friendly concierge who took our bag and delivered it to our room, to the warm and welcoming greeting we received from reception when checking in and out, to the excellent and first class service from the housekeeping team. We enjoyed excellent service at the bar before and after a delicious and faultless meal in the Bistro restaurant on the hotel premises. We can’t wait to return to spend another wonderful weekend at this beautiful hotel. It was a break we needed and we can’t thank you enough. ",5,2019,03,11
121,Real London,"Great place to stay! Wonderful hotel with the real London style walking distance to Piccadilly in a wonderful city park. The Metro the pub and shopping place are also near the hotel.
Good breakfast in the bistro. The piano player at evening is a touch of class.",5,2019,03,11
121,Excellent,"Business Trip. Wonderful room and fascinating hotel in a very strategic position for most important places in London. Very nice people at the reception, in particular Miriana and Irene. Breakfast was so good.They speak italian.",5,2019,03,11
121,Wonderful hotel and excellent service,"The St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel was recommended to us by an acquaintance. We booked three rooms and each of us shared similar experiences. We were delighted with everything about this hotel. The rooms were clean and provided all of the amenities that we were hoping to see. Everyone at the Taj went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant. The restaurant was lovely and the breakfast plan was well worth the cost. At the concierge desk, Daniele Ferri and his staff assisted us with tours, bookings, directions and general information. Everything about this hotel was top shelf, especially the staff. I highly recommend the St. James Court hotel.",5,2019,03,11
121,Nice Hotel !,"Nice Facility, Nice atmosphere !
We were selected to the Guest of the Day on March 9 when my wife visited London first time. The room was upgraded and welcome fruit and chocolate made her happy ! Buckingham Palace is so close and we enjoyed the visit. Hotel Staff is also very friendly and working very sincerely. Overall is very much satisfied.",5,2019,03,11
121,Meeting,Had the pleasure to meet Anubhav Rana this evening the security manager. He was very approachable and a great asset to your company. Love the style and prime location of the hotel. Would definitely recommend,5,2019,03,07
121,A lovely hotel experience,"I had a lovely stay at a beautiful hotel well located in the centre of London and across from the underground station. The service was first class, the room was excellent and the food was of a high standard. The icing on the cake was being informed I was the guest of the day, a hotel initiative that picks one guest each day and provides them with free upgrades and lots of niceties. What a nice touch",5,2019,03,06
121,A big thank you to the hotel,Stayed at this beautiful hotel for two nights with my granddaughter birthday to see the show Hamilton all the staff where extremely welcoming and nothing was to much trouble for them .When in London again will definitely rebook to stay again at this wonderful hotel x,5,2019,03,06
121,Lovely stay,"Had a lovely stay here for my partners birthday, a surprise bit of cake was randomly bought up to the room for him! Only downside was the tv kept turning off and then randomly turned on in the middle of the night 😂",4,2019,03,05
121,Stunning Hotel,"We booked through booking.com expecting to have one of the tiny rooms they never show online, we were met with a beautiful room with gorgeous big windows. The room was large and relaxing and had all the extras you would expect. The staff throughout were friendly and welcoming. The reception area is beautifully decorated. Location was excellent for exploring London. We took advantage of the boris bikes right outside the entrance and explored Hyde Park and the Buckingham Palace area. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,03,05
121,"Fantastic hotel, my goto when working in London ","Great hotel, right in the centre, with easy access to the tube station.  This hotel has it all, fantastic staff, larger than usual rooms for London accommodation with modern decor.  Very quiet as the building is old, so the walls are thick!

Very close to st James park for runners, which makes the perfect start to the day! 

Thanks for a great stay!",5,2019,03,04
121,Exceptional service and refinement,"This was our most recent visit to St James Court. We stayed in the Premium family room - recently renovated. Excellent room size with all the refinements we have to come to expect from the Taj group. Nespresso machine, large screen televisions, ensuite and seperate toilet, USB chargepoints, good shower in a well lit bathroom. Service as always was excellent - bathrobes, kid's bag complete with royal guard teddy bear, cake for the wife's birthday. Above all we continue to return here because the service is exceptional - feedback is listened to and the hospitality is second to none. Perhaps being of South Asian ancestry lends itself towards a certain unconscious bias but I must say it does make me proud that it embodies the best traditions of the group's indian heritage. I  always come away with a feeling of wealth and luxury but without the needless pretentious overtures that you come across in similar hotels in this price bracket. For families also with buggies the location is perfect as green park, covent garden, leicester square ,  regent's street and picadilly are within walking distance. The breakfast for the resident's rate is excellent value for what you pay. Most hotels have a european breakfast which is fairly predictable fare but for me the real draw is the changing asian breakfast which really brings exotic variety on a daily basis.

I would like to thank Yanick, Agnello and Ashton and the bistro team for making us very welcome during our stay. They went above and beyond in the hospitality stakes. We look forward to the next visit.",5,2019,03,04
121,"No longer a Hidden Gem, this Diamond is Sparkling Bright","I returned to the hotel for the first time in 3 years and was blown away by the transformation and improvements that have been made in this period. I was fortunate enough to be staying in their new premium category of room and I utterly recommend these rooms as they rival and surpass many of the great hotels of London. These perfectly compliment the great personal service that you receive in all areas of the hotel. 

Despite not being back for 3 years, I was welcomed back with open arms. From our arrival to the jasmine scented reception area, check in was smooth and delivered with a genuine warmth that I find lacking in other chains and hotels. Then off to the room, wow, the transformation into the new area is amazing and the rooms spacious and decor tasteful and modern. The bathroom was a beautiful marble stone and despite no bath, a huge shower that boasted high quality toiletries.

Now the rest.......the new Jiva spa that has only just been opened is a huge improvement to the previous offering and a calm oasis in this busy city. I did not have a treatment but looked around the fully equipped gym and wonderful new feature that is a therapy pool, I really wish I had brought my swimmers! Whilst this was marketed as a Spa in the past it never boasted this quality of facility. The final improvement has been the Bistro. Whilst still a little cramped and small, it has been tastefully refurbished and the buffet area is much better than before and the quality of food offering good, I have missed the Indian food breakfast item, my waist line had not!

They used to state that this was a hidden Gem in the heart of London, it is much more than that and they must drop the ‘hidden’ tag. If you want a great stay experience with first class service, look no further. I will always look to stay in this premium category room in the future because there is nothing to rival this in this area of London. Thank you for a fantastic stay and we hope to return soon.

",5,2019,03,04
121,Excellent accommodations with a fabulous location,"Fabulous hotel, absolutely beautiful!! The staff were very friendly, helpful, professional and accommodating. The rooms were well appointed and the beds were extremely comfortable, we were in room 512 and it was very quiet!! The food was delicious and the service was great in the lounge. The location is perfect, Buckingham Palace, St James Park to name a couple of sites that are within walking distance. Thank you, we will be back!!",5,2019,03,04
121,"If you don't wish to splurge, stay elsewhere ","If you don't want to pay for a junior suit or over, then I advise you to choose a different place to stay. The hotel and although they has upgraded an outlying section of it's rambling building, but they stand in odd contrast to the evidently old and decaying original part. The regular rooms are small and noisy. Only a junior suit has acceptable standards. 

The Taj general reservations is quite shoddy. Before arriving, I sent several emails to confirm my booking and stated preferences. They ignored them, which seems to be a persistent problem with Taj hotels and undetermined staff. At the hotel, I had to escalate my issue to management before I received proper attention. The regular staff simply operate under the unruffled british standards. ",3,2019,03,04
121,Superior Taj Hospitality; Memorable Stay,"I love Taj hospitality. Its personal. You are welcomed so well that you feel at home. Super check in by Sara, she gave me her business card for any request during the stay. Flawless rooms and best Indian food customized by chef in Bristo restaurant. It's so near to so many attractions that we enjoyed the location itself. ",5,2019,03,04
121,Still up there,"I've written about this hotel on this forum earlier and wanted to provide an update. Try and stay in one of the refurbished rooms, one whole wing has been done in very nice shades of blue and grey. Larger televisions, better layouts, and shower cubicles all make these a great option to go with the already high service standards. Front of House Manager Naveen Sikka continues to provide his personal warm welcome and it does feel like a return home every time! One of the best price value properties in London.",5,2019,03,03
121,Needs renovation ,"Great old charming building with a beautiful courtyard in central London. It is very close to the metro station and St.James park. The staff is friendly and helpful. 
Unfortunately we stayed in a very old room with windows which didn’t close properly and made the room and the bathroom very cold. The room also had a stale smell which had nothing to do with the cleaning as cleaning was done nicely. I was quite surprised by the standard of this room as I stayed previously in other Taj hotels and had a different experience. ",3,2019,03,03
121,One of the best hotel experiences,"We were immediately greeted by the concierge upon pulling up in the car and then walked to the check in desk where we were informed we were guest of the day. 
This included a free room upgrade and the manage personally took us to our room and gave us his number should we need anything. 
We were also given a lovely free plate of cakes as a welcome. 
The food was excellent, room was spotless and the hotel is just a short walk from Buckingham Palace and all the sites. 
The overall experience was fantastic!  ",5,2019,02,28
121,Comfortable hotel with accomodating staff,"Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond in the service department. The afternoon Tea was a excellent. The beds were comfortable. The neighborhood was centrally located for getting around, but it never felt overly ""busy"". ",5,2019,02,28
121,My Home in London,"Taj St. James Court has become my preferred hotel of choice over the years of my visiting London. It has an extremely welcoming and warm feel and the people there always make it a point to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Mr. Digvijay Singh, along with his entire team, always make it a point to make my stay memorable. Thank you for the upgrade too! Well Appreciated. ",5,2019,02,27
121,End of Vacation One nighter,"My husband and I booked in at St James Court for one night on our trip home from Oxford to NYC.  Everything was 5-star. From the check-in experience, to being upgraded to a king room, to the incredible mattress, pillows, and linens.  We left for the airport the next day feeling rested, refreshed, and very well cared for. We did not get to try their restaurants or bars on this trip, but we will definitely be back next time we are in London.",5,2019,02,26
121,70th birthday celebration,"This is our go to hotel when visiting London. Standards are extremely high, staff very well trained and extremely helpful. Breakfast is relaxed with lovely choice of food. The Hamptons bar has a lovely atmosphere and so welcoming.",5,2019,02,26
121,Tube rumble sound in our room at night !,"We booked Taj for one night stay so that we could spend waking around london over the weekend . We booked for Saturday night . We walked all day Saturday and checked in to sleep and planned to spend Sunday walking around London as planned. Un fortunately we did not get good sleep as we kept hearing the rumble of the tube lat night and early morning as well . Due to lack of sleep we had to cut short next days london and go home early . 

Other than that the ambience ,  breakfast and the service were excellent . There was a live piano player in the lobby at night which was very good . They did say that the rooms were recently refurbished s may be they did not sound proof the rooms sufficiently . ",3,2019,02,25
121,This will be our London hotel!,"First favorable impression, our room was ready before the check-in time when we arrived from a nine hour flight.  The room was spacious, modern, well appointed, and provided ample storage options. But its main asset is its location.  Walking distance to all major sites and just a 3-minute walk to the St. James Tube station.  Although it has several restaurants onsite, there are plenty of restaurant options within walking distance.",5,2019,02,25
121,"St. James Court, A Taj Hotel is exceptional!",Exceptional hotel to stay in. The service was excellent from the moment we arrived in the taxi the doors were opened and our luggage was taken care of. We were greeted by Beata and check in was extremely easy. Beata was very nice and gave cute gifts to my 7 year old daughter. Once in the room fruit and sparkling water were sent at no extra charge. The room was impressive. ,5,2019,02,25
121,Service Excellence,"True Indian Hospitality and Tajness !
Hotel manager Naveen and his frontdesk team does a fantastic job in defining the true customer service !! Would come here anyday !!!

I am not a usual review writer but some things are meant to be shared.",5,2019,02,24
121,Nice hotel but we experienced some issues,"This is a lovely hotel but needs to address some issues if it is seeking to provide guests with a perfect stay.

The hotel itself is lovely, good location, pleasant and helpful staff, quiet room which is always a bonus in London.

The negative aspects we experienced are;

The air conditioning was fine for heat but didn’t seem to work when we needed to make the room cooler. We were in London to attend an investiture at the palace and trying to get ready in a very hot room was quite uncomfortable.

We’d paid for breakfast and had allowed ourselves a couple of hours to have breakfast and get ready, however the queue to the restaurant for breakfast meant we had to give it a miss which was very disappointing.

Just one last complaint which others may find minor but is a personal bug bear for me, the hotel provides long life milk in the room for hot drinks despite having a fridge in the room.
",3,2019,02,23
121,"Perfect location, excellent hospitality.","Check-in was smooth, lots of welcoming staff. Room good and recently refurbished, had everything needed. Room was small but thats London for you and its an old building, which adds to the charm. Breakfast was busy. If not included in your room rate you are  better of going out. Plenty of charming cafes just across the the road which serve a much better fare for half the price.
Hamptons bar has excellent cocktails and room service is superb.
As a family we have always stayed in Taj 51 next door as they have great family suites with a more discreet relaxing ambience. The St.James court however will give you an excellent base for either sightseeing or business trips.
Stay here and you will get the best of London : History, charming service, good location( Buckingham Palace is around the corner) and a perfect afternoon tea...!!",5,2019,02,21
121,Excellent location and friendly staff,"All of the staff we encountered during our stay were exceptional. Special mention to the breakfast staff who were extremely welcoming and efficient.

The location is fantastic, we took a room backing onto the courtyard, and therefore was very quiet.

In some ways this hotel,is far better than some of its more expensive rivals.

Well done",5,2019,02,21
121,London stay,"This hotel was immaculate, clean, friendly and great staff. I highly recommend this hotel and it is by the Buckingham Palace. It’s a bit far from everything else but that’s city life and the trains are easily accessible. If your looking for cleanliness and comfort here is the place to stay.",5,2019,02,21
121,"Quiet hotel, well equipped hotel","I enjoyed this hotel. The courtyard is very charming and picturesque. The hotel rooms are undergoing renovations. We had an older room but it was still very nice. Our room had a balcony with french style doors. You were not able to walk onto the balcony but you could open the doors partially to allow some cool air into the room. The room was well equipped with a coffee/tea station, refrigerator, make up mirror, robes, slippers, and a towel warming rack. The bed could have been better but I'm spoiled by a memory mattress at home so I felt the hotel mattress was a little too springy for my taste. A few more outlets would have been helpful but maybe that's part of the renovation. The staff was lovely. Very friendly and helpful. The location was great as well. Buckingham's palace was to the northwest and Westminster Abbey was to the southeast. All within walking distance. And there is an Underground station close by as well. It's a quiet neighborhood; very different than Soho and the theater area. But there are plenty of reliable breakfast/lunch spots around the corner and several pubs. Shopping is lacking except for a few convenience stores.  If you are looking for a nice hotel in a quiet section of London, you can't go wrong with The Taj. ",5,2019,02,20
121,Royal stay at St. James Court,"The hotel is magnificent, their service was courteous and responsive, the location is extremely convenient, to bus, underground and on foot.  You can't get more convenient if you want to watch the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace!  Easy walking distance to many tourist destinations, or you can use the close by Underground.",5,2019,02,20
121,Home away from home,"What sets the Taj hotels aside from any of the competition is its attention to detail and its all consuming desire to make guests feel comfortable.

You are greeted by friendly staff at the reception desk of the St james Court hotel and invariably the hotels senior managers will be at hand to ease the way, greet you or just enquire after your journey!

Travel up to your room and instantly feel at home with an uber comfortable bed, lovely choice of pillows and most importantly the fluffiest towels ever reminding you of home!!

Breakfast is a vast spread with a choice of english breakfast staples like sausage and bacon as well as quirky indian possibilities of crepes and rice cakes!

a 5 minute stroll from westminster abbey and the houses of parliament and buckingham palace you couldn't find something more central!

most importantly its like going home!!",5,2019,02,19
121,Very good,"We so Happy to stay in this Hotel. 

The food , tapas was perfect and so good. Well done to the chef.
I recommended the cocktail to. 
The best Afternoon Tea that we tested.

We stay on premium room it was very clean. 

The staff was so helpful and professional.
We will coming back. 

The small remark it was the mattress on the extra bed 
we felt the spring.",5,2019,02,19
121,Great Stay,"Stayed the one night on business. Great location with many shops, bars and restaurants to choose from, superb hotel. Good food, great staff and service. Would recommend, and return again if in the area.",5,2019,02,19
121,Luxury stay,"This hotel stay was 5 stars from beginning to end, very friendly and efficient staff,went out their way to make us feel welcome , immaculate rooms, stunning public areas and fantastic breakfast!!!!! We can’t wait to return 😊",5,2019,02,19
121,Unforgettable!!!,"Luxurious hotel with excellent services, lobby bar with live and great music. Afternoon tea with Alice in Wonderland theme will stay forever in our memories. Strategic location to visit many of London sights.",5,2019,02,19
121,Highly recommended,"We stayed one night in this hotel as we were going to see a show. On arrival we got parked right outside the doors ( free parking on the yellow lines all weekend), we were welcomed, and found the staff very friendly and helpful.
The room was lovely, the hotel was warm and welcoming as were the staff, we used the Bistro to have a quick bite to eat before the show and the food was delicious, breakfast the next morning was just as good and probably the best breakfast we have had in any hotel we have stayed in! We were going to the Apollo Victoria theatre which was less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel and about the same to Buckingham palace, highly recommmended, if we stayed in this area of London again we would not hesitate to book this hotel again",5,2019,02,19
121,"Great hotel, horrible room ","Stayed for a relaxing weekend away, hotel itself is beautiful but unfortunately i was given a horrible dingy dirty room, i was afraid to sit in the chair from the stains on it or to walk on the carpet that has not seen shampoo in god knows how long,  tried to make the most of it but the mattress was unbearable, very old and completely worn out, worst 2 nights sleep of my life . Staff are not too friendly some are but most not. Its a real shame as it is a beautiful antique hotel but there is no excuse for poor houskeeping and maintenance. ",2,2019,02,19
121,Excellent stay,"Stayed at this hotel for five nights. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient. The room was large by London standards, comfortable and well positioned over looking the courtyard. I work in London several times a year and will definately stay here again, Also very accessible for the shops around Victoria and close to St James' Park",5,2019,02,18
121,Perfect stay in the heart of London,"Perfect personel, nice rooms, well equiped, like with tea, coffe etc. Nice situated, close to Wesminster Abbey and Buckingham Pallace, and Victoria station. 
Near you can find nice restaurants, pubs, and monuments. Big Ben 10 minutes from the hotel.",5,2019,02,17
121,Excellent Superb mind blowing,"Excellent experience with fabulous hospitality, beautiful rooms and scrumptious breakfast spread...a stunning location! We keep returning and always look forwards to our next trip!! The staff is the star performing on behalf of the brand. Location, food, rooms and everything here is top notch",5,2019,02,16
121,Loved it!,"Everything - quiet location but only a few minutes from two tube stations. Staff were out of this world and so attentive and it’s a beautiful, clean and welcoming hotel! Loved it and would stay again!",5,2019,02,15
121,Wonderful stay,"My partner often stays here on business, so I decided to join him and visit the many fabulous sites the city has to offer. The hotel itself is in a great location to visit Buckingham Palace, a short two minute walk and you’re there. As is the nearest tube station St James. The rooms are very clean bright and the pillows are extremely comfortable. Which I personally loved. Breakfast was included in the price we paid. It’s a buffet style breakfast which included an al la carte option of poached eggs and various other freshly made goodies to order. The staff were very polite and helpful. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel. hopefully I’ll be visiting lots more when my partner visits London for business. 
Thank you taj for a wonderful stay.",4,2019,02,15
121,Great hotel is nice location,"After a best-in-class check-in service by Duane, my stay at St James Court - Taj was once again a total pleasure.  Wonderful rooms and service with helpful staff at every corner!  So many restaurants in the hotel and within short walking distance.  My first choice hotel for London.",5,2019,02,14
121,Great Hotel Exceptional Service,Loved our stay at St James Court. Tomas Luko - Director of Sales & Marketing personally made sure we had a comfortable trip to London. The breakfast was great and the bed was perfect... Will definitely book again when we travel again to London.,5,2019,02,14
121,Perfect!,"The location of the hotel is excellent. You get to the main attractions very quickly. The rooms are very clean, pleasant, comfortable decor. But most I liked the staff attitude, very pleasant and polite.",5,2019,02,12
121,Very disappointing,"This is a wonderful hotel with excellent facilities. I really didn't expect mould in the bathroom, and filth between the tiles. I did request a room change, but was given the same room later in the day, following the close of business meetings. Am I really expecting too much from supposedly one of the best hotels that London has to offer?",2,2019,02,12
121,excellent hotel in a great location,"The service at the hotel was impeccable. the rooms are comfortable and the location is very convenient. many options to dine immediately outside the hotel with Victoria street a 5 minute walk away. Nishant at the front desk was particularly helpful to me during the check in and explaining all options.
Would absolutely recommend",5,2019,02,12
121,Not good for the money you pay,"We stayed for 5 days and we paid 200 euros per day without breakfast. Bad insulation to the point that every time somebody walked outside our room or in the next room ours was shaking like an earthquake. We found a used spoon in the drawer and a half eaten chocolate in the fridge. The robes and the towels smelled like curry. 10 euros in coins were missing from our desk where we had left them from our fist day there. The funny thing is we had spread them on the desk and then one day we found them in the box with the small papers for notes that the hotel provides and I took them out because we were going to forget them in there and then the next day they were missing!! The hotel refunded us but that is a serious security problem. Apart from these issues the hotel is in a great location for exploring, hot water all day and the room was warm at all times. They also upgraded us for free due to the fact that we were on our honey moon. All the stuff were very friendly.",3,2019,02,11
121,Highly Impressed,"This hotel is nothing less than a 5 star. The location, facilities, comfort and especially the hospitality make it unique. Hats off to the staff, from the front desk to the house keeping who make sure that that the guest has the perfect experience. A special mention to Mr. Naveen Sikka, the front of house manager who went out of his way to in terms of hospitality. Some initial trivial issues were dealt with immediately and professionally and he made sure that I was satisfied in the end. St. James' Court is living up to the Taj name and legacy, and I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for the perfect hotel stay, whether it be for business or leisure.",5,2019,02,09
121,A unique city break in London city,"Located just near the Victorian station in the city (perfect location), the hotel is clean and provides you great hospitality. The hotel staff were very helpful and will guide you throughout your stay.The hotel provides an excellent SPA.",5,2019,02,08
121,Fabulous Hotel,Everything about this hotel is fabulous. The staff are amazing so polite and courteous and cannot do enough for you. Whilst this is not a cheap hotel it is worth every penny. Great location. Lots of different restaurants to choose from we ate in the Bistro which had great choices and the food was of the highest quality. ,5,2019,02,08
121,Home away from home,"So glad to have chosen this place for our stay in London. Great location & wonderful hospitality , and thankful to Mr. Sikka who ensured we had a comfortable time. Unlike many other Taj properties outside India where we have stayed before , St. James Court ""feels"" much more familiar & similar in standards to Taj hotels back home , and respects & honours loyalty i.e. Taj Inner Circle members. Would love to return.",5,2019,02,08
121,Great accomodations and excellent location,"Friendly staff and comfy, clean room.  Older hotel.  Hallways are a bit confusing , particularly on the first floor, if you're walking behind the elevators looking for the gym.
The restaurants an d bars were great.  Concierge was very informative.",4,2019,02,06
121,"Attentive staff, comfortable rooms, great location","Stayed for three nights, very comfortable rooms which offer complimentary toiletries which was extremely handy as husband forgot toothbrush & shaving cream. Breakfast was buffet style plenty of it but slightly disappointed that it didn’t include a breakfast menu as it would of been nice to have kippers or poached eggs etc.
Staff were very attentive it was lovely to have the door opened for you & that the reception staff made a point of acknowledging you when you passed.
Our television didn’t work in the room & was promptly dealt with.
Umbrellas are in reception for residents to borrow & free fast WiFi was available.
Location was perfect, Buckingham palace was right around the corner & a stroll to St James Park & the underground.
Would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,02,04
121,Amazing hotel!,"Hotel was amazing, me and my husband had an amazing time there. We were celebrating our annivasery and Neil (receptionist) was so especial he sent a beautiful cake with a happy anniversary message on it. The Hampton bar was really nice and cosy. And the musicians were out of this world. Thank you Taj!",5,2019,02,04
121,"Excellent location, great staff and great value",This hotel has the best location in London in my opinion - every member of the staff was helpful and smiling... excellent value --  Bistro could do with a little more ambiance but the food there and service was excellent.,5,2019,02,03
121,A very good stay in central London,"First time at the St James court and expectations were surely met. Location is perfect just walking distance from main attractions. Had a lovely room in one of the detached buildings of the hotel that you can reach walking through the bar and the courtyard with a nice garden. The room were I was looked freshly renovated, well furbished  and spacious, certainly above the standard in UK. If I need to find something I would improve, I would certainly mention the vanity set which wasn’t offered as well as some drinks in the refrigerator which looked sadly empty. Bathroom with large shower is certainly a plus. I appreciated the sweets and the fruits I found in my room, a touch of class. Breakfast in the bistrot was extremely good with large choice of cold and warm food. Staff always very helpful and courteous. Will surely return. ",4,2019,02,02
121,Mother daughter get away,"We stayed at this hotel for a quick vacation. The location was excellent, 2 short blocks from Buckingham Palace. The service was excellent, bed comfortable and reasonable sized room. The concierge services were especially pleasant and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,02,02
121,Very Attentive,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. It was my birthday and they upgraded my room and even gave me a birthday cake. Very nice touch. All the staff from check in to out and the Hampton bar were extremely attentive. Thank you for a wonderful vacation,5,2019,01,31
121,Rude staff,"I stayed here for a weekend in December and for the most part we had a great time. However when we came home one night there was a door just before the door to our room which was locked and meant we couldn't get into our room. We rang down to reception and they sent up a member of the security team. This staff member was so rude to us, literally gave out to us and told us that it was our fault our keys wouldn't work. Told us we should always get our keys revalidated every time we come into the hotel. This was despite the fact that when he opened the outer door our keys worked to open our own door. All in all the situation was handled really badly by this staff member, he should have just come up, apologized and opened the door for us. Unfortunately it left us with a bit of a sour view of the hotel.",3,2019,01,30
121,"It was great staying at St James Court, Taj Hotel","Excellent customer care, very courteous staff, lovely comfortable rooms, good restaurants. I will definitely stay again and will recommend this property to my friends and colleagues. They just need to add another elevator as only one was working. ",5,2019,01,29
121,Disappointing experience,"Despite requesting a renovated room in advance (due to health issues and concerns after reading other recent traveller reviews) and being assured a renovated room; I was assigned a dated and grubby room. I had used booking.com to make the reservation and the room was stated to have a king bed. This room had a queen bed and looked nothing like the pictures used to advertise the room on the website. The room I was assigned I would not rate better than a room in a  2* property in a townhouse converted hotel. The bathroom, though scrubbed clean, had remanants of mould on the grouting. Due to health issues, I did not use the shower after inspection. There was a light hanging loose off the ceiling and the heated towel rail delivered a mild electric shock! What has baffled me is despite having a clear conversation with a member of reservation staff, Apurva, (who was extremely pleasant and reassuring that I had been assigned the renovated quiet room) I was in effect put into what I suspect was a downgraded room. Baffling, as I had been very clear about my health conditions had politely said that if you cannot guarantee a room meeting my requirements I will happily cancel and book elsewhere without any issues whatsoever. My stay was ruined as old carpets and furnishings trigger my sinus issues and the virtually non existent sound proofing kept me up most of the night thanks to noise from fellow guests. I am currently having to take medication to suppress the flare up. Having been to Taj properties in India and being used to the high standards of service, this was quite a shock. I would have been much happier had I been honestly told that they could not accommodate my request for a renovated room, I would have cancelled and booked elsewhere with no unpleasantness. The way this was handled is not fitting a Taj hotel. I had a second booking at the property for the following week which I have promptly cancelled. Shame.",1,2019,01,28
121,Excellent place to stay,"Wonderful vacation for the New Year's Eve in London and 6 nights spent at this excellent hotel. The service is at a very high level of quality, a very nice suite-room, clean and comfortable. A little bit crowdy at the breakfast time, but the manager was well supporting us and there was an extra room at the 1st floor. Hotel nearby the city center, a very good food restaurant also for dinner time available at the ground floor :)",5,2019,01,27
121,5 star,"Really great hotel. Super comfy bed. Wonderful breakfast and in a great location. 

We needed to get a pop up bed in the room for an additional person which was no issue to staff and they sorted within the hour. ",5,2019,01,26
121,Amazing Stay!,"We loved our hotel so much!  The location was absolutely amazing! There is a wonderful cafe right across the street where you can get coffee, meals and/or drinks. We had a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and just over a 5 minute walk to Westminster Abby. Stay here!",5,2019,01,24
121,"Lovely hotel, nice stay",Stayed here recently for get-away weekend with friends. Lovely hotel. Service was top notch all around. Very attentive staff. The rooms were very clean and modern and location of the hotel was excellent for exploring London.,4,2019,01,24
121,2 night stay,I stay at St James’ Court on an ad hoc basis but every time I come I’m welcomed by the friendly staff and made to feel at home. Good value and well located for work the hotel provides me with a good base. A particular thank you to Agnelo who for this visit who time to ask me how my day had been and make me feel very welcome. The rooms new rooms at the back of the hotel above the conference centre and the most recently refurbished and most quiet. Good internet speed for free and excellent room facilities. ,5,2019,01,22
121,Wonderful Service,This hotel is located in a great position with all the facilities you could want. Rooms are large in size and have good air condition/heating and bed is very comfortable. What makes this hotel stand out from the others from our point of view was the staff....simply great service from check in to check out...we were made to feel very welcome. The buffet breakfast was also consistently good. We will be back,5,2019,01,20
121,"Wonderful hospitality, ambience and rooms",Wonderful hospitality and ambience....Special mention for the manager Naveen Sikka who is such a wonderful person to assist everyone and make the guests comfortable. I would recommend everyone to stay once in this property and enjoy their hospitality.,5,2019,01,19
121,An Asian traveller,"The staff was very uncurteous. The amenities were not in order.After paying so much , the basics were not replenished, the water in the room , the toilet amenities.Very disappointing  experience.The location was the best part of the hotel. In spite of being an Indian hotel , the staff is very racist towards Asians!!! I would say the European hospitality is way better!",1,2019,01,18
121,Good value for money!,The hotel lives up to expectations. The room was clean. The service was generally friendly. The location of the hotel makes it ideal for both leisure and meeting colleagues. Hope that the standards are maintained after the Brexit issue is resolved!,5,2019,01,17
121,Comfortable stay," Thx, for comfortable stay, very quick check in, special thx, to Rukmini mam,for explaining everything,michelin star restaurant Quilon, bistro , everything so perfect, in every department, delicious food, courteous staff, its home away home for us, thx to Taj .",5,2019,01,16
121,An anticlimax ,"The lobby is very beautifully decorated and gives you a sense of luxury and I was well received and looked after by the staff. The room on the other hand was the polar opposite  of what the lobby exuded. The furniture was old and dated and the room had no character and was very plain. The corridors were equally as old. However, the room and bathroom was very spacious, there was lots of storage space and I had a nice view over the courtyard which was a nice touch. they were doing maintenance work (I think) just outside my room which made it look like a construction site. They were also renovating the spa at the time of my visit which was very disappointing. My time at St james court definitely wasn’t a memorable experience. ",3,2019,01,14
121,"Wonderfull staff, great location —perfect","We have travelled a lot and this is the most uniformly wonderful service we have ever received, The concierge team is helpful and accurate, the breakfast is the only hotel breakfast that was ever worth it, and the rooms are comfortable, clean and well maintained even in the older section.  The new rooms are lovely.  We even had a small medical problem and you are close to one of the best hospitals in London.",5,2019,01,14
121,Conveniently situated near Westminster with a Stunning Courtyard – Highly Recommended,"I stayed at St. James' Court for eight nights from 5 to 12 September 2018. I made the booking based on the Tripadvisor.co.uk member ratings and the favourable reviews.

A first-class experience and I have nothing negative to say about the room or staff.

The Room

I booked a Classic Double Room in this 4 Star hotel but upon arrival decided to upgrade to an Executive Double Room. The Executive rooms were recently refurbished and are closer to the reception and the moderate higher cost comfortably matched the superior room quality. Even then the room size was not especially generous at 25m² though not unusual for London and European cities.
The room interior was of an Executive standard and immaculately presented.

The Common Areas

The hotel designer attempted to create a modern but classic ambience in the corridors and lobbies with variable success as the theme was somewhat haphazard. The reception lobby was a different proposition being a bold statement in stylish comfort. A pianist in the reception lounge bar in the evening added an extra flourish to the mood. The magnificent St. James' Courtyard is a uniquely compelling reason to stay in the hotel and offered an exquisite setting to relax in during the evening or between excursions. The seating areas surrounded by abundant lush verdure created an enticing array of atmospheres; I was rather taken with the central fountain. 

The Staff

The staff were exemplars of customer service without exception and their friendly, pro-active approach definitely enhanced the experience.

The Breakfast

Breakfast was served in the ground floor Bistro Restaurant adjacent to the Buckingham Gate entrance. The tasteful refurbishment in 2017 fostered a pleasant enough environment. The continental breakfast was worthy of a 4 Star hotel though nothing out of the ordinary.

Dining

I do not tend to eat dinner in hotel restaurants as the food is generally underwhelming and poor value for money. However, one night I returned to the hotel late and opted to dine in the Bistro Restaurant. I selected The Bistro Samosa Chat accompanied by Naan bread (too late for anything more substantial) as it looked to offer an intriguing twist on samosas. The dish was appealingly arranged on the plate and wise flavour I rated it 7.5 out of 10, although the £9.00 price was on the steep side. The wider Indian food menu was impressive and a relative novelty for a mainstream hotel; one of the salient benefits of the St. James' Court being part of the Taj hotel brand.
.

The Location

St. James' Court is fabulously situated 10 to 15 minutes’ walk (depending on pace) to Westminster Abbey, the QEII Conference Centre, Parliament Square, the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Underground Station. Buckingham Palace is also in the vicinity and St. James's Park alongside it is one of the finest in London.
The transport connections are in profusion, with Victoria Station (Train, Underground, local London and European buses) and St. James's Park Underground Station all a short walk. Before you reach Victoria Station there is a plethora of quality shops of every variety and along Victoria Street and within the Cardinal Place complex. There are two renowned theatres in the area: Victoria Palace Theatre and the Apollo Victoria Theatre.",5,2019,01,13
121,The harmony with the place,"I loved the location of the hotel and its excellant and close to the tourist area ,the rooms are spacious, the beds are comfortable, and the lobby is nice and comfortable ,and all the staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful.",5,2019,01,13
121,Excellent experince,"All the staff is nice and help you with your request.  NIce with kids. we are a family , so  we ask for a family room. The room was confortable, great size for a family. The hotel  always consider that we were 2 adults and 2 kids for the amenities. ",5,2019,01,12
121,Nice and convenient stay,"My family visited London during the Christmas season.  I picked the hotel because of its location, which is close to a lot of tourist attractions ( Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby... SOHO is within walking distance) and tube station is near-by.  The breakfast is excellent and serves from 6 AM, which is a big help.  
The only down side is our room is in the seventh floor, it has the ridiculously low water pressure we've ever experienced.  We complained to the front desk three times and there were no improvement. So my wife and daughter who has shoulder length hair had to quit washing their hair for the last three days of our stay.",4,2019,01,11
121,Long weekend stay,The hotel lobby and bar is lovely but the rooms are very basic and what you would get in any hotel. We waited 4 hours to get into our room due to a technical issue so we got complimentary drinks only to be given two wrong drinks out the 4. The breakfast is way overpriced £20 per person for a buffet breakfast which i dont find is worth the money when you can get an £8 breakfast from the pub down the road which is much better. The location is great but I think thats all your really getting for your money.,2,2019,01,10
121,A delicious Tea!,"While visiting over Christmas, my husband, daughter and I had tea at St. James.  It was absolutely delightful.  Unlike other teas we have been to, this one was VERY filling.  Delicious sandwiches, scones and desserts. The service was also outstanding.  This is a must for those seeking a truly British experience!",5,2019,01,10
121,Instant Coffee?,"This hotel was very good.  We had an excellent room (huge by London standard), reception was very professional and the restaurant was good value for money.  The location was great (Westminster and Victoria line one stop away) and an off-license next door. It seems incomprehensible to me why such a nice hotel would offer (very ordinary) instant coffee. In my experience, most hotels in this price range offer a Netpresso.  The tea was good.",4,2019,01,10
121,Beautiful hotel. Very professional staff.,"What a beautiful hotel. Absolutely stunning reception with extremely professional and polite staff everywhere. Perfect quite location, just a strol from Buckingham Palace. My only negative feedback would be the terrorable view from our room. It was very dissapointing. Not what was expected for a superior room and the price paid. Apart from that the hotel was perfect.",5,2019,01,08
121,Excellent Hotel,"I normally don’t write reviews. But this hotel was superb during our stay from 21st dec to 2nd jan. My mom eats Jain food and st. James Taj had many options for her. Home away from home. Superb service be it Bristo for breakfast or Hampton bar or Quilon restaurant. I rate it as the best hotel in UK. Staff is amazingly accommodating with any request including early check in. Beautiful spacious rooms as desired. Concierge was fantastic. This hotel is Excellent, superb, amazing and fantastic. Keep up the good work team Taj.",5,2019,01,08
121,Christmas Week at the St. James' Court Hotel,"Check-in process was efficient and courteous. Our rooms were upgraded to newly renovated rooms. Rooms were spacious and spotless and  Lobby, bar and restaurant had a wonderful ambience and was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Staff, from front desk (Nishant), to room maintenance to dining room were absolutely outstanding.  Nothing was too much trouble; you only had to make a request and it was taken care of .  The food was marvelous and presentation for our Christmas dinner was exceptional (the Christmas crackers and party hats, was a brilliant touch).  The buffet breakfast had something for everyone. The location was marvelous; close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster and other London highlights, and the tube and bus lines were a short walk away. and there was always a taxi available if needed.  I had not stayed in a Taj Hotel before, but I would most certainly stay there again and would recommend St. James' Court to my family, friends and business associates.

121,Wish I could have lived there!,"Service at St James is unparalleled. I stayed for 8 nights throughout New Years and could not have been more pleased with the location of the hotel, the service within it, and the amenities provided. The metro station St. James’ Park is less than a mile away and made staying in London that much easier, but even without the metro, tourism staples like Westminster Abbey, the House of Parliament, Big Ben (covered in scaffolding for another year), Buckingham Palace, and the Queen’s Gallery are just a brief walk away. 
The hotel itself is incredible. Every morning I would order room service and it seems within SECONDS a staff member would have my food ready at my door. They have the nicest and most spacious gym I’ve ever seen in a hotel, their restaurants are incredibly good (I had dinner at the Bistro and afternoon tea at Kona), and even my most basic room had a heated towel rack and a gorgeously spacious tub. The view left much to be desired, but I was here to explore the city, not stare at it from my window.
One gripe, there was a terrible noise that made my hair stand on end throughout my trip. It sounded like a child incessantly whistling, I could hear it several times on the hour. It made it difficult to sleep. For a while I thought it was just traffic noises, but it turns out that it was the elevator shoot making this whining, industrial noise! My room was 635 and it drove me insane. I won’t dock any point from the hotel for this, but hopefully they can take care of this issue so no other guests are bothered by it. 
Other than that I had a wonderful time and was very happy to return back to St James’ Court at the end of the day in London.",5,2019,01,07
121,Hotel staff,"The staff is very helpful, charming and friendly.
Special regards for miss Irene at the reception desk for her kindly treatment and help.
Looking forward to visit again in the future.
Simply it is recommended",5,2019,01,07
121,Perfect stay in London,Great place a few min walk from the Buckingham palace. The food was phenomenal too. We loved ordering room service. Check in was a breeze and they even rolled in an extra bed ahead of our visit for free. The Royal Quarter across the street was a perfect place for breakfast as another option. Will stay here again. ,5,2019,01,06
121,Could be better,"We stayed at this hotel with high expectations, considering that it was one of the most expensive ones in London. However, it fell short on some things that make you think twice if you’re really getting your money’s worth. We were there for 4 nights for the New Year's celebration.
Things I liked: 
— stayed at the classic executive suite room was very spacious that made it comfortable for us to not bump into each other (couple with 1 kid)
— the courtyard is beautiful... best to be out there perhaps during spring or summer
— front desk, bellhop and operator staff were friendly. Housekeeping always in a hurry
— love no limit free still or sparkling water  
Things to improve on:
— pillows: change them!!! There were 4 pillows on the bed and they were of varying stages of being completely out of fluff and beyond their life span. They were in different sizes and were a pain in the head to use already. Only now that I realized that I should’ve had them changed but just didn’t do it
—room service: vegetable biryani was really good but the fish and chips and Taj burger didn’t hit the spot... you could get better ones in the pubs. Staff nice
— security: people could just go in and out to the guest floors even if they’re not checked in the hotel. I had friends come at 10pm and no one stopped to ask them if they’re hotel guests. No key card access to the elevators... which was ok. But there are access points also from outside that lead to the courtyard. One can walk in to any of the doors to the hotel and go up the elevator and the room floors. So better to double lock your doors.",3,2019,01,05
121,Nice visit,We stayed here with our family. We stayed in the new remodeled rooms which were spacious and nicely decorated. We enjoyed the Mad Hatters Tea and the concierge was very helpful.   My only complaint is that I feel the remodeled building should have a key card entry. It is very quiet and accessed via the courtyard or side street.  There is no doorman or front desk. On several occasions cars were parked in the courtyard by the door. I did not like the fact  that anyone could enter this building at all hours. ,4,2019,01,04
121,London New Year's,"I stayed here for  27Dec thru 1Jan 2018...the hotel has been going thru some renovations in the past year. A lot of good things to say about this prop. The building has been here for over 100 years I take it...they should look into some sound deadening insulation. I thought it a little noisy...the room furnishing where good...very comfortable bed. They had fresh fruit in my room...one of my issues...I could not find the gym...when I ask a employee...she did not know either.
I would recommend the hotel... location is great...I could walk to almost all places I wanted to see in 20 minutes. The food was good very pricey! I paid $8. for a cup of coffee. But their are great restaurants near by.",4,2019,01,02
121,Beautiful building and lobby and that's it,"OK so we come to London once a year and this time, we chose the St. James' court. The building facade is marvelous, as well as the lobby and the lounge bar. Once you pass these areas, the hotel is very oldish with very narrow lobbies to the rooms. The room we had was very small, maybe 9-10 m2, with a 160cm bed. The bed was very comfortable (I have problems to sleep in general and need a great bed for this and I had it). The room was also very old furniture, but hey, we just sleep in our room, so we didn't care.",4,2019,01,02
121,"Classic suite very good, but too much attention at the hotel","I stayed here (solo) from January 21 to February 4, 2018.  I booked a non-smoking ""Classic Suite"" then was alarmed when I read a review saying that a classic suite should be ""avoided at all costs"".  The reviewer never explained why.

Upon arrival, a front end manager was kind enough to show me other suites, but the one I booked was perfect.  Large sitting room and bathroom, and the mattress was comfortable.

None of the classic suites have a courtyard view, he said.  Mine overlooked active office building construction.

In retrospect, the problem was that too much attention was paid to me.  I couldn't be the first one downstairs for breakfast without front desk personel saying good morning and calling me by a wrong name for two weeks.  The doorman looked me up and down and tried to stop me from going inside the hotel once, but I was recused by a nice guy who opens the door.

At breakfast, not only are you expected to order before being seated, but they keep a computer record of everything you eat and mention it to you the next day(s).. 

I asked for the room's two pencils to be sharpened, and the front desk knew about that, too!

The hotel's location is perfect.  It's a short walk to the Food Hall at Mark's and Spencer on Victoria Street, ditto the Little Waitrose grocery store around the corner, Westminster Abbey, the Supreme Court or Buckingham Palace.  And you can certainly walk to Harrods, Harvey Nichols or the Victoria and Albert Museum.

I met the general manager and told him that Housekeeping is perfect.

I woud stay there again, but now know how to find the back door to enter and exit and not be noticed.",4,2018,12,31
121,Would recommend,"The courtyard room was of a good size , quiet and clean  The bed and bedding extremely comfortable  The TV was impossible to turn off completely as it seemed to have a mind of its own and not respond to any button pressing 😂The room and bathroom were in need of a little TLC but I understand a refurbishment programme is ongoing. The only negative was the lack of power in the shower and the difficulty in manoevering the taps for power, heat and closing the plug which we mastered eventually !! Location was excellent for Victoria and Buckingham Palace etc   The staff were wonderful  - always friendly ,  polite and helpful   I would happily stay again ",4,2018,12,29
121,Great hotel for tourists!,"Great location, close to St James tube stop, great breakfast and concierge. My family of 3 spent 4 nights here over Christmas. Our 6th floor room had a King with a rollaway for my 14-yr old daughter.  We had plenty of room. The bathroom was small by US standards, but great for London. The amenities included a full-size hairdryer, excellent toiletries, robes, slippers and washcloths were included with towels. Everything was clean, and bottled water was plentiful. The concierge desk was fantastic and helped us to find a great meal on Christmas Day.  The hotel has a wonderful buffet breakfast for purchase (we paid upfront for a discounted rate) that includes eggs, bacon/sausage, fresh fruit, baked beans, cereal, breakfast breads and pastries, yogurt, juices, and cheeses. Service was outstanding and the breakfast lasted us all day, so we didn’t feel the need to eat again until an early dinner. We loved this hotel and staff. ",4,2018,12,29
121,Rooms are old and tired,"It's possible your experience here will be determined by whether you are allocated one of their old or newly refurbished rooms.   We were allocated one of the old (non refurbished rooms) and they are in very poor condition - the carpets, curtains and furnishings are badly worn and dirty.   It is in no way a luxurious experience.   I was particularly disappointed as this was a present and I had asked in advance for one of the refurbished rooms with a nice view - and instead we got this old room with a complete view of a brick wall 10m  from the window!   Normally, my experience with Taj properties is excellent, but this was property was a disappointment.      The service and breakfast were excellent - but unfortunately that doesn't compensate for a poor room when there are so many other lovely places to stay in central London.",2,2018,12,28
121,Tired and shabby,"Travelling on my own I had decided to treat myself to a bit of an up-market hotel that would be easy for accessing central London. How disappointed I was with the standard bedroom, as my son described it as 'shabby' when he met me there. One of the decorative bed cushions clearly had a food stain on it, the walls were looking dirty and marked. Accessibility to power-points was fairly limited to one at skirting board level - not really appropriate for plugging in a kettle! There were building works going on outside the bedroom and I was not notified on check-in that this was happening. The gym entails going outside the main building across a court-yard - not ideal in an English winter!! So this certainly deterred me from venturing into it. Be prepared nothing is cheap at this hotel - though there are quite a few cafes nearby to grab a breakfast at.On a positive the door staff were really courteous and helpful and obliging in giving directions and and organising taxis.",3,2018,12,26
121,Nice stay overall,Rooms were clean and having breakfast in the rooms was one of the highlights in our overall stay. Location near to Victoria station. Noemi at the front desk was very helpful and approachable. Got quite a reasonable rate having booked way months before. Will definitely consider staying here again if returning back to London in the future.,4,2018,12,25
121,Grand common areas,"Very wonderful common areas, with lots of different spaces for drinks, tea, etc. Very attentive and helpful staff, with a great concierge.
The restaurant, Quilon, is a hidden gem with a Michelin star!
The only letdowns(ish) are the bijou rooms we have had. A bit small and cramped, needed a refresh.
Fantastic location, though, and we would stay there again gladly. ",4,2018,12,24
121,Mad hatters afternoon tea ,Fab service beautiful hotel.  Lovely afternoon tea..  Be aware of price if extra things ie.  Gin and tonic!!! Very helpful and attentive staff. Haply to place left food in lovely boxes for us to bring home.  ,5,2018,12,22
121,Lovely birthday experience,"We were delighted with our gorgeous courtyard studio room in the refurbished wing.  Private and quiet, beautifully appointed with a separate sitting area.  Wifi was excellent, all the staff were excellent, the Christmas decor in the lobby was gorgeous, breakfast buffet was excellent as well as a dinner we had in the bistro, too.  The only slight glitch was getting coffee pods replenished for the coffee machine.  I would  have enjoyed a bathtub which was not available.  Luxurious walk- in shower was very nice.  Entertainment in the lobby was a nice treat.  The concierges were very helpful.  And I got special cake on my birthday!  All in all a great hotel in a very desirable neighborhood with lots of eateries close by.",5,2018,12,20
121,New Premier king rooms are beautiful ,"This is hidden Gem because it has two wings and new refurbished rooms are outstanding. 
Mr. Manjinder and Ms. Hafsa helped to select  right category and they were super helpful.
Food in Bistro is amazing too",5,2018,12,20
121,St Jame’s court hotel,The hotel is well located between 2 subway stations. It is also easy to walk everywhere. The hotel rooms are very spacious and quiet. Nishant at the reception was so helpful and made sure that we were totally satisfied with our room. All the staff was very attentive to our needs and guided us when we needed information. ,5,2018,12,18
121,Luxury weekend city break,"Lovely upgrade to King room on the new section of the hotel. Very spacious, comfortable, all little luxuries included....as well as a fruit basket and extra water. The rain shower in the bathroom was amazing. ",5,2018,12,17
121,Business trip in Westminster,Good stay and well located for work in Westminster and to the parks.  Staff was great and the room I had was very good size!  Fresh fruit every other day and loads of water!  TVs need to be updated!  Lovely place for a beer or tea down stairs.,4,2018,12,15
121,A very nice hotel,"This is a great hotel to stay in. It is very close to where I work and to all of the main tourist attractions in London.

There were a couple of things that could be improved.

The lighting in the bathroom was woefully inadequate and the floor in the bedroom sloped.

Both were tolerable for only 2 nights but had I stayed longer I would have asked for a different room.

Breakfast was good - but expensive.

I would stay again as it is so close to the office.",4,2018,12,15
121,Check the billing if using cash .....,"...... and the express checkout.  My credit card was also debited so a double payment.  Not picked up by the hotel and took a couple of days to resolve with prompting.  Disappointing as the location of the hotel is terrific, the room was very generously sized and warm.",3,2018,12,15
121,Great and friendly hotel,"Very nice hotel in the heart of the city. The hospitallity and kind, proffesional attidude of the staff is great. We wanted to switch rooms (not for a real issue just a request) and they did it with a smile and hospitallity.
The breakfast is good. Location is great. Bar is nice, we had bear and tea over there.
I recommend the hotel.",5,2018,12,14
121,Expected much more :(,"This property has an excellent location right next to Buckingham Palace, St James park and well connected. Given the location and brand, I was expecting this to be a modern and high service hotel and booked a 10 night stay. Check in experience was smooth but despite couple of reminders they had still missed my inner circle gold membership. There was no instant recognition either of my gold tier. I asked for a nice room and was told they were giving me a big room. To my disappointment however they did not give me one of the recently refurbished rooms or a room with a view. It was a small window facing a wall and the room felt like I was staying in a basement. I did request for a better room at the reception few times and they said they would try (but sadly didn’t even send me a regret response later). Food at the restaurants is great. But the breakfast time can be very crowded especially weekends. Staff is very nice at the hotel restaurants. In some rush hours came across soiled plates being restocked for fresh use but this issue was immediately fixed. Look forward to returning when property has finished refurbishment and has a better recognition for frequent guests. ",3,2018,12,12
121,Feeling the Tajness,"Luxury handcrafted for the one- as the advertisement says, is apt to explain the experience with Taj. Every expectations were met with a smile and it is a comfortable home away from home. We are leaving today with heavy heart but the love for Taj and their excellent staffs will stay long after we check out. A big shout out to everyone working at the St James’s Court especially Brendan who was always there to entertain every nitty gritty needs of my family. You guys spoilt us so much that every time we come back to London, there will be no questions as to where we will be staying! ",5,2018,12,12
121,A wonderful hotel. Hard to beat.,"The Taj London really is one of the best luxury hotels in London. RefreshIngot different to the same old ‘big brand’ hotels the Taj caters in style to your every need. Great rooms, fantastic bars and restaurants and super helpful and professional staff. Great location. ",5,2018,12,10
121,Great room and service for business stay! ,"I was very impressed with my recent stay at the St. James’ Court. I believe I was given a newly refurbished room, which was spacious, modern, and had plenty of plugs for my various electronic devices. The hotel’s Plantation brand room amenities smell great - clean without being overly scented. Service was great, meeting their commitment to provide in room dining within half an hour. I would definitely recommend for business travelers! ",5,2018,12,09
121,Splendid stay at taj,"Amazing staffs and such  a beautiful hotel. Terrific location as its close to lots tourist attractions shopping place. . I love every minute of my stay. Mark,Brendan,  Noemi, Irene, Diego and Krysztoff were always so helpful.  Central location. Very close to Apollo Victoria.  Close to st James park station and Victoria station. Cardinal shopping area is within 10 mins walk. Buckingham palace is just around the corner and so is House of Fraser. Perfect and ideal location and an absolute amazing place to stay. The only thing I would like to see is for them to have more halal option of food during breakfast and for room service. Taj St James court... thank you for everything.  ",5,2018,12,06
121,Business trip,Valu for money is suboptimal and I would recommend other potential guests to look for alternatives. Our room was as large as a shoebox (13sqm) and we had requested two seperate beds which only received two days later. ,1,2018,12,06
121,Professional and Personable Staff Member Nishant!,"Nishant, the concierge who checked us in, was extremely friendly, personable and professional during our stay at St James Court in London. The hotel was nicely decorated, in a central yet quiet location, and the room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend!",5,2018,12,06
121,"Poor quality room, poor service and incredibly poor value for money","This hotel was expensive at £325 for room only. It was the first night of a special trip for a birthday present and we were staying in London before flying early out of Gatwick. But, the room was awful - very small, very noisy, very hot, and I was told I’d been upgraded so god knows what the original room would have been like! ",1,2018,12,06
121,Helpful and attentive concierge ,"WiFi speed was atrocious. Service, during breakfast, had a very long line, and an order of tea took over 30 minutes. I was accused of coming twice to eat breakfast for some reason, even though I had only woken up. Front Desk and Concierge were very nice and helpful.",3,2018,12,05
121,Bad service,"With the benefit of the Warmer Welcoms program between Shangri-La and Taj hotels, I get the membership tiering matching to Platinum member with Taj hotel. However, my experience with St. James’ Court Taj Hotel London was a disaster. First, I was checked in by a staff member who was sleepy as I checking in at 1am. I was checked in a room with a window facing concrete at first floor, even thought I was requesting high floor. As Taj hotels do not provide lounge access for its Platinum member, in return they provide “Taj experience” to its Platinum member varies from hotels to hotels. The booking process was another disaster as the staff members couldn’t book me the experience without a Taj membership card with me due to security reason. I really puzzle with my passport, photo ID, credit card information with that, what other fault could be? During my stay, there ware other unpleasant experiences like staff member knocking on my door and come to know deliver someone else luggages. Sending water glasses instead of wine glasses as requested. Taj is branded as a luxury hotel, however, it does not deliver that experience to the guest. Mixed feeling of staff members services. However, I would like to call out Patricia who is the only one deliver the great experience to guest. She is listening to my issues and provided the services at her level best. She is really great, not other staff members. The Platinum member benefits redemption is not user friendly. Overall, the hotel is nice but the staff members do need training to do a better job. Taj experience redemption should be simplified. ",2,2018,12,05
121,Nice stay in London,"Nice hotel, we had the classic room didnt particularly feel luxury tho for the price. Breakfast was great. Close to many London attractions. Winter wonderland beautiful, st james park, buckingham palace, westminster and trafalar square all within 30 mins walking. Tower of London we did get the tube. Fabulous London trip.  ",4,2018,12,04
121,Family reunion,"Family flew in from Australia so there were seven in our party. Every effort was made for us to have rooms close to each other. Very helpful and attentive staff, nothing was too much trouble for any of them. Rooms cleaned daily and were immaculate. ",5,2018,12,04
121,"Great Location, Good Room - Good 4 Star Hotel","Location - A short walk to the underground. Is a bit out of the way so not too much traffic and noise. 
Rooms - The room I had was small but comfortable. This is not a new property and the rooms are a bit old school. But they are well maintained so no issues. Bathroom is small but manageable. 
Service - The staff are friendly and helpful. Big tick for that.
This hotel is very good value for money. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,03
121,Great stay in a convenient section of London,The Taj was extremely comfortable with great service. The breakfast was very good as well. The location was convenient with excellent tube access via the St James Place stop for Circle and District lines. ,5,2018,12,02
121,From bad to great,"We stayed at St. James Court, A Taj Hotel in October 2018. The hotel is in a perfect location and check in was smooth. Our first room had a broken thermostat and took quite a while and 4 service men to try to fix but that didn’t work. They finally moved us to another room with a broken window and a view of a crane. It was then, after 15 hours of travel that I asked to speak to the manager. He literally saved the day and the experience ( thank you Nachos) . He put us in a beautiful room that was newly renovated. Our entire experience changed for the better and we could appreciate the hitel, surrounding areas and the restaurants in the hotel- all were excellent. I would have given them 5 stars but I just felt that the reception desk should have made the appropriate changes without my having to ask to speak to the manager. All in all would definitely recommend this hotel- beautiful courtyard and again a PERFECT location.",4,2018,12,02
121,Comfortable Stay,"It's an old property and bit dated, So comfortable but just that, so it's not a great value for money.  Location is very good, The service at the Bistro is extremely efficient in the morning at breakfast, ably supervised by Marcella, and she makes it a study in efficiency, execution and marvellous guest relations. ",4,2018,12,02
121,Excellent management,"Hotel management team was amazing specially our host Mr. Nishant. Every thing hotel room , food was amazing and I can surely say that if you are planning to stay in this hotel you could not complain about anything.",5,2018,11,29
121,Fantastic Hotel,"Wonderful breakfast buffet.   Very comfortable rooms and clean.   VERY hot water.   Friendly staff, especially Nishant at the desk who was most pleasant and helpful.  Doormen always eager to help.  Location just fantastic.   Around the corner practically from Buckingham Palace.  Easy access to the tube (St. James or Victoria) or buses.  Nice little treats in the room of fruit and a very lovely Happy Thanksgiving on the day of chocolate.",5,2018,11,28
121,GOOD STAY,"perfect location close to Buckinghmam palace and business area of Victoria. all staff are well professionnal. breakfast is excellent. cosy, well design, a mix of indian style and british tradition yes",5,2018,11,24
121,Good hotel but needs some work,"St. James Court is a good hotel but the room needs work. I booked a King Executive Room which was very small for two people. With both of our luggages, you barely had room to walk around. The room itself is a bit outdated and needs refurbishing. The bathroom was great, with a decent size bathtub that was nice to soak in after a long day of walking around London. The staff is friendly enough. The location was perfect, about a block away from Buckingham Palace and a block away from the closest metro station. Overall, good hotel in a great location, but definitely needs improvement. ",4,2018,11,20
121,Disappointed not what we expected ,"A weekend break in London for a belated birthday treat. Had researched a number of hotels and this one came out on top. Not a cheap place to stay but the photos looked great. That’s assuming you get one of the done up rooms not the old shabby room which we got. Bathroom was dingy. Tv would not turn off I had to unplug it. Water not replenished on second day. Rubbish left in the room. Had advised it was a birthday treat but no little gesture like most hotels. 

Massage, however, was amazing. Can’t recommend the wellness spa enough. Lovely staff who did a great job. 

Staff front of house were also very friendly but for the price I’d definitely stay elsewhere. ",3,2018,11,19
121,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location if you are interested in seeing many of the famous sights around London.   However, the room was a bit small and dated, although it was quiet.  Stay there for the location and the room will be adequate for a few days.",4,2018,11,18
121,very poor quality room - a surprise,"I do not normally write many reviews but I thought I should warn travellers looking at this hotel. Having stayed here a number of times in the past, the rooms were OK. This time I arrived early and the hotel was great to provide a room. But it was on the 1st floor, the tables, chairs and fittings were all chipped, old and in urgent need of a renovation. Room was stark in nature. It was a little like the staff quarters. I suspect if I had complained the hotel would have moved me (the service was generally good). For a hotel of this price and location it was very disappointing. I travel globally and stay in London a lot - and for some reason we booked this one as an alternative to another great hotel I normally stay at in this area. But on this occasion a disappointment. Perhaps I needed to ask for an upgrade. As an aside, the room had an electrical short which fried my charger - probably just one of those things with adapters and I don't blame the hotel but it was like the room itself - just a little tired (and tiring).",1,2018,11,17
121,Good value for miney,"Spacious rooms, especially large for London that were well maintained, small but clean gym, and friendly staff made the stay short and enjoyable. The check in and check out process was a little lengthy however, which made somewhat of a negative experience, but overall, would recommend it for a functional business stay.",4,2018,11,17
121,Excellence in every aspect,"I happily recommend a stay at this excellent hotel and will definitely return for another visit, the hotel is very comfortable with staff that can't do enough for their guests from front of house to housekeeping I could not find fault with the service provided.",5,2018,11,15
121,Awesome place,"Stay was wonderful and could not have picked a better hotel. Even my kids loved it, close to everything and very welcoming front desk. Would definitely stay here upon my return. The live piano playing in lobby put the icing on the cake.",5,2018,11,14
121,"Taj Hotel, London","My husband and I stayed here for remembrance weekend, as my husband is a veteran and marches at the cenotaph every year, so I always book early. The hotel looked fab in the pictures and I thought a little bit of luxury would be nice for the weekend, we stayed Saturday to Monday. The hotel was a huge disappointment. The lobby is beautiful and check in was ok. We weren’t given much information about the hotel from the staff. We had a classic double room, it was very tired looking and old fashioned, the bathroom was grubby and tired looking. There wasn’t anything luxurious about this room. We had to ask for the heating to be looked at as it was freezing in the room, a maintenance guy came with his ladders and opened the bathroom ceiling and removed a large amount of fluff from the heating system! We were also provided with an electric heater and a blanket which had seen better days, which I refused to use. It cost £14 for 2 coffees in our room, extortionate prices! They weren’t even hot.  It may be situated in a prestigious part of London but it definitely isn’t worth the money paid, we stayed at the premier inn last year in Westminster and that was more slick and up to date! I wouldn’t stay here again, overpriced for an old and worn out hotel which I think uses its location as it’s jewel in the crown.",2,2018,11,14
121,Visibly lovely,"Stayed at the st James on Saturday 10/11/18 as my husband and I were walking in the Remembrance Day parade the next day. The hotel was beautiful when we arrived, and although we had a problem with my credit card when paying for the room (I later found out that the problem was with the hotel system) the gentleman on the reception was very condescending although professional at the same time. The room was a disappointment, it was tired and looked like it needed an upgrade, the bed was uncomfortable and the curtains didn’t fit properly so the light from the building next door shone through all night, add that to the sound of the trains and it didn’t make for a good nights sleep, the hotel is very expensive, but I know that the location has a lot to do with that, don’t think we would recommend this hotel, we stay in London quite frequently and there are nicer hotels with better facilities to be had.",3,2018,11,11
121,AMING HOTEL WITH A WONDERFUL MANAGER,it was not my first time in this hotel but not the last the manager and his staff made my stay as a star   everything was perfect from the check in to the check out the room was clean and well appointedthank you again for a super stay,5,2018,11,11
121,Good but areas for improvement,Vintage but updated property in prime location - lacking luxury aspects but charging a luxury price. Attention needs to be brought to the bedding situation- I should have a top sheet and the wardrobe should have an additional blanket for the amount of beds in the room. ,4,2018,11,10
121,Great Location is the only plus,"We arrived early in the Am and were aware a room would not possibility be ready.  The clerk tried to give us a room but another clerk kept telling him no.  We were told to come back at 2pm which we did and the room was still not ready.  Given excuse a ""light"" had to be fixed. We arrived at our room to find housekeeping scurrying out of the room.  Might add while staying there we witnessed everyone being escorted to their rooms upon check in, something that did not happen with us.  Room was extremely small, absolutely no room to move about.  Pictures I viewed online show a totally different bathroom than we had.  I would have liked to have seen another room to compare it with.  I firmly believe that since we secured a ""deal"" with Travelocity were treated differently.  Only 2 outlets in the room.  Lighting was dreadful.  We had 3 people in the room and had to write a note daily to leave 3 washcloths.
Concierge service was sub par also.  We asked concierge to secure our reservation for pick up to the airport, which he forgot to do.  He assured us getting a taxi at 5 am would not be a problem.  We waited for 15 minutes while the concierge and the doorman were running all over the streets looking for a taxi.  It was anxiety provoking since we needed to be at the train station by a certain time for our one day trip to Paris.
I did ask to speak with the manager when we had trouble getting our room.  He told me he would ""take"" care of us.  He did send a bowl of fruit to our room.
I will say the bistro was pleasant, staff friendly and food was good.",2,2018,11,10
121,Good hotel with great position,"This was our 4th visit to the St James’ Court, Taj Hotel, Buckingham Gate. The hotel is excellent, rooms luxurious, the staff efficient and friendly and the position of the hotel -between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Street is ideal for sight seeing, shopping, eating and catching a show. 
We will be back next time we visit London.",5,2018,11,10
121,"Great location and a charming, unique architecture","My Best friend and I stayed here in April 2018 for 4 nights. The location is excellent and walking distance to Buckingham palace, and metros.  If this is your first in London, this hotel would be a perfect fit.  It is as its name indicates: TAJ like Indian style decor and architecture.  The negative was that the room was small and outdated but nevertheless, the bed was comfortable, and the room was cozy, & clean.   Housekeeping were great as well in providing what we needed.  There are tons of places to eat around the corner and shopping its plentiful.  Overall, a great & relaxed stay.",4,2018,11,08
121,Excellent stay!,"It was my first time staying at the St James Court suites/residences and I must say that I was BEYOND impressed by the service we received throughout our stay. I was attending for my graduation ceremony in Westminster and couldn't have asked for a more comfortable experience.

The staff took care of every single detail of our trip, from start to finish and were always available to assist us in all aspects of our stay in London. The lovely gentleman at the reception desk was particularly welcoming and made us feel right at home! 

I would most definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a pleasant stay in London. Location, hospitality, atmosphere, breakfast - absolutely excellent! I am looking forward to my next visit!",5,2018,11,07
121,"Good location, good room, great gin!","The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the curtains nearly kept the room dark.  But the bathroom is a bit dated - and the slippery marble floor is not safe when stepping out the over the bath side after a shower.  If there isn't room for a separate shower, a bath is probably a waste of space today.  The room, however was lovely.

The bar is clearly popular as it was always full. Perhaps the hotel should extend this, and reduce the seating area in the reception.",4,2018,11,07
121,"Good location, charming architecture ","We spent here 2 nights and intensively used the services of the hotel. Hospitality and customer service come up to the expected levels of a legacy of the location and the owners/chain. Super good and rich breakfast, good bar. The rooms are nicely designed and have spacious rooms both in the room and in the bathroom as well. Good beds and super silent location, good sleep. There is a bit of a labyrinth of finding your way to the rooms, yet this is making the felling mystic too. 

",4,2018,11,07
121,Ideal Location,"Well appointed, ideally situated (near 3 tube stations - one of which is Victoria). Quiet for London (in the rooms - no traffic noise). Rooms were spacious and the bathrooms a very good size for a London Hotel.
Nice attentive staff.
Would return here.",4,2018,11,07
121,Quiet and so close to a tube stop!,"We loved this hotel. When we checked in, we had been upgraded to a nicer room. We had a tub to be able to soak in after long days walking around the city. The tube stop St. James Park is only a couple of blocks away. We were walking distance to many things around Buckingham Palace. There are a decent amount of restaurants but with the tube so close, you can eat anywhere. Our favorite find was The Laughing Halibut. I kid you not, they had the best halibut & chips I have every had. I'm from the Seattle area, so I've had a lot of halibut in my lifetime!",5,2018,11,06
121,Another excellent stay at this hotel,"Returned to this hotel as I had been invited to a special Thanks & Celebration service at Westminster Abbey and had another great stay, ideally situated for the Abbey (a 10 min walk even with a wheelchair). Must mention Nishant on reception who checked us in- he was the most disable friendly and disable aware member of hotel staff I have met. 
The restaurant have just changed their menu and were happy to cater for special diets. Restaurant manager at breakfast was also excellent and arranged G.F. & D.F. pancakes for me which were very nice. We will return for another stay when we next visit London.",5,2018,11,06
121,very nice hotel,Very nice hotel and good location. Easy access to main attraction and very close to Victoria Station.Clean rooms and good service. The neighborhood is nothing special at night.Great choice for business trip and leisure as well,4,2018,11,06
121,Very good hotel perfectly positioned!,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights and we were very pleased with everything, from the check-in till the check-out. Nice and friedly people at the reception, helpful and professional. We also had breakfast at the hotel and enjoyed  the friendly and prompt service.  The coffee was not so good but this is a general issue in London. We had a coffee machine in the room and this helped a bit.
The concierge service was excellent, we got out restaurant reservations and taxies immediately. 
We will no doubt  stay here next time.",5,2018,11,05
121,Great stay!,"We had a great stay at the St James, I loved the location and the room was fantastic. 
I nice bathroom, very clean and lovely toiletries provided. I loved the courtyard with the beautiful fountain! Thank you for a wonderful stay, I will be back.",5,2018,11,05
121,3 night city break,"Great location for the west end/parks/shopping. Comfortable room/bed. We ate in the Bistro one night which was excellent, then drinks in the bar. Could do with some hooks for coats. Room services was prompt when requested.. recommended.",4,2018,11,05
121,"Good hotel, but","We came in late from our flight, no roomservice, no snacks, no in room bar. Bed was fine and bathroom good and room was clean and tidy, we slept well but if you close for room service early, there should be something to snack on in the room. Hotel is well situated for roaming the city.",3,2018,11,05
121,Nice stay,"We had a nice stay, staff was very friendly, good service. The new premium rooms are very nice, however it was very cold during the night, although the Air conditioning was off. There should be some clothes hooks.",4,2018,11,05
121,Comfort convenience outstanding,"We had an amazing time at st James -
We were given early check in - thank you Niall!! after early flight - we had an event st Parliament that evening and we were well rested  and we were then sent a fruit platter - it was superb and set the tone for a great vacation - room was cleaned and restocked daily - friendly helpful staff! Quilon was elegant and had s special cake and sparkling candles for my birthday!! Overall an incredible experience and walking distance to so many attractions - we will be back!! Thank you St James!!!",5,2018,11,04
121,AWESOME!,"My family and I stayed at the St James Court hotel Oct 11th - 16th, 2018.  From the moment we arrived the service was outstanding.  We were warmly greeted by the doorman who assisted us in getting our luggage to our rooms.  The hotel is beautiful & the hotel staff were extremely friendly & accommodating.  We had a problem with one of the rooms & they promptly moved us with a smile.  Every request we made for (ice, US outlets, extra towels, water, etc.) was carried out promptly & with a smile.  There was not a moment during our stay that we were disatisfied with anything.  
The breakfast buffet was wonderful & well worth the extra money & the staff in the dinning room were always attentive & helpful.  The location of the hotel was excellent, close to the underground trains & star attractions. They even loaned us umbrellas when it rained.  I would 100% reccommend this hotel & it will always be our first choice when traveling to London.  It's nice to know that you can still get consistent outstanding customer service in the hospitality industry.  
Thank you very much St James Court for making our stay wonderful.",5,2018,11,03
121,Awesome stay at exquisite location in London,"It is a Friendly and courteous hotel with prompt service. the rooms are good, however the location is excellent. it is centrally located with underground station near by and five minute walk to Buckingham Palace. the buffet breakfast spread was very good and so was the staff both at the dinning hall and front desk. Piano music in lounge on most nights was good. overall a very unforgettable experience would love to stay whenever in London.",5,2018,11,03
121,What an unbelievable experience!!!!!,"I cannot say enough great things about this hotel! Wonderfully located next to Buckingham Palace! Fantastic ambiance, service and the rooms were absolutely terrific!!! We were made to feel so special at every turn! I especially loved how we were not out of our room for 30 minutes and came back to find our room had been made up beautifully! The gardens are just gorgeous and the restaurant had very delicious food! I really loved the bar and all the evening entertainment!!! This is truly a 5 star hotel!!!!!",5,2018,11,02
121,"Great location, beautiful hotel, great service.","Same as the title! Sweet little kids package at arrival. Great coffee. If I had to find a drawback, the hotel could consider a wider spread for the breakfast and the chai could be better. No great views on offer either.   ",5,2018,11,01
121,Great location!,"Lovely hotel and staff. Great location. Walking distance from saint James park, Buckingham Palace rd,  Victoria station, restaurants and many attractions etc. We were offered an early check in and late check out which was great as our flight was late in the afternoon and we had time to freshen up before leaving to the airport.  We also had enough time to enjoy a great afternoon themed tea at Kona restaurant! It was an amazing experience! ",5,2018,10,28
121,"Consistency of Taj service, great location, large rooms","Very nice stay at this Taj property. My first time here. We booked a slightly larger room as there were three of us and it was well worth the price (premium!) given that we were there in the peak of the English Summer (July) so definitely high season. And we needed the Air Conditioning given the heat wave in England that is now a given every summer.

The service was fine and the breakfast too. Ordered room service breakfast also one day as it was possible with the breakfast package. Only grouse was that the hotel is undergoing some renovation and that was not mentioned up front on the website. So the healthclub/gym is a makeshift one which is not very exciting as it's in a temporary room and not in a proper gym. 

The hotel is located very close to Buckingham Palace and you can walk across it through Green Park and you are in Piccadilly which is great, esp if the weather is nice. Victoria Station is also close by and there are enough dining options nearby. Didn't try any of the hotel restaurants except at breakfast time. 

Would stay there again if for a short visit and if I got a good rate. They had a special treat for my daughter sent up to the room which she loved - was a total sugar rush platter but then she was on holiday!",4,2018,10,25
121,Lovely hotel,"Close to Buckingham palace and St James park, very convenient. Lots of coffee shops and pubs, between two tube stations for transport. Lovely hotel, beautiful decor and ambience. Breakfast needs a lot of work. Dinner menu is vast and the food is superb!  Resonantly sizes rooms. 
",4,2018,10,24
121,"4 stars, $366.00/night, but I was disappointed","The location is good - convenient walk to 3 underground stations. The lobby is lovely. The concierge and checkin staff were excellent. We were offered an ""upgrade"" to a more expensive room in their newly-constructed wing. We declined. Our room, 644, was large enough, but the shower was so narrow that you had to turn sideways or your elbows would hit the sides. The wooden furniture was old, dinged, shabby, and looked like college dorm furniture. The bathroom ceiling had flaking paint. Not what I expected from a 4-star, $366.00/night, hotel in London.",4,2018,10,23
121,Wonderful Hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel pre-cruise for two days.  This is a great hotel, which is centrally located with most of all the tourist attractions within walking distance.  Our room included breakfast, which was outstanding with unlimited breakfast selections, everything you would like for breakfast.  We also ate dinner at the Bank restaurant in the hotel which was also very good. Would stay here again without hesitation.  Loved it.",5,2018,10,23
121,A Diamond In The Rough,"We chose this hotel as we loved the location and our usual - The Conrad - was fully booked. 
We weren't aware of any renovations being undertaken. 
Beata, the duty reception person greeted us warmly and showed us to our two rooms. We went through a rabbit warren of rooms and corridors to get to our (just renovated) first room which was on a floor which had no power (level 8 I think) and was accesses through a bizarre network of stairs. 
I said that this wasn't really what we thought we were getting.
Beata totally agreed and was genuinely embarrassed by our experience. She had us upgraded in room category and resited us to the newly renovated suites on the 2nd floor. To this end we were immensely grateful. 
The room was well appointed and offered delightful extras.
The gym wasn't like in the photos on the website unfortunately. It had shut down for renovation and what was provided was gym equipment in two small rooms. Two people in each room caused it to be overcrowded. Disappointing. 
The bar was lovely and the staff most helpful I have to say and with the tube only a five minute walk away it is superbly located. 
Would I stay here again? Not sure really although I want to say yes but feeling a bit deceived by the photos and information online I'm not sure. 10 out of 10 to Beata though! She was brilliant.",4,2018,10,23
121,Overall evalation.,"Friendly courteous, and prompt service. Large room, excellent location. Piano music in lounge most nights,  Five minute walk to Buckingham Palace.  Walking distance to museums, theater, etc.  Helpful concierge.",5,2018,10,22
121,Excelllent attention and location,"I am frequent traveller and I have to confess that I was very positive surprised about this hotel. Great location , professional and commited staff ,,all worked and time there was perfect.I would highly recommend this hotel , I have been in 5 start ones and honestly nothing to envy to this hotel at all.",5,2018,10,22
121,Perfect Stay,"St James Court is where excellence meets tradition. Perfect place for a business or leisure stay in lovely London. Definitely my home when travelling to London. The garden is lovely, rooms are perfectly equipped and everyone is a delight",5,2018,10,22
121,The Good and the Bad,"Booking the hotel via their website was hassle free.

Upon arrival, check in was relatively slow, but friendly and professional. 

The room was down a long corridor in the more recently renovated wing of the hotel. It was a good size for the location (I have stayed in other places around Victoria and they were miles off this room in terms of standards). The room was very clean and extremely well appointed. It has blackout curtains, safe, empty fridge, hairdryer, USB chargers, night light, wardrobe light - really everything you could need. We did find it strange that there were two of us but the room only had one each of robe and slippers. Was that an oversight?

WiFi free and strong.

We slept well until approximately 7.30 AM when various trollies started making their way very noisily up and down the corridors. At 8.05 we discovered that our room overlooked the playground of a busy secondary school. By overlooked I mean the hotel formed one of the actual boundaries of the schoolyard. Each morning we were awoken by screams, hooots, cheers and catcalls. During classtime, the yard is used for gym practice and on some days this continues right up to 9 at night. So - be prepared to have a good sleep at night but zero chance of a lie in or a decent  afternoon nap.

We didn't check out the other facilities in the hotel. The Hamptons bar looked a bit small and glitzy, with only one beer tap, and we generally avoid bars that have a piano player.

One thing that really annoyed us was the price of the breakfast in the hotel - 30 per head - 38 delivered to your room. I travel a bit for work and am used to some fairly crazy prices, but this cynicval pricing is absolutely ridiculous and prohibitive. Is the hotel trying to stop people eating there? This was a big pain for us, as for example on our last morning, we had to get up, get dressed and leave the hotel looking for a decently priced breakfast. 

I had asked for a feather free room. On day 3, housekeeping decided to return all feather cushions to the room. No idea why but as I am strongly allergic, this was not welcome.

Hotel location is excellent (although a bit tricky to find on the first day) - beside Buckingham Palace, with lots of key areas walkable. I strongly recommend it on this point.

There are lots of staff at the front of the hotel - doormen and concierge etc. I don't let others carry my bags or open a door for me, so doormen don't add much to my enjoyment of the hotel. In this case, there was one tall gent. I greeted him one morning and he just stared at me. This was really annoying. What is the point of him being there if he can't even greet a guest? What a poor ambassador for the hotel.",3,2018,10,21
121,Exceptional hotel!  ,"We stayed at the Lalit earlier in our trip, and this hotel was much better!  It actually has a doorman and the luggage is quickly whisked away and timely brought to the room.  We received an upgrade to a premium room in the remodeled wing after asking for a room in that wing - it wasn’t a huge room but it was comfortable and GORGEOUS.  The gentleman at check in wasn’t sure he had an available room but he made an effort and found one - thank you!!!

The bed was comfy and the room was QUIET.  It was well appointed as well with coffee pods and complimentary water.  Gorgeous linens and a well stocked bathroom - I didn’t have to ask for basic things to be restocked (see my review of the LaLit).  I would DEFINITELY stay here again.  It is located very close to Victoria Station and walking distance to the Palace.",5,2018,10,21
121,"False advertising, and a change for the worse","We've been coming to this hotel for years and always thought it the perfect London hotel. Near green park and all the sights and centre of London. I've recommended it hundreds fo times and written glowing reviews.

The building and the lobby are beautiful. Perfect London. Exactly what any visitor would expect from England. And more. Quintessentially English. 

In the past we've stayed in some of the most beautiful, luxurious and well decorated rooms I've seen anywhere in the world at any price in this hotel. 

Not any more!

They've ""Renovated"" and 'upgraded""

What they should be doing is suing the designers and contractors they allowed to destroy everything that was good about this wonderful old hotel. 

The rooms in the 'new' part of the hotel are stark, barren, hard, and just bleakly awful. so depressing. And if you have any sensitivities to scents I would say don't even enter the building or your trip will be ruined. 

Much worse though is what they've done to the beautiful old rooms we've loved so much. They are now something akin to what you would expect from the motor hotel along the interstate somewhere. It must have took a lot of work to destroy this much value. It just makes my heart sink. And it's all about expectations. There is now possible way to manage them down enough to understand what's going on in these rooms.

This is by far, the saddest experience I've ever had at a hotel...

And I would just be sad for what as lost. But unfortunately I'm also angry, because along with all these changes came an HUGE increase in room costs that we paid thinking that this is just the price for the true value of a great hotel. Wrong. It's the price of the mess they made here, which is hidden from view. The outside of the hotel, the fabulous courtyard, the restaurant, the lobby, all a giant deception, luring the unaware, falsely representing a hotel that someone, for some unfathomable reason, has spent a lot of money to destroy. 

Truly heartbroken over the loss of this gem.",2,2018,10,19
121,Lux experience,"Very good location to access metro and many landmarks,  beautiful and clean building, good staff.You need few minutes to Buckingham Palace, to the green park, to Victoria station,  and there is a Bikes station near the hotel",5,2018,10,18
121,The best hotel in London!,"My experience at St. James’ Court, A Taj Hotel, was unforgettable. The hotel is so elegant! My room was fantastic and the staff was really professional and kind! The hotel is in a very great position, and the breakfast was the best ever!! I’ll be back for sure!!!!  ",5,2018,10,18
121,Amazing boutique hotel,"The hotel is in an excellent location. Near Buckingham Palace and St. James's Park. All hotel staff are amazing, professional and very helpful. The breakfast is fresh and wonderful. Very clean and spacious rooms. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,17
121,Perfect Stay,"Stayed for one night in October 18. We selected the hotel due to it being close to Victoria Palace theatre. On arrival we were given a free upgrade to a three room suite and offered a number of benefits including free drinks and substantial discounts. Sadly, we didn't have time for drinks or eating in the hotel but, on return after having been at the theatre, we discovered the beds had been very professionally turned down and we had been left some desserts and chocolates as gifts. Breakfast was excellent and immaculately served.

At check out I was introduced to the duty manager and asked about our time in the hotel.

Frankly, it couldn't have been better. I highly recommend the St James Court if you need to stay in the Victoria/Westminster areas.",5,2018,10,17
121,Exceeding Expectations!,"This was our second stay at St James Court Hotel and it was even better than the first one! From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the doorman until the day we checked out after three lovely days/nights, everything was perfect - we even got an upgrade to, what I will say, was certainly the nicest room I've ever stayed in in my whole life. The service at this hotel is so smooth and all members of staff that we came across were welcoming, pleasant and extremely courteous. We ate at the Bistro every evening ; the food was lovely and service delivered with a smile. 
I would like to give a special mention to the manager, the two doormen, the floor and the reception staff as well as the waitresses and the restaurant manager in the Bistro who all went that extra mile to make our stay just perfect. We have, indeed, decided to book for next year and are already looking forward. Many Thanks.",5,2018,10,17
121,Romantic Weekend,"Entance has kerb appeal. Great location. Parking on road free after Friday at 6pm I think. Reception staff very pleasant. The room was very nice, clearly recently refurbished. Very tasteful. Bar staff very friendly. Breakfast was good. The grounds of the hotel across the courtyard felt like we were abroad. I’m writing this review as during my stay I stupidly left my phone charger. The hotel have just confirmed they have it and will post out to me! That’s service of an exceptional level. Will definitely stay again. Thank you.",5,2018,10,15
121,Excellent location for Westminster,"Spent 4 nights at St. James' Court in October 2018 as an end to a vacation in Ireland/UK. We had booked through Hotel.com with no problems. We arrived early to the hotel (about 10 a.m.), although check in was 2 p.m., and the reception staff was very gracious, offered to call us as soon as a room became available for check-in, and had our luggage delivered to our room before we got back from a walk around Westminster and lunch. The receptionist even greeted us by name on our arrival.
The hotel location was great for us, as we wanted to see the sights in Westminster. We could walk easily to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Whitehall and Westminster Abbey. Victoria Station was a 10 to 15 minute walk.
The room was very clean, appeared to be recently upgraded, and had more outlets (power points) than any of the other hotels we stayed at in the UK and Ireland. We also had individual room AC, which was refreshing.
Our room reservation included breakfast each morning, and we had the option to order from a server as well as to self-serve from the full hot and cold buffet. We rate the breakfast as very good.",5,2018,10,14
121,Overpriced ,"This hotel is nice but as you can see from the photographs it’s very overpriced for the room. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The location is good though, near to Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham palace. ",3,2018,10,13
121,Absolutely Fabulous,My second stay here and the best place I've ever visited - the staff are wonderful and kind and make me feel like royalty. The food is spectacular and the service is impeccable. Truly fantastic and true quality. Thank you for making us feel welcome once again.,5,2018,10,12
121,St James Court London experience,"This was an amazing hotel. The staff were great and very, very helpful. We were initially in a room near construction which woke us up the first morning. We spoke to the clerk ( wish I could remember his name), who was extremely helpful and moved us to a nicer, quieter room. Everything we requested was responded to with the utmost politeness and speed. Our concierges ( Danielle and Matthew) were so helpful. They booked plays for us, recommended fantastic restaurants and were incredibly nice. Danielle even ran out to our car in the morning as we were leaving to say ""goodbye"". Cant say enough about this hotel..",5,2018,10,12
121,"Lovely elegant hotel, always stay here","My husband and I always stay at the St James Court when in London as it feels like a home from home for us and all the staff are very warm and welcoming and many know us.  We love the elegance and this time staying in one of the newly refurbished rooms which was superb and had a massive bathroom and separate shower cubicle that was a dream.  I also sing with the pianist Ed Bentley, I am a professional singer, which guests and the staff always enjoy.   ",4,2018,10,10
121,Stay at St. James a great experience,The service and treatment was impeccable.  First class treatment and great location and walking distance to great venues.  Excellent courtyard and the bistro restaurant  for breakfast and lunch was enjoyable as well.   Always and available umbrella for a rainy London day. Loved it.,5,2018,10,10
121,A nice hotel is frayed around the edges,"The service at St. James Court fulfills expectations from the bell stand to the front desk.  The concierge staff is excellent.  The lobby is appropriate, however, the journey to the rooms shows the wear and tear.  Carpeting is old throughout the property in both common areas and guest rooms.  Our suite furniture was equally worn, the bathroom sink drained slowly, and general sense of fatigue summarizes our experience.  The location of the property in Westminster is virtually ideal.  There is a lot to like about the property, however, there is more to make it loved...",3,2018,10,08
121,Great Location!,"This hotel is located within walking distance to many sites tourists want to see while in London. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. They stored our luggage while on a 3 day excursion to the countryside, assisted with taxis, and gave us walking directions when needed. We'd definitely return!",5,2018,10,08
121,Excellent value and location,This hotel does an amazing job in all departments. Our room was spacious and clean . The location was superb . The bistro for breakfast was a great value. I would definitely come back here again and recommend to any one I know,5,2018,10,08
121,London vacation,"This was my husband and my first trip to London. Hotel was in a fabulous location. You could walk so many places or use the underground. Room was clean and super comfortable. Staff was extremely attentive and helpful, Overall experience was great. There was a ton of construction outside our room but I felt like that was going on so many places and since we were up and out every day it did not affect us.",5,2018,10,07

121,Ideal Luxe Base for London Sight-seeing,"A ten-minute walk from Victoria Station, this posh hotel provides an ideal base for London sightseeing in the Royal postal zone of SW 1. Located in a 7 story building of Edwardian vintage (the familiar orange brick and white limestone lintels and window sills are typical of the neighborhood), the St James' Court, A Taj Hotel has rooms and suites excellent in every way and attentive service. It is possible to have a first-class breakfast included in the room rate: particularly interesting for its Indian dishes (offered along with the traditional English breakfast options) that reflect the hotel's management which is based in South Asia. The location is sensational with the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Pier, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral (Roman Catholic) and HAMILTON (at the Victoria Palace) all within easy walking distance in a hill-free and very safe streetscape. The Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History are one Underground stop or a cheap taxi ride away. It is a luxe hotel and priced to match (that is, less than a New York City hotel of similar character, much less) but it is a very fine value for the money. We will stay there again.",5,2018,10,03
121,Alice In Wonderland tea,"I took my daughter and 2 sisters for a special Birthday celebration. 

The food and service were excellent, the Alice in Wonderland theme was very cleverly created in the food and table decorations. I would thoroughly recommend a visit to this very chic understated hotel. 

Thank you to all the staff for making us feel so welcome. We had a really lovely time. ",5,2018,10,03
121,Very good but a few hiccups,St James is closer to Buckingham palace has a beautiful facility with a high end bar and bistro. We had a bad experience with fire alarm testing while we were trying to sleep off a long flight and drive. Valet parking was fifty pounds a day. Staff was friendly and efficient accept in providing our early check in which they were friendly but did not contact us until almost regular check in time well after check out time . Going to downtown stes and want to walk? Excellent starting spot. Very nice hotel. ,4,2018,10,03
121,"Great location, comfortable stay","St. James' Court was a great spot for our visit to London.  Just minutes from the Tube, convenient to Buckhingham Palace, Big Ben/Parliament, and the Thames, and with a couple nice pubs in the area, I highly recommend the location.  The rooms were quite nice, staff was very frienldy.",5,2018,10,02
121,Back in London,"Of all the hotels that we stayed at when travelling out of the United States this was at the top. Location is great in that it is close to Buckingham Palace and other sites. It is also close to the Victoria train station and the main bus station; in good weather they are a pleasant 15 minute walk. Also, the St James tube state is about a five minute walk. There are also cabs readily available. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had one of the newly remodeled rooms, and it was a home away from home; clean, bright and modern. Shower had more than enough hot water. Bed was a little lumpy but not too bad. There was no street noise in our third floor room. The breakfast had a very good variety of cold and hot items to choose from and the service was good, the room was ample and clean, and the tables and silverware were clean. We got the breakfast included in room rate which was a great bargain for just a little bit more money. Summing it up: I can recommend this hotel without hesitation; well worth the money, and it made our stay special, even though the weather did not cooperate. ",5,2018,10,02
121,Outstanding!,Can’t say enough about this beautiful and gracious hotel. It is an oasis of peaceful serenity that welcomes and comforts its guests after busy days of work or touring. Fabulous staff! Fantastic place!,5,2018,10,02
121,Worst hotel experience ever,"I have stayed at St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel for 4 nights in September and I am very disappointed at the hotel.  Worst experience ever.  Dirty and noisy room. Unfriendly and unhelpful staff.

1. There were blood stains on the bed sheets. So disgusting.

2. Buzzing machine noises appeared in our room about once an hour and lasted for around 10 seconds each time. Sounds like noises from the air-con but I am not sure what that was.  The noises were so loud that it frightened us and kept waking us up from time to time during our sleep.

3. We informed the reception about the problem with our room and the staff was super unfriendly and unhelpful.  She only told us there's no room for the time being (it was 10 p.m. when we first asked for help) and said they would send an engineer to our room.  She said, ""There's no room for you to change.  That's the only solution for now.""

4. Of course the engineer said he couldn't find out the problem.  When the noises became totally intolerable, we called for assistance at 3 a.m again..  Another engineer came but still he couldn't figure out the problem.  Then we were offered to move to another room, yes, in the middle of the night when we were supposed to be sleeping.  We rejected because we didn't want to move at midnight plus we disliked the location of the new room.  They said we could only wait until the next day to see whether there are other vacant rooms.

5.  No staff followed up the matter with us until we called them by ourselves.  The staff was very rude again and apparently there are issues of communication among them.  At last we were brought to move to another room and turned out it was EXACTLY the same room that we rejected to move to at 3 a.m.  Are you serious?

6.  At around 8 a.m. we were totally freaked out by the fire alarm in the middle of our sleep. Super loud siren which lasted for around 1 minute.  We opened the door immediately and called to see whether we should leave the room immediately.  The staff who picked up the phone said things were under investigation.  Nobody called back.  Nobody picked up the phone again until 30 minutes later.  The answer was, ""Oh that was a false alarm.“  Not even said sorry for the inconvenience.  No further explanation.  

To be fair, the duty manager was helpful (which she was the only helpful staff we met in the hotel),  but it was only after we were totally annoyed by the whole series of events and we decided that we must complain to the manager in person.  

End up we were provided with refund for our stay of the 1st night (because we have been entirely sleepless for the whole night due to the buzzing noises and the fire alarm).  However, I must say our mood for the trip had already been totally ruined by our unpleasant experience.  Our itinerary had been affected because we were exhausted after a sleepless night.  I was so upset by the impolite staff.  I don't see how these suffering can be compensated by such a refund.  The manager said she would arrange something nice again when we visit the hotel again next time.  Ha do you seriously think we will be willing to stay at your hotel again after all these?

P.S.  The hotel and the room are quite old.  Also, the trains were near the hotel and you can hear the noises every several minutes.",1,2018,10,02
121,Faultless as usual,"This is a great hotel, with perfect service, and an ideal location to explore central London. It's towards the pricier end but worth every penny. Large spacious rooms, not a spec of dust, helpful and welcoming staff, great building and facilities.",5,2018,10,02
121,Our stay at St James Court in London,Room was quite comfortable.service was good.location was very nice less than half a km. From Buckingham Palace.we were very well taken care of. Being vegetarian the staff used to take care of our needs.they used to ask one day before what we need in breakfast the next day. Overall a very nice experience.Staff was very nice and cooperative. Food quality was excellent.Location was nice and we'll connected by transport services.Highly recommend this property ,5,2018,10,02
121,Location and class,"This hotel has old world charm, yet our “classic suite” was quite large for a city hotel.  The bed just might have been the most comfortable hotel bed we’ve ever slept in. And, pillows were also perfectly comfortable.  We had buffet breakfast included and it was a nice buffet and stayed open until late morning—great for the day we slept in to get over jet lag.  The concierges were friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable about taking the underground  and trains to get to Greenwich. All of the above is terrific, now add the excellent location of his hotel.  We were comfortable/short walking distance to Buckingham Palace, parliament, Big Ben, and Westminster abbey.",5,2018,10,01
121,Meeting up again with an old friend from America,"We had arranged to meet up with a very old friend from America, whom we had not seen for a few years who were staying at the St James' Court and it made sense to stay there too. Having booked a room, then 'phoned the hotel to inquire whether there was a stand-alone shower. No, I would have to upgrade as this was basic room! Agreed to pay the fee but not too happy. Turned up to find that the upgraded room also did not have a stand-alone shower!! Now, not at all happy, as had to change, shower and get downstairs in 25 minutes and get a room change. Did not happen so had to get changed in the old room and go. 
Met up with our friends at the bar and got drinks. I know that hotels do charge over the odds, but to charge £3-50 for a small bottle of tonic really does take the biscuit.  And, £32 for 2 wines and 1 G&T is a bit steep!
That said, did have a comfortable sleep in our new room and down to breakfast which was served until 11.30 hours, which is very unusual and most welcome. This also helps with queuing as the time is well spread. A very good selection of buffet goods and freshly cooked eggs done all ways - great omelette. Do ask for Americano coffee if you like stronger coffee as the pouring coffee is a tad weak.  
Generally, good and helpful staffing, although feel that there was a lack of understanding re the room change - possibly due to lack of fluent English?

Were only there for 1 night, but the hotel was in a very good location for loads of sights, ie Buckingham Palace was only a few minutes walk down the road.

Might stay there again, but only if I can guarantee the room",3,2018,10,01
121,A little disappointing,"Booked a late night stay as trains were scuppered to get home. 

Beautiful decor pouring with the opulence of Indian and British colonial influences.  Lovely soft furnishings and ornaments on every stairwell. 

The barman is skilled in mixing a Vesper Martini 🍸 and we were very happy to have this tipple! 

Staff are smiley and friendly - but just a little bit disjointed at times (probably tied and limited to process over having decision making rights to appease the needs and expectations of a 5 star hotel) 

Our room was fine but not what I expected from the Taj Hotel St James. 

I’ve stayed before and it was totally different to this stay, a shower that didn’t stay up and so we just rinsed down, dirty robes - clearly not washed from before, no shower products and waited 40 minutes for them to arrive). 

If you have customers no matter what they pay for a room, a room in your hotel is a room in your hotel and the service shouldn’t falter.",3,2018,09,30
121,Great location and historical,"We enjoyed the stay at St James Court. The location is great and all the other services are reasonably satisfactory. Food is expensive and quite ordinary. Even the Indian food was just okay. We have afternoon tea at Kona, great ambiance and okay food.",4,2018,09,29
121,Fabulous and Caring Customer Service,"Well, our reception was wonderful.  They quickly tried to get us into our booked room even though we arrived early from our flight and then when they couldn't get us in immediately upgraded us to a Master Suite.  It was superb, lots of special perks, breakfast was very professionally cooked and served, terrific staff.  Also big shout out to concierge that went out of their way to get me some medical advice after I was up half the night with a horrible cough.  They went way above and beyond.  Highly recommend this for it's great service, food and superb location.",5,2018,09,29
121,Getting there,"Just spent 3 nights at the hotel, the reception staff were great and the hotel itself looks like a 1* joined to a 5* as they’ve beautifully done some rooms and corridors, but to get to them is like walking through a warn motel! The bedrooms are a great size and well finished. The location is great for central London and the tubes. I’m unsure if they intend to finish the hotel , I hope they do! I didn’t eat at the hotel due to other commitments and the breakfast was expensive at £30 each.",4,2018,09,28
121,London vacation,The Resturant was a little pricey for what was available and we ordered breakfast to be included with our room and we were unaware that it did not include our first day- which was the only day we had breakfast - this was very disappointingI think they should have been willing to make some adjustment to our bill to cover the one and only breakfast that we didn't even enjoy - $50.00,5,2018,09,28
121,A delightful stay at St James’ Court,"My husband and I have just returned from a three day stay at the hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated as special guests. Nothing was too much trouble. We very much liked the relaxed and soothing ambience of the hotel. The decor is splendid..a combination of the best of English Country Homes with the beauty of Indian Culture and design. We are widely travelled and we rated it as one of the best hotels we had ever stayed in! We particularly enjoyed the wide range of dishes available at breakfast. All delicious! The hotel staff, without exception were helpful and friendly but not intrusive. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2018,09,27
121,Awesome Hotel,"Good location.  We walked to: Buckingham Palace, London eye, Apollo Victoria theatre, Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Harrods, Piccadilly, West Minster Abby.  Enjoyed Alberts Pub one block away.  Also enjoyed hotel bar The Hampton after a long day of walking and touring.  Lovely live piano music with a nice glass of wine.  ",5,2018,09,26
121,Jasmine afternoon tea,"I took my 2 daughters here for afternoon tea on Saturday 22nd September having originally booked for the day before and unable to get there due to traffic holdups on the M6.
I teleohoned from the car and my reservation was changed for me without a problem.
The table was set beautifully, the food was amazing and the waiter outstanding! He explained each item and was very personable.
An amazing afternoon tea which we all enjoyed.
Only one tiny complaint - I wanted to use my Taj points to pay and they could not get this to work so I paid cash. I now might lose my points as they are due to expire..😒
",5,2018,09,26
121,Excellent,"This is a very nice hotel ,nice location , room are cosy and comfortable , the breakfast is very good and lavish , much better then Normal London standards. This place is especially very good for indian as they have a indian speciality michelin star restaurant Quilon and they also have some indian speciality for breakfast . kachori , idli ,etc.",5,2018,09,26
121,Outstanding Customer Service,"This was my first stay and I will return.  The accomodations were excellent but what truly stood out was the customer service.  From our bellman, to the bartender, the front desk and housekeepinf, the guest was truly thier priority.  I left a brush in my room and had an email the day of departure offering to ship it to me. Great location between St. James and Victoria tube stops.",5,2018,09,25
121,wet London theatre visit,Room 336 - front of house service just acceptable.  badly let down with room  -- very old with a view of corrugated tin wall and air handling unit. offered to pay for upgrade- told no alternative room available. unable to add 2 hot drinks (returning to hotel wet from the rain) to room  (despite £100 deposit !)--just told  to pay cash or card (despite having room card) correct change not given despite a 12.5% SC being added . That lost you at least one in-house meal for two went out!. not able to use lift for around 30 mins no one able to reset after fire alarm,2,2018,09,25
121,Another wonderful Taj Hotel!,"I booked one of the smaller rooms, but there was ample storage and a great size bathroom.  Hotel staff was very responsive and attentive. We were genuinely made to feel welcomed, from the front desk manager to the housekeeping staff.   ",5,2018,09,24
121,Tube train noise,"I was born in London and have lived here all my life so it was an anniversary treat to stay in our beautiful city. We checked in to our pre paid room and a charming receptionist gave us an upgrade to a suite Room 242. The bell hop was eager to help us proving an extra luggage stand and extra complimentary water. Fantastic, large room, huge bathroom, living room. This was ticking all the boxes. At just after 9 we returned from dinner, and settled down for the night. We could hear this rumbling noise every few minutes and it was not the air conditioning. I called reception and the lady said they had never had any noise complaints from this room before and she would send someone up. It was obviously the tube trains. Totally impossible to ignore. I dressed and went to reception to be told they do not have a problem with tube noise. This is categorically not true as the engineer said the air con was working perfectly and the bell hop confirmed the noise. Apparently there are two tube lines that run under the hotel. I was offered another room but by that time it was too late to mess about and the evening completely spoiled so we checked out. The duty manager did then agree it was tube noise but said they would stop soon - really??? And start up again at possibly 5am. Shame on you St James’ court/taj hotels for not being honest to start with when I initially asked the question and then subsequent denials. ",2,2018,09,24
121,Great location,"Nice hotel, friendly staff.  Pillows need to be relaxed though.  Great location!  Nice Italian restaurant just across street 1/2 block away.  Buckingham Palace about 10 minute walk.  We took Uber from airport for half the price of a taxi.  Train station close by as well.",4,2018,09,23
121,Wonderful Staff and Excellent location,"I just returned from a stay at this beautiful hotel and can't rate it high enough.  From check in to check out everything was wonderful. We arrived at 10:00 am not expecting a room to be ready Valerica advised me that she would contact me as soon as it was, the phone call came within a half an hour. Our bags were already in our room. 
The room was spacious and clean with all the necessities you could need fridge, hair dryer, ironing board, comfortable bed and if you forgot your converter even 1 US outlet.
The location of the hotel could not have been better.  I love to walk every morning and every night I would take a walk up to the Palace just to see it without the crowds and I could because I was literally a 3 minute walk away. 
The staff was exceptional again Valerica knew my name every morning to say hello, doormen and concierge could not be more helpful everyday. 
I would stay here again without blinking and eye. 
Thank you St James Court for a wonderful experience!!!!
",5,2018,09,22
121,Just okay ,"Booked this hotel because of its location and reviews. The hotel met all our needs on a basic level - rooms were clean, bed was comfy, and location was good. However, there were a few things left to be desired. Like, hotel services. I’m sure they offered a spa, fitness center, room service, etc but we had no idea of any of these services because there was no information at check in and no information in the room. Also, our room was on the 7th floor and it was VERY LOUD. At one point we heard the neighbors room tv and alarm!! Also when housekeeping would come to the floor in the morning I hope you were done sleeping because doors were slamming and very loud. The shower was very low water pressure and barely got hot. If we return to London, we would stay elsewhere. ",3,2018,09,22
121,Fantastic,My husband and I stayed at the St. James Court for 8 nights and it was a great hotel with wonderful staff and an excellent location as it was within walking distance to a lot of the places we wanted to visit.,5,2018,09,21
121,Outstanding hotel and staff.....The Allan's will be returning,"I can not say enough about this hotel. We stayed for five nights, let me start with the staff. Each and every member that we encountered was extremely professional and super helpful. They really go above and beyond and care about the guest. We really got spoiled at this hotel. It is as beautiful as its staff. Now about the room, we stayed in one of the newly renovated ones. It was very elegant nicely done. Very spacious very clean and super comfortable. The bathroom was super nice we really enjoyed the rain shower bath. The food and drinks were really wonderful, enjoyed the piano bar. We will recommend this hotel to friends and family as well as stay there again the next time we visit London. A big thank you to your hotel and the entire staff. Location was perfect super close to everything very easy to get around.",5,2018,09,21
121,"Beautiful hotel, service could be better.","beautiful Hotel, however staff could use training. Bar especially was inconsistent,slow and not pleasant. Room was fine , however nowhere to plug in a hair dryer  in the bathroom. I would return, however would not be happy with substandard service. ",3,2018,09,20
121,Excellent Hospitality,This is our second stay at The Taj Hotel St James Court.  Why?  Because we felt well cared for and comfortable during our last stay.  We are here for 10 days and it feels like our temporary home.  The staff are very attentive and friendly.  Customer service is excellent.  Our room is large and comfortable.  The hotel is chic and in an ideal location.  We eat dinner on site because the food is so delicious.   We love the amenities offered at this hotel.,5,2018,09,19
121,Great location. Staff was helpful and courteous,Centrally location near major landmarks. Very convenient to restaurants and public transportation. Breakfast had good variety. Staff was helpful and courteous. Room was cleaned well on most days. Overall seems like a good value.,4,2018,09,18
121,Excellent,"Excellent service. The rooms where brand new. Staff very kind, and they help you whenever you need. The breakfast is very good. Maybe they should change coffee servicing: it takes too long. It will be better if you serve yourself the coffee ",5,2018,09,18
121,Super location,"Had two nights in London - Hotel staff helped us with directions, dinner and theater tickets.  This was a great choice.  An easy walk to St James park, Buckingham palace and a number of great restaurants.",5,2018,09,16
121,Excellent,"Great location, super close to Buckingham Palace. Staff were excellent. Room was great. Ours was a bit older but perfect for what we needed. We walked easily up to Covent Garden from the hotel. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,16
121,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel is gorgeous with great service. I would definitely come again. It is down the street from Buckingham Palace and great shopping stores. The Bistro has delicious food that is reasonably priced. It was very convenient to walk to my London office, and sight see.",4,2018,09,16
121,Worst 3 nights sleep EVER.,"We stayed in room 511 on the weekend of the 8th/9th Sept for 3 nights. Part of a wedding party, so we didn't choose this hotel. 
There are TWO hotels, The Taj and The St James Court a Taj hotel connected together but with separate entrances. The entrance, when you find it is very impressive with lots of brass and liveried doormen in Top Hats. The decor is lush, opulent and truly reminiscent of the days of the RAJ.  Very ornate with lots of velvets and flowers and a very comfortable bar area in the lobby, and a stunning courtyard with seating between the two hotels offering an oasis and escape from the city.
I so badly wanted this to be a 5 star review, but too many things were just not right.
Starting with Check-in.  My husband left his passport at our country house, luckily I had mine and was able to get us checked in. They didn't however have a problem taking his credit card when we checked out.

The staff was very polite and accommodating but some of them have no English. Why would a hotel of this caliber hire people who don't speak English?? The chambermaid had no clue what I wanted when I asked her for Non-Down pillows.  I had to call the front desk and they were sent up right away.

Service in the lobby bar was slow and in the bistro the buffet selections, while good, were not hot. I had to ask two days in a row to put my plate in the microwave.
Despite this, it could have been a 4 star review except for one thing and that was the quality of sleep.
Our room was comfortable and elegant.  The view was across the street was to a construction site.  Luckily it was a Sat and Sun so the noise was minimal but there was nothing to see except white flapping plastic covering scaffolding.   The free WiFi is a great bonus.  When we were shown to our room I noticed two greasy handprints on the headboard which I drew attention to the doorman. He said he would send someone to clean it. They were still there 3 days later. In the bathroom, the toilet seat was the wrong size, Elongated toilet with a standard seat, kept slipping. The first night the bed was so hard on half my back and a dip on the other. In the morning my husband helped me lift the mattress and there was a piece of wood about 4ft by 3ft  by 1 inch between the mattress and the box. It was fully on his side and only half on mine. When we went to breakfast I spoke with the manager who explained some people like a board under their mattress and housekeeping had forgotten to remove it. In fairness she did offer to move us to a ""better room"" but there was nothing wrong with our room and I had already unpacked everything and had no time before the wedding to re-pack and move.  She said she would have the board removed and she did.
But the next 2 nights were even worse. The mattress is old, out of shape and stained. Putting a padded cover on it isn't helping. BUY NEW MATTRESSES!!
There are too many other hotels in London to choose from with better beds and any view, so we will not stay here again.
Sorry.",3,2018,09,16
121,St James excellent location and service,"Rave review for location and serviceThis hotel is 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace, on a quiet street, near Victoria Street and Parliament on the other end. So easy to walk to many things.Hotel staff accommodated our room needs, and the room was large, looked out to courtyard, just perfect. The  Comcierge helped is to shop bags;secured theatre tickets, was the epitomy of service. We’ll come again!",5,2018,09,16
121,Great location but disappointing.,Dust on walls.  Mice in courtyard (lots of them) - do not sit on the couches.  Small hotel - no view.  Got a good deal on the room but after all the extras charges I would have been better off with a chain!,3,2018,09,13
121,Could hear talking and snoring from neighboring room.,"Clean, beautiful, very nice staff but I had trouble sleeping because the our room wall was so thin I could not sleep with out earplugs and even they were not enough to cancel out sounds of people in room next door. Old building with thin walls I guess.",3,2018,09,12
121,Location location!,"Perfectly located on Buckingham Gate, London.  Excellent staff! Breakfast was a great start to the day. We were able to walk from the hotel to almost every attraction that we wanted to see. Rooms were a little small...beds were extremely comfortable.  Gracious and courteous staff! We had a great stay.",5,2018,09,12
121,Good stay at a central London hotel,"Check in at the hotel was great especially following a 30hr journey from Australia. I was very impressed with the valet service who arranged for my suit to be pressed in about 30 mins ready for a wedding the next day. The room was clean and tidy but a little small considering the price paid - perhaps understandable in central London, but the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast buffet was on the whole excellent, although some of our party had to wait a long time for their eggs to arrive following their order. Check out was excellent and the concierge were helpful in storing and retrieving my luggage. Only one slight gripe is that due to roadworks and congestion I was somewhat abandoned to find my on taxi, which in the end drove past the hotel. However minor issues aside the hotel provided a good base for our large party who were attending a wedding in London that weekend. ",4,2018,09,12
121,Nice hotel - expensive breakfasts,"Nice hotel close to Victoria and all sights - liked the hotel, excellent, friendly service. Booked a slightly bigger room and was perfect. Only complaint was the £30 breakfast, but hey, that's hotels in London (and elsewhere) - plenty of nice local places to go.
Would stay again",4,2018,09,12
121,Good but could have been better,"Hotel location:  Well-situated for sight-seeing and walking to good restaurants and pubs on and near Victoria Street.Check-in: Helpful but confused front desk staff.  I reserved two rooms, one for me and my wife, the other for my daughter and my sister-in-law.  I made it clear that both rooms were to be on my bill, and that my daughter and sister-in-law would both be checking in later that day but at different times.  I completed paperwork specifying the names of my daughter and sister-in-law so that they could check in to their room when they arrived.  When my sister-in-law came to the hotel, the front desk refused to give her a key to her room and, instead, gave her a key to my room.  Repeat: the front desk gave her a key to MY room.  Entirely unacceptable.Breakfast: Generally good; however, the first two days staff did not advise me that the buffet includes eggs in any style.Room: A wee bit smaller than what I’d expected but comfortable, with a VERY comfortable bed.  ",4,2018,09,11
121,"Beautiful hotel, with excellent service in a great location.","This was our third time staying at the Taj hotel in London, and once again we were not disappointed.The ambiance is classy but casual. The service is of the highest standard and the food we ate, both breakfast and dinner, was both delicious and reasonably priced. The location is a 5 minute walk from Buckingham Palace, and an underground station is just around the corner. The location is a short walk from Westminster Abbey and the Parliament Buildings and many other attractions and sights to see. I highly recommend staying at the St. James Court next time your in London, England.  ",5,2018,09,11
121,"Location, comfy beds, good breakfast","Stayed three nights and had the best location. Real close to the Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Victoria station. The doorman was helpful to flag down cabs. On one night we ate dinner at the Bank which is attached to the hotel. Very friendly staff.",4,2018,09,11
121,Fantastic hotel!,"Great, plush hotel. Friendly, courteous and exemplary staff. Couldn’t do enough to make you happy. On top of their game. Convenient location. Free buffet breakfast was good. Beautiful English gardens in the back. ",4,2018,09,07
121,4* services but 2/3* room,"Lovely people at Taj who will make your stay very pleasant. Thanks to their services, we didn't waste a minute of our time for visiting the city.However, the room was very disappointing. It didn't look like on the photo and the cleaning was too light. Those are details that don't usually bother me but since I paid for a 4* experience I was very expecting excellence. The view on the court was lovely but too noisy at night since we were juste above the restaurant and the windows are definitely too thin.The breakfast is excellent ! Many dishes and, again, excellent service. You just must be careful of the time as it can get very busy and then you will have to wait in line for a bit.I would recommend this hotel for its lovely people and its location. ",4,2018,09,04
121,excellent location,"a lovely hotel in a great location. I have stayed here many many times in the old hotel as well as the new wing and recommend the hotel due to its perfect location close to the underground, shops cafes etc.
The good: 
excellent indian food at their restaurant, nice lobby, though tiny, some of the staff are really polite and good, good business center, new wing is much better

The opportunities:
do NOT raise prices as steeply as you are!! its not worth it at these new prices...the hotel itself  needs refurbishment (old carpets in old hallways, tired beds and bathrooms, really archaic 'gym' (2 tiny rooms)..TRAINING IN HOSPITALITY IS URGENTLY NEEDED...some of the reception staff can be much better trained, housekeeping needs much more training in hospitality, how to speak politely, same for spa. though massage itself was great, conciergeteam  itself is awesome but it takes FOREVER to send my luggage to the room EVERY single time I have stayed no matter what time of day or night i arrive(surely an opportunity here)
thanks!",4,2018,09,03
121,Excellent stay,"The stay was very comfortable in spacious rooms. The location of the hotel is very good as Buckingham Palace, House of Parliaments, Big Ben, Hyde Part etc. are just walking distance.   The service was excellent with Duty Manager always ready to help. I really enjoyed having a few drinks and food at the courtyard open restaurant and bar. The Hamptons Bar had excellent service. The hotel have large variety of dining options and the food at Bombay Brasserie was outstanding.",5,2018,09,03
121,Simply Lovely!,"Great staff and customer service. The hotel was clean and inviting. We had an issue with the air-conditioning in the room we were initially assigned. However, the management quickly rectified the issue by offering a new room with working AC. Would definitely stay here again!",4,2018,09,02
121,Excellent hotel,Beautiful hotel with redone rooms.  Only a two minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a one block walk to some excellent restaurants.  The staff is wonderful from the front desk to the concierge.  Only a 10 minute  easy walk to Victoria and Victoria Coach station,5,2018,09,02
121,Great Stay Again,"We had visited this hotel a number of years ago and, since that time, we have always recommended it to family and friends traveling to London, so we were pleased to discover that it is still a convenient and wonderful place to stay in London.  The staff at the front desk, bell staff and concierge desk were most helpful when we had a lost luggage situation.  Our rooms were spacious and they even had special gift packs for our young grandchildren!  Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay to begin our British Isles journey!",5,2018,09,01
121,25th wedding Anniversary ,"I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. We’ve stayed here many times and the hotel and its staff always make you feel very special.

On our arrival we were greeted by sunaina , who informed us we had been selected as guest of the day, which was a lovely surprise, especially as we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. 

Our room had been recently renovated . Very modern and beautifully finished

The staff were all very friendly and seemed to of been informed of our celebrations, congratulating us wherever we went.

We had a complimentary drink in the courtyard before the champagne flight.

I’d booked the champagne flight which was excellent and very relaxed and enjoyable. Thank you Kendel. Canapés went perfectly with the selection of Laurent-Perrier and we had some giggles with our waitress.

We had breakfast in our room on our first morning which was very nice and arrived within the time requested.

We had a few pre dinner drinks in The Hamptons bar (see separate review)before walking through to Bank restaurant (see separate review).
Our second morning we decided to go to the bistro for breakfast. Once again the maitre congratulated us and offered us some bubbly at the table. Poached eggs were perfectly cooked to order and there was a good selection of buffet breakfast if preferred.
Once again, staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

We left our luggage at the concierge desk and returned later that afternoon. Had a few drinks before the journey home.

The end of a great stay .

121,"Great Experience, Perfect Location and Tremendous Team!","Spent three nights at the St. James' Court last week and had a great experience.  Traveling with lots of young children can often be hectic and stressful, but the staff at St. James' made an incredible effort to keep in mind everything from a peanut allergy (restaurant team was completely aware of the allergy and let us know whenever there was something to be concerned about - incredible!)  to providing the kids with back pack bags, crayons and little booklets about London.  And a special thank you to Aida for the incredible smoothies, cookies and everything else that she did to make our stay more enjoyable.  The hotel was also within walking distance of the attractions we were interested in (War Room, London Eye, Buckingham Palace).  Rooms were stylish, clean and nicely appointed.  We will definitely be back to stay here again.",5,2018,08,30
121,Laziest Taj staff ever!,"From all the Taj properties that I have stayed in, this one definitely doesn’t even come close to their standards. While the location of the hotel is fantastic and the rooms are spacious enough, the housekeeping staff is one of the laziest I’ve ever come across. We stayed for nearly 2 weeks in the hotel and throughout my stay the room was not cleaned properly. The staff was so lazy that they used to just replenish the bathroom essentials and make the bed. No vacuuming, no cleaning the bathroom, etc. On one of the days they didn’t even clear the dirty napkins kept near the coffee table and water bottles were left on the floor. We had to call the manager and were assured that they would get this sorted. It was still not sorted out. The dining plates and glasses from previous night were just left in the room without having them cleaned. I understand that’s the room service job but while cleaning the room the staff could just make a call to room service and have them collect the places. Isn’t that a basic courtesy to a guest? I’ve never faced this issue in any of the other Taj properties but this property in London surely is not just the laziest staff across all Taj properties but probably the most laziest and inefficient staff across all the 5 star properties. Even the room booked was to have a king size bed. To our shock we found out that though the size of the bed was king size, they used two separate single mattresses and covered it up with a bed sheet. It was extremely uncomfortable and despite complaining to the staff they didn’t provide any solution to this except saying that they were overbooked! How is that my problem? If we booked a king bed then we ought to be provided with one! ",2,2018,08,30
121,Well located hotel,Although it is a well situated hotel their check in service was very poor and the quality of room for the price was poorTheir service was responsive and excellent. For the money I expected better rooms ,3,2018,08,30
121,"Great location, nice facilities, friendly and helpful hotel employees","Stay there for 8 nights with my families. Very good experience. Walking distance to quite some tourist attractions and nice restaurant, convenience stores, supermarket, stores for shopping. BTW, conceige helped me with the stamps for my postcards, saving me a lot of troubles.",5,2018,08,30
121,An excellent and central hotel,"We stayed 7 nights (July 24 to 31, 2018) at this nice and luxury hotel situated on Buckingham Gate, close from everything (Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, Westminster, etc.). The room (754) on the seventh floor was not very large but very clean and up to date with a very comfortable king bed. The modern bathroom includes a large walk-in shower. The personnel at the reception was very polite. The concierge was very kind, efficient and helpful for information and reservations (excursions, restaurants, transfer to the airport, boarding passes). The breakfast was particularly good :  fresh orange juice, various fruits, delicious scrambled eggs, cereals, bacon, cold meats, cheese, yogourt, pastries, bread, coffee. We could also order very good porridge with berries, toasts or omelets. We had dinner at two restaurants of the hotel : Bistro and Bank. The food at Bank Restaurant was excellent, the service was very good and we had a nice view on the courtyard. We recommend without hesitation this good hotel to spend a few days in London.",4,2018,08,28
121,Excellent Services,Great stay at the hotel. Beautifully decorated and excellent staff.  Customer service was very professional and easy to access. I would definitely book them again when I plan to head back to London. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. ,5,2018,08,28
121,Good service but a little worn,We stayed at the hotel for 2 days In August. When we arrived there was something spilled and wet on the carpet that we stepped in. The room otherwise was clean but worn. The bathroom heated towel rack did not work. The air conditioning was also not working but a phone call to the front desk had that fixed quickly. It was hot so we were vary happy about that. The concierge desk was extremely helpful. All in all it was not a bad stay.,3,2018,08,27
121,Wedding in London,"I have never been in a hotel where the staff went way above themselves to make  my daughter and I feel special.
Everyone from front desk, housekeeping, breakfast staff and manager for the hotel were outstanding.",5,2018,08,27
121,Highly Recommended,"Like every other Taj Hotel we've visited, St. James Court is immaculate, perfectly decorated, well maintained, modern and a delight to stay in. This hotel is about 100 yards from Buckingham Palace and the entrance to St. James Park, which I believe is  one of the loveliest in London. The hotel lobby and bar are comparatively modest. Each night we stayed there was a small band playing different styles of music in the lobby. My favorite was a 3 piece jazz band that included an excellent pianist and double bass. (My brother-in-law is a drummer, so I am forbidden to editorialize on drumming skills.) Service was friendly and quite professional. Our room was very comfortable, the king bed perfect and the linens and towels second to none. We ate one meal in the hotel's Bistro which my wife and I felt was excellent, reasonably price with a good wine list. Also in the hotel is home to a Michelin starred Indian restaurant, Quilon, which we must visit on our next stay.
We found the prices quite reasonable despite the property advertising itself as ""posh"" and ""luxury,"" which by any standard it certainly is. 
Lovely to view, great to stay. We will return. Highly recommended. ",5,2018,08,27
121,Always enjoyable!,This was our 3rd time staying at St. James' Court and once again it was wonderful. The renovated rooms were gorgeous and breakfast in the bistro was very good.  Would stay again if/when we return to London.,5,2018,08,25
121,"Very good, not great","The location is great, the bed is great, the water pressure and bath robes if you're into those things (ie, my wife...) are great. 

But small annoying things as well: we asked, and paid for, a family room but got a regular room with hardly enough space for a baby cot. Also, the cot didn't fold up correctly. Also, two parents with a baby, buggy (stroller) and three suitcases would have appreciated help getting in & out of taxis. 

Nothing dramatic, but not stellar either.",4,2018,08,24
121,"wonderful hotel, location and staff",Having stayed here on a recent business trip I have nothing but praise for this hotel. The staff were excellent the room was immaculate (358) and the food was top notch. I usual stay in the large chain hotels when I come to London on pleasure trips but not anymore! I will definitely be staying here with my wife on our next trip to London. The location was very good it is only a short walk (30 minutes) to Leicester Square but the walk is through the park and down the mall so it such a pleasant end to an evening. if there was any downside it would  be that the hotel bar is quite pricy but apart from that an excellent hotel!,5,2018,08,24
121,Great service and breakfast,"We booked this hotel months in advance because it was in the center of town. It was a good location.  The service was great and the breakfast we paid for in advance was outstanding.  One reason we booked this hotel is they had king beds.  When we got to our room it was small but lovely.  it had been completely redone .  It had American electrical outlets and lots of places to recharge our phones and ipads.it also had an expresso machine we enjoyed.  We realized though it was only a queen bed.  We (along with another couple) asked for a room with a king bed.  They only had one so the other couple took it.  Their room however was in the unremodeled part and although it was bigger than ours very out of date. If you can stand a queen bed I would recommend the new part. When we got home they had mixed up our bill with our friends, but after a call and some emails we got it straightened out.",5,2018,08,23
121,Relaxing in the courtyard while writing this 💗,"This story goes back 12 months- We were booked to go here last year while my wife was on a conference but my mum sadly took ill and passed away peacefully meaning we had to cancel. Taj were unbelievably sympathetic and allowed us to carry forward our booking 12 months and here we are now 12 months later having a delightful dinner near the tranquil fountain in the rear courtyard. Such a beautiful hotel - hard to believe we are in the centre of one of the busiest cities in the world. Brilliantly combines old world charm and elegance with modern comfort and luxury. The staff are exceptionally courteous and can’t do enough to ensure you enjoy your stay. Can’t be faulted 10/10

We will (obviously) be back

121,Excellent location ,"The hotel is in an amazing location just a couple of minutes walk from buckingham palace and within walking distance of London eye and Houses of Parliament. The room we had was slightly disappointing, a couple of the plugs didn’t work, there was a huge crack on the wall beside  the window, there wasn’t much natural light and the room was small with not very much storage space. Also the bin in our room wasn’t emptied for two days which I feel is very poor service from a hotel of this standard. The lobby is beautiful and the staff where pleasant. Because of the brilliant location I would stay again. ",3,2018,08,22
121,Living like royals,"This was my first time staying at a hotel with this standard and concierge-service, and it was awesome!
It was clean and the beds were comfortable. It lays in a quite street, so had no problem sleeping - a big plus.
It was within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Westminster Abby +++ very central!
The lobby had a nice atmosphere, with music and luxury furniture, great place to relax and drink a few drinks.
The staff was polite, nice and welcoming.
We did not try the breakfast, but will certaintly do that next time. I´ll bet it´s very good!

All in all we had a fantastic stay, and would highly recommend this hotel :)",5,2018,08,21
121,Always superb,"Great staff, great location and stunning setting. Always well looked after here, and the rooms are big (by London standards) and wonderfully appointed - especially those recently renovated. The hotel is continually improving.",5,2018,08,20
121,Highly Recommend ,"St James Court Taj Hotel
Very happy with our choice to stay at this hotel. We stayed for six nights and hound it excellent.
Very conveniently located near Buckingham Palace and Westminster. Beautiful grand hotel with excellent service from Front Desk to Restaurant and Housekeeping.
We only dinner in once at The Bistro and the service was fantastic from Esther and the food lovely. Our room was very comfortable and quiet and the courtyard pretty.
We were able to walk to many attractions and tube stations and found great pubs and cafes near by.
Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,08,20
121,Centrally located with beautiful courtyard ,We stayed in a family suite and the rooms were great in terms of setup. Though the room was new it lacked the size of the TV which was very small. The reception area and the bar are nice to be and pass by. Check out the courtyard behind and the restaurants run by them. ,4,2018,08,19
121,5 star service and property in london,"Everything was great!!! The staff was very kind, useful, helpful, with sincere interest in our satisfaction, the service was impeccable, always greeting with smile, all of them. The location of the hotel is awesome. I will mention some names as example of the superb workers which I have contact with, Diego at the front, the concierge who assisted us with tickets for my daughter, Miriam at the front desk who double made sure the room was what we needed, the restaurant manager Yonos and his staff who always accommodate our requests. Our room was immaculate everyday, housekeeping did just Perfect!!!... our stay was simply delightful. Thank you so much",5,2018,08,19
121,"Old Charm, Great Location and lovely Breakfast!","One of the oldest hotels in London, St James Court Taj, is a charming hotel to stay in. The front desk staff is courteous and efficient. We had an issue with one of our rooms - we booked a room for 3, but booking.com didn't inform the hotel of the same - The gentleman at the front desk was helpful in sorting the situation out for us at no extra charge. 
The breakfast spread is lovely, with lots of options in breads, cheese, Eggs and of course piping hot idli sambar!!
The only drawback is that the rooms are very small and theres absolutely no view to talk about. Infact we had a wall in front of our room making it claustrophobic and that was kind of disappointing.",4,2018,08,19
121,Spoil yourself,"The St James Hotel is in a fantastic location with easy access to Buckingham Palace and its environs, Westminster and all of its attractions plus Victoria Street with it's shops, eateries and banks. The hotel is an historic building built around a central courtyard which is beautifully laid out with gardens and pathways.
Rooms are old but modernised to a good standard and quite a bit of renovation is taking place in some sections of the hotel.
Breakfast was very good and the room becomes a restaurant at night. there is also a Michelin Star restaurant attached tot eh premises if you would like to spoil yourself.",5,2018,08,17
121,"Amazing Services, Upholding The brand Values & Value for Money.","Taj Doesn't Need Any Review Or Feedback Services Yet Providing Them Is Always Out Of Happiness They Provided By Making That My Stay Would Be Comfortable. Courteous Staff, Concierge Was   Extremely Extremely Helpful. We Had An Early Checkout, They Made Sure that We Would Be Provided With A Breakfast For Our Journey (Although We did Not Carry The Full Contents, due To Luggage, But Yes Extremely Helpful when There's A Child Involved) Breakfast Was Nice And The Staff Made Sure That Once we Get Seated We didnt Have To Move to Do Tit Bits Like Tea Or Reorder.

121,Love the Central London Experience,This is the most wonderful hotel experience in a long while. Great!

121,"Best Birthday ever, London July 2018",Beautiful luxury hotel with very nice staff and excellent service.  Complimentary hot  breakfast bar every morning was very nice and convenient.  Loved that it was within walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the London Eye. ,5,2018,08,16
121,Fantastic stay! Outstanding service!!,"We had a very memorable stay at St. James Court. Although our room didn't have a great view and overlooked construction, the staff with their outstanding service more than made up for it. The room was well appointed and comfortable. The bathroom was a tad small but well stocked, clean and everything worked. The location is excellent and walking distance to all central London attractions. The restaurants on property are also very good. The hotel staff and service was simply outstanding. I would like to call out Benny at Quilon for his excellent hospitality and service as well as Mateo and Svilen at the Hampton Bar. The live jazz in the lobby by artist Ed Bentley was also excellent. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to London.",5,2018,08,15
121,Historical Hotel,"i was there for 3 nights. i like the reception employees they were very nice and friendly, the bistro restaurant was great. despite some of the furniture look old but the bed was very comfy and  u feel like u dont wanna leave it !i am not sure about the safety in the hotel since any one can enter and go directly to the elevators !",4,2018,08,15
121,"Location, Rooms and Food","The location of this hotel is extremely good. Central to London and just around from Buckingham Palace and St. James’ Park. The tube too is easily accessible from the hotel.

The rooms are well appointed but a trifle smaller than I would have liked. I understand the rooms are being refurbished, but did face any issues or noises at all.

Had booked with a breakfast package and that worked out well for us. Spent 3 mornings leisurely enjoying well cooked eggs and other assorted breads. Ate meals at 
Quilon and Bombay Brasserie but preferred the latter.",5,2018,08,14
121,Good Experience,Over all  it was a very good experience. It was both business & leisure trip with my family. Location wise good as it is near to James's Park Underground tube station so travelling was very easy.  Walking down to Buckingham gate.,4,2018,08,14
121,Be very careful,"We booked the Classic master Suite for our recent stay in London. It was my wife's birthday and we paid the top price for the best room they had. We arrived from Australia and was placed in what they called a Junior Suite. The Junior Suite is half the size of the room we booked and was basically just a normal hotel room. We complained to the front desk that the room they had given us was not what we had booked and paid for, and the desk clerk had the gall to tell us we had been ""upgraded"".
We asked to speak to the Manager on Duty and a very pleasant lady agreed that the room type was not what we had booked, but could not put us into the pre booked room, because it was just not available. We finally had to settle for another Junior Suite, and a very small compensation was offered for the inconvenience.
By the way, the pictures on their web site must have been taken some time ago, because all the room we looked at looking nothing their web pictures.",2,2018,08,13
121,excellent,"great service. friendly staff. excellent location - walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Churchill war rooms.

121,Truly Taj,"Amazing hotel very close to Buckingham palace. The service and food was exceptional ,exactly as you would expect of a typical Taj property. All the staff from the front desk, bellboys and servers were very helpful. The courtyard area was a good place to have a drink in the evening. Got a room close to the elevator as requested because my wife was pregnant. Got upgraded to the executive room on arrival which was a good gesture. The free wifi speed was very good as compared to other hotels.
Had an amazing 8 nights. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,13
121,Best Hotel we ever  Stayed!,"Very warm people who work here that make us want to come back. 
Good locations, 5 minutes walking distance to St James Court underground/tube/train station, 2 starbucks stores and to Buckingham Palace. 
Clean, spacious room (We booked a Suite room) with an extra bed for a child.",5,2018,08,12
121,An excellent hotel close to all facilities,"St. James court, A Taj hotel is an excellent hotel close to tourist attractions and public transport. The customer service is excellent. The breakfast had good variety and is available from 6 am onwards. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a centrally located hotel with all facilities close to public transport.",5,2018,08,12
121,Central Hotel,Great position  Friendly and helpful staff A little expensive but worth it for the position just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and within walking distance to Big Ben and the London eye. Hop on Hop off bus a great way to get around,4,2018,08,11
121,Excellent hotel with fantastic service ,"My wife visit at the hotel with my young daughter
All the hotel staff Were phenomenal. They were very kind and helpful

They gave them an early check-in. 

The restaurants were very nice
They accommodated our  vegetarian choices and even have my daughter a half portion . 

My daughter, threw up in the room. Within an hour, they had the entire room cleaned

Kuddoos to them !!!!

My wife injured Her foot ( trying to get down from an Uber cab]
The manager - Sarah was very helpful.
She helped get her ice, compression bandage
Everyone was very courteous
Even the bellboy and concierge help my wife get around with her broken foot

We will definitely stay in this hotel, when we come back to London

I would strongly recommend staying at this hotel
It is very convenient for traveling and has a great location",5,2018,08,09
121,Great location and hospitality,"This was my first stay at this hotel and I wasnt sure what to expect. As the heading suggests, the location is walking distance from the Buckingham Palace main entrance and all the attractions around it.

I was in a renovated room, which turned out to be a junior suite with its own powder bathroom. The room was excellent - spacious, clean and well appointed. The wing where I was located was undergoing external renovation, so the windows were sealed and I didnt get a view. However the room itself was well lit and didnt feel claustrophobic. 

Do walk around the hotel, as there is a beautiful courtyard to sit in and the two bars are great. I would recommend a meal at the Quilon, as it was excellent!

The hotel service is friendly and efficient. My only grouse (and the reason why its a 4 star review) is the breakfast service. The place was crowded during the two days that I walked in, despite trying to beat the morning rush. Seating felt packed and didn't allow for a leisurely coffee.",4,2018,08,09
121,Great Stay,"We spent a long weekend in London at the Taj St James and it fit the bill perfectly.  We arrived late at night and were met with a room upgrade to a renovated double, with a cot made up as requested for our daughter.  The room was beautiful and spacious by London standards.  The bathroom was gorgeous with wonderful tub/shower.  London was having a heat wave but the Taj's AC was amazing!  A bit of a long walk to our room from the elevator - with quirky sets of steps along the way - but worth it to have a quiet room facing the back.  Staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Great WiFi.  Great location - a little quiet but a nice walk to Buckingham Palace area and St James Park of course! Victoria station not too far.  We also walked back from Piccadilly.",4,2018,08,08
121,"Very central location, excellent staff","We enjoyed the hotel, we were staying 4 nights for holidays and the location was ideal to visit the main attractions in London with easy access to the tube and theatre.
We had a junior suite which was very nice and cleanliness etc was great. The only issue is there was no walk in shower and the bath is narrow and can be dangerous to get in and out of if you use the shower over the bath.",4,2018,08,07
121,Rip off doorman,"I asked for a taxi to the airport ,doorman told me it would be much cheaper if I use one of the hotel cars, driver demanded £80 when we got to Heathrow, when the black cab from the airport charged £60, the driver of the car told me he has to give the doorman £20., Should have just stuck to a taxi ! Not a nice ending to an otherwise nice trip to london. You don't expect to be conned by a doorman in a quality hotel such as the taj, avoid these cheap crooks.",1,2018,08,07
121,First rate Indian hospitality in London,"The hotel retains the extraordinary service and hospitality that the chain is noted for in India. It is friendly and efficient without being obsequious. It is spotlessly clean, with large rooms, good bathroom facilities, comfortable beds, and above all had more than adequate air conditioning for a hot and humid London. Convenient to Underground.",5,2018,08,07
121,A real 5 star hotel,"We found that we needed accommodation on short notice and decided to try the TAJ  St. James Court Hotel as we had enjoyed staying with them in India.They showed us a choice of rooms and we found one to suit our needs. All the staff were kind, friendly and helpful and assisted us in every way. As London is in a heat wave,we slept well due to the air conditioning.We had a great breakfast with anything you wanted and help with our electronic devices in the Business centre.
They are relatively expensive, however, they deliver superb service.",5,2018,08,07
121,St. James Court,"The hotel is lovely, and the great majority of the staff go out of their way to be helpful and kind.  I would not order food at the hotel's Hampton Bar again, but the cocktail offerings are terrific.  Teh concierge staff is stellar.",5,2018,08,07
121,Service Great - Rooms Dated - Location solid,"I would love to give this property a 4/5 star review.  However, I can't!  The hotel staff is very friendly and 5 star indeed.  The breakfast is simple, albeit good.  A small buffet and a menu to select various options.  The location is within walking distance - 10 minutes - to many attractions.  The metro is about 5 minutes walk.  I used Uber to return to the Heathrow and it was very convenient and about 25 euros.  The room itself is quite dated and definitely needs to be refurbished.  The bed was soft and terribly uncomfortable.  The bathrooms old and more like a holiday inn!  Wifi worked great.

I would stay here again, however for nearly 300 euros, I would look elsewhere.",3,2018,08,07
121,Great Hotel,"We had wonderful time at this hotel. Great location, very close to Victoria Station and minutes walking from Buckingham Palace. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, with an electric kettle and complementary tea and coffee.

Also, there are three other top restaurants serving different foods.",5,2018,08,07
121,Relaxing Getaway,"Celebrated 20th wedding anniversary in London. Struck by how lovely the main lobby is. Quite different from the exterior. Great location—near Buckingham Palace.

Our room was 641 very large with large double bed, table and two easy chairs, settee, dressing table, drinks cabinet, fridge and large bathroom. Excellent view over the courtyard. The hotel was beautiful with courtyard and outside tables. We were on our Golden Wedding and they couldn't have been more accommodating providing a special breakfast in their adjoining hotel in a private room on the ""wedding day""
St. James Court is situated near Buckingham Palace and St. James Park tube station",5,2018,08,06
121,Perfect spot,"This is a beautiful place to stay.  My room was very nice. High ceilings, comfortable beds and an electric kettle with tea and coffee were nice features. Restaurants in the hotel were very good.  I recommend getting a reservation for Bank.  The breakfast buffet at The Bistro was unique and interesting.  You are just a 5 min walk from Buckingham Palace and can access the Underground nearby.  Several of London’s other attractions are accessible on foot from St. James Court.  There is also a convince store just two doors down and a shopping center is within walking distance as well as several pubs.  Check out the Adam & Eve and Greencoat Boy.  Staff were friendly and always ready to serve.  The stay was expensive but this is a full service hotel after all.  Picture is of the courtyard in fish-eye view.",5,2018,08,06

121,"Comfortable hotel, excellent food and customer service","Thank you Taj team (especially Beata) for the excellent hospitality. Food is delicious, rooms are new, clean and comfortable to stay in! The staff do everything possible to make the stay as comfortable as possible. Please keep up the good work!",5,2018,08,03
121,Great hotel in great location,"This hotel is located close to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. The Victoria line links up with Tottenham Hale which is served by the Standsted express. We stayed here for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were very clean, we had one of the newly refurbished rooms. The breakfast was very nice, with a great selection on offer. I would definitely come back here.",5,2018,08,03
121,Centrally located hotel,"This hotel is less than 10 minutes from Victoria Station. Great access to shopping areas ,restaurants and eateries.
Hotel is clean, has warm ambiance and helpful staff.
Breakfast is excellent with a variety of English and Asian dishes. 
I plan to stay there again.",5,2018,08,02
121,Great Location and good hotel,I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions. Last year my husband and I stayed at this hotel once again. The hotel is close to Buckingham Palace and many other sights seeing places. There is a good Indian restaurant which is next to it in case you are craving for the Indian Food. The rooms are bit small in size.,4,2018,08,02
121,Not Taj standard,I would say this is a nice hotel in a fantastic location but the standard of service and some of the rooms are not as good as they could be. This could be on par with other hotels in the group but some of the staff let it down. Their customer service skills are poor for example at breakfast asking for a black coffee and being ignored. In the bar being accused of not paying for drinks. The rooms could be cleaner and updated. It just doesn't give out the buzz of a good hotel.,4,2018,08,02
121,Great Hotel? Surely. Taj Quality It's Not,"Stayed in this hotel last month. Was unpleasantly surprised to discover that no one at the service desk didn't warn me about construction that was going on the same floor. Some parts of the hotel looked worn out (carpet, rooms,, elevators). I was expecting much more from the Taj-branded property",4,2018,08,01
121,Royal Hospitality ,We were upgraded at check in to a 1 bedroom suite which was very nice.  The rooms were small but I think that is London.  Breakfast buffet was included with our reservation and good variety.  The front desk and Bistro staff were very accommodating and friendly.  Nice shaded courtyard for drinks and light dining.  Just down the street from Buckingham Palace.  Near Victoria Station and walkable but we chose to take taxi due to the unusually high heat.  Large business center if you need it.   We would stay here again.  ,5,2018,08,01
121,UK trip starts in London. Central location,"Great location for getting to most common tourist spots. Very very close to Buckingham palace.
Onsite restaurants available. I recommend Bank. Good pricing for London.
Cafes around area open business days. Weekends not so much 
CBD area very busy Mon- Fri
Executive double room - in renovated section was good, would not like old section myself.
Room 655 down back is a long way from lifts.",4,2018,07,28
121,A Palace Hotel in London Town,"This historic property is exceptional by any standard: service that would suit the most demanding duke and duchess, comfortable public rooms in traditional English style, a variety of restaurants and bars and classy, thoughtful management by the Mumbai-based Taj Hotel group. My very large accessable room featured a view of the interior patio where meals and drinks are served, a king-size bed and, in the bath, both a fully-equipped tub and separate shower. Bank Westminster, a turquoise and white aquarium affair in which I enjoyed dinner during two recent stays, looks out  on the fountain patio and offers memorable service and food, including a pre-rush-hour, reduced price menu. Quilon, a Michelin-starred South Indian restaurant, and The Bistro, a cafe, round out the dining offerings. My favorite breakfast dish at the latter, the spicy masala omelet, is a delightful taste of the Raj. Service by the concierge staff, bell men and door men is  tip top. The hotel is entirely non-smoking and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. ",5,2018,07,27
121,Excellent!,"Great service and staff was very pleasant. Awesome location and we loved the Sherlock Holmes Afternoon Tea. We were pampered from start to finish. Would definitely recommend this hotel for comfort, location and enjoyment. ",5,2018,07,25
121,A bad mistake," We thought this would be a nice refurbished older hotel. The refurbishment turned out to be “half done”. Our room had plumbing fixtures with handles falling off & a shower that did not operate properly and generally poor workmanship. The door on the bathroom was filthy with hand marks and chipped worn paint on the bottom .
 It would be “polite” to say it was overpriced. ",1,2018,07,25
121,Fantastic mother/daughter stay,"My 17 year-old daughter and I stayed for a week and had a wonderful time at this very well-located hotel in London.  The room was very spacious—especially for European hotels and was very well-appointed.  The staff was fabulous and always accommodating making check-in and check-out fast and easy.
As New Yorkers, we love to walk and the hotel is centrally located close to virtually everything.  Cabs are readily available Victoria station is 5 minutes away and there is also a local tube station even closer.  The neighborhood is lovely and there are numerous places to have breakfast and lunch across the street.
We would absolutely stay here again.  Everything was terrific.",5,2018,07,24
121,Not as good as I remember it.,"Stayed a weekend here with breakfast and it was an average stay.  Exceptional staff who were all very friendly and seemed eager to please.

The reception area looks immaculate but once you venture into the hotel to locate your room, the corridors appear very run down with worn carpets, chipped woodwork, and it all looks like it needs a makeover.

Room was a classic double overlooking a building site which proceeded to start work about 0730 on Saturday morning.  Duty manager offered to move us to a quieter room but as we had only one night remaining seemed pointless.  Nice gesture nonetheless.

Breakfast was a nice selection with eggs made to order as required.  Nice variety and all seemed to be hot.  As other contributors have pointed out, the room is far to small to cope with the number of guests, and queues formed in reception of guests waiting for a table for breakfast.

No ice machines and we were not allowed to take an ice bucket with ice from the bar, but had to order from room service.  Also friends wanted to arrange a bottle of champagne (paid for) to be available in our room on the Saturday, but they were told that the hotel was unable to do this?  Very odd, and a little disappointing.

Would I stay again?  For the location and staff, yes, but it would have to be an exceptional deal.",3,2018,07,23
121,Good with a few quirks ,"Generally speaking we loved this hotel!  I would not hesitate to recommend it.  We were a family of 5, 3 grown sons who shared a room and my husband and myself.  Check in was quite frustrating.  They did not offer early check-in (we arrived at 8AM) but did take our luggage.  We burned time until 2 PM when they said at least one room would be ready.  When we returned at 2PM they still weren’t ready and we finally were able to check into one room at 2:30, and the other wasn’t ready until 3:30.  After being up all night on an airplane, that was a bit rough.  The boys room was plenty big enough for 3 twin beds, and ours was spacious as well with a king bed.  Plenty of closet space, iron, ironing board, 2 white robes, slippers and safe.  The mini fridge was unusual in that it was completely empty.  Every day they left a bottled water by the bed, complimentary.  Outlets were plentiful and different kinds, including a USA outlet.  I was able to plug in my hairdryer from France without any kind of adapter, and there is a USB charger as well.  (Note: they provide hairdryers, I just prefer my own).  Bath towels were the large bath sheet, fluffy white variety, and they had heated towel racks.  Shower had decent water pressure, although I will say some of the grout could’ve benefited from a good scrub with bleach, but it was only in a couple of places and not bad—I have definitely seen way worse for sure.  They also provided toiletries, although the housekeeper left 2 tubes of bath gel (in addition to bar soap), then took them on day 2, and I had to ask for them back.  For some reason they make the beds without a top sheet which is strange but maybe that’s British Standard?  We did not eat in the restaurant, because breakfasts were 22£/pp, and you can’t order individual items off the menu.  For someone who eats oatmeal/porridge for breakfast that’s a bit much.  Take the deal when booking that includes breakfast, probably worth it.  There are plenty of restaurants very close, so it was not a problem.  For other meals we were always out so didn’t have opportunity to eat dinner or lunch there.  The location is brilliant.  The St. James UG stop is close, as well as the Victoria Station, and Buckingham Palace and Saint James Park are 5 minutes away.  Concierge Service was good as well, we booked 2 tours through them, and got advice on locations of attractions and UG.  Tons of places to eat very close—be warned though, a good number of them wanted reservations for Dinner.  I consider this hotel pricey, but for the location and type of hotel not out of the norm for London, and believe me I looked at every neighborhood, and a ton of hotels.

121,Worst club sandwich ever,"This review relates to a business lunch in the courtyard with clients staying at the hotel. The staff were excellent and I cannot fault the service. However, the £16 vegetarian club sandwich was three massive slabs of bread (nothing special) with some dull roasted veg and one thin slice of processed flavor-free cheese approximately 2 inches by 1.5 inches. The overall sandwich was about 6 inches by 4 inches by 3 inches plus high. 95% of that was bread. The filling was fairly flavor-free overall and didn’t stand a chance against all that bread. Some of the others had the regular club sandwich, which seemed more interesting on the filling side, but still with half a large loaf of bread. All I can say is, don’t have the club sandwich!",2,2018,07,22
121,Residential section much better that main hotel,"The residential section has much better standard, good service, welcoming staff and better facilities. The main hotel is very busy and the staff seems to be running around every where. Breakfast is OK and the staff in Bistro are not properly trained",3,2018,07,22
121,Never again.,"This is a decent hotel but by no means 4 stars as indicated by its reviews or its price point. It is generally fairly clean, but some public toilets don't flush, the shower in the room was small and mildewed, the mattress was musty (as were the feather pillows) and ancient with a dip in the middle, and the wait staff are unaccomodating and inattentive. One night that didn't appear to be particularly busy and with four men on staff, we sat in the garden for 15 minutes before we were able to get a server’s attention whilst two other tables who sat down after us received even worse service. Another night, after getting out of a play later in the evening, we watched a boy eat a pizza that had been served not five minutes before, and the waitress refused to even ask the kitchen to make one for my son, because it was not on the night menu. I asked, “could we get a pizza?” and she snippily replied, “is it on the night menu?” I asked politely if she could request one from the kitchen (given they had baked one just moments before), and she replied that if she did that for us, she’d have to do it for everyone. Five or even four star service?  I think not.  Wondering what a Michelin Star even means anymore, if anything. We will never stay at a Taj hotel again.",2,2018,07,21
121,Excellent Staff and Amazing Location ,"We had the perfect last day in London at St. James Court! The whole atmosphere, food and drinks were amazing!!! What a safe haven from the city hustle and bustle. The staff was fabulous and Serhan took such good care of us!!!! ",5,2018,07,20
121,brilliant stay,"The hotel has fantastic connectivity all over London, due to it's location. Hotel staff is jovial, welcoming as well as obliging.  No doubt, this is one of the finest of hotels.  I highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2018,07,17
121,Excellent hotel,"Excellent location in Victoria / Westminster area. First class hotel, stylish and elegant. Bank restaurant at the hotel has good menu; room service first rate - best I have eaten in a long time. from checking in; to out you are treated just as you would expect to be treaed - in the best possible way. ",5,2018,07,17
121,Four Nights,"We spent four nights here from the 21st-25th of May, 2018. The hotel is very close to Victoria Rail and Victoria Coach terminals. We were within 3 blocks of Buckingham Palace and the Royal Parks. 
We found the staff very helpful and friendly. Our room spacious and had a very comfortable king seized bed. The bathroom was somewhat dated and had poor lighting.

The weight room was under construction but the hotel used two seperate rooms to temporarily house their cardio and free weight equipment. This equipemnt was in very good condition and the rooms were not too busy. The room with the carido equipment also had fresh fruit in it.

We opted from breakfast being included when we booked the hotel and we were glad we did this. The breakfast buffet was pretty good with a nice variety. The staff working in this area were very friendly and efficent.  

The hotel is within walking distance of many landmarks. We often walked instead of taking the Tube as the weather was perfect. There are a few pubs closeby and a nice coffee shop across the stree that is open till 10pm. The area seemed fairly safe as we often walked back to our room close to midnight and had no issues.",4,2018,07,15
121,Excellent concierge service,"We visited London last week and stayed there for 6 nights. Mathew and Danielle of Concierge teams were helpful and knowledgable.

👍👍👍👍👍

London is good. It takes 2 mins walk to Buckingham Palace. Pizza restaurant Franco Manca (around 6 mins walk, recommended by Danielle) is good value for money. ",4,2018,07,15
121,Conference,"Attended the hotel as a delegate at a Conference.

Door staff were smart and very professional, helped me wity taxi's.

Reception staff not very helpful, I clearly needed to use a lift as I was using a walking stick and had luggage but when I asked for directions they directed me to a staircase which was at the opposite end to the reception/lounge area to the lift.

When I arrived at the room for the conference the door had been blocked by a temporary barrier which I struggled to negotiate and then open the very heavy door. NOT DISABLED FRIENDLY!

The room allocated was adequate for the conference needs but rather stuffy and hot and not enough bottled water provided.

The food and beverage provided was OK but the finger sandwiches were dry and weren't labelled for filling content or food intolerances.

Despite my clear difficulties with the heavy door and temporary barrier near the lift at the start of the day (again at the opposite end to the main entrance of the conference room) the barrier hadn't been removed so I had the same undignified exit trying to juggle walking stick and luggage. I would have thought this issue would also be a fire safety hazard!

Nice building, smartly turned out staff but sadly lacking in customer service.",3,2018,07,15
121,Amazing property and staff,"The best hotel in London to stay. Excellent property very close to Buckingham Palace, walking distance from the high street and tube station. The property is superbly built with all the modern facilities. The only thing I missed was the pool as this property doesn't have one. I ave four star for service because the receptionist charged me for late checkout at 4 pm. I am Taj innercircle member and a regular guest of Taj and as a courtsey they should not have charged me for that as most hotels would not.  ",5,2018,07,14
121,Poor Concierge Help,"Left a bag on the plane. We asked the concierge 4 days in a row for help. All were very nice but one, but none of them really bothered taking it too serious to help us. When I approached one, he said, ""I am very busy with lots of customers and will do what I can.  It really depends how many customers I have to help today.""  I AM CUSTOMER!  The hotel was acceptable, but the service when I really needed it the most wasn't there.  I am extremely disappointed.  The worse part besides getting zero help was when the airline actually reported our bag the same day to their website where the concierges said they were looking for us.  The only other issue with the hotel was our kids room had NO AC the 5 days we stayed there....not good when in July!",1,2018,07,14
121,Tajness Missing,"New Rooms are good but if you are used to have Taj Service, you may be disappointed.  Need more options in Breakfast for Vegetarian people like me.  Some of the staff members were very happy to help  but not all are same.  ",3,2018,07,14
121,Excellent Breakfast,"We had the pleasure of staying at the St James Court Hotel for 5 nights, we booked an Executive Junior Suite, however upon check in we were graciously upgraded to one of their brand new Premium Studio Suites on the 8th floor. 
The upgraded room was very clean, modern and beautiful, however it was a journey in itself getting to the room, as this was a new floor of the hotel no lifts went there and we had to catch a lift to floor seven and then zig zag through hallways and walk up a small flight of stairs (we would’ve gotten lost had the check in assistant not shown us there). However as soon as we arrived in the room we noticed the loud constructions noises going on what seemed like right next to us (renovations were meant to be completed May 2018, but now expected late July 2018). We immediately told the check in assistant that we would prefer a different room not near construction as we usually spend a bit more time in our room due to working remotely, to which they said they would look into it for us. After about 10 minutes waiting in the room listening to more drilling and hammering noises we called check in desk to see what was happening and the assistant said they would check and let us know, another 10 minutes passed and we called again to which they said they had upgraded our room from executive to premium and another room wouldn’t be as nice or new, I explained that was fine as we knew the room type we booked and the Executive room was still meant to be a renovated room. The assistant then explained that there was only one room type of ours available and it was currently occupied by someone who was checking out late at 3.30pm so the room wouldn’t be cleaned and available to us until about 5pm (check in time is 3pm). So we agreed to wait as we definitely wanted to change rooms. 

The Executive Junior Suite was much closer to what we expected, with a bedroom, separate lounge room with desk, closet/walk in robe, and bathroom, so a much bigger room (the premium was a studio room) however I’m not sure how long ago the “renovations” were done but it didn’t seem like it was done recently with the room being a bit dated but still nice. 

The gym is also currently being renovated so it’s just in a small room for weights and a separate small room for cardio, so not very impressive but still usable and better than nothing with basic weights and equipment. 

We loved the breakfast buffet, the sugared donuts were amazing, definitely worth a try. The staff even let us pop back in around 11am (we were usually there at 6am to have breakfast due to jet lag) to grab a baguette and some cheese and ham and we would then leave and take it with us for lunch on the go, not sure if this is totally allowed though but they were very hospitable and even provided us with a takeaway container for our baguette one day. There was a section for pastries, croissants, sweet danishes, baguettes, rolls, chocolate croissants, muffins, and donuts. A hot selection section, but you could also order some hot items and toast from the chef, which included sausages, bacon, mushrooms, tomato, baked beans, and an Indian dish, etc. Continental options also included cereals, fruit, cheeses and cold meats. 
The Michelin star restaurant connected to the Hotel, the Quinlon, is incredible. Absolutely a must visit during your stay, the service there is impeccable and the food absolutely divine. 
Overall, a lovely stay, close to everything, great service and staff are all incredibly helpful and want to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

121,Good business hotel,"I’ve stayed here about a dozen times now. Good location, good rooms, expensive bar and restaurant. Staff are always polite and helpful. Mostly full of people working or wealthy tourists. I’ve only eaten breakfast in the restaurant which is good (and they will cook eggs etc to order). Not eaten there for dinner but, in this location it’s better to walk about and find something. ",4,2018,07,11

121,Lovely hotel with very helpful staff,We stayed here for the RAF fly past. It is in a superb position and is very comfortable. The bed was lovely and I have a very bad back so it really matters. The room was lovely and very clean. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and as I had requested a walk in shower we were upgraded. I would certainly stay here again.,5,2018,07,11
121,Nice Hotel,"The hotel is very nice albeit a bit expensive for a drink and breakfast, although both are nice indeed. The rooms are spotless & clean and the service is excellent. We will use the hotel again in the future for sure.",4,2018,07,11
121,Pleasant Family Stay at Centrally Located Hotel,"My family and I, two adults and three children, recently had a pleasant stay at this hotel for vacation.  We had gone on a 12-night cruise out of Southampton and decided to stay here an extra five nights on vacation to explore London.  This was a beautiful hotel centrally located between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey/Parliament.  The rooms were nice, the breakfast was good, the concierge was helpful, and the staff was pleasant and attentive.  The hotel was a little one off at times, for example we could not get adjoining rooms (although initially confirmed for it), but the issues were minor and did not interfere with what was a very pleasant stay.  My kids particularly loved the hotel because it was fairly luxurious yet not too stuffy (as can be sometimes occur in some of the higher end business hotels).  I highly recommend this place for any family looking to stay at a nice hotel in London which is centrally located to the sights but not in the insanely touristy areas of Piccadilly or Leicester.  Anyone looking to book this hotel for vacation should also do so well ahead of time.  We booked our rooms eight months prior to our stay.",5,2018,07,10
121,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed recently in a King size room. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean. We had the breakfast package, which I recommend, food was delicious. And not just breakfast, had dinner through the bar one night. Very good pizza. What the made the stay great--- their staff. I wish I could remember their names so I could give them each a shout out. From the front desk to the doormen to the waiters everyone was super nice. The only problem we had was one night ordered room service. 2 hrs later they brought the food. I quite frankly had figured they forgot about us so as it was getting late when we ordered anyway. The waiter was very nice even when I sent back the food after 2 hrs. Other than that our stay was great!! The hotel is in a great location and easy walking distance to several sites. It also very close to the St James Underground, which we used a lot. They even sent my niece a special birthday treat one night after they found out we were there for her birthday. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,09
121,Good with few bumps in the stay,"Food,service & location are good. Check in with Rukmini was not as smooth as one would anticipate! Had a 4 night stay with breakfast & a 25£ non cumulative credit for some locations in the hotel. Checked in at 6 pm on the 25 th June & was categorically told by the check in staff ( Rukmini ) that I could not use it that evening !! Did not want to argue or create a scene! Ultimately only used the certificate for 3 nights & much to my chagrin as was informed by check out staff that I missed a night for the certificate !! Besides the front desk staff need a little training in how to deal with customers ! Was sent on a wild goose chase from bank to bank regarding old £notes ! I realize the hotel doesn’t accept them but know facts before you send your customers all over the city trying to change them !! No banks change the notes unless you have an account with them 😖so one is really at a loose end especially when trying to pay cash ! ( 2000£ worth) 
The A/C in the hotel was really bad as it was some of the hottest days in London so requested a fan that was promptly brought to me but was inadequate answer for the heat in the room !! 
Service staff at the bistro are very good & so are the room service staff when I ordered ice !! 
I did move hotels half way through my trip on the 29th June to another hotel ( chesterfield ) since I was in London till the 2nd July !",3,2018,07,09
121,Divine Location and food,"This hotel is located right beside St.  James Park,Westminster and Buckingham Palace. One can walk to Trafalgar Square taking the Buckingham Palace route and easily reach the heart of London. Several Buses go from very near the hotel which will take one anywhere.  The underground is a minutes walk from the hotel. A gorgeous hotel,  with Superb service and exceptional food. The breakfast is elaborate and cheerful,  the music in the lobby lounge heart warming in the evenings. The High Tea served here is award winning and a remarkable experience.  Quillon,  the Michelin, starred Indian restaurant is a must. The newly renovated too. S and bathrooms are absolutely great.  A great choice for anyone who wants to enjoy London.",5,2018,07,09
121,Nothing so Taj about St James Court,"It’s always a tough call if one has to write a review about a premium Taj property which falls miserably poor on expectations. That’s what happened with us. During our annual vocations we decided to experiment with different hotel stays in London. We discovered some fascinating hotels but sadly got disappointed by one for which we were so lucky king forward to. Taj St James Court is reasonably well located. It’s very close to Buckingham Palace but to be honest you don’t need to be close the palace everyday unless some have a work to do. To start with it, the property is rather run down in its look and feel. It does give a old world charm but in doing so they have failed to add luxury or what people could call it a “Posh”, which normally is associated with a premium and respected chain such as Taj Group. We booked a classic master suite and paid in advance as well so - such was the excitement to be at Taj St James London. Our suite was probably the most run down room in the entire hotel building. The wall colour behind the TV in the living room is sort of disfigured due to a possible sewage. The TV sets are so small. The picture of a suite just didn’t match with the one we saw at the time of booking. The couch is fitted with rather hard surface and was so in inviting. Bed was comfortable though. Bathroom was spacious but lacked clearly in luxury. The suite was over crowded with furniture which is placed in a least optimised way that made even the 700 so feet of area look so small. The breakfast is average. Thankfully the staff is truly Taj. From front office to the restaurant the staff quality is very good and extremely professional. The duty manager Ms. Sarah did her best to address our concerns. ‭The Indian food at the Bistro was below par. Can’t imagine how Taj could get it wrong. My advice for the amount of money involved, please give it a skip. London is full of amazing options to choose from. My apologies to Taj for being so harsh but honestly Taj St James have badly let us down. ",3,2018,07,09
121,Perfect location,"The location of this hotel is perfect, really close to the palace, houses of parliament, etc. for sightseeing and close to tube. The room we were given was lovely, large twin room with nice bathroom and air con. We added breakfast on which was amazing, so much to choose from and rally good quality!",5,2018,07,08
121,"Great location, be aware of many private events","Great location, nice hotel. Two out of four nights we were there we were unable to use the courtyard due to private events. One of the main reasons we choose this hotel was because of this feature. It was disappointing for sure. Out room had a horrible view of the air conditioning units, which didn't even work on our room one night. They fixed it the next day but it made for an uncomfortable night in 80 degree heat. All in all the hotel was fine but there are certainly better ones in that city. Nothing special other than the location which was great.",4,2018,07,07
121,Great Hotel excellent Location comfortable Rooms,"This is one of the classic Hotels for Indians Especially with the Signature Taj Hospitality is a must  Stay for all Indians and Indian Origin persons in  London.The Indian Food at the Restaurants is Top Class.
Rooms are very Comfortable .Have stayed at this Hotel many times over the last two or three years and found theeplace to be excellent.The highlight of the place is the Hospitality and the Staff.Indians can have Indian Food which is a big advantage for some people who want to  have Indian Food during travel in London .
Location of the Hotel is excellent and a stone's throw away from major attractions like Buckingham Palace and Westminster etc.

However would like to point out some things lacking while our last stay at this Hotel in May,2018 wherein we had made bookings  about 3 months in advance for a couple for a double Room.
We were disappointed with the size of the Rooms which was adequate for 1(one) person only and seem to have been adequate for one person only. We were two of us and there was hardly any space to move around in the Room. There were no side tables provided in the room and there was hardly any space to keep our luggage .After check-in a request was made by us to provide us a better room adequate for two people but we were not given the Room for two  leading to disappointment.
Morale of the Story  is that please check the Rooms which you are staying and hope they don't repeat this again with us regular customers.",4,2018,07,07
121,Great place to stay for 4 nights,"We flew into Heathrow, our transport took us directly to the SJC Taj Hotel, and we explored London from there. This is a very nice hotel, and friendly!  The breakfast was excellent. Our room was spacious, which is hard to find in central London without paying a fortune, and the price was reasonable for London. Wales’s than 5 minutes to Buckingham Palace, easy walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament, and a short walk to the Tube. Excellent in every way!",5,2018,07,07
121,Taking customers for granted ,"The problem with successful hotels like Taj is that they do not care about client loyalty, because they know that even if one doesn’t come back, they will not lose any business as someone else will take their place. 

I have been staying at this hotel for quite regularly, but recently I have started noticing that the first answer to every request is a “No”

I really like this hotel, but I am now having second thoughts about staying here again. ",2,2018,07,07
121,Great boutique hotel in a good location,"We visited with teens ages 16 and 18.  The rooms were nice and clean with good A/C.  The location was excellent.  We felt like we could walk to many of the tourist landmarks, and we could also easily get to the underground.  Uber’s and taxis also operated near the area.

The staff was very nice and accommodating.  The food at the hotel restaurant was great.  

There is not much nightlife around the hotel, which is great if you want quiet, but if you want action, the location is not for you.   

Highly recommended!",5,2018,07,07
121,Great hotel in a great location,"This hotel combines a luxurious and well done décor with a wonderful staff and perfect location.  The hotel is a short walk to Victoria station, Buckingham Palace and Westminster.  The front desk staff are welcoming and efficient.  The concierge is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and the doorman always available.  The only small problem is the maintenance of the rooms: TV would not turn off (we had to unplug it); the toilet kept backing up and the toilet seat was not well attached; very few outlets for electronics and power was not good for charging electronics.",4,2018,07,05
121,NOT HAPPY!!,"We paid (12 months in advance) for a six night stay at ""The Taj"" so we would be centrally located to explore London.

HOW DISAPPOINTED WE WERE!

After a long day of flying we were ready for a good night's sleep. Ruta checked us into Room 233 and our nightmares began.

Firstly the curtain couldn't be closed (hanging from its track) to block out the late setting summer sun and the air conditioner was stuck on heat and wouldn't cool the room. It was a 31 degree day!

The pièce de résistance was the room was over the subway and trains would pound through every TWO minutes!! This lasted until one o'clock in the morning and then began at 4:30am again.

In the morning, we requested a change of room however we were told we would have to put up with the trains and heat for another four nights until another room could be found. 

What was most upsetting, was management knew of the concerns with Room 233 and the staff still allocate that room to guests. Apparently, the noise of the subway can be heard in all rooms on Level 2.

Having paid £1100 for the six nights accommodation, this type of customer service is unacceptable.

We could have cruised from London to Perth  (35 days with a balcony) for £2000!

Common sense did prevail and we were moved to Room 415 that had a working aircon and we couldn't heard the pounding of the subway.

The stay at ""The Taj"" should have been the highlight of our trip. ",2,2018,07,05
121,Excellent Hotel,"Lovely location close to Victoria. Really feels like what it is - a premium, luxury hotel - from the moment of check-in until check out. There's a choice of restaurants too which means if travelling alone on business you can keep everything ""under one roof"" and the twice I dined alone, the staff were so welcoming and impeccable in their manner and service.
The rooms was perfect - good size, well equipped and bed/bedding - the best.
Absolutely nothing not to like.",5,2018,07,05
121,A Great Hotel with a terrific location,"The Taj St James Court combines the Taj Group's traditional hospitality with an old world charm and an outstanding location barely 200 yards from Buckingham Palace. 

It has long snaking corridors reminiscent of old stately buildings and a charm of its own and even though some parts do look dated, it somehow gets absorbed in the quaintness of the property. I was alittle disappointed with the shower ion my room - its of an earlier vintage and not quite as effective as modern showers. 

The  restaurants are outstanding - the Quilon is an old favourite of mine.

The concierge and the front office staff are very helpful and efficient - but as a regular resident at many of the Taj properties in India, the traditional Indian charm is lacking - not that it detracts in any way from the service.",5,2018,07,03
121,Luxury hotel but comfortable for families,"We stayed at the St James Court a week ago. We rolled out of a cab after a long overnight flight from the U.S. and a layover in Portugal. I was worried about our casual appearance as we had booked the Alice and Wonderland tea right when we arrived. No one bat an eyelash at our appearance. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. They had a  special welcome bag for the kids and personalized cookies at bedtime. We felt welcome in all areas and the family suite accommodations were perfect. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was a decent size and well appointed. The location is central to everything you’d want to see and an underground station was around the corner. I would recommend this hotel to any of our friends and family and hope to return ourselves one day.",5,2018,07,02
121,Great Hotel!,"My first stay at St. James Court A Taj Hotel and we loved it. Nice quiet area of London close to Victoria and St James tube station and just round the corner from Buckingham Palace. Very warm welcome, nice decor in the check in area. The room we had was lovely, recently renovated and very good indeed. Comfy beds, great bathroom, very good shower. Very well designed room with lots of plugs which is very helpful.
After a night out we had a lovely drink and snacks on our return to the hotel.  Breakfast also very good indeed but be warned it does get very busy so try to avoid busy times.

All the staff we dealt with were so friendly and helpful and made you feel very special. Also a lovely courtyard at the back of the hotel which is very pleasent for drinks and snacks.

Fully Recommended! A Hidden Gem!",5,2018,07,01
121,"Second Visit in a year, great hotel","This was our second visit in a year to the St James Court Hotel, this time for a family 60th Birthday Celebration. Our stay was as good as the first and I would highly recommend the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location walking distance to buckingham palace and a couple of blocks from the St James Tube Station.

Apart from the high finish of public areas and rooms, good breakfast selection, probably the hotels best feature is the service of the staff which is first class.",5,2018,07,01
121,1982 or 2018 St James' Court is still home,"St James' Court in 1982 under other owners was tired with lovely bones but caring  of  our family of four. Returning this year I found a beautiful hotel restored in the TAJ style with lovely garden courtyard.  Perfect location for Buckingham Palace, The Other Palace Theatre, Westminster Chapel and Victoria Street shopsI
I had requested room with walkin shower and I had perfect classic room on the first floor lobby lift to Regents entrance.
off the courtyard.  
I was there at weekend so not troubled by building work on new modern wing",5,2018,06,29
121,Amazing Service!,"We’ve come to London for just a few days and our stay in this hotel has been amazing. The rooms are comfortable but what really stand out are the staff .. Geeta Punjabi , Caroline .. I can’t name them all but just from the breakfast staff , housekeeping, bell boys, doorman etc Our stay has been fanstastic. I really can’t give you all enough credit for this. 

The hotel is in a great location and just minutes away from Buckingham Palace.  The food from the Bistro very tasty and served quickly. The breakfast buffet is small but has enough variety. 

Thank you so much , we will leave with fond memories of London.",5,2018,06,28
121,Great place,"I loved my stay at Taj. The service and food were both amazing. Front desk was extremely helpful. Thank you for your hospitality. The location is a great advantage and if you are craving great indian food you must check out the restaurants in the hotel
",5,2018,06,28
121,Luxury hotel in the center of London,"Our trip this time was to watch the famous Hamilton show, and decided to stay here for two nights. The service was great, hotel was beautiful, but room was really small (not complaint as it is London after all). Although it is close to many tourist attractions, the hotel is quiet.",4,2018,06,26
121,Very nice hotel. Very posh!,"Lovely hotel. We felt very posh staying here. If Buckingham Palace is your destination then stay here because it’s 300 yards down the road. Great place for an early morning jog. Stayed 4 nights. There were no issues. The only amusing thing was when the chap was carrying our luggage to our room. From reception we went down the corridor, left, down another corridor, right, then left, then down another corridor, then into a tiny - and I mean tiny - lift. Up 2 floors, left, down a corridor, right, then left, down you guessed it another corridor, right, right again, down a penultimate corridor, then our room was just round one last corner and down the corridor a few yards on the left. Or was it right. Wow! The hotel is a warren. ",4,2018,06,25
121,A thoroughly pleasant stay,"I was in London for a Round Table Conference at the St. James’ Court Hotel, thotoughly plesant although my room was in the very last corner seen from the elevator, but in the renovated part, a special thanks to the Front Desk for their flexibility, when thinking of late Check Out. The Wifi works nicely, the AC was not good but noisy. Special mention of the Bar in the Courtyard. ",5,2018,06,24
121,great location,"3 blocks from Buckingham Palace and 5 min walk from Westminster.  Our view was of the street, but really not a problem for the time we spent in the room.  On check in the staff will offer an upgrade, get room sooner.  Not sure it is worth it.  Rooms are very nice.  Breakfast in their Bistro is outstanding, highly recommend it.",5,2018,06,23
121,First trip to London from USA- mother and son trip,"Thank you so very much for our recent stay. The location is incredible. Right on tube. 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace in Westminster. Right by St James Park which easily connects to Green Park and Hyde Park. Best area in London. Beautiful historic hotel . Immaculate and the breakfast was amazing! All of the staff were so kind. So impressed with housekeeping, the really nice man who showed us to our table each morning, the room service and wait staff. We were hot in our room due to faulty AC and within 30 min of our arrival they moved us- both rooms were lovely. Bathroom felt like spa. I can’t wait to come back. This trip will never be forgotten. Memories for a lifetime for me and my 15 year old son. Thank you!!!",5,2018,06,23
121,Fabulous!,"We stayed here for our silver wedding anniversary. We arrived to be met by lovely staff who advised us we had been upgraded to a suite at 51 Buckingham gate across the courtyard. We were taken over there to be greeted with a glass of bubbles before being shown to the suite which was just fabulous, up on the highest floor (something we had requested if possible), so quiet and comfortable and equipped with everything you could need or want. Fresh fruits, a well stocked mini bar and good coffee machine all made for a lovely stay in this gorgeous hotel. The bed was very comfortable and breakfast the following morning was superb! The staff are just lovely,  very attentive and really made our stay special. Thank you so much and we really hope we can stay again one day. Oh and the location is great too!",5,2018,06,22
121,Incredible,"The hotel staff are amazing and you can’t get past anyone without a hello. People always open the door and the concierge was very helpful. The breakfast buffet was amazing and we purchased it with the room, otherwise the price would be very steep. 
  We were in the newly renovated area and the room was well done and not small like most European rooms are. 
  Rooms cleaned daily, then someone comes to see if the cleaning was done properly. That was impressive. 
Location was excellent
I highly recommend this hotel",5,2018,06,18
121,Elegant,Stayed for a week for meetings in London and enjoyed this lovely hotel centrally located. Special treat was inner courtyard with fountain and dive-bombing pigeons who beat me to the nuts! Would stay again.  Service was terrific. Food was divine.,5,2018,06,18
121,Wonderful ,"A quick London break isn't complete without the proper accommodation. 
The service and warm hospitality of this hotel made it all worth it!
We deliberately booked this hotel because 
it's close proximity to Buckingham palace. 
Our room offered all comforts with a luxurious touch and we could recommend 
this particular hotel anytime.
On our next excursion we will definitely 
staying here it again.",5,2018,06,18
121,A Wonderful Surprise,"On checking in we thought the receptionist a little 'dipsy' as she had to ask us our names several times and did not seem to recognize us when we represented to her at receiption five minutes after check in.  However, when we returned at our 2pm room access time we were wonderfully surprised to find that we had been upgraded to an apartment.  It was WONDERFUL. (Only downsize was a concern that the hotel has misplaced our luggage, ((concierge could not find it)) however it had been taken to our room and not communicated to other concierge staff.   The staff at the apartments were well informed and very professional.  The room was quiet and well appointed.  Loved it and (even though on higher price range) would definitely stay again.  Location is very good - easy walk to Central London, our rate included an open bar evening drinks in the dining room.  The hotel also has a wonderful enclosed, peaceful garden, it is next door to a church (hence quiet), has a variety of good restaurants around it.",4,2018,06,17
121,A warm welcoming hotel in a central location,"One of my favorite hotels! A very friendly and helpful staff. Great restaurants, a nice lobby, a fantastic location. We could just walk to the main tourist or shopping spots. The subway station is close too. I think I will be staying at St James Court whenever I visit London",5,2018,06,15
121,Good Four Star hotel in a great Central London Location.,"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel in May on our way back to Australia. The hotel is undergoing extensive renovations to lift it to five star, and as such some rooms may suffer from building noise during the day. We arrived on the Saturday and were offered one of their newly renovated rooms for our stay. The rooms are really 5 star, very classy as befits a Taj Hotel, but we had to ask to be moved on the Monday, when building work commenced above our room ceiling which was very noisy.  To the hotels credit they moved us to one of their hotel suites in their adjacent building which was really lovely. We could not criticise the hotel staff who at all times were great and the Restaurant serves some great Indian food. The hotel is in a good central location within walking distance of Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, London Eye, London Dungeon etc, and has a tube station only a few minutes walk away. Yes we would stay in this hotel again. ",4,2018,06,15
121,"So far, this is a never again experience!!  Shame on you Taj Group!!","I am currently sat in the reception area of this hotel as despite being here for nearly two hours i don't have a room.  We booked a junior suite and when i was shown it the air conditioning doesn't work and its like a sauna in the room.  I rejected the room when the staff said it would not be fixed until at least tomorrow.  It is at least 25 degrees outside so imagine the temperature inside.

I was then shown to a room on the 1st floor and despite me saying repeatedly i wanted a quiet room they put me in a room where you can hear every train rumble underneath.

Again i rejected and was taken to a room on the 7th floor.  I couldn't see out of the windows as they have masked them all over - as there are builders walking about outside the room on scaffolding, and banging and clattering.   I was advised that they finish at 4pm....  (thats Ok then but bang goes any chance of a lie in!!)

I have checked other London Hotels and it is almost impossible to change hotels at such a late stage.

I have now been offered a 4th room but it is not ready...!!!

This is a shambles for the TAJ group and very poor customer service.  Just wish i could escape and go somewhere else.

The manager thinks that offering me tea and biscuits will resolve my present discontent!

It does not.   I doubt we will ever set foot in here again after this fiasco.

There are better hotels for the same price that take care in looking after their guests.",1,2018,06,13
121,Great hotel with a great location,"We arrived from LHR at 9:00 AM not expecting that our room would be ready, but planning to leave our luggage and enjoy our first day in London. Much to our pleasure, we were accommodated with a room and an upgrade. It was so nice to be able to unpack a bit and relax before heading out. 
After a ""brilliant"" day observing the practice Trooping the Colour and visiting the National Gallery we were ready for an early bed and could have eaten dinner in, but were given a great recommendation nearby and so did that.
 We returned to the St James' Court having succeeded in staying awake until the end of the first day and even having enjoyed it a great deal. 
The hotel is so quiet,  and given it's location in the center of a huge metropolis, that's saying a lot. Extremely comfortable bed, a bathroom with everything you need and want and truly accommodating staff made for a great night and a great start of our UK vacation. A delicious full English breakfast next morning sent us off on more adventures with full bellies and smiles on our faces.",5,2018,06,10
121,Stylish Hotel excellent food professional and efficient staff &close to Buckingham Palace,We stayed here for two nights.  On arrival we were informed that we were the hotel's guests of the day which meant we had been upgraded.  A lovely surprise!  Allocated a newly re-furbished room -very stylish and comfortable.  Fruit and hand made chocolates and extra bottled water included.  Also discounts given on all food and drink.  As I was attending a Royal Garden Party on the Tuesday this was a double bonus.  Our photographs were taken in the courtyard and we were promised they would be sent to us but we are still waiting.  Food in the Bistro was good but the only criticism was that the mains were delivered immediately after the starters with no gap whatsoever.  In fact one of two friends who had joined us for dinner had barely put his cutlery down!  We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was far too expensive.,5,2018,06,09
121,40th Wedding Anniversary Celebration stay,"This is a very late review as we stayed for 2 nights at the end of May. I cannot praise the hotel highly enough. My husband had ordered flowers for me to be waiting in our room and told Elisabet Gonzalez who dealt with his request, what they were for. The flowers were beautiful and when we booked in we were upgraded to an Executive Room which was lovely and really quite spacious. We were left chocolates when we returned to our room that evening with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate.  The next morning at breakfast Naveen Sikka, Front of House Manager came to speak to my husband and told him that they had upgraded us again to an apartment in 51 Buckingham Gate across from the hotel. We were amazed and delighted. The apartment was amazing, we wished we could have stayed for a week! The staff in 51 Buckingham Gate could not have been more helpful and made us feel very, very special. Zuzana Mitevova Duty Manager was extremely attentive although I have to say that all the staff were exceptional. I also had a fantastic massage and would recommend the spa (although the spa is being renovated).  We would return to this hotel again, although I daresay we would not get such 5 star treatment! We thought it was a very, very good hotel in a very good location, quite near St James underground station and within easy walk of Buckingham Palace. Thank you so much for making our 40th Wedding Anniversary so memorable, Naveen, Elisabet and Zuzana. We hope to see you again. Carol & Ray Russell",5,2018,06,08
121,St James,"Arrived late in the day but room was not ready. Booked for Silver Wedding Anniversary as a treat, but entered the ""double"" room to find ""twin"" beds...!  Overall waiting time was 1.5 hours with 1 complimentary cup of coffee. Eventually housekeeping managed to push beds together but we noticed that sheets were torn, towels not fluffy and the pipes clanged all night.  The plumbing was also in need of maintenance as smells wafting up from the basin. Staff kept smiling, but nothing was done.  Breakfast area was clean and the food was good. Complained but was offered another night (no discount or compensation offered) to see if we could better our experience.",2,2018,06,06
121,Stayed here whilst attending a Royal Garden party and it is very convenient,"Overall this hotel is a good high end hotel with reasonable value for money. The exception is the Bistro restaurant where breakfast is served. There is a 2 seat table located alongside ( touching) a service station which is at head height when you are seated there and gives you the benefit of smelling everyone else's breakfast leftovers with the added attraction of a bottle of cleaning fluid and the clatter of refilling of the cutlery rack. I raised this with the staff on the first day of our stay and their response was ""you can sit somewhere else tomorrow"". When I suggested they should not locate a table there it was blank stares all round but they continued to use the location, This is the very worst of London - Your a tourist so who cares if something is wrong as you will not be back any. The was not even a second rate approach. Eat elsewhere",4,2018,06,06
121,Standard high quality Taj hotel,"Fantastic service as always when at a Taj hotel. That said, the decor is also like other Taj hotels set in an older colonial vibe. The room was enormous but the TV a bit small. The spa was under construction but they accommodated us at the associated apartment residences.",4,2018,06,05
121,Please upgrade your elevators,Very interesting hotel with many nice features. The problem is that the elevators are a nightmare. They state 18 persons capacity but I had twice problems with much less than that. The elevators would stop and the doors would not open. Also the stairs to go up and down are not evident to locate. Not very friendly. ,3,2018,06,03
121,Superb and great value,"Gorgeous building 2mins from Buckingham Palace, Westminster and tube. Staff friendly and nothing too much trouble. Off main road so exceptionally quiet at night. Rooms lovely and beds and pillows so comfy they deserve a mention. Have never seen such an extensive breakfast buffet with imaginative choices to suit all tastes. Very good value.",5,2018,06,03
121,Perfect location,"We were greated by a lovely lady Elizabeth who was welcoming and helpful. Great location, close to so many attractions - rooms and the hotel were very clean. Buffet breakfast had lots to choose from - and was delicious. Great service + great hotel - highly recommended  ✅",5,2018,05,31
121,Mixed feelings about this hotel,"I have a mixed review regarding this hotel.  
Pros:  The location was fantastic!  The common areas of the hotel are very nice.  The included breakfast buffet was a pleasant surprise since I was unsure of what to expect. While the variety of food on the buffet doesn't change daily, the quantity of food and the ability to order eggs/omelet was a great value and way to start the day.  The staff that I encountered were very nice.   The size of our room was good since typically rooms in Europe are quite small.

Cons:
The hotel is under renovation.  Some of the rooms have been updated and some have not yet been updated.  At check-in, I asked for a room that had already been renovated.  I was informed that I could be moved the following night to a room that had been renovated but it would cost an additional 50 pounds per night.  Since we were out and about most of the time, my family opted to not spend the extra money.  As a result our ""classic suite"" was very shabby and had stains on the carpet and throw pillows.  It was very disappointing.  Also, there were 3 people in our suite and despite asking housekeeping many times to please leave 3 -4 bath towels when making up the room they would only leave 2 so I would have to ask for extra towels either at turn down time or I would have to call housekeeping.  That is very frustrating when you come back tired from a day of sightseeing!",3,2018,05,30
121,Taj India replicated in London,"Asa frequent guest of Taj Hotels in India, I was keen to stay in the UK-based one in central London - there are two but sit side by side - I opted for the St James'  Court and was not disappointed. It was interesting to see so many ""normal"" features of Indian hotels here in the UK....home from home!

The staff throughout the hotel were extremely pleasant and helpful and made my short stay memorable. Certainly worth considering staying at this central hotel with Hyde park close by and lovely walks etc.",4,2018,05,30
121,Doesn't quite do it for me,"Definitely some positives - excellent location, unexpectedly quiet for central London, nice ambience. We tried checking in early as had to be elsewhere the rest of the day . In every similar scenario elsewhere the hotel has managed to get a room fairly quickly- however despite others being checked in we waited 2 hours until the official time. I'm sure they'll say different but can't help feeling our Expedia-rate booking meant we certainly weren't going to be done any favours. Room was ok. All in all I was left disappointed- just felt like we weren't wanted which may be me being paranoid but that's how we were left feeling. All other kids were getting goodie bags on arrival so I'm assuming our room type didn't warrant one for our son",3,2018,05,29
121,Thoroughly recommend,"Recently stay at this hotel and far exceeded my expectations. 3 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, tube stop 2 minutes down the road. The hotel itself was cleaning, staff were so helpful and breakfast was fantastic. Would definitely stay there again. One of the better hotels I have stayed at in London.",5,2018,05,29
121,Wah! Taj!!,"It was a pleasure staying at the St. James' Court recently. The location is fabulous, rooms great but its the service that makes me want to recommend this property strongly. I have a bias favoring the Taj, yet every interaction with the polite staff brought a smile.Would be unfair to name just a few yet i must...Navin - Thanks for everything. You promised we would feel at home and we did. Iulia - the breakfast was a cherished experience every single day. What do i say about the highly decorated and celebrated Binoy and his team at the concierge desk - a big THANK YOU. From arranging our car rental to recommendations of places to visit and getting us impossible reservations! Our trip would not have been the same without your inputs. Mr. Digvijay Singh (GM) took time out of his busy schedule to check on us. Mr. Singh you have every reason to be proud of your team. Would love to stay with you the next time and every time we visit London.",5,2018,05,28
121,First Class!!!,"Staff was very polite and ready to greet and serve guests as they depart and arrive!!! We were helped with car rental and tickets for Tower of London, Westminster Abbey and Churchill War Rooms at the concierge desk. The location of this hotel was perfect --the underground station was just around the corner and it was just a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben.
Perfect 
Perfect
Perfect
The next time we are in London, we will stay at the St. James Court!!",5,2018,05,27
121,"Friendly staff, great breakfast","Positive: Pleasant hotel with highly motivated staff, close to Victoria Station if you come by train e.g. from Gatwick Airport (top tip: The Visitor Oyster Card can be used on the Southern Railway trains for 8.30 pounds during off-peak hours). Despite its cetral location it is very quiet, so you get a good night´s sleep.  The breakfast buffet has a good selection, and you order coffee or tea and eggs or porridge from a waiter; there are plenty of people working there, and they are very friendly.

Negative: My main complaint would be that there is a distinct smell of mothballs in the room; putting your clothes into the closet will result in them smelling of mothballs, too. While we were there, the gym was being refurbished and moved into a suite, and the sauna and steam bath were not operational due to renovations.",4,2018,05,26
121,Excellent location,"Location is excellent, walking distance to just about every tourist attraction. Breakfast was great but do get there early as tables fill up fast.  We had an executive room and it was a decent size for Europe standards.",4,2018,05,25
121,Hamilton ,"We were going to see Hamilton on a Saturday evening and decided to stay in London for the night. We walked from Victoria Station via some backstreets and in apx 10 minutes arrived. We arrived at the hotel early on the basis we could leave our bags at the hotel as we were a couple of hours earlier than the check in time. We had actually entered through the back entrance which was undergoing some building work, at the desk the receipt was friendly and when we asked if we could check in early, she kindly found us a room, which was great.
The room was the basic one with a double bed, it was rather small which is not unusual for a city hotel, but nicely furnished with a bathroom which had a bath/shower. The tv had all sky sports channels and other satellite channels. There were tea/coffee making facilities and it was fine. The hotel has a nice feel to it both its traditional facade with a pleasant reception area which has traditional feel with a modern twist. It has a fitness room and spa treatments as most larger hotels in London have, but no pool.
When we returned to the hotel after Hamilton, we visited the bar for a nightcap, it had a nice feel about, friendly bar staff, a reasonable selection of cocktails and your standard spirits, at typical London hotel prices. There was a pianist playing which was a nice touch. We gave the £22 per person buffet breakfast a miss and there are several local breakfast options, we chose st James Park cafe which I have already reviewed.
Finally as other reviewers have noted, it has a local feel to it as it’s on a small side street, there is a local grocery store which open every time we passed it, there are a few restaurants and some pubs and coffee shops all within 5 to 10 min walk as is St James Park tube station and the park itself. We enjoyed our stay, it is not cheap but by booking in advance we got a reasonable deal.",4,2018,05,25
121,Exceptional,"It was a lovely 10 days at this property. Very well located and with easy access to all transport and parks. Great service, warm and hospitable. It seems to be a legacy — The “tajness “ continues. 😊😊😊😊",4,2018,05,23
121,Quiet Luxury in a Great Location,"This hotel is an absolute GEM. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out, we received phenomenal service. Special shoutout to Elizabet and the Bistro breakfast manager for their especially attentive, polite, and friendly service.

The room was spacious, well lit, well-stocked, and was clean as a pin every day. The bed was comfortable and the bedding/pillows were fluffy and soft. The wardrobe and chest of drawers offered more than enough storage for two people. The bathroom was divine; large shower, extra LARGE towels, with beautiful fixtures and plenty of room on the ledge for all of your personal items/toiletries. 

Breakfast every morning is absolutely worth it. The food is hot and fresh with so many options, as well as an option for made to order eggs. The service and selection at the bar is also lovely.

The hotel is just a few short blocks from Westminster Abbey, and 2 streets away from a tube station on the District line, which should get you just about anywhere on the Thames.

We will never stay anywhere else in London now, and will be on the looout for other Taj hotels.",5,2018,05,23
121,Alice in Wonderland Afternoon Tea,I treated my daughter and mother to this (daughter's 11th birthday).  It was a delight.  Gorgeous setting and really impressed with the detail and care taken.  Will be taking my husband to the Sherlock Holmes equivalent the next time we're in London!,5,2018,05,22
121,Fabulous location,"Great locale near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Recently remodeled, not quite complete. Large room, comfortable bed. Outstanding breakfast buffet. Friendly, helpful staff from all over the world.",5,2018,05,22
121,Loved it,"Stayed for three days on business. First plus was upgraded to a lovely suite. All staff I came across were lovely and helpful with nothing too much trouble. Room service of a very high standard. Not bothered at all by renovations. Gym a bit basic but only temporary. Well done to all, it is so difficult to achieve this consistency. Would absolutely stay again Luiza",5,2018,05,19
121,Happy in London,"We stayed at the St. James upon the recommendation of Wings Travel and were very happy with the stay, the restaurants, staff, concierge and amenities.  The hotel is well situated and we walked everywhere.  It is minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, about 1.5 miles from the theater district and around the corner from a few theaters. Restaurants and good shopping are nearby as well.",5,2018,05,17
121,Excellent hotel we were made to feel very special,"We love this hotel because of it location, standard of rooms, facilities & service. However on this occasion the Taj went out of their way to make everything so very special for us as this trip was a gift for my partners birthday.  We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was delightful, treated to a drink at the bar and  treated like royalty, thank you all at the Taj for making this trip just perfect.",5,2018,05,14
121,visit to London,Staff friendly and helpful.  It would have been helpful if the bathroom  had a shower rather than a tub with a high step. Good selection at buffet breakfast. Concierge service good. Would stay there again ,4,2018,05,14
121,Overpriced and uninvited guests staying too,"Myself and my partner decided to stay here for 2 nights after receiving a recommendation to book here. The hotel itself (lobby, bar, restaurant) are all lovely and the location is perfect however there were a few aspects of the stay which left a lot to be desired. Firstly the room itself was tiny, very small for two people sharing and the bed was very cheap and quite uncomfortable. The bed frame is obviously very cheap and on wheels and only took the smallest movement to push it away from the wall resulting in the pillows dropping to the floor. Secondly is the quality of the food. We did not eat in the restaurant so I cannot comment on the quality there but we did have a snack in the lobby area. We decided to try 3 of the tapas dishes which were around £11 each so not cheap to start with. The chicken quesadillas were quite simply one of the worst plates of food I have ever had the misfortune of ordering. The chicken was quite clearly from a packet and there was no sauce or flavour within the quesadilla itself, it was also delivered to the table almost cold, not surprising since it had clearly been heated in a microwave. We complained about this and the waiter apologised and took it away, a few minutes later it arrived back at the table after receiving another blast in the microwave or a quick turn on the pan, can't be sure. This particular dish was inedible, the other two were not much better. The waiter apologised when he cleared the plates and asked how the meal was and to be fair he did not charge us for them so this was okay, disappointing but not the end of the world. The worst part of the stay happened just as I was about to leave the room to check out. As I was about to leave the room at 6.30am I was greeted by a homeless man who was asleep directly outside the door of my room, I politely told him it was time to wake up and proceeded to call the front desk to alert them that there was an uninvited guest sleeping in the corridor. I have nothing against homeless people however for almost £250 per night I don't expect to have to step over somebody in the morning, it also highlights some serious gaps in security (especially for women and children) that this can happen and the hotel does not have an accurate head count of everybody in the building. During checkout I again mentioned this to the staff member who was dealing with me, he didn't seem completely surprised and I suggested the man in the corridor had obviously worked out where the camera blind spots are and the hotel security are not doing a thorough enough job during the night. Overall the stay was okay but I would not return again. I have stayed in a lot of nice hotels and unfortunately this particular experience ranks rock bottom.",2,2018,05,14
121,Very poor room and misleading service,"We had American guests over and wished to stay at a nice London hotel that was centrally located

The St James Court Hotel is very well located 

BUT although we had booked and paid for our rooms well in advance our American guests were given what can only be described as a wedge shaped room right in the corner of the building - it was clearly much smaller than what we had booked. Moreover the air conditioning was not working making the room very cold

I raised the issue at the front desk and was told that there were no rooms available that night - That despite the fact that I could go online to Booking.Com and book the same level room for that night !)

I complained the following morning and then they moved our guests for the next night

When spending over £800 I shouldn't have to do this and it was embarrassing for all concerned",3,2018,05,11
121,St James' Court,"St James' Court is a very conveniently located hotel in Central London. It is easily accessible by all modes of public transport. The rooms are comfortable, and the service is exceptional. An ideal hotel for a business trip or a family trip.",5,2018,05,11
121,Room was not available! Poor Customer Service!,"We were told our room would be ready at 2pm, however, after being told it was not ready after inquiring at 2pm and 2:30pm. We tried to ask what was going on and no one would give us an answer. At 3:30pm, we were given a room that had water leakage in the ceiling and the bathroom was not fully cleaned. We asked to speak to the manager but no one returned our calls from the room. I immediately called Expedia who I booked through and after several long phone calls between them to explain what was going on, Expedia not the St. James offered to put us up in another hotel. We were so disappointed and exhausted after traveling we were sorry we ever booked this trip. 
The trip was starting off as a disaster and if it were not for Mr. Gary Sayles, Executive Housekeeper for  TAJ 51, sister hotel to the St. James Court we were not sure how our vacation would have ended up. Mr. Sayles was very understanding and secured a room for us at the Taj 51. He even had our belongings transferred over to the new room. The customer service at the St. James Court was unacceptable and poor and wasted our first day in London. We can't say enough for Mr. Sayles' assistance who salvaged a poor start into a good vacation. He is a great representative of the Taj hotels!",1,2018,05,11
121,"Location Good, Room poor overpriced",Nicely located hotel. If you look at their adds and pictures it looks beautiful and indeed when you enter it looks like a classy place. However the room we got didn't live up to the hype. It was very plain and more of a very over priced tourist class room.  I suppose they think if they give you free soap and shampoo that it makes it a five star hotel. In addition the price quoted on Expedia was lower than the actual price and didn't include breakfast which is about $50 for two.,3,2018,05,09
121,Was expecting a bit more,"Stayed for a few nights. Service and people was really good they couldn't do enough to help especially the door attendants and reception. However the room was rather tiered and in need of some attention. The bed was small compared to other hotels we have stayed at but it was comfortable and so were the pillows.  They only have free view tv and they don't have the handy phones that most all of the other hotels have these days. The food in the bistro was lovely and well presented. We came back from a show late so decided to have a snack in the bar but they stop serving tapas and pizza at 10.45 or there abouts and change to the bistro menu. Who wants a full meal at that time of the evening surely the tapas would be a better option? Depending on when in the week you stay this is quite an expensive hotel for what you get in terms of technology and space but you do get robes , slippers and free water.",3,2018,05,08
121,Great night’s sleep,"The hotel is a short stroll from Buckingham Palace. The check in staff were very polite, welcoming and helpful. We stayed in an executive room which was clean and airy. The mattress was very comfortable and the location of the room was so quiet we had a superb night’s sleep.",5,2018,05,08
121,AMAZING HOTEL AND STAFF,"We just came back from a family trip staying at the St. James Court Tja, and we are all just over the moon. We had a fantastic stay from the start to the end. 
The room was big and comfortable for all 4 of us ( family room) and the beds very very comfortable and also the bathroom has all facilities you may ask for. The bar and restaurant all served the best food.

We have to mention a very special treat from your wonderful head of staff: Mrs.Sunaina Soares & Mr. Naveen Sikka. 
They made our stay in the hotel extra amazing in all matters. 
Also they made both our daughters feel very special and they had such a wonderful treat with them. 
We can not thank you enough and you have just filled our hearts. 
It was a pleasure and honor to meet you both. Thank you for all your kindness and special attention. 
We will definately be back to see you and your lovely staff behind the desk, the sweet cleaning team and the rest of your very well strained and kind personal. 
We can not recommend this hotel enough for families traveling with children.
 
From us all ;
THANK YOU MR. SIKKA & MRS. SOARESS.
FOR MAKING OUR STAY IN LONDON THE BEST EVER.",5,2018,05,06
121,Avinash Bendke,"Excellent stay at fantastic location in Central London.  Loved the room size, lavish breakfast and food at award winning Quilon restaurant.  Very convenient location bang in front my office.  Would love to come back.",5,2018,05,05
121,Excellent hotel,Hotel is located in a great spot. Buckingham Palace is just down the road as is Westminster Abbey. The staff is wonderful. The rooms are good size.  The breakfast that came with the room was superb. We loved it there!,5,2018,05,03
121,Good but....,"Was just alright. Nothing wrong with the place.  But nothing to make us want to come back, other than the location. Room on small side. But clean and tidy. As I say. Nothing wrong with the place.  But no ‘spark’.",3,2018,05,03
121,Perfect,"I had stayed earlier at the hotel in 2009, when it was a Crowne Plaza. This hotel came as an option during booking my trip and reading all reviews I decided to pay a little bit extra to stay here. It was definately a good call. Service was very good and breakfast included other options than English Breakfast as well. We were able to do some changes for our rooms easily and luggage was waiting for us at the room, when we arrived later that day. Complimentary newspaper and water bottles are always a nice touch. Location is excellent to see major attractions and rooms were nice and comfortable. I have to mention the shower working in a modern way, because it is not always obvious in UK. :) It is easy to give five stars to this hotel. We will be back for sure.",5,2018,05,03
121,"Comfortable, clean, not WOW!","Having seen the website, I expected a hotel with a bit more character in the rooms, it all felt a bit bland.  It was my husbands birthday and having been told that I'd been upgraded to a beautiful Executive Room, I was glad I wasn't in a room that would have been smaller! This was fine, but with just enough room. All was very nice and comfortable, the bathroom was really good and it was all very clean. The location is really great if you want to get to the main sites easily. ",4,2018,05,02
121,poor  due to construction,rooms at or near the construction site should be closed during the renovation.  Very loud and sleep disruptive.  Front desk should be more aware of where the rooms are that would be  effected by the construction.  I have  stayed at the hotel many times and normally it is one of the best in London.   ,2,2018,05,02
121,A Royal Visit,"We stayed at St. James , down the road from Buckingham and near shops and restaurants.  Lovely staff and a truly cosmopolitan makeup of staff.  Very Helpful and assisted with whatever came their way.  I had my cell phoned charged and sent to our room everyday. Enjoyed our breakfast with lovely young staff from all the corners or the world serving us. Whenever we back in London, this will be a sure stop for us.",5,2018,05,02
121,exceeding all expectations,"5 star says it all fab room food service very clean   staff could not do enough for you very friendly and help full
 everything was what we  needed and more   would 100% come back next time  we look forward to our next visit .thank you ",5,2018,05,01
121,Wonderful,"Great location for central London and theatres Wonderful,professional staff who had ndersatndbwhat good service is all about. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast and food sevedbat the Hampton Bar was excellent ",5,2018,05,01
121,First trip abroad,"I chose this hotel based on the reviews I read here. It was our first trip overseas and wanted to make it a good one. The hotel's location was perfect for our needs. Everything we wanted to do was either in walking distance or short tube ride. The staff was very welcoming, especially the bellmen and doormen. They were awesome and completely on top of things! If you base your stay on the room photos, you will not be as pleased. Our room was underwhelming. It was incredibly small and drab. It was white and brown with zero warmth. The bed was comfortable though. The bathroom was tiny and had no outlets. I had to do my hair sitting on the bedroom floor. The shower was so narrow and I actually nicked myself on a sharp piece of glass door trim. The good thing about our room was that we were not in it very much. I did inquire about an upgrade prior to our trip, but the cost was just too much more. To the hotel's credit, they are in the midst of renovations and we did not have any disturbance at all.",4,2018,04,30
121,Expectation Exceeded,"I found this hotel on Hotels.com...such a beautiful hotel. The lobby is welcoming and the check in was speedy. The room was ready early. The hotel restaurant and bar were very good. The restaurant serves a delicious variety of food including Indian fare. On Friday night they had a gentleman playing the piano and on Saturday evening there was a small jazz band entertaining the guests. The room felt more like a cozy homey bedroom with everything we needed...very large bath towels, ironing board, tea maker, nice toiletries and even chocolates...the hotel concierge was available 24 hours and extremely helpful! There are many restaurants within walking distance. We found this location PERFECT! It’s within walking distance to all the main sights but tucked away from the crowds. A very quiet beautiful property. ",5,2018,04,30
121,Very professional,I have stayed at the Taj numerous times over the last few years and without fail the hotel and particularly its staff have delivered a very high standard of comfort and care. It delivers excellent value for money in a central London location,5,2018,04,30
121,Excellent location ,You can walk to many of the attractions from the hotel. Underground is so close by too. Service was good and the rooms were lovely. Breakfast had a good spread. Highly recommend to first time visitors. ,5,2018,04,29
121,Terrible Experience,"The pictures of the room I booked were not as the room they actually gave, the hotel has different types of rooms, but the old ones are just as if you stay in a hostel, the bed is terrible, it totally ruined my trip to London, the room was small, expensive for what it was, the walls and the furniture was really damaged, the door knobs, the toilet, the glass ""door"" on the shower , everything was falling. I did not say anything, and one day they called to my room to tell me that the lady from the housekeeping found some stains in the sink (which by the way is not even for a hostel and is made of a very poor material) , and that I had to pay for the sink, I am attaching pictures of the stains too. Three people came into my room and made me wait for almost an hour, the hotel manager,the lady from the housekeeping and the person on the front desk (which I consider extremely rude and invasive) to blame me for being responsible of the stains on the sink because the lady of the housekeeping didn't see it before me. I showed them all the problems,but they insisted that I had to pay for the sink or for the cleaning. I only used cosmetic products, and if the sink gets stained with them, then the quality of the materials on the sink they have is not the one for an hotel. We argued a lot in my room and I asked them to leave as they were making my stay unforgettable The service, the room, THE BED!! everything wrong, the spa was closed with no advice. I would rather go to a hostel next time",1,2018,04,29
121,Good location,This hotel had an old school London feel to it which is exactly what we wanted. We stayed here the end of March while they were doing renovation but it did not effect our stay at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Bar downstairs off of the lobby area and they have a few restaurants connecting to the main building so there was a variety of food options. Good location. We were able to take the underground around London and walk back to the hotel with ease. There is a nice cafe right across the street for breakfast/lunch options as well as a corner store right down the street. One of the only downsides of staying in central London was the price of the hotel and the restaurants associated with it.,5,2018,04,26
121,Excellent hotel and service.,"The St. James is a lovely hotel and well placed for central London. Comfortable beds and good portioned rooms for central London. Just a few 100 yards walk to Buckingham Palace.

The staff are particularly friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Only downside and I'm being really picky was we had to queue for breakfast one morning due to the London Marathon causing an unusual number of runners all turning up for breakfast at the same time.

I would highly recommend it.",5,2018,04,25
121,The St. James is AWESOME!,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about our stay here.  Our family arrived, straight from the airport, to drop off our bags.  We were early and our room wasn't ready, so we headed out to sight see.  When we got back, for our 'inconvenience', they upgraded us from two rooms to three in the most elegant suite I have ever seen!  Everyone had his own bathroom, fully stocked kitchen, complete dining room-- I swear, it was bigger than my 3 bedroom home!  And the staff were all so very attentive.  The second time I walked in, I turned the wrong way, and two staff immediately jumped up to politely help me navigate.     Their brunch was delicious, with chocolate croissants, strong tea, porridge-- all the goodies.",5,2018,04,24
121,Excellent hotel and location,"Spent 7 nights at the hotel. This is an excellent hotel very close to Buckingham palace. The staff was very attentive and polite - we had a great experience during checkin, daily breakfast service and checkout. The lobby is very plush yet cosy. Breakfast had a good variety of options. We had an upgraded room that had a separate sitting area and I and my 2 kids had a very comfortable stay. They brought complimentary cookies and smoothies on the first day for the kids after specifically asking them for their smoothie choices, which was a nice welcome touch. The kids also got complimentary welcome kits. The tube station is very close which makes getting around easy. Will definitely look this hotel up next time I am in London. It is an excellent value for money.",5,2018,04,23
121,We enjoyed it a lot!,"We stayed in the hotel for 4 days. A standart room on the 7.floor. it's newly renovated, well equipped with all modern USB plugs (you don't need an adapter for the british mains). The bathroom is brand new. We had 2 bottle of water and chocolate every day. The bed is comfortable there is light in the wardrobe. 
We dined twice in the restourant of the hotel. Everything was delicious! We enjoyed the stay",5,2018,04,20
121,Fabulous!,"I took my two grown up daughters to London to see Sam Smith in concert and we were very pleased with the room and service that we received during our stay.
Fabulous room, location and staff made this a hotel to revisit.",5,2018,04,19
121,"Great place, welcoming service, old world charm",Stayed here for two nights ...the rooms were tiny as is the case with most of central London but we're cosy and well equipped so no complaints... the service and reception was true to its Indian roots and just for that will go back to it  ,5,2018,04,19
121,Excellent!,"We stayed three nights recently and at the time of booking were made aware that parts of the hotel were being renovated, however this caused us no disturbance the hotel was very quiet. We had a comfortable room on the second floor overlooking the Courtyard giving a pleasant outlook. Service was excellent throughout the hotel. In addition to breakfast in the Bistro we ate for two evenings in the Hamptons bar, great food in a relaxing atmosphere with live piano.The hotel is in a good location for touring around the Westminster area and only 10 minutes walk from Victoria Station. Would stay again.",5,2018,04,17
121,A building site ! No sleep here,"This place is a building site at the moment, as the hotel is been renovated. You can not sleep after 6 in the morning as the builders begin work. Also plenty of racket during night. It should have closed until the work was done. Its only open because  of the owners greed.",1,2018,04,15
121,Awesome Hotel in the heart of town!,"Comfortable hotel in the heart of town. Close to the underground, and coffee shops! Enjoyed the breakfast at the Bistro and Quilon Restruant. Just hope that the Restruant starts to change the menu a bit.",5,2018,04,15
121,Huge disappointment.,"We moved because first room was dirty and bed was sagging. It was a ""renovated"" room. Parts of the bathroom were rusted. Walls were dirty with smudges and splatters. Second room was much better except the bathroom wall was covered with sprays of some sort from previous guests-all over. Night stand dirty. It was as if they has never wiped the furniture.  Coffee mug was not cleaned up from the morning. I brought this to the hotel's attention, housekeeping said they do not touch coffee mugs that have coffee in them left out. When they did finally address it, the mugs were not washed, they were put back dirty. I asked repeatedly for the room to be cleaned.  I spoke to hotel guest relations manager and housekeeping together and it was NEVER done. Not one of the things we pointed out were ever cleaned. The same dirty coffee mugs remained for 4 days after repeatedly asking for them to be either washed or replaced. Asked for more towels, they were brought to my room in an unfolded pile. It has been a week since check out. (I was credited $100 check out and was told by the manager on duty, without bringing it up to her, she did not feel that was enough.) I was contacted by guest relations who turned it to the hotel manager, his solution was a preferred rate for a future stay at one of their hotels. Not going to happen. Ever. Pretty poor customer relations.",2,2018,04,14
121,A warm and welcome family stay in the heart of London!,"Our family trip to London has become a great experience thanks to the outstanding service and care of the crew at the St. James Court hotel! A warm welcome and excellent service from the start, a large and cozy family suite and many unexpected extras like fresh fruits upon arrival, personalized treats for the children before bedtime, a family picture souvenir and much more made our stay truly memorable!",5,2018,04,13
121,Excellent Experience - 5* Taj Hospitality,"We booked our stay at Taj St.James Court at an extremely short notice with just one request - 02 rooms very close to each other. To accommodate this request they upgraded us to rooms that were fairly close to each other. The rooms and bathrooms were perfect, modern and good size considering the average size in London. The breakfast was very good with vegetarian options. Hospitality was at its best (one can never go wrong with Taj). The hotel is just off Victoria street which offers numerous eating options and is 4-5 min walk to tube station. This was our second stay at the hotel and would love to stay again.",5,2018,04,13
121,The best hotel experience!,"A few weeks ago I was in London on business and I was lucky to be booked into The St, James' Court Hotel.  Because they are re-furbing the main hotel, I was super lucky to be upgraded to the Suites.  I have never had an experience quite like it and if you can, then I would urge anyone to stay here.  They room was amazing but to be honest, it was the experience from the very moment I arrived that made it so special,  From being greeted by the wonderful Steve who guided me through the pretty courtyard to the main reception area.  Here I was not only greeted with a glass of Champagne, but a warm and genuine welcome.  No 'are you checking in' - which is my pet hate as it is usually blatantly obvious! But a warm and genuine welcome.  I was made to feel that the staff were genuinely happy that I was their guest.  I was shown to my room which was above and beyond all expectations and then drinks in the Members Lounge later was a welcome surprise.  Breakfast the next morning was what I can only describe as an 'experience' and I really wish I had time to liner longer.  Thank you team Taj for making a very mundane business trip into an experience I will never forget.",5,2018,04,12
121,5* Experience,"My 6th stay at the Taj over several years. Since our first very enjoyable stay some years ago, we always now try to stay at The Taj when we visit London. It is location is excellent for visiting London sites because of the public transport links, plenty of bars for a bite to eat and to enjoy a drink in very traditional pubs.
There are upmarket restaurants too. You will not be disappointed if you book at The Taj, they treat guests like royalty. The rooms are very clean and comfortable.",5,2018,04,10
121,True Taj Service!,"I worked for the Taj group many years ago, but never had the opportunity to stay at one of them till last week with this gem of a hotel. I had brought my family from California for a week in Paris and London. From the check in process to Food & Beverage to concierge services to cleanliness of the room and facilities, was first class. The team is phenomenal and it shows they have been trained well, in the way they welcome their guests to how they serve a beer. Thank you so much for taking care of us. Having worked with The Ritz Carlton for many years it was such a pleasure receiving the true Taj service. A big shout out to Ruta at front desk and Yunus, Gabrielle and Greta in the bistro for taking care of us and our guests. We will be back!",5,2018,04,09
121,A fantastic hotel with excellent staff,"The hotel has a great location, very clean and stylish rooms & lobby, extremely helpful and courteous staff and all for good value for money. I think its difficult to beat really - very highly recommended.",5,2018,04,09
121,"Feeling its age and LOTS of construction, don't plan on napping","I reviewed before but the hotel has changed. I have stayed at this hotel 4 times with large blocks of rooms and this time will be the last.  I have had a variety of rooms here but this time I upgraded to a king deluxe room and was highly disappointed.  It seems they try to nickel and dime you for everything.  I was asked if I wanted a newspaper each morning and I said no.  They brought one to me the first day and I got charged for it.  It was taken off the final bill.  I could hear everything from the rooms next door.  Everything.  I started laughing, quietly, at a show and the neighbor pounded on the wall to hush me.  It was only 10pm and I was not noisy.  I then heard them snore all night.  The construction going on around the hotel is incredibly noisy during the day and they start early.  Upon check out I asked to be charged in dollars instead of pounds.  I was charged for my meals in pounds on a separate invoice and the rest in dollars which with the hotels inflated exchange rate amounted to the hotel gaining an extra $18 per day.  It adds up for a week stay.  I love the location but the hotel is feeling its age and needs a makeover.  I will not be back.",3,2018,04,09
121,Great Hotel,"This gem of a hotel is charming, super well located, with great service. Great breakfast buffet, amazing restaurant on site.  The concierges are really so helpful and kind - making suggestions of attractions, buying tickets, explaining how to get there on the subway.",5,2018,04,09
121,Superb location ,"Stayed for 1 night with a friend , the location was great , never used the underground at all .
The hotel was above expectations, which was great as we had a deal on price . Loved the live piano playing in the bar in the evening , was a nice touch whilst having a drink before we went for dinner . Will definitely use this hotel again ",5,2018,04,09
121,Decent value for a great location,"Our room was nothing to get excited about but was perfectly comfortable with a huge bed and well positioned TV. The rest of the hotel is nice and well appointed. We didn't use the restaurants so can't comment on them, mainly because with such a great location its best to get out and enjoy London.

Very close to Buckingham Palace and its parks and walking distance to most of the main shopping areas. All in all, good value.",4,2018,04,08
121,Excellent,great location and food. The rooms are comfortable but bathrooms are bit small specially if you are traveling from US.The Rooms have ample of storage space. The staff is very accommodating and took care of our needs all the restaurants are excellent ,4,2018,04,08
121,Top Notch,We spent a week in a junior suite at the Taj in London and were overwhelmed by the quality of product and excellence of service throughout our stay.  The hotel is situated just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful and the staff treated us like Royalty.,5,2018,04,08
121,"So close to everything, easy walking distance to tube and Buck House.",Staff were very friendly from the Doorman to the Reception.  Food in the restaurant was excellent especially the curries!!  We would stay there again.  Once the upgrade is finished I think the hotel will be even better.,5,2018,04,07
121,Great deal near Buckingham Palace,"Walking distance to a lot, tube for the rest. Excellent value in a fine hotel. The room was not big, but adequate with a good size well laid out bathroom. Very nice public rooms and a fantastic restaurant. You won’t go wrong here.",5,2018,04,06
121,"Request ""remodeled"" room","The Taj has a reputation for providing a luxurious experience. The hotel reception and restaurants certainly achieve that. The doormen are friendly and helpful.
I have stayed here 3 times: twice in the horrible old rooms and once in a newly renovated room that I had to request and wait for.
Rooms: I have twice stayed in old rooms. I am so perplexed that they don't indicate that during the search process. Those old tubs are downright dangerous to take a shower in. The layout of the older rooms is horrible... tiny TVs in a hallway and nowhere near the bed. 
Bathrooms: older room bathrooms are just dangerous and they should not allow older people to rent them. I insisted that my Mum be put in a new room and they accommodated that request.
New rooms: sea change! Modern and updated. I hope all their new rooms have showers and not the old fashioned tubs.
Tip: light switches in the UK are, for some reason, located outside the room you're entering. So you have to fish around behind the drapes to turn on the lights in the bathroom.",3,2018,04,06
121,Terrific first experience,"We selected The St. James Court because of location, price, amenities and the fact that it is a Taj Hotel.

The location was amazing, a close walk to many sites, and right between 2 underground stations for easy access anywhere.  We contacted the hotel prior to our visit to explain some special needs related to chemical sensitivities.  The hotel responded promptly (from a few departments) and assured us they would take our requests seriously.  When we arrived for check in at 11:30 am we were met by guest services manager Sunaina Soares who escorted us to our upgraded room (early) and reviewed all the precautions taken in advance of our arrival: cleaned room with minimal chemicals; double-washed/rinsed our bed linens; and removed complimentary scented toiletries.  She checked in with us several times during the week as did the housekeeping manager and the hotel manager.  Customer service at this hotel is a high priority.

The room itself was a king suite with adequate space and recently renovated washroom. It was very quiet but didn’t really offer much of a view.  The building is Victorian and doesn’t feel sterile like a newer building.  There are always people at the front door and concierge desk eager to assist with anything.  We had a couple of issues with our in-room safe (turned out to need a new battery) that were responded to promptly.

Our room package included breakfast in the Bistro.  This was a daily changing buffet and made to order eggs.  Staff here were attentive.

The hotel is a 2 block walk from Buckingham, and St. James park, and about 10-15 minutes from Trafalgar Square.  Victoria Station is 10 minutes one way and St. James Park Station 5 minutes the other way.

I wouldn’t think of this hotel as luxurious, but it is certainly pleasant, well staffed and located.  I recommend you consider it.  We would be happy to return.",5,2018,04,06
121,"Old World Charm, meets Modern! Location!","I've frequently traveled to London,and it was finally time for my girls trip!! I had 4 out of our 6 that had never been to this beautifully historic and tremendous city. They wanted some old world charm, with some modern amenities and the Take was just what we needed at St. James' Court. Centrally located to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben & Parliment, and Piccadilly.  Everything. Is. Walkable.  The staff was super polite and professional, the hotel bar served up some great meals and fancy cocktails.  Rooms were great size, for old London!  Only pitfall is if you're going for pubs and food - you're a distance away. But - take a Black Cabbie!! I would come back hands down.  Great spot for a first-time, or returning traveler to London.

PS, turn your towel warmer off! You will burn your bum, or worse if you brush against it! Hahaha! ",5,2018,04,06
121,Location! Location! Location!,This is such a great hotel! Literally minutes away from Buckingham Palace! You couldn't be more central then the St.James. Not only is the location great but the hotel itself is excellent. I truly enjoyed my stay there!,5,2018,04,06
121,Fantastic Hotel and staff,"A fantastic and beautiful hotel, great location for our theatre visit to see Wicked. Polite, friendly and helpful staff, especially our check in and check out lady Valerica, she was lovely. The room was amazing and we were upgraded to an executive double, amazing time, definitely recommend and will definitely be returning.",5,2018,04,03
121,Ruta was very kind,I recently stayed at this hotel after getting really sick in London. All I wanted was a good night's sleep. Ruta was very kind and put me in a very comfortable room. We had a pleasant stay. Thank you!,5,2018,04,03
121,Nice hotel in a very good location,"We were visiting a few museums near Westminster so settled on this hotel for the location, I would definitely stay here again as it is away from the busier tourist areas (even though it is round the corner from Buckingham Palace it never felt too busy on the streets surrounding the hotel) and it is in a good location for different tube stations (mainly St James Park, Westminster and Victoria).  The hotel itself is very nice, the room was a good size (we had an executive double).  The only downside was that the air conditioning had to be kept on at around 21-22 as when we turned it down or off it seemed to make a high pitched noise, we did report it and I think someone came to look at it whilst we were out but it was still there.  All of the staff were very helpful.
We did not use any of the restaurants so cannot comment on them (£30 each for breakfast was a bit excessive considering there are three restaurants within 2 minutes walk with much more reasonable prices).",4,2018,04,03
121,Very Good except one unpleasant staff experience.,"Have stayed at this hotel 2-3 times for work. Location is central which is very convenient, Rooms are decent with good aesthetics and the best part is the hospitality. The staff is professional and know their stuff unlike some other hotels where if you call for room service you have to spend some time explaining to them what you want.
Only once did I have an unpleasant experience where there was a leak in my bathtub which was wetting the walls of the washroom below me and they had to come to my room again and again to fix it. And the concierge that was accompanying the plumber had the guts to tell me that I should use my ""washroom properly"". I didn't understand what I could have done if the bathtub was leaking and that made me think if he was just being racist. He was white, not sure if he was just rude or racist. Have not encountered any such unpleasantries otherwise. ",4,2018,04,02
121,Simply Lovely,Fabulous hotel close to the Buckingham Palace and lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance or a stroll across the park! The hotel lobby is beautiful and attached is a cute garden. The staff was super friendly and greeted us always with a smile.,5,2018,04,01
121,Great Hotel in the Heart of Westminster...,"We spent a week at the St James Court during our London visit.  The location was perfect; easy walking distance to many attractions and the St James Park tube station.  There were also some very nice pubs and restaurants within a few blocks.  We stayed in an Executive King Room, which was a nice sized, comfortable room.  Although we didn't eat any meals in the main hotel restaurant, we enjoyed the lobby bar several times during our week.  So, excellent location, comfortable room and great service, we plan on staying here again on our next visit.",5,2018,03,31
121,Very welcoming,We booked direct with the hotel following a recommendation  I have to say the whole expereince was excellent     A nice warm welcome from pleasant and informative staff.  Our room ( 516) was excellent    This hotel really provudes value for money and is well located for or trip,5,2018,03,31
121,Great stay ever,"It was next to buckingham palace and near the centre of london eye.the room was comfy,clean and big.theyve arranged taxi from/to the airport and all was fine.theyve upgraded us to a larger room.we ate club sandwich as room service and it was fantastic.the bathroom was very clean and all the staff very helpful and polite!highly recommende for everyone and for couples as its a luxurious hotel next to alla the sightings.surely will go there again",5,2018,03,28
121,Luxury and Location,"St James' Court has a boutique feel with big hotel amenities and services.  Great location near Buckingham Palace and walking distance to the tube, which is ideal.  Staff is extremely helpful and courteous.  Rooms are immaculate with lots of fine touches.  Especially like that hotels these days have the USB ports for charging phones.  Buffet breakfast is plentiful with a few items to order at no extra charge.  Love the little bar - cozy and intimate overlooking a Victorian courtyard.  It was lightly snowing last weekend, which made it extra special.  And the bartender knows how to make a martini!",5,2018,03,26
121,"Lovely hotel, close to Buckingham Palace","A lovely hotel, excellent service and of high standard but at a reasonable price.  They   upgraded our room to a suite which was very nice and over looked the courtyard.  We were only there for one night, but would definitely stay again if in London.  Room was very clean and comfortable.",5,2018,03,26
121,Great Stay,"We recently stayed at the Taj for two nights before we left for Scotland. The hotel was very quiet....we just got off a 9 hour flight....had lunch ( restaurant is fantastic....ate breakfast there as well....delish...slightly pricy but service was outstanding)...then a 4hour nap. The room was well appointed, larger than expected and as mentioned, very quiet. We did have a late night leak in the bathroom on our last night....the staff responded immediately and did offer us another room. But the leak did stop so we did stay in our room as we were checking out the next day.  You could see a water stain around the light the next morning so something was going on in the ceiling. All in all, we don’t really have any complaints. The hotel was in great proximity to many sights and some great pubs.",4,2018,03,26
121,Lovely Hotel,"Great staff, very happy. Large clean rooms and the overall decor was very nice. They were carrying out some renovations during our stay but there was absolutely no impact on us so very well managed. Brilliant (if expensive!) Breakfast.",5,2018,03,25
121,Can’t wait to go back! ,"Had an amazing stay at the hotel. 

Before we arrived I had a few questions and staff were only to happy to reply quickly and warmly.

On arrival staff were so friendly and welcoming. When we ended up in a side ally a staff member very kindly escorted to the front entrance. When we checked in the hotel had upgraded us to an executive kingsize room. It was incredible and very generous of the hotel. The room was clean and spacious (two things not to be taken for granted in London we’ve discovered in the past!). Also we had a special chocolate dessert waiting for us as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. 

We enjoyed drinks at the bar during the evening with a delightful piano player.  

The location is great. Just a few mins from st James park tube and 10 mins walk from Victoria. 10 mins walk to Buckingham palace and many, many shops, restaurants, cafes and delis around. 

But without doubt the best bit about this hotel are the staff. Attentive, warm, knowledgeable and nothing was ever too much trouble. I can’t wait to go back! ",5,2018,03,25
121,Fantastic stay! ,"I stayed here for one night in March for our weekend trip to London to see Mamma Mia. The hotel was in a brilliant location just a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. We arrived around 4:30pm and the lady on reception gave us a free upgrade to a suite, we just had to wait 20minutes for it to be sorted. We sat in the reception area and had complimentary Tea and Biscuits which was lovely. The room was very spacious, it was clean and fresh. The bed was comfortable and we had a brilliant night sleep.",5,2018,03,25
121,Uncomfortable stay,"Lots of room for the hotel for the money you pay. Beds are very uncomfortable and left my partner with Cronic back ache to the point it ruined New Year’s Eve night at the mayors firework event which was the whole point of us being here. Staff had very poor English and it was hard to understand. Decor very out dated and could do with a revamp. Not worth the money paid.  These areas need looking at. Would be reluctant to stay again,",2,2018,03,24
121,"Excellent central location, good property!","Very centrally located, a 5 min walk to Buckingham palace and St. James park with larger than normal rooms by central London standards. Good amenities and excellent staff and hospitality. 

Very good outdoor cafe area. The heritage nature of the building meant that business meeting rooms were a bit quirky.",4,2018,03,23
121,Splendid,"We stayed here for the first time after sourcing online. An excellent hotel and would return. Room was very clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and attentive, reception area and bar has a good atmosphere, nice place to stay for a relaxing trip.",5,2018,03,23
121,Wonderful ,"‘Wonderful’

➕ This hotel is simply perfect. I don't understand why it's not a 5*. It absolutely deserves it. The service is perfect. The personal is really helpful and nice. The room are beautiful and clean, the bed is so confortable. The wellness and the fitness center are great. The tapas at the lounge bar are excellent. The only little bad point is the food from the room service ; it is not at the level of the hotel. The savour is not so good.",5,2018,03,23
121,A little disappointed,The staff was amazing a very helpful. They are the reason I gave the hotel a 4. The bed was rock hard and the shower got water all over the floor. We finally figured out how to get the shower to stop spreading water. There was a white stain on the arm chair and several red stains on the carpet. I was really expecting more for the price. ,4,2018,03,22
121,A nice place and very accessible,We stayed in A Taj Hotel for a very short visit last year. A very pleasant experience. Staff friendly and helpful. Our room was huge and quiet - for London. Not hugely modern but very clean and comfortable with a great bathroom. Tea/coffee tray and TV. Breakfast in a bright sunny area looking out onto a walled garden also delightful. Happy to recommend this hotel.,5,2018,03,21
121,Meeting and lunch,"A WONDERFUL hotel with superb staff and beautiful decor. Highlight of my meeting here was lunch at the Bistro. 
Absolutely delicious food and extremely reasonable in price for central London. Thank you for a memorable day and I will be returning again & again to hold meetings and have another lovely lunch as the menu is so interesting and varied. Thank you to Abhishek Shankar for introducing me to the Bistro. Firm favourite for my list of London restaurants. ",5,2018,03,21
121,Poor means the new 5 star,"On check in the receptionist was very pleasant and took down the details very professional. During the brief exchange of words, she mentioned our room being a Junior Suit and that this room was very nice. My daughter with her boyfriend then arrived while i was completing check in so she completed her check in also and used the same phrase, ""That this room was very nice"" This immediately rang alarm bells and not to my surprise our room was awful. Yes it had a sitting room, but waht they did was make the bedroom part like a box room and the bathroom was so tiny that you had to have the door open to use it.
furthermore the cleanliness was terrible, both inside and out in the hallway and staircase.
The service in the bar area was good and pleasant along with the bar food. however the bar area is so small only a dozen people can sit in it otherwise you have to eat and drink in the reception area.
Spa was in the adjoining hotel also.
Overall this is not a 5 star hotel and when complained i was shrugged off. my suggestion is simply dont use this place as you wont enjoy your stay for a very expensive experience",2,2018,03,20
121,"Perfect location in central london, friendly service, comfortable rooms","This charming hotel is in a perfect location for enjoying London.  Just down from Buckingham Palace and St James Park, it is also easy walking distance to Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey.  It's near Victoria and the area of Buckingham Gate is quieter than Piccadilly and some other areas in or near central London so there's very little street noise.  Breakfast includes an Indian-themed dish every morning (like chana masala, yum!) and is beautifully presented with a full selection of traditional British, European, and American breakfast foods.  Rooms are small and simply decorated but comfortable -- nothing fancy but everything you need.  Bathrooms are upscale -- very clean and modern.  The hotel staff are quite friendly; after many years of staying here, I always love coming back.",5,2018,03,18
121,Great stay,We recently stayed one night at this hotel and from the moment we entered the staff were so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us The room we had was cosy and comfortable no problems at allBreakfast in TheBistro was tasty andand nicely cooked we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends ,5,2018,03,17
121,The best hotel in the area,"Definitely the best hotel i have stayed in, in the Victoria/Westminster/st James Park area. Service is exceptional, room exquisite and breakfast amazing. For the price and the area it is definitely the place to stay, undoubtedly thanks to the the service (it’s so good I needed to mention it twice). ",5,2018,03,13
121,Really nice stay in a great location,"Stayed here for one night as a treat stopover in London. 
The reception on arrival was first class, greeted initially by a lovely doorman, and then by the receptionist Ruth, who was so nice and welcoming. 
The room was excellent, extremely comfortable bed and all amenities as needed. 
We didn't eat here, but we did have a few whiskies in the bar before bed. Once we'd had a few, we didn't  even mind they were so expensive haha. Again staff were so attentive and friendly. 
Another two amazing receptionists, Alina and Beata helped us to check out and were so lovely and chatty. 
We would definitely come back to stay here again. Highly recommended stay and so perfectly located to Victoria station. 
",4,2018,03,13
121,A nice hotel with excellent service and good location,"Was surprised to be the guest of the day.  Got an upgraded room and a fruit bowl, glass of wine and some other discounts.  The hotel restaurant was wonderful, and the service throughout our stay was excellent.  The room was spacious and relatively well appointed, but the furniture needed to be refreshed.  The hotel is undergoing a major renovation, so I expect this will be addressed.",4,2018,03,12
121,Wish I had known that the hotel was being renovated,"I did not notice when I booked that the hotel was being renovated.  It's a massive property and does need to be significantly updated, so I applaud those efforts.  The mini suite we booked was comfortable but needs new paint and the bathroom desperately needs a facelift.  Gym facilities have been relocated and are minimal, so don't bother to pack gym clothes unless you're completely OCD and don't mind a very small facility lacking in customary amenities.  Breakfast is good although the dining room is crowded and quite loud.  The location is in an unremarkable part of London full of unattractive government type structures devoid of charm.  The underground stop is quite close, which connects you to the rest of the city easily.  There are other options in this grand metropolis; I wish I'd studied them further.",4,2018,03,11
121,great location historic property excellent service,"two min walk from buckingham palace, mayfair, five min to hyde park, less than 1-1.5 miles to oxford street and strand, broadway shows, quiet pristine area , 10 min walk from victoria station. 5 min walk to shopping centers and brand outlets, lovely comfortable rooms, old world charm with modern amenities. good food. ",4,2018,03,09
121,Carefull - hotell may change you more and then you may not recover the money!,"I've been charged three times more for one night and since one month the hotel has still not gave me back the money. They said several times it was a mistake as they did a double preauthorisation, however the bank confirmed that the money are not just blocked, the hotel took them all. And each time I'm calling they don't know what to say.
Personal was rude and unhelpful, not able to handle this situation. 
Also hotel is not very clean.",1,2018,03,09
121,Luxury Hotel for Less,"We recently stayed at the St James Court while in London for vacation. We stayed for a few nights but loved the property. I work in the hospitality industry and am extremely particular about properties and value. We got a great deal on this hotel and certainly felt like we got more than what we paid for. The rooms were nice and spacious (for a European property as most rooms run small anyhow). Lovely bathrooms, my only complaint would be the water pressure on the shower if I'm going to be picky. The staff was friendly, and accommodating for us. Not a huge ""scene"" if that's what you're into, but it was quiet and had a nice bar and restaurant attached if needed. Great location to walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, shopping etc if you are in for vacation. Would recommend!",5,2018,03,08
121,"Very close to being a grand hotel, but needs attention to detail","This hotel was/is being renovated.  The first room assigned had clearly not been updated since the late 70s.  The furniture was depressing laminate, the walls scuffed and stainged, and the lampshades burned.  The bathroom fixtures were lovely marble but obviously old and very worn.  After complaining a bit, I was upgraded to one of the newly renovated rooms on an upper floor.  The decor on the upper floor room was cleaner and more modern, especially the bathroom.  

I think this hotel will be quite lovely when renovations are complete.  But, I think they need someone who focuses on the details.  For instance, the door security lock on my new room didn't function.  The shower door made a noise like it would break every time I opened it.  Lobby light fixtures were plastic and appeared to still have labels inside the shades.  Random wires showed above the elevator lobby chandeliers.

I don't think the daily breakfast buffet is worth the cost.  The ""scrambled eggs"" had a very mealy texture and were flavourless.  The daily melon offering was labeled ""cantaloupe"" but was invariably actually very underripe honeydew.  Pastries were small and stale -- clearly not made locally or recently.

However, all things considered, I really enjoyed my stay at the Taj.  The staff is very pleasant and helpful and the public areas are lovely and comfortable.  The courtyard is especially nice in the evening.
",4,2018,03,07
121,Wonderful stay! ,"We had a wonderful time! We stayed in the Executive King room, and it was quite spacious and clean. The breakfast was great with friendly helpful staff all around the hotel. It was easy to get to any places in London with great access to tubes and buses! I would definitely stay at the Taj again on my next visit to London!  ",5,2018,03,07
121,Weekend Stay,"Beautiful Hotel with with plain rooms but very clean.
We upgraded to a Suite but it was quite small and not really worth the extra.  
That said we would stay here again as the staff were very helpful and friendly.
Bar area is nice to chill out for a night cap.",4,2018,03,07
121,Top Location,"We stayed at the St James Court during the new year celebrations of 2017. This is a very smart hotel with a great vibe. Food is good and the bar area is a nice place to relax on an evening, after trekking around London all day!
The rooms are to a high standard and the staff are great.",5,2018,03,07
121,"If you isn't satisfied with this, stay at home!","This is by far the best hotel we have stayed at in London, and we have tried quite a few! Situated in Westminster, near the St. James' Park Underground,you can reach most of Central London within minutes. (And a taxi to the theatre district will cost you 10 to 12£). 
From our arrival at  4 o'clock in the morning, due to a delayed flight, until we checked out 5 days later we were treated exceptionally friendly from all of the staff.
Questions asked that could'nt be answered there and then were checked up and given an answer asap.
The room was not to big, but very well equipped. This is the first London hotel where we could use our European type electrical plugs in several sockets. And we really appreciated that it was two good chairs to sit in. The beds were a little bit on the hard side, excellent for us both. 
The bathroom was clean and with a good selection of toiletries. Full size bathtub, and the possibility to adjust the volume on the television from there!
Chocolate on the bed every morning and evening, and a basket of fruit the first evening. Free bottles of water and free Wi-Fi. No noise, as the room was fronting the back yard.
All in all, we will warmly recommend this hotel to all, You surely will have a pleasent stay.",5,2018,03,06
121,Mid week stay,"Beautiful place, very expensive and had builders outside of room. Stayed here with my partner whilst he was on work so I was in the room working for most of the day. Was disappointed to find that building works were being done right opposite our room and they were relentless. Food was good from the bar area, although was slightly disappointed when charged extra for buying a drink from the bar. Service charge should definitely not be included when buying a glass of coke! Also a slightly weird smell on the second floor need a looking into! ",3,2018,03,05
121,Overnight delight,"Just one night, first time, but excellent place to stay at. Checked in early here and was given an instant upgrade. Breakfast deal was offered at £15 pp on check in, and advised it would be £22 the following morning, so we took it. Turns out the breakfast was very good value for central London, especially as it would have been a Sunday morning when everything locally would have been closed.
Free WiFi included
Four separate types of plug sockets in your room, so every country must surely be included.
Bathroom products all good, rain style shower easy to use.
Ironing board, iron, dressing gowns etc all in the room.
Fruit basket, mini chocolates, good variety of tea/coffee all included.
Bed comfortable and street noise minimal for a city, even though we were directly over the entrance and main road. Can’t complain about city noise if we are in a city!
Check in and out handled professionally by reception staff. Misquote was £50 pp for breakfast but that was soon clarified when we were told it would be more expensive then following day at £22!
Will we stay again. At the price deal we got, absolutely. 
Well done the St James crew. Lovely hotel and excellent service provided.",5,2018,03,04
121,Superb stay at St James's Court!,"The service of this hotel is excellent. Very nice staff. The location is perfect on walking distance from all main attractions in Westminister and also very close to underground station St James's Park.  After arrival we got a free upgrade to one of the executive suites. This room exceeded our expectations. Separate bedroom with good quality beds and living area, excellent electric devices, very nice and clean bathroom and of course enough room for a pleasant stay. Every question could be asked at the concierge and reception. Hamptons bar is cosy and intimate. We would definitely come back and recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,2018,03,04
121,Always a pleasure,"Often stay here when working in London. Great location and warm, friendly service. Fabulous, spacious rooms and great range of restaurants. My favourite being Quilon.

Highly recommend if you are visiting London for business or pleasure",5,2018,03,03
121,Amazing stay.... service is unbeatable!,"Everyone from your concierge, reception, housekeeping and waiting staff are just awesome.  I booked last minute and I wasn't disappointed.  The room was just perfect and had everything I needed including a very comfortable bed. Staying in London will never be a chore again as I will rebook here from now on.",4,2018,02,28
121,Old world charm is no longer attractive,The hotel feels jaded . Although Major renovation is going on but some of the renovated rooms don’t feel modern or justified to the price . Food is improved and the bar is also interesting . Overall nice location but check for value .,3,2018,02,26
121,Amazing Service,"So well impressed by St James Court’s TAJ service!

My company chose this hotel as a center of operations during an international conference.

We were all very well impressed with the hotel staff professional service and amazing cuisine.

Well done guys,

Gracias!",5,2018,02,23
121,Just love it......,"This is the second time I've stayed here and it won't be the last.  Very pleasant staff at check in, got  upgraded to an executive room. No view, overlooked the courtyard but considering outside at the front there is building works going on I think we got the better deal.  Also made it a very quiet room therefore getting a fab nights sleep. Extremely comfortable and big bed.  The bathroom was lovely.......always got to be better than you have at home else why bother going anywhere - it's a womans thing I think.
The location is brilliant. You can walk to a lot of the main touristy bits, although there are 2 underground stations near by if you need them.
Didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on that but did have a martini in the bar on the last night which was excellent and came with some lovely nibbles.
It is expensive but if you are not tied to when you go and look out for when there is an offer on it is well worth booking.  
Can't wait to go again.",5,2018,02,22
121,Highly recommended,"Everything about the experience was fantastic, from being greeted at the door to check out. The staff were the best I have encountered , very courteous and knowledgeable. It was our wedding anniversary and a cake was sent to our room, much appreciated. We were checked in late so a lovely note and chocolates were sent to our room as an apology by the duty manager which I thought was very professional. We had an anniversary dinner at the Quillon restaurant which was superb and I have to say the staff were exemplary again. The location was great.  I am reluctant to bring up a disappointing experience as we had such a great time but I think it should be raised. One of your maintenance staff walked into our room at 8.35 pm and I was standing in my underwear and my wife had just got out of the shower and was lying on the bed , he said he knocked but we did not hear him maybe because the TV was on but we got a shock and he left. I would suggest anyone who needs to get in the room should ring first. I want to finish on a positive note and say I will recommend you to anyone and thank you.",5,2018,02,21
121,Great hotel in perfect location,Stayed here for three nights and was absolutely satisfied with it. The room was clean and spacious. The service was great. It was really easy to get to the tube and the area was relatively quiet. I would stay here again!,5,2018,02,20
121,Grand hotel,"Had a lovely stay in this beautiful hotel - the entrance is very grand and gives a great impression. Staff were really friendly and check in was easy.

The room was very clean and comfortable, not the most up to date décor but it was clean. There was complimentary water, which was great, and chocolates on the bed, which is a lovely touch.

The location is good, not far from Buckingham Palace.",5,2018,02,20
121,A great stay - helping make a present weekend even better ,"I had booked a weekend stay for myself and my boyfriend for his Christmas/Birthday present, with tickets to his football teams home game. I noted in the booking that the stay was a present, and was thrilled to find that we were being upgraded when we checked in. Thank you! The room was just as hoped and very comfortable for our stay, with an extra surprise of a sweet treat with ‘Happy Birthday’ written. We very much loved our stay and were sad to leave; the weekend went too fast! The hotel as a whole was great, with a bar we also enjoyed just off the lobby. We will definitely look to come back and stay next time we’re in London. ",5,2018,02,19
121,A very positive 7-day stay (with a few minor points for improvement),"My wife and I stayed in Room 329 between 8-15/2/2018. Paid in Nov 2017 GBP 1100 on a no-cancellation plan, with breakfast. A very good price for a solid 4-star hotel off-season. We were upgraded from a Classic King room to a newly renovated room.
Location: very suitable for us (ages 68/62) - quiet, safe neighborhood, 300m from a tube station, close to Victoria Street.
Check-in: friendly, no hassle (block of 50 GBP per day on the credit card - no big deal).
Lobby: nice, intimate, warm, with a bar at the far end + pianist in the evening. 
Bar: good service, very reasonable prices, nice atmosphere.
Room: good size and lots of storage, safe, minibar (which we didn't use), complementary mineral water. 
Bed: huge. Good mattress. Pillows OK - no pillow menu. Synthetic comforter - not my first choice. Quality sheets, A/C: efficient.
TV: I missed the Eurosport channel while the Winter Olympic Games have just begun!
Bathroom: very good water pressure & temperature, decent amenities. Be careful when stepping out of the bathtub as it has high shoulders. Excellent bath towels. I missed a toilet brush.
Breakfast: overall good selection and very good service - But: poor bread selection (baguette or supermarket toasted white/brown). Limited vegetable selection - only tomato & lettuce (most days); cappuccino quality so-so (maybe the trainee barista on the one day I ordered).
In summary: a very pleasant hotel in a good location and excellent service, with very good value for money - highly recommended!",5,2018,02,16
121,Anniversary Stay,"I stayed for an overnight visit in February for an anniversary trip with my girlfriend and could not have been more pleased with our stay. The staff we encountered were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. Having visited from New York City, we were guided by the concierge on what tubes to take for our destination. 
My only concern is that upon check-out, I had informed the reception staff that a few item from the minibar were empty and did not want to be charged for the missing items. Sure enough, we were hit with the charges but had it removed after speaking the the hotel after our departures. 
Thanks again for an amazing stay!",5,2018,02,14
121,Exemplary Hotel! Wonderful Hotel!," My four weeks at the St. James Taj were wonderful. The hotel is beautiful, my room was spacious and marvelous (although only the basic room advertised), the bathroom was elegant and housekeeping services were exemplary. The staff was all sincerely friendly and helpful and went far out of their way to see that I was comfortable and that each request was taken care of. It was a wonderful experience to stay at the Taj!",5,2018,02,14
121,A very special place.,"We have just had a wonderful stay at the St. James Court hotel in Buckinghamgate London for a birthday celebration.

What a lovely hotel – the staff were so very helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome. They responded quickly to any needs and were willing to help in any way they could.

The room was very clean and warm and all the little touches made it very special.

Breakfast was amazing and so very tasty and the staff were very attentive without being intrusive.

The hotel is very well situated for visiting London attractions and a short walk to Buckingham Palace. In fact it used to be the overspill hotel for Palace guests in years gone by. 

A relative of mine used to work there in 1911 and I have always wanted to see where she worked all those years ago.

The architecture is amazing and the courtyard magical with the fountain and Shakespeare Frieze.

We were able to leave our case early before check in time and go off exploring and when we returned the case had been taken to our room.

Would recommend St James Court and would love to stay there again.",5,2018,02,14
121,Old World Charm in the Midst of City Center,"The best thing about this Hotel when one is greeted soon after stepping out of the taxi. In fact the best aspect of this hotel with the old world charm located in the midst of the city  closer to Victoria Station and nearer to a plethora of shopping and dining places. The constraints this hotel faces that of the larges spaces and lounges that modern hotels offer is to some extent compensated by quality of service and attention. The room service, breakfast, the housing keeping, the concierge and the reception, all of which I found attentive and quick to attend to requests. The rooms are smaller but the bathrooms needs an improvement more in regard to toilet flushes and water mixers. The break fast is not very extensive and elaborate but quite adequate. There are some items on display and some served on special request. Being from South India, I was pleasantly surprised with Idli Chatni and hot Sambar which I found more tastier than in many Indian cities. Compliments to the chef. St James  station is close by that connects to the whole city and Waitrose located in a 5 minute walk and open till 10 pm is good to pick up something that one may want in the late evening.  The drawback is the pricing which is rather steep for a  hotel that offers rooms that are smaller in size and comforts of minimal nature but that does not seem to matter to the hotel that sees steady stream of guests keeping it busy and occupied.  If you are on a business trip where  hotel is more a place to have breakfast in the morning and sleep in the night, it seems to be quite in order. The best thing that I experienced about this hotel is the sound sleep that I had all the five nights of the stay I had there.",4,2018,02,13
121,Mixed feelings,"Yes the hotel is under renovation but remains in the end quite hotel with many dysfonctionning issues.
Rooms don't benefit the latest standard for such hotels.
Wifi is cahotic, the bathroom is small and not equiped with a real shower and the heating system works with difficulty and stops in the middle of the night because set not too work for too long!!!.
However some facilities are okay like the 2 restaurants (that benefited a real and entire reno). Breakfast is fine but not outstanding at all.
The place was quite despite a construction on the same street but it stops every day at 7:00PM.
Despite all this I gave a 4-star rating because the place is quiet and the average benchmark in London remains low.",4,2018,02,11
121,Good Experience,Good place to stay good location. Staff friendly. Charged extra for newer room which should be free as the older rooms not good. Extended the checkout time on request. Breakfast also good with nice selection                                                                                          ,5,2018,02,11
121,Great location but v poor hotel,"The hotel was expensive, the rooms were cold, tired and not very welcoming. They said they had refurbished some rooms but none were available. The Indian restaurant was quite good but very expensive and not value for money",1,2018,02,11
121,Central hotel with lots of character,"We stayed at the St James' Court as we were going to see Hamilton, it was really close to the theatre. We arrived early, around lunch, one of our rooms were ready but the other was still being made up. We checked in, left our luggage, the staff were really helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We were offered an up grade to a 2 bedroom suite but declined this as we knew we would not be in the room for very long. The room was spacious, the bathroom quite small and the toilet was low but the towels were huge, if you are like me larger in statue then I like a big towel to go round me, these were ample and fluffy. We breakfasted across the road in a little Italian restaurant which was charming and well worth a visit. I would certainly visit again on my next trip to London.",5,2018,02,11
121,Beautiful,"The staff were very helpful with directions & sightseeing in the neighborhood. They had maps ready to give and were very friendly! The staff made great dining recommendations, as well. They were helpful with directions to the Underground and in posting mail.",4,2018,02,10
121,3 Days in St James's Court Westminster,"We have just arrived back home in Ireland from a truly amazing stay in St James's Court hotel. From the moment we arrived , we were treated to real 5 star hospitality . Really cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and the location really is in the very heart of London.",5,2018,02,10
121,Excellent Location at a Perfect Price,"The Saint James Court Hotel has become one of my favorites. We just sent 11 days there and loved the place.
With an excellent location, right off Buckingham Palace Gate you are in the middle of London and since we love running outdoors, you have both St. James and Green Parks around the corner making this a runner's paradise (especially St. James Park which is beautiful)
The rooms were very nicely appointed with all the classic amenities you expect in top notch hotel. We had an interior patio Executive Studio which was perfect and pleasantly quiet.
Service in the hotel was really very good with all the staff very attentive. I especially appreciate the service provided by the concierge and Conny who helped us organize our trip to perfection, from trains to restaurants and even a Premier League match.
The bar and grill provide a perfect setting for a nice English breakfast.
Overall a perfect selection to stay and had I known I would probably have booked at the Taj Suites next door that provides a small kitchen and a better appointed suite for a long stay, but overall this was perfect and great price!",4,2018,02,10
121,Lovely break away,"Lovely hotel in a great location. Room was spacious and clean
Only a couple of downsides. The steam room and sauna weren’t available which was a shame and I would have liked to have been told before we arrived. And breakfast was slightly disappointing for healthier options. Otherwise fine, and will be staying again ",5,2018,02,08
121,AMAZING HOTEL,"Our stay was amazing from the very start to the check out. The team is nice and discreet. The bar has great cocktails, coffees and teas. A lot of choices. We had a wonderful Executive King Room, with a very confortable bed, spacious, everything perfectly clean and well decorated. Last but not least, the location is very good as it is central and next to St James’s Park & Victoria stations. Thank you for this stay, it was perfect.",5,2018,02,07
121,Disappointed,"We recently visited for one night when in London. 
Upon entering the hotel we were very impressed by the grand nature of the reception area and seating. Very impressive and stunning.
However once we went round the corner the grand nature reduced. The website promised a lovely view of Westminster or the Taj Courtyard. We had a view of a brick wall! We were upgraded to an executive double, which did not look like the pictures!  The bathroom heating did not work during our stay either.
Having said all that the room was good value for its location and had every you needed. We did complain to the Manager and were offered a return trip with complimentary breakfast and a guaranteed upgrade which is nice next time we come to London.
Very impressive reception area, disappointing room in comparison. Would we stay again, yes, good value and good location for London!",3,2018,02,07
121,Neatly tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Victoria Street,"The location of this hotel at first glance, indicates that there is nothing much going on around it. But round the corner is where all the activity is, which is on Victoria Street that leads to Victoria Station. Most bus routes run through this road and St James Court tube station is just a stone throw distance away.
The hotel has a lively lobby with attentive staff behind the reception desk and the front door. It took a bit of getting used to being this side of London if one is used to staying on the west side. 
The rooms were a tad small even though i had booked a King Executive room but the price i got it at was worth the spend. All the amenities were generously left including water. The garden at the back of the property is like a breath of fresh air, much needed after a long day. If you are looking for a courteous, friendly, safe hotel, this one fits the bill.",5,2018,02,06
121,Definitely children friendly! In Love!,"We (me, my husband, our 6 yo son) stayed at this hotel for 5 nights for our new year vacation.  Unfortunately my son was sick when we arrived in London.  He was vomiting a few times in the hotel, starting from in our bed room when he was sleeping, in breakfast room in the morning, and also in the lobby when we just finished our breakfast.  But instead of giving us some bad face or reaction, the staff were really helpful.  The house keeping staff changed all bed sheets (our bed and extra bed) and even gave us extra towels until we checked out.  In breakfast room, they immediately asked us to change the table while the other staff immediately cleaning up the table and the floor. In the lobby they also response really quick to put the 'slippery' sign in the lobby while the other staff came with tissue box and paper bag for my son just in case if he vomit again and the cleaning lady came to clean the floor. They even tried to make my son feel comfortable because my son was almost crying after vomiting. 

I can't say anything, just thank you, thank you, and thank you for your unbelievable friendly service. We will definitely stay at your hotel again when we come back to London.",5,2018,02,06
121,Taj as usual the best,Once again Taj Hospitality at its best. They are true hoteliers. Rutu at reception- she was super efficent. Concierge excellent and at hand. Wifi super good. Room service and house keeping top ( kudos to the management). What definitely needs to be looked into room 223 is the shower is leaking and this is my 2nd visit where the shower pipe is leaking. Guess all need to be checked. 2ndly the hot water in sink tap is nice and warm but not in the shower. Will be back again for sure,5,2018,02,05
121,"A beautiful Hotel in the heart of Victoria, London.","It's a beautiful hotel in the heart of London off of Victoria. A very quintessentially English experince, with a fine fabric of the Tajness, very typical of any Taj property worldwide. Westminster Abbey and Underground Station are literally a  5 minute walk away. Located just around the block beside the Buckingham Palace Gates.....Parliament Square/Building and Big Ben are just 10 minutes away by walk. Well connected by London's famed ""Red Bus"" with stops all along Victoria Street heading towards popular tourist and shopping destinations across Central London like Trafalgar Square, Regent Street, Oxford Street, Piccadilly and The Thames river. A great experience of Tajness in Central London.....St.James Court!",5,2018,02,05
121,It is an okay Hotel rather than a great one,"We stayed over in London for a few days recently and chose the St James Court Hotel. Lets start off with the staff, they were incredibly polite, respectful and helpful so full marks for their training and commitment to a great service.

The thing that let the stay down was the fact the hotel is tired. The room was comfortable but the bathroom less than appealing. An in bath shower with a tap that, if nudged either way, became too hot or cold. It is clear there has been no investment for some time.

The breakfasts were okay, but for the costs, not good value for money. A nearby cafe left them standing in terms of quality and service.",3,2018,01,31
121,"Great location, nice older hotel, under renovation!","Location is outstanding for business and tourist activities, central to many important parts of London. The main areas of the hotel are somewhat small, lobby, bar, restaurants, meeting rooms, but suitable and nicely appointed. Guest rooms are terrible if you are in the unrenovated areas, the renovated rooms are much nicer, modern and functional. Be sure to know what you are getting. When we were unhappy with our tired old room, they moved us to a nicer newer one. Conference staff for our meeting was very helpful and accommodating!",4,2018,01,30
121,"Location, Location, Location!","The hotel is beautiful, the decor is a bit outdated, but they are remodeling soon.  The cleaning staff, the concierge, the doormen are all unbelievably friendly and helpful. It is literally 3 minute walk to Buckingham Palace.  Westminster Abbey, the big ben are all walking distance.  on the other side is shopping galore on victoria street. Loved it all!",5,2018,01,30
121,Simple but elegant hotel with great service,"This conveniently located hotel is within walking distance of many major London sites. The rooms are spacious, well organized, and comfortable. There are not great views from the windows because this hotel is wedged in a space with many other buildings but the quality of the decor, personable nature of the staff, and excellent food all make up for this. We had a meeting in one of the conference rooms, which was catered with a wonderful array of food and had an excellent set up for audiovisual display. The only other minor downside is that they are reconstructing their spa and exercise room so if you desire exercise, you need to use an adjacent property.",5,2018,01,30
121,Beautiful Hotel. Fantastic staff. ,"All staff really pleasant and helpful. Hotel was in prime location in heart of Westminster. Close to everything. Doorman, concierge and reception staff were really friendly. Rutu, the receptionist was very accommodating and gave us an upgrade to a junior suite which was amazing. 
Really clean, comfortable and welcoming. The bed (queen size I believe) was so comfortable as were the pillows. The added touch of the slippers and robes was lovely. Huge shower in the ensuite was great. Nice comfy little lounge area just off the bedroom was really good. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and will certainly be back next time we’re in London. ",5,2018,01,29
121,Day Long Conference,Very comfortable well appointed hotel.Conference facilities were excellent and the lunch was very good.As a conference venue it is excellent.The staff were very helpful and went above and beyond - so recommended.,5,2018,01,28
121,Fantastic,"My wife and daughter stayed on 25th Jan for one night 
The room was more that adequate, clean and great toiletries with a very comfortable bed. 
The room on the 6th floor over looked a beautiful courtyard 
Location was perfect for what was required as the hotel is just a 10min walk from Victoria Station. 

The best part of this hotel is it's staff, they were so friendly and helpful 
Even delivering my daughter a birthday cake to her room.. 
would definitely return..... fantastic stay 
",5,2018,01,28
121,Great Hotel,"Highly recommended hotel with great service and service, the hotel competes with international chains big time, generous room space and beautiful lobby .

The hotel offers all the required amenities. Will definitely visit it on my next visit to London ✌️.

The property also offers serviced apartments.

Good job Taj Hotel team ",5,2018,01,28
121,You get what you pay for. Not much.,"I wouldn't stay here again.
The Taj hotels I've seen are incredible. This was pretty bad.
Very tiny room - apparently it was JUST renovated....you had to open the bathroom door, then walk in past the door, now you are touching the shower, then you have to close the door or you can't access the sink; charming (not).
Look, it's London, places are small, but this was REALLY unpleasantly small - again, Expedia and you get what you pay for I guess. It is extremely well located - 2 blocks from the District Line tube that goes EVERYWHERE you probably want to go. Get a 7 day unlimited Tube Ticket called the ""Oyster Card"" for zones 1+2 about $50 a person, then you just jump on and off the tube all day long. Worth it for even three days. The hotel was awful - the restaurants, tiny and expensive but the staff in the restaurants were TOP NOTCH - major points for that - the prices and mediocre eats are not their fault. The front desk is a little annoying - I don't like to be bothered when I walk in and out and they said HELLO every time you do this, but maybe that's just me - it annoyed me. I felt like I was being WATCHED the whole 4 days.... They think they are this fancy hotel and they are NOT....breakfast is not included and costs about $30 a person - go across the street, to the left, then cross the street again - there is, just slightly to the right of the corner, an ITALIAN RESTAURANT. Their food - coffee and breakfast FABULOUS and CHEAP in comparison. The owners are LOVELY - great place - but do not mix this up with the LARGE place across the street from the hotel - THAT place is so AWFUL - the staff and the food - honestly, unspeakable - I stamped out of there....  TAKE UBER from the airport to the hotel - well worth it. Oh...and did I mention, don't stay at this hotel unless you get an amazing deal like we did - still - I'd rather stay somewhere with a larger bed, in a larger room with breakfast included :-)",3,2018,01,25
121,Huge room and the most comfortable hotel bed l have ever slept in!,"We came up to London for a birthday party and to view the London Lumiere, as we had stayed at the Taj before and eaten there several times we thought we would treat ourselves and stay over.This time we had an executive room which was excellent , spotless , spacious and with the most comfortable bed l have ever slept in! The breakfast was in the Bistro which is lovely and the staff as usual were very attentive. We had a cooked breakfast as well as some selections from the buffet. All in all it was just what we wanted and once again the staff here really do go the extra mile.",5,2018,01,25
121,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed for a week in January during our vacation in London.  The staff was excellent throughout our stay.   We enjoyed the breakfast buffet a few mornings.  The location was great,  just minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and St James's Park Underground.",5,2018,01,24
121,Lovely Hotel in the heart of London,"We stayed here over a weekend & the hotel was situated close to Victoria station as we came into Gatwick airport so it was really handy. The check in was quick & the guy was extremely friendly & helpful. The room was also very specious for a central London hotel & was decorated nicely. There was some noise from the pipes by the toilet but nothing major (we reported the issue & they were very apologetic).The bar was also lovely with nice music & the staff were very good. We didn’t have breakfast as we felt the price was a little expensive for what we wanted to pay (£22pp) it did look amazing when we looked in though, however we found a couple of places near by. We would love to come back again as we felt we didn’t get to spend very much time here during the weekend as we were out & about so much!! ",5,2018,01,24
121,Excellent experience ,"This was my first experience at a Taj property and I quickly learned that the chain and the property is highly focused on customer service. Every staff member was exceptional and helped to ensure my stay was perfect. The room was also very nice, well appointed and large size. Very convenient to have a 24 hour concierge and front desk staff. Location was also great and quiet at night. I would definitely return to this property next time I'm in London.",5,2018,01,24
121,Conveniently located hotel - undergoing necessary renovations ,"We stayed at St. James court during the last stay in London, for its good location and walking distance to Green park and the city. 
Overall the hotel caters of course mainly to foreigners but its old fashioned the lobby small and not welcoming. The lobby bar is old and worn chairs , and not impressive with furniture, service and cleanliness . The hotel is situated in a lovely but huge complex with renovations ongoing in some parts.
The checkin was friendly but the room not ready, even checking in in the afternoon past 14:30pm.
The room was ok - the bathroom tiny and towels were missing , housekeeping had to be called. 
The lobby and guest entry to the elevators is old , dark and not welcoming. 
The breakfast option is overpriced and not recommendable … there’s plenty of little cafes nearby with better value for money and service. 
One very last experience which was not so impressive was the concierge - or person being responsible for the bell staff in order to retrieve stored luggage on checkout day.. he was unfriendly to guests and even worse terrible to the staff who tried to assist in the departure process. Obviously he felt disturbed using his phone and answering text messages rather than making sure the guests are being served. 
",4,2018,01,21
121,Perfect location - good quality/price ratio,"We spent three nights to visit London with my family.
I chose Taj because a few days before my departure the price was half the one of Sofitel.
Very central and quiet location.
Don’t expect a cozy room : they are ok but deserve a renovation
Our only « disappointment » was the breakfast: if you can choose a location near the hotel",4,2018,01,20
121,Perfect example of a perfect hotel,"When in London for business, this is my go to hotel.  Impeccable rooms, staff and service. I would live here if I could afford to. I have stayed here numerous times and have never had a bad experience. ",5,2018,01,18
121,Great stay... Good value.,"I had a great 8 day stay here. Had an Executive Room which I found a little on the small side, but very comfortable for one person. Overall the hotel was tidy, the staff were amazing and the location perfect. 

Only make minuses I could possibly mention were, it could use a little freshen-up in the corridors and one elevator was out completely use slowing things a bit. If you find the laundry/dry cleaning price a bit high, there’s a 2 hour laundry/dry cleaner steps away.",5,2018,01,18
121,A nice central hotel ,"A good hotel in a very good location in terms of being close to the Victoria train station for connecting to London Gatwick. It's about a 12min walk from the station, there is also the tube on Monday to Friday the entrance closer to the hotel is open and I would take you 3 mins to walk there or 5 mins to the other entrance of St James's Park tube

I also walked from picadilly circus in about 25 minutes 

I was offered an upgrade to a suite including breakfast and took it for £50..well worth it. The rooms are nice and clean, thought the TV is rather small for such a property.

There were signs that they are doing renovations, but I couldn't tell.

The breakfast service staff were absolutely fantastic.

All in all a great place to stay in London. ",4,2018,01,16
121,A real treat!,"We stayed for one night over New Years Eve. From the minute you walk in the door you are treated like royalty.
Check-in went well, we were offered the option to check-in early into an upgraded room for an additional £25, which we did.
The room was fabulous, we have zero complaints. The staff were amazing.
The location was ideal and within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to visit and a 15 minute walk from the embankment for viewing the fireworks.
It was a short visit and next time we'd love to stay a little longer.",5,2018,01,14
121,"Great location, clean and spacious rooms","Friendly staff, great location, clean and very spacious rooms (especially for Europe)   close to tube stop and 3 min walk from Buckingham palace.  I enjoyed everything about this hotel except on 1 instance with our do not disturb sign up they entered my room while I was in shower... back story to this was I asked at front desk for a tooth brush I had forgotten mine... however I told them I was hopping in shower and if they could just leave it outside the door I would check as soon as I got out... I do not know where the miscommunication happened I was very clear and think no matter what if do nit disturb was up they should not have entered... I only knew someone was in room cause the tooth brush was on my bed side table when I walked out of bathroom... Thankfully I showered with the bathroom door shut or they would have seen right in.  I truly believe when Do Not Disturb is up they should never ever enter unless there is a medical or safety emergency.",4,2018,01,11
121,4 star hotel with a 5 star staff !,"This is a 4 star hotel with a 5 star staff you will be greeted with a smile by the staff when you enter their lobby and that is really stunning. The staff is really helpful and especially Elizabeth Gonzalez who is one of the duty managers was extremely sweet and helpful. It was a pleasure meeting all of the staff from the concierge to cleaning staff and to those at the reception. 
BIG thumbs up to them. We had the Executive King Size Room (Room 630) and it was really excellent and we enjoyed it a lot. If I should change one thing I would get a power supply and USB above the bedside tables but other then that everything was just perfect and I would recommend the hotel to others.
They were doing some renovations to some rooms and they should be done in May 2018 so those rooms I assume will be to the same standard as the room we had.",5,2018,01,11
121,New Years Finest,"We booked a last minute stay in this hotel over the New Year Period. 

Sooo Glad we did..... 

What a hotel, everything about it says Traditional British, from Decor to rooms and hospitality. This hotel is very well located with Buckingham Palace literally across the road, Hyde park, Victoria ans westminster so very local. 

The hotel offers a boutique feel so service was very personal and concierge were sufficient at assisting with Restaurant books and general info ie valet parking which we used seamlessly. We were immediately upgraded and were taken to our suite with no delay. The suite was stunning and more than we anticipated, housing a kitchen facility also.

This is definitely a luxury hotel and would definitely recommend for a london visit or a  New Years stop. 

Will definitely be returning to this chain ",5,2018,01,08
121,Excellent Hotel for visit to London,We visited London for Xmas 2017. Hotel was in an excellent location for walking to all the special spots in London with Xmas lights etc. Our King room was very spacious and the breakfast (included) was very good with lots of variety. But the best part of the stay was the staff....nothing was too much trouble and always friendly and helpful. Also has a very nice bar and courtyard area serving drinks and food late into the evening. We would definitely return when in London.,5,2018,01,08
121,Excellent!,"It is a very nice property, well maintained and centrally located. Customer service is excellent. Food on property is very good as well!  Staff was friendly and ready to assist. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2018,01,07
121,Wellness Centre,"I can't praise Maria who gave me a body massage back in Aug 2017! The staff were friendly, helpful, informative and I can't praise this place enough!
I will be back soon for sure, I recommend this amazing place.",5,2018,01,05
121,25th Anniversary!!,"First of all I would like to apologise for taking this long to write.
Having stayed in the Taj in India and more recently in Sri lanka, we were so excited to find the Taj in London. 
As it was our 25th anniversary we wanted to go somewhere special. And everyone from start to finish made our stay very memorable! As soon as we arrived we were made to feel so welcome, and little touches during our stay made it even more special. We felt the warm hospitality that we have experienced in Asia but this time it was right on our doorstep. I would highly recommend this hotel with it's wonderful staff and delicious breakfast and superb lunch at the bistro. The best risotto !
THANK YOU all so much for making our stay so memorable! Looking forward to come back !",5,2018,01,05
121,Worn-out Rooms,We have booked for 6 nights and we moved out after one Night. Classic Master Suite looks nice on the photos when we booked. But on arrival it was totally a crap. The Carpet is so used and it is dusty and smelly. The flush in the toilet is not working. The only good thing about the Suite is the size. Avoid this Suite at any cost & it doesn't worth the money we paid.,2,2018,01,04
121,Superb setting for 50th birthday weekend,"My experience of the St James’ Court has been superb, from the moment I first booked until our final goodbye. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. 

We stayed at the St James Court during the weekend of my husband’s 50th birthday. They enabled us to access our room early and chose us as ‘Guests of the Day’ which included free drinks for us all at the Hampton Bar.  Staff were exceptionally courteous at all times - including by email - which is not always the case even at luxurious hotels nowadays. 

During our stay, unexpected gifts such as handmade chocolates left in our room alongside a hand-iced birthday cake made the stay really special for my husband. This hotel definitely go above and beyond. 

The Taj kids activity bag given to our 9 year old was also really special. It contained a book about London, colouring crayons and even a high quality St James teddy bear which was amazing. Our 16 year old son looked very envious so I think that shows the quality!!

The hotel is really conveniently situated. We had lunch on the day of our arrival at The Quilon next door (see my separate review) and it was so nice to be so close! We walked to Buckingham Palace (5 minutes) and then to the nearby shopping area at Victoria (5 mins). In the evening we went to see Dick Whittington at the London Palladium - a very short tube journey - and to return by taxi was a very reasonable £15. 

We slept really well in our Family Room and enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast on the First Floor as the main dining room was full. The staff at this restaurant were extremely helpful and polite. I must, in particular, mention Salah (there were 2 men with this name and I am referring to the elder Salah) who made sure that our hot chocolate was always topped up and every need was met. 

On our second day we checked out early, but made full use of the ‘Luggage Room’. We visited the London Eye (30 mins walk with a 9 year old) and then later the Sky Garden for brunch. 

We collected our luggage before departing for home, when we were given a cheery goodbye by the Doorman.  We would all have happily stayed another night. I would really like to thank all of the staff for making our stay so memorable. 

We plan to return next Christmas and other family members have indicated that they would like to also.",5,2018,01,03
121,Ideal location for visiting London,"The hotel is in a great location. Easy walk to Victoria street and Buckingham Palace.
The front desk is very helpful and  does a smooth check in.  The morning breakfast  is outstanding.  The staff work very hard they quickly  get everyone in and served.  They worked very hard to get you on your way for the day.  I had requested a room to face the court yard.  I had a great room.  It was quiet away from the street noise.  I had searched
several places.  I am really glad I stayed here.  The staf, food, location and room all added to a great stay.",5,2018,01,03
121,Stayed here on week of Boxing Day/New Year 2018,"Spent a week in this hotel on Boxing Day/New Year.  I only give 5-star ratings to 6-star (Asian) hotels, but this one warrants a 5-star rating for a 5-star hotel.

You can tell the class of hotel with their attention to details (all available in this hotel):
- shaving mirror with lights
- 3-ply tissue papers
- towel warmer
- slippers
- multiple turn downs

Close to all the tourist sites (BuckinghamJam Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, London Eye, ...)

A lot of reviewers mentioned the proximity to subway stations (St. James's Park, Victoria), but my biggest surprise was how close the hotel is to Bus Stations, taking you conveniently to the following frequent locations:

Bus 24 - Lester Square/Trafalgar Square, SOHO
Bus 11 - Covent Garden
Bus 211 - Stamford Bridge (Chelsea FC)

Will definitely be back if I get into the London Marathon in 2019.",5,2018,01,02
121,Disappointing room,"From outside hotel looks amazing, staff is really friendly and helpful. All that greatness finished when we walked in our room. Old style furniture, smelly towels(clean, but smelled of chemicals), gap between window and wall (always fresh air from outside), some stains on the chair. Room provides bathrobes, slippers, iron, hairdryer, kettle. Disappointing and wouldn’t stay here again.",2,2018,01,02
121,Nye stay was amazinggg ,"We booked this hotel as we were off to the fireworks and had a prime location and had great reviews.
I was on crutches due to an op and messaged the hotel prior to see if they could give me a room near the lift. Which they responded and said they will do their best.
On arrival to the hotel we got parked right outside 😃. As no parking restrictions nye or day.
We were greeted before we arrived in the hotel and the man took our bags. 
The lady at reception was very friendly and explained that they had given me a room near lift which I was so grateful for.
The hotel foyer looked very nice, as good as the photos.
We then arrived at our room. We had everything you needed and more for a 1 night stay. Tea/coffee facilities, tv, mini bar, iron/board, hair dryer, bathrobes/slippers and toiletries in the bathroom.
There was alot of information leaflets that was really useful ie menus for the restaurants, spa facilities, room service.
I enjoyed the garden out the back of the hotel. All lit up, was a lovely place to sit. Would be alot nicer in the summer.
We really enjoyed our stay. 5* service and great hotel and prime location.
We will definately be coming back again ",5,2018,01,01
121,Exceptional,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel from 12/23 to 12/30. The service is outstanding. They arranged a Christmas tea, excursions and play for us. The room was immaculate and anything we asked for was taken care of immediately. The hotel is in a good location about a block from Buckingham Palance and a nice walk to Westminster Abbey and Leicester Square. I would stay here again and most definitely recommend it.",5,2017,12,31
121,Treated like Royalty,"We traveled to London over the Christmas holiday and spent 7 days at this hotel.  We asked for an upgrade and paid $25.00 for a bigger bed/room vs the smaller standard room.  The hotel staff at this hotel from the checkin, to the the restaurants, bar, and other staff is exceptional! 
We really felt that they truly cared and wanted your stay to be spectacular.  The room was always cleaned to perfection daily.  
The breakfast was a part of our package and I highly recommend it as paid as part of your package otherwise regular price is £22.00 per person.  
The staff in the Cafe/Bristro was the best!  I have gluten allergies and once they discovered this they had Gluten free bread/toast for me every morning and the Bistro Mgr had Gluten free pastry mini loafs brought in for me  as part of my breakfast.  They take the time to know who you are and treat you like you are royalty.  
We were lucky enough to book this hotel at a discount rate about 10 months in advance and the rate was half of normal room rate. 
Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,12,29
121,Great Location,"My wife and I stayed here from 12/17 thru 12/23.  We arrived around 10am from the US from an overnight flight.  Our room was ready when we got to the hotel however if we wanted to check in we would have to pay 10lb per hour.  This is the first hotel i've personally stayed at where you were charged in this way.  We decided to eat breakfast first while we waiting to get our room key.  Breakfast this day was not included so it was quite pricey (50lbs or so).  The first room we stayed in was ok.  Rooms like other reviews have mentioned are a bit dated and somewhat small which seems to be the norm for places in London.  The location is amazing.  Few minute walk to Buckingham.  St. James's UG station a few minutes away as well so made the commute from the airport rather smooth.  Most of the staff was very helpful aside from one of the breakfast servers who just seemed like he really didn't like his job and was generally rude each day we saw him (didn't catch his name).

Lobby/bar/courtyard all had a very nice feel/atmosphere.  The reason i'm giving this a 3* and not a 4* is primarily due to the customer service upon check out. Towards the end of our trip (2 or 3 days left) after a long day of sightseeing/walking we came back to the room to relax and rest up for the next day (7pm).  Our TV wasn't working.  We called down to have someone come up and fix.  About 30 minutes later no one showed up so my wife and i stepped out to grab something from the store down the street.  We stopped by the front desk and asked them if someone was coming.  They made a call which seemed like this was the first time they were hearing of this.  We come back to the room and their is a repairman in the room trying to fix.  We decided to give him space and sit by the elevators while he worked and just hang out.  Another 30 minutes passed and still nothing.  Long story short, they couldn't fix the tv.  Finally after 3 hours of waiting they asked us what we wanted to do.  At this point we didn't really know what our options were but then they said they could move us so we did.  Needless to say we didn't get to unwind as planned.  The next room was worse than original.  Smaller bathroom, bedroom was slightly bigger, walls looked dirty and the noise was terrible.  Every time someone turned on water you could hear the pumps run at all hours of the night.  

The issue i have is at checkout my wife had asked the breakfast and the extra hourly fee be removed due to this issue of moving rooms etc.  The person went to the back to check with the manager and it turned into a let's make a deal session.  In the end we got the hourly charge (20lb) removed but that was it.  Terrible customer service.  Would not have killed them to remove the breakfast charge and the hourly charge.  

I would stay at this hotel again however despite this but we were extremely disappointed as i don't feel they really showed us what great customer service is all about.",3,2017,12,29
121,Family Lifetime Trip,"We spent the first 4 days of our trip at the Taj St. James Court hotel and could not be happier with our choice.  We had two room and both were amazing, peaceful, relaxing and yet right in the middle of everything.  

Wish we had more time there!",5,2017,12,28
121,Christmas 2017,"We had a fabulous stay at this hotel over Christmas! From start to finish the staff were amazing especially Beata who was very helpful throughout our stay, the food on Christmas Day was amazing and the rooms we had were spacious (Classic King and Executive King). We will definitely be visiting again!",5,2017,12,27
121,Poor room but excellent staff and breakfast. ,"First of all, the good points. The staff were great and I loved that they greeted you each time you walked through reception. 
The breakfast was also fantastic. Good choice and service.
Good choice of tea in the room.
Now the bad points:
Room was one of the worst rooms I have ever stayed in, including in budget hotels. First of all, the room was tiny - looked half the size of the rooms pictured on the website of the same standard. The room was also in desperate need of being refurbished. There was a large stain on the carpet, the walls and floorboards had black scrape marks on them, dents in the wall, cracked tiles in the bathroom. The room was freezing - the heating system was so old it took a long time to heat the room. I spent a lot of time huddled under the blankets. 
When I moved into the Room, there were used toiletries in the bathroom. 
I decided to book here due to its leisure facilities, but these were closed for refurbishment during my stay. 
When the bins were emptied at night, it echoes around and is really loud and woke me up a couple of times.
I also got woken up at 6.30am and then again before 8am on a Saturday by lots of noise from outside. 

All in all, I wouldn't stay here again. You can get bigger, modern, soundproofed rooms elsewhere in London. It was just too expensive for a room in such desperate need to be refurbed. 
",3,2017,12,23
121,Excellent..... again,"This is our second visit to this hotel and again it has been faultless. Superb breakfast, clean and well appointed rooms and all round very good service. Occupies a great location 2 mins from tube and Buckingham Palace. Also had a very good evening meal in their Bistro restaurant and very accommodating for children in our party. Service is fantastic, a traditional approach where nothing is too much trouble.
Great value for money for their room rates. We will definitely come back and would highly recommend to others.",5,2017,12,21
121,Country manor excellence,"St James Court is not for those who prefer the profusion of steel and glass in ""modern"" hotels.The ambience is 19th century it would not be a surprise if Kipling were to be seen in the premises,scowling at the staff. The rooms are comfortable ( if not American Standard in size) and the lifts classic, not needing key cards to operate. Wherever you are from, try the Indian options at breakfast,including Room Service. The Indian food is authentic although the Taj has forgotten to ensure that a Bollywood movie channel gets added to the cable fare. The streets around the hotel,and the parks, are ideal for walking if the weather is kind, and the tiny shops nearby worth a visit. An elegance long past in most locations survives at the hotel, just as it does at the Raj Mumbai",4,2017,12,16
121,One of the best near Victoria,"London hotels are not always the best at least not for the price you pay! But the St James is an exception. The service was great and the room was very spacious and quiet. 
It’s not a cheap one but at least you get what you pay for. ",5,2017,12,14
121,Needs refurb,"Even a 2/3 star shouldn’t have yuk areas as in these photos. I was in the 7th floor (at my request to be away from traffic) but the corridors looked like they they were paper thin walls and the windows were pretty disgusting with rot internally. Bathroom really needs updating. Also it’s a bit cold in here (although it is 0 degrees outside). The windows must be leaking a ton of heat. 
Other than that it’s not too bad. Bed seems comfy. ",2,2017,12,11
121,Comfortable stay in well located hotel.,"I have just returned from a pleasant 3-night stay at this hotel. It’s in a very good location; in a reasonably quiet area (especially at weekends as many of the surrounding buildings are offices/government departments), between Victoria and Westminster, yet very handy for all of London’s attractions. The staff, from the Door staff to the managers, were very friendly and attentive to everyone. They happily changed my otherwise nice room for another which wasn’t located close to an air conditioning unit (the bane of the well travelled light sleeper 🙄). The second room overlooked the splendid courtyard, though sadly, noise from the ongoing building/renovation work in one of the other wings, woke us early on two of our mornings. 

The room was pleasant and comfy despite a very draughty window (covered fortunately with good, thick curtains), and furnishings which were somewhat past their best. The tv was also pretty old and had a poor picture. However, there were plenty of toiletries, good towels and plenty of storage. The bed was quite comfy too.

Breakfast was very good - a very good buffet and hot food choice. Improvements to be made include my usual gripes for hotel breakfasts: provide proper HOT toast, put real butter on the table (especially in 4 star+ premises) and serve your green tea properly!

I’d love to return, but once all the renovations are complete, this establishment will likely join the long list of the “unaffordable to the normal human beings of this world” hotels 🙁.",4,2017,12,11
121,Lovely Stay,"Great stay here - very central, however pricey on drinks. Round the corner from Buckingham palace. Staff were very pleasant and always helped. Room was lovely and great place to stay overall. We never ate here as even when getting snacks it was very expensive. Best tip is to stock up on juice etc from the corner style shop a few doors down. On a bus route and close to tube so also great for transport links",4,2017,12,11
121,A Celebration weekend for two!!,"We were celebrating our Anniversary and were looking for a hotel in this area to stay as it was the perfect location. Previously we have stayed in another Taj Hotel in Maritius which is of a very high standard and thought we should book this lovely hotel.

On arriving at the hotel the Valet service took our car to their car park and we then checked in to the reception. We were shown to our double room on the second floor.
However we were very disappointed with this particular room as not only was it quite small but ther was an extremely freezing cold draught coming from the bedroom window. I looked out of the window and saw the view which was not good at all, full of which looked like the hotel's electricity units!!.

I then closed the curtains in the bedroom to see if there would be less of a draught but unfortunately not. I them telephoned the Reception and they said they would find us an alternative room. I the next half and hour we were offered a complimentary upgrade to a King room on the fifth floor. This room was very nice, warm and much bigger, much more to the standard that we had expected from this very high standard of hotel. 
The Reception Manager was very helpful and provided us with this lovely alternative room.

That evening we had dinner in the hotel restaurant which was also used for breakfast . The food was nicely presented and very hot. Perfect due to the freezing weather!!. 
The next morning we chose to have the buffet breakfast which was very nice. We ordered coffee, apple juice to start followed by eggs, cereal and pastries. All the food was nicely presented and the staff were very courteous indeed.

There was a beautiful Christmas Tree in the reception area all dressed in pink!!. It was very pretty indeed. When we checked out of the hotel The porter collected our suitcases and Beata the Receptionist said she would sign us up for Taj Hotel Loyalty Offers. She was very helpful along with Elizabeth the Duty Manager.

All in all we had a very comfortable stay at this most elegant hotel.",4,2017,12,11
121,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here with my girlfriend will visiting London for a couple of days, great location near Buckingham palace and Hyde park also near tube stations to access the rest of the city. The room was lovely and comfortable.",5,2017,12,10
121,Mostly a very enjoyable stay,"We stayed at the St Jame’ Court for 5 nights in December and overall it was a very enjoyable stay. For the price that we paid it was certainly more than ok. Nice room, amazing breakfast buffet, perfect location for sightseeing and close to all other areas within a few underground stations. 
What led to give this an only “average” rating was the very different treatment from various staff members that we received. While breakfast for example was always a pleasure and our dinner at Bistro exceptional, staff at the hamptons bar was repeatedly inattentive (we didn t feel welcome and had to ask for drinks several times, a second ask for the menu was just ignored overall). Also while staff at the enttance held up the doors for some guests, for us and others this service seemed not available...
We are well aware that things were busy and can t always be perfect, we just had hoped for the extra mile in service...",3,2017,12,07
121,"Lovely hotel, great area","While visiting London I stayed two nights at the St. James court hotel with 6 friends.
I had a large double room #266, I was surprised how large the room was for London standard.  They have a small but comfortable bar area where we had drinks each evening, service was very good.  Breakfast was excellent.  The hotel is very close to Buckingham palace with many shops, restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance.  Really enjoyed my stay, would stay again.",5,2017,12,07
121,EXCELLENCE,"have stayed here several times and this hotel never ceases t amaze me with the attention to detail, staff are always friendly, food is excellent and overall location makes this hotel excellent value for money",5,2017,12,04
121,Service by the bucket full,"This perfectly wonderful hotel offers everything. Stylish, beautiful architecture and staff customer service second to none.

This hotel building is hundreds of years old and as such it is occasionally going to have decor and bits that need doing. But who cares,,,.Rooms are clean; comfortable and crisp clean sheets; towels,dressing gowns. Water is lovely and warm and a complimentary newspaper is hooked on your door each morning on request. If it’s raining: fear not an unberella is offered at the door.

The court yard is an amazing place to sit for a few quiet moments and the array of restaurants are all fabulous.

Conveniently situated near the station : the palace is a few moments walk as are shops and parks.

Heaven",5,2017,12,04
121,Superlative service,"We stayed at this hotel a number of times, and will never stay anywhere else in London. The service is the best that we have ever experienced anywhere in the world including places like the Waldorf in New York.
The staff at all levels of the hotel are fantastic -from the doormen, concierge, check-in and the people running the hotel, or understand customer service. The service is not done in a brash way as it is in some hotels, where it feels very obsequious and false, but rather very quietly, genuinely and a feeling that the staff really care about you.
We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite, without ever having asked for it, and my requirements as a wheelchair user were met and understood, and I was never made to feel that my questions were stupid.
I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Every floor has little incense stick dotted around the place leaving a beautiful light fragrance. The colours in the hallways on each floor are very restful pale green and pink, little tables around with lovely glassware.

The incredibly fantastic Guest relations manager Sunaina made my husband and I feel as if we were royalty. She came to greet us upon arrival and arranged for a beautiful plate of macaroons to be in the room to greet us upon arrival. She even arranged to have two single beds put into the room instead of the king-size bed which enabled me to use my mobile hoist.

As I said at the beginning, this group, and clearly this hotel and their management team and staff at every level completely understand customer service and how to make their guests feel at home.

I could not recommend them enough.

And, the hotel is within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Victoria station and all the major London attractions are a short walk away.

Thank you to all at the hotel for a memorable stay.",5,2017,12,03
121,Hit and miss accomodations,"The people were lovely and helpful, but my lower level room was incredibly far from a (working) lift, and faced a very noisy area of construction that put me at eye level with the construction crew.  The hot water ran erratically in the shower.  So, the nice toiletries were cancelled out by the burning/freezing exercise.",3,2017,12,01
121,Excellent!,"From the moment of arrival, everything was perfect. We were made to feel welcome by all we encountered. The room was comfortable & immaculate. Excellent food options at hotel restaurants. Looking forward to our next visit!",5,2017,11,30
121,An Oasis in the Heart Of London,"This is just a beautiful Hotel, the rooms and suites are well appointed and are extremely comfortable. There is a gorgeous outside internal square that leads to a very good restaurant that provides excellent West Indian food. For location, quality, cost and dining stay here",5,2017,11,30
121,Wonderful visit,"Luxurious hotel, great service! One of the best hotel that I visited.
Anna from the reception was very helpful 
Loved the atmosphere very elegant the room was very spacious and clean and the location was a winner",5,2017,11,29
121,Extremely Noisy Due to Construction,"Beware: They are renovating the hotel and there is construction going on across the street on the south side of the hotel. The hotel very kindly put us in a room literally right next to the area they are renovating making it practically uninhabitable during the day due to the noise. The neighboring construction noise would last until 9PM.

Toilet in the room wouldn't flush properly...likely because the entire bathroom and room looks like it hasn't been updated since the Victoria age.

When we booked on Travelocity we booked a rate with ""breakfast included"" that the hotel later said actually did not include breaskfast. Only after multiple e-mails did we get that sorted out.

Entire experience really just disgraceful.",1,2017,11,29
121,Another Wonderful Visit,"This was our second visit to this hotel this year, staying in an Executive King Room with breakfast included, and nothing could be faulted. In my previous review, I neglected to mention the hotel staff. I have to say that they are probably the most helpful, friendly and courteous hotel employees that I have come across.",5,2017,11,28
121,Mediocre ,"Very disappointed with hotel and it's family room .poor ventilation and light .wanted to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary with Taj but turned out very depressing .check inn took 25 min because of ameture staff who was very slow .expectec better room for the price we paid and specially because we mention arriving to celebrate our 25 wedding anniversary was expecting better view room but that was very sad.no flowers no fruits etc.
Gave us an far end corner room with dirty trays outside the passage.
The staff seems are least interested in their duty with Sad faces and are working for the sake of it .
 Sad this comes from Taj being my favourate chain and that too being a gold inner circle member .Very disappointing .......",1,2017,11,28
121,"Good Location, Great Service","I stayed at the St James' Court for the tail end of a business trip in London.  The hotel is in a good location, close to the tube and walking distance to Westminster, Buckingham Palace, St James Park, choices for food.  Other sights were a short train ride away.  The staff were all courteous and friendly.  I would have to say that service is impeccable.

My room was of reasonable size albeit somewhat dated.  It was also quite a distance from the elevator and seemed to be in an older part of the hotel.  Of concern was the fact that there was a sign on the bathroom door indicating that the door should be shut while showering to prevent the fire alarm from being triggered.  The hotel is in the midst of renovations so hopefully, this is something that will be 'corrected'.  I did get a pretty good deal despite booking relatively late so I would still consider this hotel to be a great value.",4,2017,11,26
121,"Courteous service, excellent value","The Hotel is centrally located in Westminster, the service outstanding and the rooms comfortable and well appointed. We stayed at the St James during the initial days of our visit and switched to a Mayfair Apartment after returning from the Southern Coast. We almost left those accommodations in the late hours to return to the St. James. Next trip to London we will book all evenings at the St James. Of note, Beata at the front desk proved to be exceptionally helpful!",5,2017,11,24
121,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at the St James Court for a week.  The hotel is very easy accessed by tube, just get off at St James Park station and walk about 3 minutes.  The staff is very friendly and the room is very nice.  The only complaint is the washroom is a bit small, other than that, the room is perfect.   The breakfast buffet at Bistro is excellent and the Michelin starred Indian restaurant, Quilon is right next to the hotel.  There  are a couple nice restaurants near the hotel.  Although it's a bit pricey, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,11,16
121,"Well situated, friendly staff, Taj Hospitality!",Stayed here in October and was very happy with the service and the food. The rooms are fine with decent size bathrooms. Ideal for people looking for a good looking hotel that located close to most of the sights and sounds of London.,4,2017,11,16
121,Great overnight business stay,"The scene when you arrive is amazing. A wonderful look and feel to the lobby.  Check in was swift, I was greeted with a smile and treated as a person - a great start.  I was in a double room on the 5th floor.  The room was clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated.  There was plenty of hanging space and hangers in the double wardrobe. There was an iron and ironing board and trouser press.  The tea tray was well stocked with a decent selection of teas and coffees.  The bed was very comfortable, linen great quality and well aired.  The bathroom was immaculately clean, complimentary toiletries were high-quality, and the water pressure in the shower was excellent.  The heated towel and heated mirror were nice touches.  
I had a good night's sleep and there was minimal traffic noise from the road.  However, at 6am I was woken by deliveries outside.  I cannot say whether they were delivering to the hotel.  Breakfast had a good selection of fresh fruit, cooked and cold food.  I had mushrooms, beans a chicken sausage and a rasher of bacon.  Quality was excellent, but the food wasn't as hot as I would have liked - that was my only negative observation of breakfast.  Alan waited on me and he was superb.  Attentive but not overbearing, and very polite.
This isn't the cheapest place to stop for an overnight business trip but you cannot doubt the attention to detail and overall quality.  In the room there is a need to upgrade the television to a 32"" as it is too small to watch from the bed. 
I will be happy to return for future stays.",4,2017,11,16
121,Another fantastic stay,We had to return to this hotel after our last visit. Not only is the hotel itself wonderful so are all the staff who do everything to make your stay special. Our welcome started with Isabella who checked us in. What a great fun lady she is. The ambience is brilliant and is reflected in the way guests appear so comfortable lounging in the lobby and enjoying a glass of wine. The fact that the manager Mr Gagan Sharma replies personally to all comments on this site speaks volumes for him and the confidence he has in his hotel and his staff. The location is superb. Our room was fabulous. We will continue to return..,5,2017,11,15
121,Great Location & Service,"Pros:
Location, just 100m from Buckingham Palace
Excellent Service
Breakfast is superb

Cons:
Room size very small, as compared to Taj Standards
Hotel is bit far from shopping area, almost 1.5kms
no swimming pool",4,2017,11,14
121,Good but not great!,"We stayed here for 3 Nights in November, 2017. 
Pros:
1. Staff is very helpful, warm and friendly.
2. Good breakfast.
3. Cycle stand is right in front of the hotel.
4. Buckingham palace is 2 mins away.

Cons:
1. The rooms are outdated and few of them are extremely small. Not upto the Taj standards. Average toiletries. 
2. No swimming pool
3. Interiors of the room and bathroom is also sub-standard.
4. It is close to Buckingham palace but not close to the shopping area, namely oxford street, regent street, etc. So thats a disadvantage.",3,2017,11,14
121,Remberence weekend.,"This was our 2nd visit to St James' Court Hotel in 5yrs for our London weekend. The door, reception, bar and restaurant staff are very pleasant, helpful and professional. The rooms are clean, with comfy beds and are serviced well. The recent change of ownership to a Taj Hotel has secured a major refurbishment program for the coming year in 2018. The Indian influence and clientele direction is already apparent in the decor and food choices at all meal times. Looking forward to paying a visit to the hotel on our next trip to London.",4,2017,11,13
121,Excellent as always ...,"Recently visited for the 4th time and they made our stay special as always . Excellent Taj service throughout , always going above and beyond to ensure things run smoothly . Great location , overall a good choice for a luxury stay in London . Would recommend going for at least a studio room to make the stay extra special . Will be back soon!",5,2017,11,13
121,Amazing !,"Good location, nice room. Although most of my time I spent outside whenever i came back had a good night sleep.Recommended to friends and family for sure. 
Whenever you are staying here, get a good long walk outside! so worth !!!",4,2017,11,13
121,Elegant older hotel near Buckingham,"Lovely hotel, conveniently located close to a Tube station, and near Buckingham Palace.  Beautiful older property, nicely updated. Big room, nice bathroom. Free wi-fi. Great caramels at front desk. Would stay here again!",5,2017,11,11
121,Good old Taj but tired,This is a very classic hotel.  Good reliable Taj service.   Very charming lobby.  Excellent and quiet location.  Rooms are tired but comfortable.  They are refurbishing.   Breakfast is decent for a London hotel.  I will return when it's refurbished. ,4,2017,11,11
121,Third visit to this Hotel,"This was our third visit to this Hotel, however, I was a little disappointed this time, due to:
*  this booking was made through a deal with Expedia, and the rooms that we were allocated were far from substantial.  We had two rooms and one of the rooms was so tiny and the window looked onto (five centimetres away) a complete brick wall.
*  I asked (and we stayed four nights with two rooms) for one room to be made available early on the day of arrival - they couldn't do it.  I then asked if I could have late checkout on day of departure - they were going to charge me for each hour I used the room.  

You would think that returning customers would be looked after - I'm going to St Ermins down the road next year!!!!",4,2017,11,08
121,Very good hotel and good price/value,"Stayed 3 nights at this hotel. I guess it is the more economic version of the Taj hotel next door.  Room was spacious, bathroom small, such that you practically had to climb over the toilet to get into the bath and shower. Showerhead sprayed unpleasantly hard water sprays. Recommend to replace by more gentle  showerhead. Only other comment is that master light switch is next to door upon entering, not next to bed. You need to get up to switch lights off. All bedside lights and lights next to couch need to be turned on and off individually.  This may be comment of spoiled travelled, but I found it a bit of a hassle. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was well appointed . I would come back to St James Court. ",4,2017,11,08
121,Affordable hotel in London,"We travelled for my husbands birthday and found this hotel to be affordable and well positioned in London close to a lot of tourist attractions.
The service was good, but the rooms need a little attention.
The bathroom size is good with a bath",3,2017,11,08
121,Never disappoints!,"I always stayed in Taj Hotels while doing business in India - this was my first visit to a Taj outside of India - and I was just as happy in London as I always was in India!  The rooms are fine - nothing special, but have everything you need - and are super clean!  Service is excellent - room service is provided twice each day - and the staff respond right away to any requests.  The hotel is in easy walking distance of many of the main London attractions including Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square etc...  We had breakfast included with our stay - and it is wonderful - a large buffet (including eggs cooked to order if you'd like) to get your day started right!  There are also several good restaurants both within the Taj and nearby.  All in all a great London visit!",5,2017,11,07
121,Tired looking rooms,"Very tired looking bedrooms and corridors. Awful smell in the corridor (smelt like sewerage). Bathroom was awful....shower didnt work properly and the shower curtain design meant that the water flooded out onto the floor. General areas in hotel were lovely, clean, and inviting. Understand the hotel is due to have a refurb.....the bedrooms and bathrooms definitely need it. Do not think we will stay again.",3,2017,11,06
121,"Great location, super restaurant (Quilon), poor rooms, average service","I stayed here for a week last month whilst on business. I am a gold TIC member. I tried to use one of my upgrade vouchers, which was declined. The room they gave me when I checked in almost made me weep. It was dingy, in average condition, totally outdated and with a view of a wall. I returned to the front desk and told them I was checking out. And voila, they found me an upgrade which they could not do 30 mins ago. For 250 quid a night, the room they were trying to pass off was ghastly. The upgraded room they gave me was acceptable.

The location of the hotel is super for tourists and for those looking to reach the City.

Breakfast was poor - after the first day here i walked across to the restaurant across the hotel for a much better and cheaper breakfast.

I understand the hotel is about to undergo a refurbishment - overdue I think.",3,2017,11,05
121,A wonderful Taj hotel in London with an Indian touch,"I enjoyed staying at the St. James Court hotel during a recent business trip. It was my first stay at the Taj hotel in London. As a Taj hotels fan, I must say that getting an Indian breakfast and a Masala omelette at The Bistro and that too of high quality was a big plus point. I loved the lunch and dinner at The Quilon. Drinks and snacks at The Hamptons was a very pleasant experience too. The period architecture of the hotel makes it stand out. Although a late check out was not accommodated, a hospitality room was provided. Overall, a wonderful experience. I shall be back. ",5,2017,11,04
121,Great Property ,"Excellent location, nice and spacious rooms. Very luxurious however i did feel room service could have been better. Overall it really serves our holiday purpose and the staff was extremely courteous and nice. ",4,2017,11,04
121,Quiet stay in serene neighbourhood,I stayed there for few nights for a business trip which I attended a conference nearby. It is a quiet neighbourhood especially after office hours. It's close enough to metro station. Rooms are clean and spacious enough. The shower head inside my room was quite weak which was the only down side of my stay.,4,2017,11,03
121,Excellent,"Hotel is excellent services are to good I love to stay again and I like to be with my family and the staff are good all staff are very cooperative I enjoy staying in take hotel wonderful stay I enjoy and I m planning to come back again

121,Excellent Location - Mere Walking Distance to Victoria Station,"A luxury hotel in Westminster that gets high marks for its location. It's just moments away from Victoria station while also in close proximity to St James' Park and Buckingham palace. 

Check in was quick and efficient by the very friendly front desk staff while my room, a double, was more that adequate for me, space wise, as a solo traveler but should also be fine for a couple. No real views as my room faced the back of the of the building (I was on the 7th fl) but the furnishings seemed nice and in order with no sign of wear. 

The bathroom seemed fairly updated and it was spacious, including designer bath products.  The glass panel on the shower tub is a bit of a tricky thing as these sorts of styles tend to be but learning to manage it ends up being fine. Closet space was decent and the complimentary wifi was a nice touch.

Overall, a fairly decent experience.",4,2017,11,01
121,Great location ,"The location is key to this hotel , very central and convenient for both sightseeing and business trips. My room unfortunately on this stay was very tired looking and needed a bit of attention, especially the bathroom. I was on the top floor during this stay and must say the room was peaceful and I did have a good nights sleep. The communal areas are lovely with a good bar/ restaurant. Breakfast was served on time as requested, I’d have liked a bit more information on checking in on what options were included in the room service breakfast. ",3,2017,10,31
121,Miss,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Taj Hotel in London for one night and we absolutely loved it. 

The hotel staff are very polite, helpful and make you feel comfortable. The restaurant food in Court Yard was amazing (bank westminister)

The room in which i upgraded was fabulous.

Overall we were extremly impressed and would definalatly visit again. The loccation to this hotel is perfect. You are central to all tbe main attractions but also have Knightsbridge walking distance for your shopping spree 😁

I highly recommend this hotel A++++++",5,2017,10,31
121,Excellent Hotel,"We have stayed here 2 times and it was fantastic both times. The entire staff was friendly and helpful.  As soon as the door is held open for you and you walk in the lobby, you are made to feel special and important. There is always someone there to help you with directions and suggestions. The rooms are luxurious and very comfortable.  Breakfast was very good. They have a buffet or you can order off the menu. I did not care for their dinner but others liked it. The location is walking distance to Buckingham Place and in a great area.We felt very safe.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,31
121,Favorite hotel in London - amazing again,"As a regular visitor to London, I’m glad I found St James Court on my last trip in June.  We’re staying here again and it’s just a fantastic hotel.  On this visit my adult son is with me and we have the family suite.  The regular rooms are very large but the family suite is even bigger.

The room is very comfortable and stylish with two queen beds and a large living room area.

The restaurant (Bistro 51) is great with a wonderful breakfast buffet. The staff is always the nicest you could ever hope for.

I love it - can’t imagine I’ll stay anywhere else on future visits.",5,2017,10,29
121,Fabulous Stay in Elegant Surroundings,"I stayed one night here for a dinner at the House of Lords. My taxi was greeted by a brocaded uniformed concierge with a top hat who swept me in to the reception desk. Another courteous member of staff registered me and sent me to my room.
It was quite a long walk from the lift but my room was lovely - very comfortable and soundproofed as I could barely hear any noise at all despite being in the centre of London.
The bed was extremely comfortable with quality linen and I had everything I needed including discreet air conditioning, warm fluffy towels on a heated towel rail and beautiful toiletries.
I really enjoyed my stay and wished I had stayed longer !

Breakfast was superb - again elegant with tables with space around and courteous service. Beautiful food - I absolutely loved it.

I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to discerning friends. One of the most impressive hotels I have stayed in.",5,2017,10,27
121,"Great hotel, great location","The hotel is within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and many other sites.  Beautifully decorated lobby with Concierge, valet service and doorman.  Inviting bar and lovely restaurant.  The guest rooms vary in size and ours was a good size.  Very clean with bathrobes and slippers, coffee maker, mini bar, etc.",4,2017,10,27

121,Lovely Weekend in London,"My friend and I went to London for the weekend and stayed at the St James Court, A Taj Hotel. We didn't let a little rain get us down. The hotel Doorman was very helpful as well as the Concierges. I am slightly disabled, I walk with a cane and finding someplace for Lunch, Starbucks and a pharmacy, being far from home any help is appreciated.  We had a Jr Suite, with a shower, as I can't climb into European Bathtubs.  We had Room service for breakfast and it was out of this world. Just wish we were warned that the early check in was 20 pounds and hour charge, we got in to London at 6:00AM.

Two block walk to the side of Buckingham Palace, Cabs were always available and everything is pretty much a few blocks or cab ride away.  Oh Yeah, Make sure you remember the chocolates and caramels at the check in desk.",4,2017,10,25
121,"ABSENCE of CUSTOMER SERVICE, CARE and INTEGRITY","Relying on the representations of The St. James, we expected to have pleasant accommodations to celebrate our honeymoon in London. There was no care, consideration or effort exhibited by The St. James either during or after our stay. The St. James admits that our accommodations were adjoining a major construction site, with heavy equipment and a work force operating directly outside our window from morning until evening. In response to our multiple requests for relief, The St. James only offered another room adjoining the construction area, which we were told was subject to the same nonstop commotions and noise.  In 5 separate conversations since our honeymoon, the St. James staff has acknowledged the problems described above. During several of these telephone calls, we were promised a prompt and reasonable resolution by management and we would receive a follow-up call from the appropriate manger. Instead, no manager has called despite these assurances. Beware of the care, candor and credibility of St. James.",1,2017,10,25
121,High End in city center,"The hotel is definitely top class and it is a 10 minutes walking from Buckingam Palace. All there is top class from furniture, to quality of service up to breakfast. Definitely recommended if you wanna spend some time in the city",5,2017,10,24
121,Excellent stay!,"We stayed at St James Court for three nights whilst attending a family wedding and had such an enjoyable stay were thinking of returning in spring next year. Although the hotel has many positives including an incredible location its biggest asset are the staff who were all first class friendly, helpful and professional. We had dinner in the Bank Restaurant where the fillet steak was as good as I’ve tasted we also a tasty evening meal in the Bistro Restaurant. Highly recommended.",5,2017,10,23
121,Just ok... toilet broke. ,"Our stay was just ok. The rooms are definitely on the smaller side and are on the older side as well. My family was there as well and their room was much larger depending on where you were actually located.

Unfortunately also our toilet broke which was a frustrating thing

However, The location is good though in terms of the major sites which are in walking distance and a good fish and chips restaurant but since it is in the more business district area it can be a little sketchy at night.

Overall just OK.",2,2017,10,22
121,Great stay!,"Stayed here for a week in early October 2017 and had a great time! The location can't be beat - very close to two tube stations, a mall, and major tourist attractions (Buckingham Palace and St James Park). We arrived before check in time after an overnight flight from the US and the staff helped us get our bags settled while waiting for our room. We went out to lunch while we waited to check in and once our room as ready (about an hour), we recieved a call from the front desk and were able to go right up to our room and our bags. We used the valet parking service one night for our rental car, which was a quick an seamless process despite not having a booking. The room is comfortable but a bit small, which is to be expected in London. My husband and I each had a suitcase and there is no real place to put them, so we had them laid out on the floor for a week and just had to kind of walk around them. We couldn't get the tv to work, but not sure if that was a room issue or user error. Since we weren't in London to watch TV, we didn't really worry about it. One thing I was disappointed in was the lack of USB chargers in our room. I had read earlier that the rooms included them, so we did not pack converter plugs for our trip. We must have been given an older room because our room did not have any USB ports, so if you are thinking of visiting without a converter plug you may want to  bring one just in case.",4,2017,10,20
121,Wonderful stay in a wonderful location,"What a gem of a hotel! I had previously lived in London ten years ago and was looking forward to returning with family who had never visited the great city. I opted for the St James’ Court due to its location near the center of Westminster within walking distance to Victoria while being in a quiet location outside of the main tourist centers like Covent Garden and Oxford St. 
I was pleasantly surprised by its generous, warm customer service, lovely accommodations, and superb courtyard. I thought the price was very reasonable and enjoyed my stay. I would absolutely stay again. I also recommend The Phoenix for great pub food nearby. Mahalo nui loa to our friends at St James’ Court for making London feel like home again and making the trek from Hawaii worthwhile.",5,2017,10,19
121,Excellent Accomodations,"Front desk staff, restaurant staff, food quality for breakfast, concierge staff friendliness, location within London, cleanliness of the rooms-property, walking distance to Underground were all just great.",5,2017,10,19
121,The perfect stay!!,"This hotel was the perfect stay.  First of all, it's location is very central to most tourist attractions.  You can easily walk to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, London Eye, Trafalgar Square, and I could go on.  It is an easy walk to local tube stations.  The service...wow!  The doorman will always hold the door for you and the concierge will answer any question you have.  Need a cab, there is a taxi rank right outside the hotel.  Laundry service available, which we used, amazing!  Turn down service, room service, very good!  We checked in early after an overnight flight.  The front desk was gracious enough to let us check in early.  The room, very very clean.  Bed comfortable.  Pillows a little flat, but after asking, we were given fluffier pillows within 10 minutes delivered to our room.  Restaurants offer good selections if you don't want to go out.  Room service, oh my, wonderful!  The breakfast, which was included for our stay is the only part that could be improved.  It is a wide selection, but is the same thing everyday.  Also, and this could be in part because I am from the southeastern U.S. it was just okay.  If we hadn't already payed for it, I would have went elsewhere.  My husband and I stayed here 5 nights.  If back in London, I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2017,10,17
121,Birthday celebration ,Loved this hotel. The staff were absolutely brilliant. They really couldn't do enough for you. There was a wide selection to choose from at breakfast and the food was lovely. As it was a special birthday I was treat to a complimentary dessert which was delivered to my room! What a lovely surprise!!! Excellent location for visiting Buckingham palace and Westminster and also a short journey on the tube to Piccadilly and the West end. Really enjoyed my stay and would definitely return! Only one minus would be no nice view from our hotel window but that really didn't spoil our stay!,5,2017,10,17
121,Amazingly Superb!,"This hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed in. Hotel is clean, luxurious and superbly taken care of. The over 400 yr old hotel has amazing rooms and a superb staff. Complementary newspaper, chocolates and water and a staff always going the extra mile to ensure a great stay. 
Each time I go to London, this is where I will stay. Close to Buckingham Palace (less than 5 min walk) and two different Underground stations (St. James's Court, Victoria) 
Just beautiful!   ",5,2017,10,16
121,Wonderful hotel! ,"The hotel was an amazing part of our stay, the staff was super nice, when we checked in we mentioned we were on our anniversary trip and the receptionist was super nice and gave us an upgrade! We particularly loved the lobby bar, they have great drinks and the complimentary olives were delicious. It also has a great location if you want to be near the touristic sights!  ",5,2017,10,16
121,Comfortable hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for business for a few nights. The feel in the lobby of the hotel is very luxury (e.g. the door is opened for you). The staff is very friendly and I noticed that on the first night my room had had an ""open the covers"" visit whereby the bad slippers were left next to the bed. I found the bed very comfortable to sleep in and the room was very complete with its contents. A nice touch was also that on the second night I was given some complimentary fruit.

Slight downside for me was that the window of my room on the 2nd floor seemed to be very close to the staff or kitchen entrance meaning that from c. 5:30am there was a lot of noise with talking people and (what sounded like) containers or bins being transported. (but I am conscious that I live rural and am therefore not used to much noise around me)

I did not have breakfast in the hotel, so cannot comment on that. There is a Pret-a-manger across the road, so handy for a quick grab-and-go breakfast if you do not have much time.",4,2017,10,15
121,awesome stay,"Spent 4 nights here last week, and cannot say enough great things about this hotel. First of all, the location is great. We were right in between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. It was about a 10 minute walk to either sight. It was also only a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube station.  The free breakfast was terrific, lots of options both cold and hot. They would also cook you eggs or an omelette to order. Our room was super quiet, on the 6th floor, overlooking a pretty courtyard.  The staff was great. They called us at 10:30 am to tell us our room was ready, even though check-in is 2 pm.  The concierge was always ready to help us out with directions or dinner recommendations.  There are lots of good pubs within walking distance. Highly recommend this hotel !!!!",5,2017,10,15
121,Outstanding service,We have stayed here the past few nights and I cannot express enough just how fabulous the staff are. They are attentive and personable. They go that extra mile to make your stay memorable. The level of service is truly outstanding. We have agreed that we will stay here on the annual trip. ,5,2017,10,15
121,top hotel,"It is in a stunning location in the heart of London. A fantastic hotel. The rooms are immaculate, comfortable and cozy.

It has an incredible relaxing atmosphere and has an interesting old fashioned design.",5,2017,10,15

121,Good in many respects but badly let down by breakfast,"Ridiculously expensive, but just par for the course in Westminster. Room very pleasant, and relatively quiet for central London. Breakfast, unfortunately is shambolic. Dining area is too small, and insufficiently staffed, pretty much guaranteeing a long queue whilst you wait for a table. Manage to create a queue even when there are many empty tables! Falls well short of what is expected for the standard of hotel this aspires to be.",3,2017,10,10
121,Special attention received!,"My husband and I stayed last week for 9 nights at this wonderful hotel. I was a bit concerned because I had booked for surgery on my feet so I knew that I would have to spend the whole time in our room. I need not have worried as the housekeeping staff ( particularly the lovely Hungarian lady Susanne ) couldn't have been kinder. Always lots of smiles and offers of help. Susanne was so thorough cleaning our suite but also so caring as well. I looked forward to seeing her each day. One day I even had the Head of Housekeeping, another lovely lady visit to see if all was in order. Room service was excellent too and I certainly put it to the test as most of my meals were brought to me. 
Our last night I was able to hobble down to the Bank restaurant. Excellent food, ambience and a wonderful guy serving us.

You clearly have an fantastic team. Thank you for making what could have been a difficult stay a very pleasant one!

We'll be back for a more normal visit so I can enjoy all the other aspects of this lovely, well located hotel.

121,Memorable stay,I stayed with my wife in this exquisite property located in the heart of London for almost a week last week. The stay was very comfortable with pleasing and ever helpful team of staff. The rooms are elegant and even though the hotel is soon to undergo major renovation the facilities are superb. Worth every penny to stay in this prime property.,5,2017,10,07

Thanks for all your help.

121,"Terrific, classy hotel!","Taj St James Court lived up to expectations. We stayed in an executive, double. We wanted a quiet room and got one at the end of the hall (#422). The room, while not big, was very functional and renovated. Nice sized closet, desk, and another desk next to the bed. The bathroom was great and the shower was perfect.
The breakfast, which was included in our package, was fantastic! Made to order eggs, large buffet, toast (just ask for it), great service.
The staff was very friendly. Always a smile and hello when returning from a day touring.
There was always a positive buzz in the lobby. Lots of activity, piano and other music every evening.
St. James underground was just 5 minutes straight ahead and to the right.
Concierge gave great advice-i.e. going to Windsor by way of Waterloo station and SW rail rather than going to Victoria, Paddington changing at Slough. The time was the same-1 hour.
Only negative was a lack of restaurants nearby for dinner. A few pubs, an Italian restaurant across the street, but this area is not like Covent Garden and other areas-no big deal though.
Great service! Good renovated room and bathroom! All in all a great hotel!",5,2017,10,06
121,Great Location In Victoria,This hotel is in a great location minutes walk from St James Park tube station and Victoria St.  The welcome and service at check in was excellent. There is a nice bar area at lobby. Rooms spacious with nice bathroom.  Turndown servicecwith fresh towels in the evening without request. Mini bar and tea/coffee making facility in room.,5,2017,10,06
121,Excellent hotel,This hotel was excellent.  Rooms were very nice and even had a towel bar that you could turn on to warm your bath towels. All of the employees were very friendly and polite.

121,GREAT HOTEL AT PRIME LOCATION ,"We stayed at St. James Court Taj Hotel for 4 nights. We were so pleased with our stay and how close it was to walk or take the train to all the places we had on our agenda. The hotel bed was very comfortable and their restaurant breakfast was unbelievably delicious, a great start to another busy day. If I had to mention a Area for improvement it would be the poor shower water pressure. Very nice stay. ",5,2017,10,02
121,Could do better... ,"Starting with confusion over the room booking, although resolved, I would have expected better. Great location near Buckingham Palace for tourists. Busy hotel ideally placed. We only had breakfast, no evening meals or snacks. Rooms needed a refurbishment, but the hotel is doing this. Not sure of stay again here as could do better. ",3,2017,10,02
121,"Quiet, central location & wonderful staff","This hotel was perfect. It was within walking distance easily to Westminster Abbey and surrounding sites, Buckingham Palace, Victoria Street and much more. It is also a quick 2 minute walk to St. James Place tube station which sits on the Central and District lines. There are plenty of coffee shops and eating options close by as well as in the hotel. The staff were more than accommodating and always pleasant. Very reasonably priced as well. A great experience!",5,2017,10,02
121,Convient location and exceptionally great experience,"We stayed at St. James Court hotel for seven days and have nothing but good things to say about our experience.  
The location was great for walking to venues as well as to the tube and bus routes.  
We booked an executive king room and it was very spacious, clean, comfortable bed, plenty of closet space, space for suitcases, mini-fridge, hot water pot for making tea/coffee (included), welcome fruit basket, desk, lots of electrical plugs (including USB ports), large bathroom with tub/shower combo and large vanity. 
We only had one issue and it was resolved quickly. We booked through and external source and they did not pass on to the hotel that we requested a non-smoking room (most of the hotel is non-smoking, but they have a few rooms). They were fully booked that night, so we had to stay in the room, but they brought in an air filter that totally cleaned the air.  When we were out touring the next day, they moved us to a non-smoking room and left an apology note and a plate of yummy fudge.
Our room included the buffet breakfast, which we took advantage of each day.  The buffet had a wide range of delicious food, but we could order from the menu as well with no additional charges.
The reception staff and concierge were always very friendly and helpful.
We'll definitely stay there again!",5,2017,10,01
121,Rather quiet place in walking distance to the inner city attractions,"Comfortable room with table and two chairs, nicely decorated. Our room came with a view to the inner yard with its fountain. There was no disturbing noise of other guests. Breakfast was very tasty and rich.",5,2017,10,01
121,Exceptional Hotel In a Fantastic Location,"There are a lot of places to stay when visiting London, and trying to choose the best accommodations, for the best price in the best location is the ultimate end goal. St James' Court, A Taj Hotel checked all of the boxes for us, a party of four - two couples, visiting London for the first time. Location wise, the St James is located on the south end of the St James Park a few blocks from Buckingham Palace (walkable), Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament, Picadilly Circus, The London Eye and lots of other fantastic sites. The hotel is actually two hotels as Taj 51 takes up one side and the St James Court the other(Taj 51 is 51 Buckingham Gate & St James is 54 Buckingham Gate - the only time this was an issue for us was with the airport transfer. There is no turn down alley for the St James - you merely pull up out front). 

The hotel is quite stunning, visually. The outside is ornate with the red brick façade. There is construction going on across the street right now so capturing that perfect photo of the front of the hotel is a bit of a challenge. That said, there is always construction in London as we have come to learn, and with all of the sites to be seen, snapping a photo of the front of the hotel should be the least of your concerns. 

Our rooms were very comfortable. We had king size beds, a sitting area. Our room on the sixth floor overlooked the drive alley for Taj 51 so it was kept up well and continued the brick motif. The bathroom was of a decent size. The shower tub combination sits up a little high so you need to be careful when entering or exiting. The water pressure was average however the controls for the water took a moment to understand (there are two knobs. The first, controls shower vs tub - counter clockwise for shower. The bottom knob is for hot or cold - counter clockwise again for hot. To control the stopper, turn the large dial that doubles as the faucet for the tub. Clockwise for open). There is also a heating rack for the towels. For our room it was between the commode and sink so you had to be careful if reaching over to the sink as you might inadvertently catch your arm on the hot pipes. No one was burnt out of our party, but there were multiple arm jerks over the course of our 4 day stay.

There are several restaurants at the St James Court and Taj 51 location which adds to the convenience. We heard a lot about Quinlon of which everyone raved. It is an award winning Indian cuisine restaurant. Unfortunately we did not have the chance to dine there. We did enjoy Bistro though. This is located to the left as you enter the lobby. Their lunch and dinner menu appears to be the same, but the food that our party tried was all very tasteful and satisfying. The dishes had an Indian flare here as well (although not all of the dishes are in that vein. There were steaks, lamb chops, chicken dishes and more). The marinara sauce that came with the bread board had hints of aromatic spices. It was very tastefully done. This restaurant also is the main breakfast location. You can purchase the breakfast plan when you check in. If you don't, you can pay as you would at any other restaurant, or you can put it on your room.

There is also the Hampden, located at the back of the lobby where the bar sits. They have a separate menu with tapas style dishes. Their play on fried chicken is a winner as were the kabobs.

We tried Bank (also another restaurant, however not affiliated with the hotel -as we were informed). We found the restaurant to be empty most of the time - from the courtyard you can see into the restaurant and we found the courtyard to be one of our favorite spots. More on that in a moment. At Bank we were rudely greeted and proceeded to sit for 10 minutes without a single server visiting - there were only two other tables occupied. We looked over the menu, and though a little pricey, we had chosen our courses. After the ten minutes we opted to leave. 

Bank aside, the experience was fantastic. The bar servers and tenders were real stand outs - a shout out to Rommel who was one of the most accommodating attendants. We spent a lot of time in the courtyard, either waiting for the other couple, or unwinding from our days of sight seeing and met other patrons of the hotel. The drinks kept the evenings and the conversations going and the pleasantness of the servers seamlessly wove through the laughter. Not to sell it short, the courtyard is quite beautiful. With large patio umbrellas and heaters the London weather could not 'dampen' the get-togethers. The centralized fountain, complete with koi turned out to be a favorite spot for wedding photos. Also the fresco brick that circles the courtyard are quite spectacular.

Knowing that there are a lot of places to call your temporary home when in London, we found the St James Court to meet all of our needs and exceed many of those as well. Our entire group agreed that this is a high recommendation. Please go and enjoy.",5,2017,10,01
121,Great hotel and top notch staff,"Where to start,  before even arriving at the hotel I had an accident and ended up at hospital. When I was released they sent a car to pick me up,  I was met by concierge manager who greeted me, got me checked in rapidly and settled in my room.  They helped me unpack, went to pharmacy for me and made sure I was comfortable.   The front of house manager checked on me regularly and after a day of recovery I started being able to come out   All the staff new me by name, took exceptional care of me and have earned my loyalty to staying here in the future. The hotel itself is beautiful, well kept and yet has a warm homey feel, a very relaxing courtyard.  The location is great, 2-3 blocks to Buckingham Palace, and the beautiful parks.  My room was a classic studio and quite spacious.  They are in the process of updating which the bathrooms could use.  The breakfasts were very good as was room service food.  I ate at the hotel restaurant Bistro, very good seasonal selection, very tasty and nice ambience.  And too reiterate, the staff went above and beyond   And Location, Location.",5,2017,09,30

The only complaints was that there was no hairdryer in the room (however, one was quickly provided when requested) and there was some noise from the Underrground.",4,2017,09,28
121,Loved it,The staff very friendly and most helpful. We ate at the Quilon restaurant and the food was outstanding. Located so close to Buckingham Palace was fantastic. Lovely parks literally on the doorstep We couldn't ask for any more. Thank you.,5,2017,09,28
121,Excellent hotel,St James Court Taj was a wonderful experience - the staff were terrific - room was clean - I totally enjoyed my stay there - the bed was very comfortable - food and drink were fabulous - lobby was always clean and comfortable,5,2017,09,28
121,Great location,"The location is very good, the rooms are good but a bit small. Although this didn't bother us at all. Would love to see healthier options at the breakfast buffet (avocado, nuts/seeds) and non dairy alternative (coconut milk, almond milk)",5,2017,09,28
121,Always good,"My fourth time here. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations, so the gym has moved and there is some dust about, but the service and amenities remain at their five star excellence. Even the cheaper rooms, which I take, have style and comfort. Great location!",5,2017,09,28
121,"Poor customer service, very bad safety and security for guests.","We checked into this hotel on 15/09/2017.

The hotel security Kiran, the night manager John and the weekend Manager Sunaina.

The Hotel manager John (black ethnicity) was very rude, didn't know anything about the hotels rules and regulations. We begged and help off of him and we didn't get nothing in return but sarcastic remarks and answers that directed us nowhere. John really does not know anything about hospitality and is clearly in the wrong business.

The hotel security manager during this time we was there also has not got a clue what he was doing, when he firmly gripped me from my arm and threatened to evict me from the hotel when all I was doing was waking through the lobby to sit down with my friend. I was going to call the police to as this is assault but then the hotel weekend manager came and persuaded me to not to. She then promised me we will be issued with a refund as we made a formal complaint, yet no refund has been made.

The hotel stay was £355 yet they've taken £405 out of my credit card. We did not use the minibar in the room as we had it removed on check out, nor any other chargeable items. So why have we been charged £50 extra? And where is the refund that was promised to us from your weekend manager for the very bad service and stay. We all felt very vulnerable and unsafe during our stay to being constantly harassed by staff and security even though we were guests.

The all round hotel stay was a shamble, we were looked at like we were criminals. We were embarrassed by several staff members on numerous occasions I felt front of other guests. Little did they know we were guests and paid to stay at their hotel.

All three staff members John, Sunaina and Kiran patronised us, pointed fingers at us, threatened to evict us, embarrassed us in public in the lobby, made us feel very unsafe all because they assumed we wasn't guests. This is totally against hospitality ethics especially from a high profile hotel chain (that I've stayed at internationally) 

We are still seeking our refund as promised by Sunaina however we are still seeking legal advice to sue Taj Hotel and it's staff for the heartache, mental trauma, assault and harassment by especially Kiran and John.",1,2017,09,27
121,How Times Have Changed,"My husband and I have always tried to stay at the Crown Plaza St. James Court Hotel on Buckingham Gate.  The rooms have been spacious and lovely and staying there was always a special treat while in London.  Sadly, times have changed and so has the ownership of the hotel.  It is now a Taj entity.  I made reservations for 4 back in October, 2016 for this September expecting the same kind of room we've always had. It was not to be.  We had rooms on the top floor that were not only small, but much in need of some tender loving care.  Cracks in the wall, and what they patched was done poorly.  Sloppy repair of tiles in the bathroom and cracks on the floor, along with an old worn sink.  Generally, the room needed a paint job.  We had one small window that looked out at old roof korbels.  We were awakened at 2:00 am by a loud party in the courtyard.  My husband called the front desk and the gal knew nothing about it and wasn't going to do anything about it.  He said he was going to call the police and shortly thereafter the noise stopped.   It is a sad come down for a lovely, old hotel in a beautiful building.",2,2017,09,27
121,The best,Is a great hotel the right location great staff clean rooms and much more. This was our first time in London and where very happy with how close it was to all the major sites all within walking distance. ,5,2017,09,27
121,Excellent hotel in central location,"Excellent hotel. Exceptional service. Restaurants are very good, we booked the Around the World in 80 Tastes meal experience and thoroughly enjoyed it, this included having all 4 courses of the meal at the different hotels. Good fun and an unusual exciting experience.",5,2017,09,26
121,Great hotel in a great location,"The hotel staff are amazing, the overall quality of the hotel, it's food and amenities is world class and you could not ask for a better location  to all the major tourist sites!  Most are within walking or cycling distance. Not to mention the close proximity to Buckingham palace give's a great sense of safety all times of day.",5,2017,09,26
121,Price,Price was too high for size of room.  Excepted a nicer larger room for the price that I paid and it was a daily maze to get to my room.  Furniture need updating....holes in lampshades.  very disappointed as soon as I walked into the room.,2,2017,09,25
121,"Staff always helpful, received breakfast with booking and it was wonderful.. never had to wait long to be seated!","Ask for converter upon arrival... will save you ranting about here to plug in your North American appliances!! No ice machines, but staff always willing to bring up bucket very night! 
We liked the location and found we were able to walk to many local sites.... Neighbour is Buckingham Palace!!",5,2017,09,25
121,Hidden gem in London,Excellent service and large room make this a wonderful stay for couples travelling with luggage. Staff always friendly and very helpful. Breakfast excellent. Room size makes it a very comfortable stay. Close to underground station.,5,2017,09,25
121,"Old rooms, poor service","Not sure what put me off- whether the hospital themed corridors, super small rooms (I’ve had bigger rooms in all Tokyo hotels I’ve stayed in) or just the apathetic attitude of one staff I had the misfortune to not avoid dealing with",2,2017,09,25
121,Lovely hotel with great service but looking tired,"The people at this wonderful hotel are unfailingly polite and helpful and always cheerful and smiling.  The food in the bistro is outstanding, some of the best Asian/Indian food I have tasted for a long time with subtle and unexpected flavours which are a delight.

Al this though is spoilt rather by the hotel particularly the accommodation being in need of maintenance and a sprucing up.  My room for instance had a |TV remote control that did not work, windows that were difficult to open, paint that had adsorbed the London grime and a tap that rotated freely around it mounting in the basin.  The corridors to the rooms are less than appealing and could do with brightening up.  Niggles maybe but they detract from superb service.",4,2017,09,25
121,Amazing!!,"We loved every moment of our stay at this hotel. It is truly a world class establishment. Service was amazing, accommodations were outstanding and food was delicious. The location cannot be beat- just a few blocks from Buckingham palace. Very easily walkable to many destinations and bus stop nearby.

Check in was super easy. Was informed we were upgraded to suite, which was an awesome surprise. Bags brought to our room and setup. Staff is very efficient and professional. Room was very large and beautiful. Concierge staff is very helpful and informative.

Breakfast is delicious and complete. Again, staff there is beyond helpful. Also had dinner at Bistro and room service from the bar- fish and chips was SOOOO good! Room service was so fast and professional. Food expertly prepared and plated. 

I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. Rate was a bit of a sticker shock initially from American standards, but definitely got what we paid for.",5,2017,09,25
121,Not as good as it used to be,"Excellent location but quality has really slipped since my last stay 2 years ago.  Breakfasts were excellent though.  

I was a bit disappointed with my room etc, particularly as this was the 5th time I had stayed at the hotel.  We booked a suite as there were 3 of us staying and I had stayed in the suite on my last stay so I knew they were spacious enough to cope with 3 people with one person on a fold away and 2 in the king size bed.  The last 2 times I stayed, I was given a suite with a bathroom and a second lavatory which I mentioned when booking the suite would be good for us as I would be sleeping in the sitting room.  However, we were given a suite which did not have this.  On top of that, the roll away was set up in the bedroom.  Not a big problem as we moved the bed ourselves to the sitting room.  What was an issue was that the milk supplied in the room curdled when used in tea, so we had to ask for more.  We were not supplied with biscuits, we were only supplied with 2 mugs, we had to ask for another.  The toilet leaked in the bathroom, quite badly so we had to put towels down to soak it up - this did not seem to be noticed by room attendants.  To be fair, we did not complain about it.  We were not supplied with 3 of things over the 3 nights we stayed either.  Very annoying.  On top of that the printer not only did not work, it did not even have ink it it, also annoying as part of the reason we chose this room was so that I could work - for which I needed a printer.  Again, to be fair, we did not complain until we checked out.  We are going back (already paid for) for 3 nights in October.  I do so hope we get better rooms.  It actually felt as if we were put in a room they don't normally use it was that shabby.  The chaise long was badly stained, etc, etc.  Very disappointing",2,2017,09,24
121,Perfect Week,"The St James's Taj has an excellent location. It's only a 5-10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and if you want to see other parts of London, it's easy to get to and fro with the St James's Tube station nearby.  It is much quieter and classier than some of the hotels in the more touristy sections of London, yet there are plenty of restaurants in walking distance to choose from. We will stay here again.",5,2017,09,23
121,Not as good as last time,"This was our second visit to the Hotel. 
We travel from Australia and chose the Hotel based on location, right opposite Buckingham Palace and close to Victoria Station. 
Last time we left the hotel raving about it to our friends. 
This time it was just ok. 
We were there five nights and we slept very poorly on a cheap hard mattress. 
Our room’s wifi was abysmal and could only be accessed by sitting on the floor in the hallway near the door to the room. 
Guys you need to clean the mould out of the top of the shower area. 
Also the level of service has dropped. 
There is a man in the morning breakfast area who was dismissive of us, like we were low values guests. 
The staff in the front counter used to all acknowledge you as you went through. They now don’t. 
The furniture in the common areas are tired and overall we thought for about AUD $500pn it wasn’t as good as we expected. 
On our next visit to London we will look around for a new hotel.  ",3,2017,09,23
121,Great Location in Central London,Perfect location for exploring and traveling through central London. Beautiful rooms. Expensive but most of Central London is. Rooms are good size with big beds and all the amenities. I would stay there again.,4,2017,09,23
121,Ideally located hotel in London with all amenities .,Value for money for your stay in London. I am extremely satisfied with hotel staff and all facilities of the hotel. Very conveniently located for all major tour attractive places of London. The hotel staff is always ready to guide you for your sight seeings or any other issued of travel. The Breakfast is extremely good with many varieties. Every day you find change some changes in menu which is high light of the breakfast. Well done. A home away from home!!!,5,2017,09,23
121,Best way to stay for a London Trip......,"If you are first timer to London for a family visit, believe me this is the best place to stay and explore London. Book London flight; book this TAJ hotel and book Big Bus for 3 days and you are done. We visited recently London in Last week of August 2017 with family and initially decided to stay for just four days, but later extended to stay for eight nights in same hotel. Location, facility and staff were very good. Thanks a million for arranging tasty Jain Hindu food. Location is such a great that walking can do many of attractions. We explored London by Big Bus for 3 days and rest 3 days by Evan Evan tours. Amazing experience with both....Evan tour to Oxford, Stonehenge, Windsor, etc....were best in all respect.... arrangement, sight seeing and information and support......",5,2017,09,22
121,Awesome hotel,"Wonderful hotel with very friendly staff. The location is perfect for short walks to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, underground stations, shopping, and banking for currency exchange with no fees. We definitely will stay here again if we return to London!",5,2017,09,22
121,Hotel in London within Walking Distance to Many Tourist Attractions,"We stayed here for four nights following a cruise. Our room was small, but everything was outstanding. The accommodations and service were excellent. We included breakfast in our stay, which was also excellent.  The hotel is located within walking district to many tourist attractions such as Buckingham Palace, the Churchill War Room Museum, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, etc. For other attractions, a ""hop-on, hop-off"" bus stop is nearby, plus taxis or the tube are readily available.  This is a 4 star hotel, and is a little pricey, but it's worth it. I recommend it, and would use it again.",5,2017,09,22
121,GREAT HOTEL,"staff, rooms, breakfast buffet, location. excellent. the concierge Connie excelent and very helpful. close to the palace, big ben, westminster. great lobby bar. very good rooms. very nice hotel.  ideal for couples and business",5,2017,09,22
121,business stay made easy,"Stayed for 2 nights staff great as usual, Bimoy in concierge gets a particular mention for dealing with a couple of challenges for me. check in was smooth, informative and efficient. Classic and smart rooms my hotel of choice when in London",5,2017,09,22
121,fantastic hotel !!!!,this palace is wonderful if you can stay here. breakfast is good everything is ! everyone is nice and everything is complimentary ! love this hotel chain wish they had more locations in other citys to try. thank,5,2017,09,21
121,Sophisticated hotel with great service,"The hotel is with traditional decor but very elegant. Nice hotel within the neighborhood of the queen. Walking distance from Tourist attractions and  St James and Victoria stations. Lots of restaurants and shopping centers approximate to the hotel. Service and staff are very friendly , courteous and approachable. Special mention for the breakfast team Eunos and his staff. Very particular with clients needs and given extra importance. We stayed for 5 days and Eunos and staff knew us  without looking the list. Reception and courciege helpful and nice. Even provided us with umbrellas when we went out. Housekeeping and room service who never failed to provide water  and chocolate everyday. Live music every night in the lobby is amazing.",5,2017,09,20
121,High End hotel near Buckingham Palace,"The room was a good size, with two armchairs and a desk.  Bathroom was a little tight.  Air conditioning was good.  Construction is going on in courtyard so don't plan on sleeping past 8 AM if on the court yard. Also there is a boy's school on the courtyard and when they are out for recess they can make quite a racket. 

Disappointing was the bed size as, *king* was specified and it was more like a queen sized bed if you are familiar with the designations. 

Food was pricey but good.  They have three restaurants the ""Bistro"" had the best menu and prices. Wine Beef (something) on the special price menu was very good, as was the Wanton soup on regular menu.  Don't have them do your laundry, they just send it out, probably to the laundry that is about 200 ft down the st. from their front door, check with them as to price without the hotel mark up.  Also, across the street and down a bit is ""Bon Gusto"" restaurant and pizza, good prices and reasonably good food, Veal Saltimbocca was good and they were happy to substitute penne alfredo for spaghetti pomo doro in the dish and it was reasonabley good.  Better Italian food than I expected in London, anyway. On the same side as the Laundry there is the ""M"" store which has a small selection of wine and beer so you can take a bottle up to your room for a night cap.  

The worst thing about this hotel is that it is very Indian oriented and perhaps that is why they *perfume* the corridors.... and they do it excessively.  If you have asthma or COPD, be advised. I ended up taking basically a ""staff route"" to avoid the corridors as much as possible because our room was *far* from the main elevators...about 4 connecting corridors away. This can be a serious problem if your lungs are compromised. 

Order the buffet breakfast, contains all the ala carte items and allows you to order an omelet or eggs your way and still sample any of the other buffet items. Cheaper in the long run.  The bacon..English style... wide strips and very fatty was not so good.  It doesn't have to be that fatty.  The scrambled eggs on the buffet were that annoying texture less, too moist style you find in England, so I took to ordering eggs sunnyside up or an omelet.  

The retaurant staff is pleasant, and seem all to be quite attractive nice young women (sorry fems)  who have varying degrees of English fluency, so they may get your order wrong because they misunderstand.  That's another reason to order the buffet, if it's wrong just send it back and tell them to redo it. Flat fee (20 pounds IIRC) on the buffet.  

They have apples, toffee and chocolates on the main desk for you gratis. 

It's about a 10 minute walk to the Buckingham Palace to see the changing of the guard, take one of the hotel umbrellas from behind the doorman.  We got rained on every day for 2 weeks even if the day starts out beautiful and sunny",3,2017,09,20
121,Great location but lied to twice,"I am giving this a four star rating based on the great location, room size and very good housekeeping.
The location is perfect for the first time visitor to London...walking distance to many of the Royal sights,Victoria and St. James tube station,bus stops and near the Westminster pier for river travel.Also a good selection of restaurants within walking distance.
On arrival our room was not ready at 2 pm, we waited until 3:30 pm to be shown our first ""quiet room'' 617....we were greeted to the sound of sawing,hammering and concrete breaking. This executive king room was directly over looking 2 active work sites. We insisted on a room change and were told that no one else complained and that the sites were not active. This sites were active and we were assigned a much quieter room 525.
We were surprised upon check- in by the request to pay our full 10 days in advance as well as a 50 pound a night deposit for incidentals after having our passports photocopied. We were told we would receive any balance owed to our account a few days after our departure.  There was nothing in our reservation confirmation to indicate this policy. When I asked reception if this is Standard procedure in London she assured me that is is. Another lie... upon investigation and consultation with a family member who frequently travels to London and stays at various hotels, I was informed that in his experience only one very""untrusting hotel ""asked him to pay in advance and he had never been asked to provide a photo copy of his passport. This experience soured our view of the St. James.
The hotel touts itself as a luxury hotel which it is not in my opinion....little attention to detail in the floor foyers...badly chipped baseboards and door frames ,grubby foyer elevator walls and poorly fitted and frayed carpeting.Even the lovely lobby had furniture that was worn.
We ate at the Bistro twice, the first dinner was very good the second was poor...they apologized and' comped' an entree and appetizer.

However the friendly doormen, and the cleanliness of our 350 square foot room with a decent bathroom size were definite pluses.... I would still consider this a good value hotel but would not stay here again.",4,2017,09,20
121,Lovely hotel,"We had a king room which was larger than expected and well appointed. The long winding hall to the room is a reminder that the hotel is old, but you’d never know that since the room, lobby, and restaurants are beautiful. The staff was excellent and especially Sunaina at the front desk, a big thank you to her!  ",5,2017,09,20
121,London visit,"Beat a welcomed us quickly and efficiently to the hotel when she checked us in, spending time explaining the hotel facilities and answering our questions. Throughout our four days we found all staff to be cheerful, helpful and pleasant.
As for the hotel itself, we found it to well maintained, clean and very comfortable. We slept well in a comfortable bed with God pillows and bedding. 
We thought the hotel was perfectly located for walking access to central London, with good nearby tube and bus services.
Thank you Beat a and Taj team for making our stay so enjoyable and we look forward to returning some day. ",4,2017,09,20
121,A true landmark of British and Indian heritage,"Loved the location, the architecture, the courtyard and the service. Very helpful staff and the room service was spot on. One of the best in room dining experience I have had. 
I can't think of anything else that could be imporved and will definitely be coming again soon.
Keep up the good work.",5,2017,09,19
121,"Central location, great hotel","A great hotel for a short London stay, central, close to tube, buses, shops and sights. The room was comfortable, breakfast good, all the staff courteous and attentive. I am very happy to recommend this hotel.",5,2017,09,18
121,Wonderful stay,"We loved our stay at St.James Court. We received very warm welcome on arrival and got upgraded to a suite with separate living room,  beautiful space and relaxing decor. Housekeeping did excellent job and hotel was very clean. I love the scent they're using in the hotel.

The breakfast was very high quality, served in a beautiful bistro restaurant with natural light. 
Staff was very attentive, everybody greeted us with a smile, ambiance was elegant yet relaxed. 
There is a sense of security in the hotel, there is some by the entrance door to check who is entering the hotel and greeting guests. 
Anyone who reads my reviews knows how picky I am when it comes to high-end hotels. I felt very comfortable and well taken care of in St.James Court. I highly recommend you to stay there too.
It's our new home away from home when visiting London to see our friends and enjoy musicals.

",5,2017,09,18
121,Good experience nice stay,"I stayed at this hotel through work for a week, very clean and pleasant entry into the hotel, friendly staff and well greeted.

Stayed in an executive double, was very surprised how small the room was , did expect it to be bigger. Wi-Fi disconnects and does not auto login so be aware you just need to re login, simple enough task unless you forget. Power shower was poor not much of a power shower. Sauna and steam room pointless to be honest, lukewarm at best, went a few times was the same each time so didn't bother. Last negativity the TV is rubbish such a small tiny screen, in this day and age and a hotel claiming 4/5 stars would expect much better TV.

The positives, staff were amazing very well trained and always friendly and willing to help. Queen size bed was comfortable, however not the best pillows. Food was lovely, great variety and loads of different restaurants situated throughout the grounds, prices are steep compared to high street competitors. Services provided were lovely as was the breakfast, even did the lazy option and had breakfast ordered to room, WOW, that was fit for a king, great stuff. Went gym 3/4 times lovely clean area access 24hrs no complaints at all, except what I wrote above about sauna etc.. They had a great choice of sports channels, which is very rare, but need better TVs, they are also very very accommodating with special requests, all you need to do is ask.

Overall  stay was above average but would expect better from a 4/5 star hotel.",3,2017,09,18
121,Excellent for families,"We were very happy with our hotel choice for our family's vacation in London (4 nights in August).  We stayed in a ""Family Room"", and it was perfect for our family (parents and two 8-year old kids).  The Family Room was a junior suite with a bedroom area (2 double beds) and a living room area with a couch, desk, and TV.  Very spacious and comfortable.  The room was quiet and clean, and the beds were comfortable.  We had no complaints about the room.

Service was very pleasant and friendly.  Upon check-in, they gave stuffed animals and a kids' tote bag to our kids, which was a nice gesture.  They provided umbrellas during a rain storm, which was also greatly appreciated.

We ate the included breakfast buffet, and it was very good quality.  Not much variety from day to day but the quality was consistently good.

The main selling point of this hotel is the location, which is hard to beat.  A few minutes walk to a tube station, and a short stroll away from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben.  The street the hotel is on was fairly quiet, but within a couple blocks of Victoria Street and various restaurants.

We'd definitely stay here the next time we're in London.",5,2017,09,17
121,holiday experience at taj st james court,"The location is good. The breakfast experience is Horrible. Sunny side down fried egg, the staff has never heard of this order in their life. service is average . i would not recommend this overrated hotel to guest who are used to luxury.",3,2017,09,17
121,Staying like Royalty at the St. James Court Taj Hotel,Location Location Location. Outstanding all round. Service excellence. Most magnificent establishment of all times. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The restaurants and bars within the hotel was extraordinary. The Michelin star restaurant Quilon was exceptional. Both the food and service remarkable. Will definitely go back. Absolutely memorable.,5,2017,09,17
121,Warm elegance with attention to service,"This hotel really does right from start to finish. The facility itself is gorgeous and the rooms are wonderful. I requested a room with a courtyard view. While they could not guarantee it, they assured me they would try to accommodate. We arrived early and did not expect our room to be ready, but it was AND it was a lovely corner room on the 6th floor overlooking the courtyard. The bed was very comfortable and the room was of good size. The bathroom was very tasteful and modern. Breakfast offered a very nice variety and cooked to order items were also an option. The location of this hotel cannot be beat. Just a ten minute walk to Westminster Abbey with wonderful restaurants and pubs surrounding it. About a five minute walk to the underground.  The neighborhood is very safe.
As good as everything else is, the service is the hallmark of this hotel. The staff simple cannot do enough for you and a guest's satisfaction is their goal. One night, I could not get the bathtub stopper to work and the front desk sent an ENGINEER. He had it working in no time. Another night, I returned to the room to find my iPad not connecting to the free internet. I was connected to Apsri who endeavored to lead me through different scenarios, all the while manning the very busy switchboard. Alas, nothing could rectify the problem and all the IT personnel had gone home. Apsri was not to be undone, she called one of the IT men at home and patched me through to him. Logan was so personable and set me up through a shortcut he devised. Apsri followed up to make sure the internet connection was working for me and that I was completely satisfied. Every staff member we encountered made us feel like they were there solely for us. I am very hard to please, but this hotel and staff left us happy and looking forward to a return stay.",5,2017,09,16
121,fabulous hotel and tapas bar,"lovely hotel with great bar & tapas service , food in restaurant and breakfast 5 star. only problem was staff knocking on door then entering with out waiting for me to answer it. no inside security on door  slept with chair under door knob as I didn't know who would just walk in!!",4,2017,09,16

Just be sure when making a reservation your getting the exact room you are requesting. The location was good near Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, Parliament.",4,2017,09,16
121,Perfect location,"Great restaurant.  Good service. Perfect location. We would definitely stay here when next in London.
We were close to the palace and easy access to the underground or buses.  Hotel had a very warm and friendly atmosphere ",4,2017,09,14
121,Perfect for Families!,"Perfect Location. Quiet place. I think it's perfect for families or couples that visit London for holidays. The rooms are ok (not more than that) but the atmosphere and attention is awesome. I would come back without any doubt!

The only thing not so good is the big lines in the cafeteria at breakfast time. They found a solution for us when asked about it.",5,2017,09,14
121,Unparalleled  Accommodation in London," The St. James Court Hotel is located almost exactly in between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abby in the House is a Parliament.  The staff here is, literally, the best trained that we have ever experienced.  The concierge team is the most capable of any we've ever worked with. The September, 2017, we bought a group of 30 adults on attending records tour and stayed at the St. James Court all 9 nights ...  what a lovely property, or people were enraptured with the elegance and beauty, not to mention the capable staff and great material that we had planned. It was a magical 10 days and I can't wait to get back to the St. James Court next season. ",5,2017,09,14
121,"Excellent Hotel, Convenient Location","Stayed here for four nights. The room was spacious, clean and well kept. The location is five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and five minutes walk from St. James Park Underground Station. Very easy access from Heathrow. The amenities were luxurious. The breakfast buffet was excellent. It included both Indian dishes and continental fare. The dishes on the menu were different every day. The hotel provides umbrellas for rainy days which is excellent gesture. There are three excellent restaurants on premise. Also five minutes walk from Victoria Street which has many shopping and eating options.",5,2017,09,13
121,A Haven of Luxury & Comfort within steps from Buckingham Palace!,"The St. James' Court- Taj Hotel is a haven of luxury & comfort within steps from Buckingham Palace!  I hope to come back on my next visit to London!  This hotel experience provided excellence that I have never had before during a hotel stay. The hotel is a true beauty!  And the rooms were the very definition of clean, very comfortable & spacious. And the hotel bistro/ restaurant offered food & service that was very top-notch! I felt like I was treated like a royal! 
Thank you for a truly wonderful stay! ",5,2017,09,13
121,Unforgettable memories in London,"The stay was absolutely wonderful, it was beautiful and the service was  extraordinary, the staff went out of their way. My husband and I will definitely recommend A Taj Hotel to  others planing a trip to London. ",5,2017,09,13
121,About being treated right,"My wife and I arrived early in the morning after a long flight, airport arrival shuffle, transport to destination in unfamiliar surroundings. You know how it is; by the time you arrive, you feel like a dogs breakfast.
The St. James staff fixed that feeling immediately. The doorman gave us a bright welcome as we entered the large beautifully decorated lobby and were checked in by a professional who knows how to comfort tired people. Our room was large, clean,  tastefully decorated with a king size bed that was awesomely comfortable. The staff attended to our every need, At breakfast, service was attended practically at the time we sat down. Afternoon tea or a drink and refreshment at the bar area was the same. You feel special. Additionally, the location could not be better. Buckingham Palace and the major attractions of beautiful London are right nearby. 
When in London, stay at the St. James Court, you will really love it.",5,2017,09,13
121,1st visit to London,"St. James' Court is close to many major sites - Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby.  The hotel is beautiful with staff that is extremely helpful and courteous.  There are great restaurants and pubs nearby.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  Our every need was met.  
",5,2017,09,12
121,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Purpose of the stay was vacation.  The location of the hotel is ideal.  Close to Buckingham Palace, but more importantly close to the tube and bus lines.  Housekeeping and the hotel staff were very friendly and efficient.  Had no issues with the hotel and would recommend it to someone staying in London, especially in the western side.",5,2017,09,12
121,"Premium hotel, premium location","Stayed here for four nights. The room was spacious, clean well kept. The location is five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. The amenities were luxurious. The breakfast buffet was excellent. It included both Indian dishes and continental fare. The items were different every day. The hotel provides umbrellas for rainy days which is excellent gesture. There are three excellent restaurants on premise. Five minutes walk from St. James Park underground station and five minutes from Victoria Street which has many shopping and eating options.",5,2017,09,12
121,Awesome place!,"The St. James is a great hotel, fabulous service, outstanding location, tremendous value for the price.  Breakfast for us was included and it had a lot of options, even made to order eggs or omelettes.   ",5,2017,09,11
121,A stones throw from the queen ,"We stayed here for 5 nights and it was lovely 

A real traditional English hotel 

Had a lovely breakfast everyday where you could order eggs anyway you like to your table and a huge buffet selection of hot and cold 

There is a lovely bar in the lobby which has a piano player every night. I had a glass of champagne and one of the tapas dishes only £9 really lovely portioned snack

I was sitting by myself in the bar and the lovely bar tender Adriana came and spoke to me, she was an absolute delight, really looked after me. Then I went back up to my room and later realised I had left my phone in the bar. The lovely Adriana had found my phone and put it aside for me, the front desk staff were also amazing offering for someone to bring my phone to my room for me. 

All the staff at the hotel I met from the door  greeters, concierge, front desk, room attendants and breakfast staff were all amazing every where we went we were greeted with genuine happy welcoming smiles. 

What makes this hotel great is the people who work there and of course that it is located only half a block away from the queens house. ",5,2017,09,11
121,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London","This hotel was great. From start to finish. I booked this hotel through TravelVelocity.com along with my airfare. The hotel is close to just about everything. Walking distance to 2 different tube stations, 2 convenience stores, a mall, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly circus, Big ben, westminster abbey, the Thames river, and much more. The customer service from the front desk was awesome! I highly recommend it. My BF and I stayed in a double room (this was plenty enough for us). It was clean and the cleaning crew did a great job!",5,2017,09,11
121,"Convenient, Comfortable Hotel in the Centre of London","This hotel is very convenient and close to the centre of London.  Our room was clean, comfortable and had enough storage for our week's stay.  Breakfast was of a very high quality, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,09,11
121,"Great Location, A Cosy Room but Alas, with Only a View of a Brick Wall!","We decided on this Westminster hotel for its location – a mere two blocks away from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park, and also within walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Parliament.  Moreover it was near enough to the theatre district - a 15 minute brisk walk away – so that one was unfearful of taxi-cab traffic that could make one miss one’s theatre date!

We liked the friendly and courteous staff, the uncrowded lobby and efficiently-run breakfast room, and this being a Taj Hotel, the various Indian dishes that were available on the breakfast buffet. These were real treats indeed that made it special and different from generic hotels. We also liked the intimate bar with its deep comfortable chairs where one could have a night cap.

We liked the cosiness of the room we had – tastefully decorated with beautiful historical engravings - and its location far from the elevators. In the small but adequate bathroom, we liked the fluffy towels kept warm by a radiator, the toiletries that came in small individual bottles (and not in ‘pumping’ containers), the large magnifying mirror. We liked the accoutrements for morning tea or coffee, the well-stocked mini-bar, the variety of available television channels, the waffle-designed bathrobes (ideal for summer) and slippers…The icing on the cake:  the hangers in the closet were real and easily removable! Unlike those in other hotels, these were wooden and were not attached with ‘pins’ to the closet rod.  Another nice touch: the free newspaper that came in its individual blue bag early in the mornings.

We were just disappointed that our 3rd floor room looked out on brick walls: a tiny ‘blip’ in our otherwise very satisfying stay.",4,2017,09,11
121,Great place but you got to pay...,"Excellent location, nice service.  Food not included and you either enjoy London or this hotel.  If you can afford the price it is worth it.  I had a good stay.  AC is not the best as room tend to stay warm.",5,2017,09,11
121,Nice stay,"They allowed early check-in when we arrived (about 1-2 hours early).  Welcoming lobby area.  Within walking distance of pubs, coffee shops, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace.  Small room (to be expected in Europe and due to the age of the hotel).  Comfortable bed.  Long walk from elevator to our room.  No surprise fees.  ",4,2017,09,11
121,Great location,Great hotel but shower over bath was way to small and shower curtain kept sticking to your body. Small room but very clean and tidy. Fantastic location and able to walk to most attractions. Great breakfast and very nice staff ,4,2017,09,10
121,no hot water in the room,no hot water in the room last day……we had to take a shower in another room the was in another floor. you could imagine that with a 3 months baby the move was not easy and of course you shouldn't experience that in a 5 stars hotel.,2,2017,09,09
121,Excellent,"Taste of Indian hospitality in heart do London. Great location for tourist destinations within walking distance. Equally close to business address that I was to meet. Great Spa experience. Well equipped, maintained Gym. Good food for breakfast, which was the only meal I had. ",5,2017,09,09
121,Excellent quality rooms and friendly service,"A lovely clean hotel, with excellent high quality facilities throughout. Staff are very polite, warm and friendly. Food is a very high standard. Excellent location for central London. I have used this hotel previously and intend to use again in future",5,2017,09,08
121,Natesan,Staying St James' Court A Taj is a wonderful experience. We stayed for a holiday so commuting from taj to all attractive locations takes few minutes of walking. Wonderful hospitality especially for kids.,5,2017,09,08
121,Great choice,"Every person in the hotel was so helpful, polite and friendly. We had the most wonderful time from the moment we arrived until our final farewell. We would never hesitate to book this hotel again and even request the same room. The staff were simply amazing in their efficiency and dedication to our wonderful stay.",5,2017,09,07
121,Great top notch place!,"Great hotel, upper class, courtyard is perfect! Very friendly, close to everything. Buckingham palace is right down the street and London Eye, Westminster Abbe and Parliament all within short walking distance.",5,2017,09,07
121,Short Visit to London - Hotel Disappointing,"The hotel itself is quite nice and the staff are friendly and accommodating.  I had higher expectations of the rooms.  The rooms are shown on the websites to be of a 5 star quality and when you arrive, it's disappointing to find that the rooms are small, the beds are small (unless you pay a major upgrade) and in my case we had a very noisy room, kitchen odours and water problems.  Not what you'd expect in a 5 star hotel.",3,2017,09,07
121,Great place and location for Westminster area,"A really good hotel well situated. 
Restaurant quality excellent with an interesting mixed cuisine, introducing Indian dishes that are too class. 
Reception can be a challenge on getting issues dealt with. All very polite but never action issues well. ",5,2017,09,07
121,Excellent Weekend Stay,"From the moment we checked in the hotel the service provided was excellent. The food was first class and the breakfast service was exceptional. The service in the cocktail bar was also first class and the staff, friendly and courteous. The afternoon tea was something to be enjoyed in the Kona Restaurant. Good food, well presented with good service. The room was brilliant and well furnished, cleaned and serviced by an unseen  housekeeping team. An excellent weekend stay",5,2017,09,06
121,Great London experience,"I really recommend this hotel, the experience was amazing, the location was perfect and the service was great as well.   It´s a different experience staying in a hotel with an Indian influence. The food is also very good, you should definitively book a table in Quilon restaurant, the best Indian food experience I ever had.",5,2017,09,06
121,Any 3 star hotel in London will beat this 5 star hotel,"First of all, they gave me the worst room in the hotel, 476. What is bad about it? It is facing directly toward the construction site. What does it mean? It means I got woken up every single day, except Sunday, at 8am; it is even better than the hotel morning call. I arrived at the hotel fairly early, 4pm. There was still a bunch of room available, not sure why they had to put me there!! The hotel wasn't even sold out! They still got a lot of rooms available when I checked online!

Second of all, the moment I went to bed, I started wondering if I were in a 2 star hotel. It is so obvious that the mattress is so OLD that the middle section is soft that sucks you in, but the edge is still very hard and firm. What kind of a 5 star hotel would have this kind of mattress?

Will I ever come back to this hotel? Not likely unless they price themselves to a 3 star hotel. Yes, it is not a 5 star hotel, it is a 3 star.",2,2017,09,05
121,Short break,My husband and I stayed at St. James for 4 nights. We enjoyed our experience at the hotel very much. The staff are very professional and very polite always smiling and ready to help. The location is fantastic you can reach the very heart of London in 15 minutes' walk or use the tube station just around the corner. The rooms are comfortable and quiet with everything you need. The buffet breakfast offers a good choice of quality food and drinks. We would recommend St.James' and will definitely come back next time we visit London,5,2017,09,05
121,"St James'court , a Taj Hotel","Lovely hotel, very friendly staff, great location central to all tourists sites.close to Buckingham Palace so you can watch changing of the guards. My advise is to get there early so you can be near the fence. ",5,2017,09,05
121,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, good breakfast","Stayed at the hotel whole 1 week. Nice breakfast, ok selection to have variation every day. A lot of focus on Indian cuisine. Nice present to the kid when we arrived. 
Spacy and modern room. 
Very nice afternoon tea - Alice in Wonderland theme.",4,2017,09,05
121,not expected from taj,"very poor customer satisfaction. after doing a big goof up on food. thats also fine but after such an incidence while checking out if we were asking for a additional 2 hours of late chk out. we get charged. after being a epicure member and after that asked to meet a senior no one was even ready to meet, all were in some meeting.",2,2017,09,05
121,Fabulous Hotel,"Everything about this hotel was wonderful, the staff very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Our junior suite was superb, the bed and pillows extremely comfortable, and very quiet. The middle courtyard was a great place for a drink or meal. Couldn't ask for more.",5,2017,09,05
121,Super Stay,Fabulous location and extremely helpful staff from the front desk to the in room dining. The hotel is walking distance to The Thames and the area a delight to walk. The rooms are spacious given London rooms and the hotel staff curteous and ever smiling. Would definitely love to go back soon.,5,2017,09,05
121,"Low grade of a ""Taj""","We were unsatisfied of the room which is very very small,bed also small.At 6 th floor there is small window and boundary wall of the roof..Do I stay in Taj?:Yes! But do I stay at St James Court?;No! And I do not advıse to any one to book through Booking.com this hotel.",4,2017,09,04
121,Stellar experience at St. JAMES' COURT,Our extended stay at St. James' Court hotel was our home away from home. The staff was very accommodating with each request and saw to it that we were well taken care of.  Location in central London is very convenient to businesses and popular attractions.   We will definitely look for a Taj hotel when traveling,5,2017,09,04
121,Great hotel in perfect central London location,Pleasantly surprised how well the hotel looked when we arrived. It truly lives up to its internet pictures  Staff  was friendly and very helpful. We were able to walk to all our destinations and return every evening to a comfortable bed. ,5,2017,09,03
121,Incredible experience ,"Everything was perfect.  They have excellent staff who provide unmatched service at all times.  Their rooms are spacious and ooze luxury.  With several tempting restaurant choices, you will be spoilt.  They have a fantastic breakfast spread too.  And the bar is amazing.  I highly recommend this hotel in London - just a couple of blocks away from Buckingham palace.  It is quite pricy though. ",5,2017,09,03
121,Excellent Hotel,All staff members were polite and helpful whenever my wife and I had a question about services at the hotel. The staff members ensured we were satisfied with the accommodations at the hotel and provided additional services to ensure we were comfortable during our stay. The hotel provided a fan and a converter in our room. The staff always greeted the guest when entering and leaving the hotel.,5,2017,09,02
121,Treated like a Queen a couple of blocks from the Castle!,"This is a wonderful hotel.  First and foremost was the outstanding service from every department. Everyone bent over backwards to ensure we had a fabulous stay.  The location was perfect.  Just blocks from Buckingham Palace and about 20 minutes walk to Westminster Abby and Parliament. Close to Pubs, restaurants, the Tube and Buses.  But not the mass of tourists like at Piccadilly Circus. The hotel is renovating.  At first we had one of the older rooms, but they nicely moved us to a beautifully renovated room.  Both rooms were large and very comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was very good and was complimentary with our package. The cafe in the courtyard was great. The Tapas were very good and reasonable for hotel food.  It was just a lovely place for a drink after a long day of sightseeing.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  If we ever get back to London, (I really hope so) we will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,08,31
121,Clean and friendly staff,"The staff was friendly and always greeted us. Our room was comfortable and the breakfast was really good. The hotel was in walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Green and Hyde Parks, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, and the Thames. ",5,2017,08,31
121,Grossly over priced,I have never stayed in an hotel being charged a 12% service charge. £29;12 for breakfast!! You need very deep pockets to stay here. Also if you are a wheelchair disabled person it is a no no!! The access to the hotel is via a ramp which is much to steep and an accident waiting to happen. £50 a day to park your car.,2,2017,08,31
121,Experience,"I had lovely time at Taj Hotel, the service in the bar outside, he was excellent wow, we stay for 6 hours good champagne, DOM P.. we just come for bank holiday..also the room is so clean wow, I'm going back again I will recommend my friends..",5,2017,08,30
121,First time in London,We found the St. James to be a fantastic hotel for us. I would call it a 4 star property with 5 star service. The hotel lobby and courtyard are beautiful. The room was large and very comfortable. My wife and I always want a room that is not only comfortable but romantic and it was. We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was very nice that we could either have it in the café or in our room. We had breakfast in the room each day and it was delivered within 20 min. The location is fantastic easy walk to Buckingham Palace Big Ben Westminster Abby all within blocks. For the money I don't think we could have found anything better.,5,2017,08,30
121,Wow,"We arrived at the St James Court, and were treated fantastically from the moment we were checked in by the lovely and helpful Anushree to the moment we left. 

Every member of staff were happy, helpful and smiling throughout our stay, and really gave the impression that we we were welcome. 
The hotel is amazing, and really is luxurious in many ways. Our room (366) was fantastic, clean and so big, and the bed was absolutely great, big and comfortable. The bathroom was large clean, and had all the amenities that we needed for our stay, so we did not really need to bring our own. Even if we had have forgotten anything, the Hotel offered to provide the bits we might have forgotten. 

The breakfast was superb, and everything you could wish for was there, from sweet treats, continental fayre, Everyday items such as bacon, sausage, and even omelettes and poached eggs made to your own requirements. The breakfast staff were brilliant, and although they were working so hard, they were so attentive and never stopped smiling. 

Thank you all for making our trip so great. It was a fantastic experience, and one we will never forget. 

I'm 100% sure we will be returning in the near future.

A card waiting for me and chocolate strawberries on a birthday plate. The massage was the best we have ever had. Afternoon tea was a delight. The staff go out of their way to help. Location was fantastic from Buckingham palace to Victoria and saw Wicked in the evening. All walkable. Breakfast was lovely with the best eggs benedict with salmon. Would love to go back,5,2017,08,27
121,Enjoyable Stay in a Delightful Hotel,"Stayed here for two nights. The hotel is perfectly located for trips to the parks, Buckingham Palace, Westminster , etc. and is a 20-25 minute walk from Piccadilly/Soho/Chinatown. Had no complaints at all but, staying as a couple, we would probably go for the king bed option next time. The spa provided a wonderful massage after a day of walking around London and there is a peaceful courtyard area for relaxing in.",5,2017,08,27
121,Great breakfast & can walk to Buckingham Palace,"It was a short walk from the tube. They let us check in early and our room was very pleasant and comfortable. The breakfast buffet (included in our room price) was so varied with fruit, pastries, eggs, sausage, potatoes, some indian dishes and much more. It was the best breakfast on our 10 day trip! We easily walked to the Palace, Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the wharf. The staff was great, black cabs were right out the door and dont forget the yummy candies as you walk by the front desk!",5,2017,08,26
121,Best hotel in Central London,Indian touch in western financial capital. Very satisfied with overall hotel experience. have been staying for last 6 months consistently and epitome of Indian Hospitality of Taj.   will always stay at St. James when in London,5,2017,08,26
121,5 Star Hotel at Affordable Price,"Hotel is in a fabulous location on a quiet street near many big attractions (Buckingham Palace, Westminster). Staff was friendly. Large breakfast buffet.

121,"Beautiful accommodation, reasonably priced at Buckingham Palace.","This was our second trip to London and the hotel was a great place to stay.  It was very close to the royal parks and palaces as well as a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station.  The staff were outstanding.  We had a number of interactions with the staff and every one of them was an excellent interaction.  They were friendly, professional and very helpful.   We had the included breakfast and it was very traditional English and very well prepared.  The staff here also was very helpful: custom eggs were offered at no extra charge, when you put toast in they offered to deliver it to your table and we felt that we were more than a number.  The setting was beautiful, the courtyard was an oasis away from the street sounds.  We would be happy to stay again.",5,2017,08,26
121,Fantastic hotel,"I love staying at this hotel when I'm in London, the customer service is exceptional, the rooms are fantastic and amenities exactly what you'd want from a central London location. I have never had a bad experience staying here. ",5,2017,08,26
121,Juanita Buffalo NY,I had a wonderful experience at St James Court Hotel. It was my niece and i first time in London and we were made to feel very welcome. The hotel is centrally located so you can get to everywhere quickly. 3 minutes from Buckingham Place. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I will stay there again when i return.,5,2017,08,26
121,London accomendations 2017,"Location amazing.  Service impeccable. Our room 530 was lovely looking out over the court yard. Enjoyed the special touches.

I highly recommend this hotel for families!",5,2017,08,23
121,Expensive but very nice hotel in a great location,"Very very nice hotel close to Buck Palace and 200yds from tube station. Rooms are very nice, well furnished and clean.

121,The Taj,"This was my 5th stay at the Taj and once again it's always lovely going back. From the moment you approach the entrance you are made to feel very welcome.  The arrival and departure formalities were very smooth and the standard room was fine. In the past we have been upgraded to an executive room which are wonderful.
However we did receive complimentary breakfast, much appreciated. Breakfast at the Taj is always very good.
Easy to get to by public transport,  only a few minutes walk and you can never get lost because it's only a few minutes from Buckingham Palace.
Easy to walk to Traflgar Square, takes about 20 minutes at an easy pace.
Looking forward to our next stay at the Taj.
",5,2017,08,22
121,Suitable for family,"Tidy hotel but a little bit far from underground station.  Nearby it has many shops for eat and shopping. 

Staff with good greeting and CS services. Housekeeping services are also good and quick action. 
",4,2017,08,22
121,VERY POOR SERVICE,"I deeply regret what happened at my check out. I tried to do all my planning on time so that I could do everything without stress. However, as you had a broken elevator everything went wrong (you know elevator could be broken. The point is: there were no Plan B to face this problem). My bags arrived 25 minutes after the person got them in the room. When they arrive downstairs the guy knew I was in a rush, but he got another bag of other people. This is unacceptable. Several alternatives could be used: down the stairs with the suitcases (including that I said i would go there to pick up my luggage), after some time you asked an employee help to pick it up and he just disappeared, could have picked up the elevator on the way up, could have picked up the elevator of service, could have picked up the elevator from the bedroom side rather than going to the other side of the building. Anyway, it was a succession of mistakes and incompetence. At the end I had to pay more to my transfer since the driver waited almost half an hour after the time i was supposed to be ready to go to the airport. And I had to get another flight because I was told I wouldn´t have enough time to go through customs, security, etc.
Lots of hotel people downstairs but no one able to solve this easy situation.",2,2017,08,22
121,Great Value,"You will find it difficult to get more for your dollar than at the Taj Hotel St James. We were very satisfied by the level of service, the size of the rooms, and the quality of the breakfast buffet. Plan to return here again in the future.",5,2017,08,22
121,Splendind day in London!,"Will try to arrange one more stay in Tadj Hotel; now will try for leisure with family.
Location is absolutely wonderful for both pedestrian walk for sightseeing and transport connections. Some good food and drinks both within hotel and nearby (authentic British pubs).",5,2017,08,22
121,Good location,"Excellent stay at this hotel,  great location with lots of attractions within easy walking distance.
Food served in the Quillon restaurant was excellent with very attentive service
Lovely courtyard bar for a summers evening and prices were very reasonable",5,2017,08,21
121,Great experience,"My wife and I spent 3 nights @ St. James Court from the 5/08 - 8/08. Great Hotel with warm and friendly staff to great you. Check in was a breeze an the room was very comfortable, particularly the bed. The bathroom was nice and tidy and the shower had good water pressure and great heat.  Highly recommend the buffet breakfast, which was delicious. It had a great selection of hot and cold food and fresh fruit and cheese platters.  The coffee was also amazing! A great way to start the day.  A great place to stay and so central to all the major tourist attractions.  Would highly recommend and can't wait to stay here again!",5,2017,08,20
121,Vacation,"I was reluctant to leaving a review as I had mixed feelings about the hotel. The first night of our stay the AC was not working and we slept with the windows open. We were offered another room but it was already almost mid-night so we opted to stay until morning to resolve the issue. We were awakened
to heavy construction nosies early in the AM. outside our BR. We were offered a 50% credit for the night, but eventually received 100% after calling the booking co.They also gave us a upgraded room which was fine. Overall, the staff was fine. Getting the manager to do the right thing, and the noisy room, is the reason for the lower rating.",3,2017,08,20
121,"Wonderful, luxury five star hotel","So pleased with the high quality and warm prompt friendly service. Room exceeded expectations. .all three rooms were different with 374 being the largest with two windows. Meals in both Bank and Bistro restaurants were excellent as was the breakfast. Never saw in any hotel with as many polite efficient pleasant staff that there were at breakfast...and a wonderful huge breakfast buffet including some Indian specialties (and one could as well order custom omelettes, porridge, etc). Beautiful furnishings including high quality carpeting throughout. Also excelkent gym including men's sauna and steam room. And all for almost half the price of other similarly located five star hotels. Location is excelkent with Victoria Stn five mins walk and tube stn. Fresh flowers everywhere and a beautiful courtyard where one can order tapas and pizza.",5,2017,08,20
121,"Great location, but horrible view from room.",Hotel location was great and we could walk to everywhere in London. Hotel service was fine too and the suite i booked for 4 nights was perfect for a long stay. However the room had a view of their service courtyard and all we could see was trash and air conditioning outdoor units for our 4 day stay. Their standard rooms might have a  better view as compared to the suites.,4,2017,08,20
121,Poor customer service ,"On check-in, of course the room is not ready. Surprise surprise surprise. 

Also, I wanted to update my room rate to include breakfast. 

The lady checking me in spoke to the duty manager. I requested to speak to the duty manager but she REFUSED to speak to me. 

Poor customer service when the manager of the hotel REFUSES to speak to a customer about a simple request that more CUSTOMER FOCUSED hotels have accommodated. 

One would expect that given the PREMIUM price point of this hotel they would care more about the customers. ",1,2017,08,20
121,a few days in London,great place to stay.  location within walking distance of many sights.  breakfast buffet a little pricy but very good food.  do try indian restaurant. and weather permitting the courtyard is wonderful.  would stay again,5,2017,08,19
121,Good Location and Excellent Service!,"Stayed with Family in August in a Classic Master Suite. The suite is spacious and given the ""old style"" furniture and decor gives it a rustic appeal. The Hotel is centrally located within walking distance of the Buckingham Palace. The St James Tube is a stone's throw away and convenient to explore the city
The staff is extremely courteous and service is excellent. The General Manager was gracious to offer us breakfast without charge for the entire duration of our stay. 
The hotel staff really makes you feel welcome and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. The concierge was particularly helpful in booking tickets and other services and also in advising us on the locations to visit
I would recommend a stay here to experience the legendary TAJ hospitality for which it is world famous!",5,2017,08,19
121,Fantastic stay,"We just return from a 8 day stay at St james court.  We were travelling with our 16 year old son and had requested adjoining rooms overlooking the courtyard. At first we thought we did not get adjoining rooms but they were very clever adjacent rooms.  we had a door which blocked off a small hallway which both rooms connected to.  We locked the front door and kept the bedrooms doors unlocked so we could go from room to room.  Our Rooms were very large for London.  I would say they were the same size as any North American Hotel room we have stayed in (larger than some).  At night time it was like sleeping in a tomb.  We heard nothing I mean absolutely nothing. You would have thought we were staying in the outskirts.  Our booking provided a free breakfast.  The selection was great and the food wonderful, the pork sausages are the best you will ever have.  The staff is lovely everyone is very welcoming and friendly.

Here are a few tips.

Get the 7 day travel card for the tube you can get it at any tube station.  It makes getting around easy.

Download the APP city mapper.  It gives you a map of london and it provides you with travel directions from point to point you can choose a walkinf path, bus only, tube only, or combination of all three.  We found this app very helpful.  It made used the buses super easy and I suggest you use the buses they come all the time and you see more of the city than if you stuck to the tubes. 

WARNING - this app will drain you battery quickly so bring one of those external charges if you plan to have it running in the background or do as I did get the directions then quit.  I would re launch the app as needed to double check the directions on the trip.

Cell phones- if you are like us and wanted to be able to use the web, call one another  you will want to pick up a uk sim Card.  our Canadian plans (which charge the most in the world) wanted to charge us $10 CDN per day to roam in the UK.  Yup that would be $240 Canadian.  We picked up £10 pay as you go plans from O2 which gave us 100 minutes of calls unlimited texts (UK) and 1 gig of data.  The plan is good for a month and can be topped up if needed. So for $48 CDN all three of us had phones.  The O2 store is on Victoria road.  Turn right out the hotel doors cross Victoria road turn right and walk 100 meters.  Do not buy a sim card at Heathrow the deals there are not as good.

Snacks and drinks
There is an off license (convenience store) next to the hotel but his prices are higher than those at Little Waitrose which is across the street from the 02 cell store. They have a great selection you can get anything you need and bonus you can buy the big pots of Marmite for like £2 cheaper than the small ones here in Canada.  Mmmmm.....Marmite.

Cheap (for london) lunches.
Pret-a-Manger or just Pret if you area local.  Great freshly made sandwiches.  Try the cheese and pickle it is sooo good.

The number 15 bus.
Runs from Tragalgar Square towards the tower.  Some of the buses are the standard new london bus (double decker).  But they do run eleven of the old Route Master Double deckers.  If you have the time wait for an old Route Master and enjoy the experience.",5,2017,08,19
121,Cheers to St. James Court,"We chose St. James Court based on reviews and ideal location for a 2 day pre-cruise stay in London.
The entire experience exceeded our expectations.  We were warmly greeted by the doorman after our overnight flight from Canada.  Unfortunately a room wasn't ready but our luggage was securely stored and then moved to our room later.  The friendly staff were very professional.  The hotel has an impressive entry with doorman.  Our room was comfortable and clean.  Despite the age of the facility, it appears to be clean and very well maintained.  The buffet breakfast was quite adequate and nicely presented with friendly staff.  Our bed was comfortable and non-smoking room in a quiet area.  The location was perfect - located a short walk from Buckingham Palace and sightseeing buses galore.  We felt safe and secure.  A nice touch was the fruit, fudge and chocolate at the front desk.  We would highly recommend this fine hotel.",5,2017,08,18
121,Excellant hotel,"Excellent Hotel, room really lovely & large, we stayed on the 4th floor & I couldn't believe how quiet it was, no traffic noise even though the street just around the corner is extremely busy. The staff were lovely & couldn't do enough for us. Would stay again",5,2017,08,18
121,Location; staff; clean,"location was great. staff friendly and knowledgeable. hotel clean with good amenities. room had a little noise from staff to traffic; but, nothing that was excessive.  building is old so the bathroom didn't have the best ventilation.  ",5,2017,08,18
121,Birthday suprise,Booked this for my partners birthday. Is now my go to place if I ever want to stay in London. Rooms were beautiful. They put rose petals on bed & in bathroom. Had a lovely dinner in restaurant and relaxed In bar after. Can not wait for next visit.  ,5,2017,08,17
121,Great hotel for first-time visitors,Was an upscale property at a great price. Had valuable outdoor patio space .  Location was excellent for walking or biking to most sites.  Various restaurants and park were close by.  Felt like a very safe neighborhood and had no issues walking late at night.,5,2017,08,17
121,Water pressure of shower,I was given a room on the fifth floor where the water pressure of the shower was too low to properly use it! I explained the situation and an engineer came to my room to find the water pressure normal! He eventually admitted after staying for 10 min. in the bathroom that indeed the water pressure was to low to take a shower and also recognized that he couldn't fix the problem. Finally another room was proposed to me and at around midnight I moved to another room on the sixth floor.   In the sixth floor room the water pressure was better but certainly not what I'd have expected for a regular shower! Also the smell emanating from  this sixth floor room indicated that has was occupied by a smoker! Under such circumstances I don't think I'll recommend your hotel to anyone!,3,2017,08,17
121,A Big Thank You!,"Just like to say a big thank you to ALL the staff at the St James' Court for making our two nights stay very special, especially to Sunaina who made us feel most welcome.
We choose the Taj Hotel again, as it's our hotel of choice when visiting London. The service is first class, staff always polite and helpful, bedrooms and bathrooms spotless, very comfortable beds, good WiFi and set in a great location. We will certainly be returning when we are in London next!",5,2017,08,17
121,great place to stay in London,"His hotel is very nice, good staff, is just a few blocks from the Palace. The rooms are very nice. What more do you want for a reasonable price. The next time we go to London we will stay here. We did a trip to the Downton Abbey / Dr. Martin tour and a few days in London.",5,2017,08,16
121,Old world charm and top notch hospitality,"Staying in this hotel brought back movies hollywood.  The service is excellent.  The staff is just there to please you.  Very polite and couteous.  The room we stayed in was rather small and with old fashioned decor and furniture but somehow, it did not take any of its charm away.",5,2017,08,16
121,Stay at St. James Court,Excellent hotel centrally located near Buckingham Palace and Westminster. Very friendly and attentive staff. Our room was ready when we got there. The included breakfast was excellent. We were very impressed with the hotel in general.,5,2017,08,16
121,fantastic hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the st James court hotel August 2017 for four nights. Brilliant hotel, great staff, very friendly.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Our room was so quiet, yet hotel is very central. We just loved it and would definitely stay there again.  Linda",5,2017,08,16
121,Wonderful hotel,"I had an amazing stay, the staff was incredibly kind and attentive and the location couldn't have been any better, literally steps away from Buckingham Palace in a very peacefull neighborhood. 

The hotel interior is very beautiful and the room I stayed in was modern and very confy. 

Breakfast was very good and varied but I would recommend going to breakfast early because it got a bit hasty from 9 to 11.

The hotel has themed afternoon tea hours such as Sherlock holmes and Alice in Wonderland (which I totally recommend). 

I'm very satisfied with my experience in this hotel and I would totally recommend it.

",5,2017,08,16
121,Excellent for families & great location,"We spent 3 nights as family of 4 in Exec Family Suite. I can't fault anything in our whole stay. From the moment we stepped out of the car to the moment we left, the service was excellent and everything went very, very well. 
We arrived after a 14hr flight with a 3 & 7 yr old. Check-in was smooth, our room ready and our bags were delivered within 5 mins of us getting in the room. 
The room was a great size by London standards, the largest I've stayed in over many trips to London. This room type has a lounge area with sofas for 4, plus writing desk and TV as well as a good sized free floor space which was great for my Son to play with his trains etc. There is a partial wall between the living space and the bedroom, it is not a full wall. We had 2 queen beds plus TV. No kitchen facilities but kettle available. Good sized bathroom. 
The little extras were fantastic... a kids welcome pack, one of the best I've seen; a special delivery on day two of a fruit smoothie and chocolate cookie with kids names on them. 
Excellent buffet breakfast plus eggs a la carte. We had dinner in Bistro which was great food, excellent flavour and good children's menu. We also had dinner at Bank restaurant with friends - food was excellent, including ribs on the kids menu which my daughter loved. 
Food and service excellent. Location excellent, walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Tesco, Victoria station etc. Would not hesitate to recommend for families, children very well catered for and welcomed at this hotel.
Spa services also very good. 
Only recommendation is a more thorough clean of the carpets, but this is being really picky. Most people would not be sitting on the floor playing with toys but just something I noticed. ",5,2017,08,15
121,Stay at St. James' Court,"I can't say enough about this hotel.  Everything about it is exceptional.  The service and treatment at this hotel cannot be beat, and it's affordable.  It's very beautiful.  Rooms are large and very clean and set up perfect.  Food in the courtyard of St. James' Hotel is fantastic.  

As far as location, it's in a beautiful area, and you can quickly walk to Buckingham Palace.  It's very close.  It's not in the shopping districts, if that's your thing, or the Eye of London and popular tourists spots.  But these places can be walked to as well.  We used Uber a lot and walked and used Hop on Hop Off bus.   An Uber is always two minutes in away in London and from the hotel if you don't like to walk.  Or St. James' will call a cab or you can flag one yourself.",5,2017,08,15
121,Lovely Stay,"Sorry for the delay in writing my review, I had scheduled surgery upon my arrival home.
Upon our arrival at 10PM we found out there was an issue at check in. I was very upset as it was late and when I made my reservation in February and with many emails I was assured my request would be met.  The next day, thanks to the help of Mr. Naveen Sikka, the problem was corrected and from that point on the St. James Court Hotel redeemed itself.  We usually stay at another local hotel when we're in London and decided we needed a change.  We will definitely return to the St. James as we found that after the issue was resolved we were able to relax and enjoy the lovely atmosphere and the staff was wonderful.  We found the hotel and our room very neat and clean and the breakfast yummy the location is great as well as we were able to walk to most places quicker than a taxi could get us there.
Again, a shout out to Mr. Naveen Sikka for all his help.

121,London Show Visit,"This was a birthday treat form my good lady wife to visit London. I chose the St James again on past experience, where the serevice was par excellence. This time there we some things that were not as i would have expected, for an executive room i would not have expected cobwebs, tea/coffe not refilled, and an uncomfortable bed! This is our 4th time staying at this hotel and i was a little disappointed to any the least by the room and lack of detail in the house keeping service.",3,2017,08,14
121,Buckingham Palace trip,We stayed at this hotel as it was close to Buckingham Palace. The staff were excellent and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in London. From the porters on arrival and receptionist everyone was so helpful ,5,2017,08,13
121,Best hotel in London!,"Conveniently located, exceptionally well managed and lovely staff and a real pleasure! Close to the palace in a truly wonderful part of town, the St. James is an ideal hotel for anyone traveling to this beautiful city. ",5,2017,08,13
121,Excellence again at Dt James's Court,"Another very enjoyable stay at this excellent hotel. Staff are attentive, service is very good and quality of food was as expected. Check-in and departure was quick and without issue. Highly recommended, I will be returning. ",5,2017,08,12
121,Disappointing ,"I generally don't leave reviews as our usual hotel stays are great. However I feel I have to on this occasion as I really don't want other people to be as disappointed as myself! As a family we stay in hotels a lot, particularly in London and was intrigued by St James's Court as the price was good (£450 I think) and it rated highly. As far as location went it was great as we were attending the theatre and then taking the children to Buckingham palace the next morning. That is where the positives end! 

Room was dated. Room service was beyond poor - took an hour to reach us and was still missing a drink. Hotel lobbies are dated and have a very odd layout where no one knows where they should be. Finally, breakfast was a joke. Couldn't fit us in, waited 20 minutes, when questioned she had forgotten about us! Got given 2 separate tables and offered complimentary extras for the children for our trouble. We helped ourselves to the worst breakfast I have ever encountered. Cold bacon, eggs and sausage, meats and cheeses with film on them from being out so long and yogurt that my 7 year old described as 'tasting like when you are going to be sick!' Personally I only tried the Bircher muesli as everything else looked so awful. That was also horrible. After we left we were informed that the complimentary extras for the children were ready. Half an hour later as we stood by the lift to leave. Brilliant. 

I would advise to pay a little more and go for a Firmdale or Intercontinental even if it means a taxi journey. To be honest I would rather a Premier Inn",2,2017,08,12
121,Our Favourite London Hotel,"A little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. The rooms are ""well appointed"" to use a cliché, the food is excellent and the staff are friendly and helpful. I can see that we will be returning here on a regular basis in the future.",5,2017,08,12
121,Felt like royalty!,"We had such a greatexperience at this hotel! It's withing walking distance of many attractions, such as Westminster abbey, Buckingham Palace, Big, Ben, etc. Close to the tube and bus stops, close to the Thames as well. The staff was outstanding, often going above and beyond to be helpful. They made us feel like royalty! In nine days there, we never saw anything but greatness from them. The rooms are clean, bathrooms are a little small, but we were barely in our room other than to sleep, there was so much to see! Lots of restaurants for all budgets, at night they had a bar in the interior garden, we loved to go there and relax after a full day of sightseeing! The room was a little small, but very affordable, especially when so close to everything and worth every penny to be a part of this wonderful hotel! If you have a chance to stay there, you won't regret it!",5,2017,08,12
121,Average Interiors .. Excellent staff and service!!,"Let's put the disappointment out of the way. The interiors of the room are feeling dated and is in need on a refresh at least in the wing I was staying in. Other members of my family in a different section had a more modern interior. So this might be an issue depending on where you are located.

The staff and service at this hotel are simply outstanding. Any amount of praise would be less. Whether it was room service, front desk, in room dining or concierge, they went all out to ensure that all your needs were met. They were courteous and efficient at all times.

The location of the hotel is a big plus as you are a 5 mins walk from Buckingham palace and it is easy to go around London if you are staying here. Whilst you are here, a visit to the Michelin starred Quilon restaurant which serves the best Keralan cuisine in London is recommended. The breakfast is quite nice and there are always some Indian items in the buffet which was a bonus. We put in a request for some Indian breakfast items in advance and they served it at breakfast (additional charge applies) which was quite nice.

I would definitely recommend this hotel. Would be worthwhile putting in a request to be located in the refurbished wings. If you are travelling from India then this place is a no brainer as you can load up on Taj points and experience the fabulous Indian hospitality while being 1000s of miles away from home.",5,2017,08,12
121,A very Average experience ,I was expecting a really nice hotel and was quite pleased with the room but when it came to breakfast I was really quite disappointed. I was forgotten about while waiting for a table and when we actually had the food. It was pretty poor. Bit disappointed. Wouldn't recommend. ,2,2017,08,12
121,St. James Court,Excellent attention 24/7. Perfect location. Close to tour buses and walking distance to Palace. I highly recommend it to others. Very knowledgeable concierge helps with transportation and tours. Breakfasts re the best here.,5,2017,08,11
121,Best service in London,"I stayed at the hotel last week for a weekend break. This is the second time that I stayed in the hotel, and once again all of the staff were incredibly helpful, courteous and nothing seemed to cause any problem to them.
I'm in a wheelchair, and following an accident need to sleep on a special mattress which I take with me when I travel. I called ahead of time to ask the hotel to remove the mattress on the bed, and fully expected this not to have been done when I checked in. To my surprise, they'd followed my request, and it just made me feel that they really care about their guests.
We also needed an adapter plug, and that was brought to the room within about five minutes of asking for it.
The staff are so friendly and professional, and we stayed in many top hotels around the world and this hotel is by far the best.
My only complaint is that the parking charges are extremely high - £50 per 24 hours.

I would recommend this hotel to anybody, and love the charm of the courtyard and the lovely pastel pink/green carpets and little touches like incense sticks.",5,2017,08,11
121,"Convenient location, large family room, good service ","We stayed as a family of 3 for 6 nights in their family room. The room had 2 queen size beds, 2 TV, 1 living area and 1 washroom. The place was spacious and beds were comfortable. Breakfast was included at the bistro, at a cigar bar and also in room, the latter being something exceptional. You could order champagne breakfast in room with no extra cost.
The service was good in that staff were polite and helpful. 
The hotel was just 5 minutes walk from the tube and 3 minutes from little Tesco. There were many restaurants nearby.
The drawbacks included:
The gym appeared slightly old.
My friends who booked 2 rooms with king size beds were unfortunate in that the drainage in one of the toilet stopped working. As they preferred to have interconnecting room, they had to change rooms 3 times for 6 nights.
The window was left opened and the lights were left on after cleaning of room.
The false fire alarm went off twice.",4,2017,08,10
121,St James Court,"We stayed for 5 nights. The room was a good size, bed very comfortable and the breakfast of excellent quality a mixture of self service and you could also order anything you wanted. Entrance foyer is a bit dark and rather uninviting. Staff are very helpful and the bedrooms quiet at night. Would recommend it and is convenient to the Underground and Victoria Train station.",4,2017,08,09
121,"Great location, comfortable and pretty","Stayed for work, rooms are small, but it's London and I've seen smaller. Very comfortable rooms with pretty furnishings, a bit confusing to wind around the halls to find your room but sort of the charm. Great service, only has drinks at the bar but it was very good. Good location. Wifi is excellent. Lots of shops nearby.",5,2017,08,08
121,Great staff and superb location,"On arrival, unfortunately Trivago had messed up our booking and they had no record of it...  apparently Trivago are exceptionally good at this!  The staff were superb, sorted it out within ten minutes and our room was organised. The bar staff work hard, breakfast was great with a good mix of hot end cold food, the bar next door had happy hour cocktails, rooms were clean and we were two minutes walk from our Palace visit. Would definitely book again.",5,2017,08,08
121,"Central Loacation, Top Notch Service!","Stayed 4 nights in July with family.  The rooms were large by Euro standards. Service was top notch.  Concierge and desk staff are helpful and friendly.  Rooms were clean and serviced promptly. Location is central, with many attractions within a 15 minute walk.  I recommend the afternoon tea.  Great food and service as well.  This hotel is not cheap, but considering it is central London, it is a good value.",5,2017,08,08
121,Great Hotel,The hotel let us use the salon when we arrived much earlier than check-in as well as before leaving for our flight. The breakfast buffet was phenomenal and everyone at the hotel was very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is located in a great part of the city with easy access to many of the top attractions. We had the larger room with a king size bed which had lots of space. A tip would be to check and compare the square footage of the various rooms.,5,2017,08,08
121,Great location and service,"We had a great time staying for one night as a treat for my mum's birthday.  The location was excellent, really close to Buckingham Palace so we could do the palace tour and an easy walk to Big Ben and Wesminster Abbey.  We got the Thames Clipper boat service from Westminster Pier to Greenwich and back, which was really easy to do and great just to pay with contactless cards rather than worrying about pre booking tickets.  

Our rooms were standard rooms - one spacious twin and one double and were better than expected having read previous reviews.  The furniture was a bit tired but not enough to spoil the room.  The shower was really powerful, which was much appreciated (having stayed in quite a few hotels where it hasn't been!). Both rooms overlooked the inner courtyard, which is really pretty with lots of flowers - the double room had a full view whilst the twin room looked onto the other side of the hotel which wasn't quite as attractive. 

We had a tapas lunch in the bar, which was delicious - 3 dishes were perfect for 3 people and later on enjoyed after dinner drinks in the lounge with a pianist playing.  We really liked the feel of the hotel and found it to be upmarket without being stuffy - the staff were excellent.

I had called the hotel in advance to let them know it was my mum's birthday and when we returned from the theatre in the evening, there was a small chocolate cake and Happy Birthday message in her room, which was an unexpected special surprise. 

Breakfast was served in the Bistro, which has great decor and lots of natural light and was good, although some of the hot food items were a bit too cold. We were offered eggs cooked to order, including scrambled eggs which were already available from the buffet. The lady who seemed to be in charge of the breakfast service noticed my mum opening her birthday cards and a few minutes later brought a strawberry cake with a candle in and the staff sang Happy Birthday to her, which was fabulous.

We loved the little touches in the hotel - lots of fresh flowers, fragrance diffusers in the corridors and really helpful doormen offering umbrellas and taxis.  Overall a great stay, will definitely return.",5,2017,08,07
121,Lovely stay close to attractions,"I have actually stayed in this hotel twice; first time on business a couple of years ago, and recently when I surprised my boyfriend with a weekend trip to London.

And it was that positive experience from my business trip that made me choose this place again, and it did not disappoint. 

The hotel lobby is stylish and elegant, and gives a very nice first impression. Service in this hotel is good. The room was lovely with classic decor, and of good size. Amenities were standard, nothing special about them one way or another. 

We enjoyed drinks in the hotel lobby bar a couple of times, and really enjoyed the cocktails and the selection of champagne. The bar can, however, be quite busy - but that's a good sign in this case. 

For someone rather sporty, this hotel is within walking distance to many popular attractions, and literally only minutes from Buckingham Palace. We walked all the way to Mayfair for dinner, and Selfridges for shopping. Most people would probably wish to take a taxi or the public transport: St. James's Park tube station is the closest, and Victoria also within a walking distance. 

Overall, an elegant hotel.",5,2017,08,04
121,"In London, always seek St James Court","Close to the iconic Buckingham Palace, St James Court is one of the finest places to stay in London. It has all you desire when away from home. It has the class, and is shorn of the glitz and razzmatazz one sees at all five star properties across the world. Staying at St James is an experience of its own. I enjoyed it, what about you?",5,2017,08,03
121,Potential to be a great 5 star hotel. ,"Some family members and I recently stayed at this hotel for our first trip to London. I give this hotel a 4.5 star rating and will look to stay here again when London. 

Positives:
1. All the staff were extremely nice, accommodating and professional.
2. The hotel is very clean. 
3. Very nice lobby and bar area with piano player at night. Lobby has comfortable chairs and is very relaxing place to sit and unwind from day of walking in London.
4. Very large rooms for central London. We had King Size Rooms. Large bathrooms in our room. 
5. Very quiet rooms, slept like a baby every night. 
6. The rooms are turned twice per day. They were very neat and clean upon admission and throughout stay.
7. Location of this hotel is hard to beat, bar none. Very safe neighborhood and walkable at night. 5 minute relaxed pace walk to St. James Park & Buckingham Palace. 2 minutes walk to St. James Tube/subway station and 5 minute walk to Victoria Station. 8 min moderate pace walk to Big Ben, London Eye, Southbank and other historical sites. Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus are about 15 minute walk away from hotel. Several pubs, restaurants and grocery stores in surrounding area of hotel. The hotel is a 3 to 5 minute tube ride to most tourist areas. 
8. Taxi line up across the street and always available. 10 pound early morning taxi ride to Paddington Station to take the Heathrow express to Heathrow airport. 
9. Very nice gym and workout area.

15. Hotel offers free European/U.K. plug adapters.
16. Heat & A/C worked well in room. 

Negative(s):
1. Room and hallway wallpaper needs updating, wood trim in room needs some touch up painting.
2. Bathroom did not have exhaust fan. 
3. Touch up painting needed for doors, windows and window sills.
4. Some lamp shades need replacing.
5. Longer and better shower curtains. Shower water would leak onto floor.
6. Depending where your room is located in the hotel, you may have to walk down maze like hallways to get to your room. 

In summary, if this hotel makes some slight aesthetic improvements and upgrading, in my opinion it can easily be a 5 start hotel that can rival other 5 star hotels in London due to its location, charm and staff professionalism. ",4,2017,08,03
121,Great hotel in London,We had a great experience with my family. We had a family room which was perfect for all the family with three kids. The kids had hot chocolate and cookies waiting for them in the afternoon. The staff is very friendly and ready to help. Very nice breakfast buffet. The location is perfect: just few minutes walking from all major touristic spots in London.  I was at Taj Hotels many times and they really know how to take care of you. I trust Taj. ,5,2017,08,02

121,Afternoon tea at St James Court was wonderful,"I took an american colleague for a really British afternoon tea. We had been in Westminster to The Tate and all around Westminster so this was an ideal venue within walking distance from St James Park.
It was wonderful. The week we were there, they were doing a Wimbledon themed afternoon tea. This included Pimms jelly (gorgeous), little cakes shaped like tennis balls, scones, mini sandwiches, miniature strawberries and cream etc etc. It was really a treat and my american colleague could not stop taking phtographs and talking about it.
So thank you St James'Court - you did us proud!",4,2017,07,31
121,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is about a five-minute walk along Buckingham Gate to Buckingham Palace. 
Beautifully  decorated and classy. I agree with other reviews that the TV  was hard to navigate. Excellent  and knowledgeable staff at reception desk. The bartenders were nice but had no clue about the tourist areas we asked about .They were outsiders. 
Expensive but lovely tea at the hotel in an Alice in Wonderland Theme. My partners do not like tea sandwiches  but the decor was great.",4,2017,07,30
121,"Lovely hotel, very friendly service","Stayed at The St James Court Hotel last night (29th July) for the first time.

The hotel has a fairly grand facade and is impressive as you walk up to the entrance, certainly you get the feeling of old school opulence and grandeur.

Upon entering the hotel we had a very friendly welcome from door staff, reception staff and everyone we encountered.

Check in was very easy and a smiling and helpful chap called Brendan talked us through the speedy process and gave us a brief overview of the facilities.

Our room was clean and tidy although (No 679) at the very end of a fairly long route march along winding corridors and up and down slopes and steps.

A smallish but very comfortable double bed meant for a good night of sleep. The facilities in the room are to a good standard although the TV is a little small when viewed from the bed (a reasonable distance away due to the layout of the room).

There was no real view from the bedroom window as it faced another part of the hotel opposite but that's fairly standard for central London.

We ate in The Hamptons Bar after taking in a show in town and the food and service were both very good indeed.

Breakfast in the Bistro is a combination of buffet and request and we were seated at a lovely table by the window.

The food was very nice, with an Asian slant, no doubt paying homage to the Taj group and a number of its visitors.

My first visit to this hotel and any Taj hotel and I must say that I really liked the atmosphere here, the building helps this, but mostly because of the staff who were attentive and friendly throughout without being stuffy and obsequious  (as often some large West End hotels are).

If you are in town and looking for a comfortable friendly and beautiful place to stay, you should consider this place. Thumbs up from me!",5,2017,07,30
121,Warm & Loving place called Taj!,"Every Taj hotel I visit I have a certain expectation from them. And yet again St James Court not only met but exceeded them. We were travelling with a small baby and were given all the support we needed for his meals. The renovated rooms were superb. 
People who deserve a special mention are Front of the House manager Navin Sikka and IRD ordertaker Ganga. Navin was there to address any issue or concern and always with a warm smile in the lobby.
Ganga was extremely well versed with his job knowledge and very understanding of whatever we ordered from IRD. He never had to keep checking with the chef, he knew what can and cannot be done. Very helpful and always pleasant on the phone.

Thank you Taj for the lovely hospitality and making us feel at home away from home :) ",5,2017,07,29
121,Good for business travel,"good place. second time in 2 years. got same room.

121,2 night stay,"Hotel is in a great location very close to Buckingham palace and Victoria train station.
Reception beautifully decorated and i liked free chocolates or fudge on the counters nice touch.
Bedrooms nicely decorated bed comfy and nice touches decor.The only downside tiny tv very difficult to change channel and see from bed.

Breakfast lovely bit pricey £20 pp very good selection and attentive service.
Service very good taj helpful taxi straightaway, greeted in lift and all staff acknowledged me nice personal touch.",4,2017,07,29
121,Excellent hotel let down by breakfast,"The hotel and its staff were first class. Our room was well-appointed and comfortable. The TV was a bit difficult to negotiate and slow to respond. Our only quible was with the breakfast - a very good variety, but I was disappointed with the temperature of the buffet items. The plates were barely warm and the food only lukewarm - lukewarm bacon is not the best. However this was made up by our meal at Quilon - quite superb.",4,2017,07,29
121,Wonderful stay as always,"My favourite hotel when staying in London, it is like coming home as everyone at the hotel are so friendly. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated in warm rich colours of red and golds and the rooms are well appointed and restful. Classy is a word that springs to mind when thinking of the St James' Court.  Beds are extremely comfortable and all staff work very hard to make your stay a pleasant one.  Great drinks at the Hamptons as well as delicious hot chocolate later on round off perfect days out sightseeing and seeing old friends. I am always so pleased to see world class pianist Ed Bentley playing great jazz and standards and I myself as a former professional singer always perform a couple of songs with Ed on a night or two which those who are present always tell me they enjoy.",5,2017,07,28

Prices are bit on higher side 
Over all good experience ",5,2017,07,27
121,Fantastic stay!,"I recently had the pleasure of spending two nights at the St. James Court Hotel. It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. The doorman immediately takes your luggage for you and by the time you check in it is already in your room! 

It's a beautiful building both inside and outside. The Lobby is exquisite and I was lucky enough to get a room overlooking the courtyard with two separate huge arch top balcony doors (although you couldn't go out on the balcony, which I thought was odd), but it added to the beautiful atmosphere of the room. Since I was on the second floor I was worried about the noise coming from the courtyard restaurants, but it was quiet enough and I loved seeing the action in the evening. 

I paid for a classic king and asked if they had any updated rooms and this one was definitely updated. Beautiful modern decor but still warm and classy. Beautiful built in closet and mirrored bar, and a separate nook with a desk and TV (a bit far to see the TV but I didn't watch much anyway). The only negative, if you can call it a negative, is that there are no outlets to plug anything in. You get a coffee pot and tea kettle, and there is an iron and ironing board in the room, as well as your cell phone and I had to crawl on the floor under the desk to use one outlet, and move the TV away for the only other one. It seems they forgot to think about that when redoing the room. Unfortunately, the hallways don't seem to have kept up with the rest of the hotel because they are extremely narrow, very long and winding and are in need of an update. While they weren't dirty and the carpet looks reasonably new, the pink and pale green maybe could be updated.

The front staff and everyone that I met was so friendly even though it is an upscale hotel and I was wearing jeans for my stay! It is close to the underground with the circle and district line only a couple of blocks away. It is also just a block or so away from Buckingham Palace. 

The only word of warning I have is that the breakfast is extremely expensive and there is a lovely café right across the street where I was able to get breakfast for about £10. 

I would definitely recommend staying here and plan on doing so on my next visit. I booked this hotel a year ago so I was able to get a pretty good price.

121,Mad Hatters Tea Party,Had a lovely afternoon tea party here with a friend. Everything was delicious and the service was great. The place was beautiful. Setting was done beautifully paying extra attention to detail which I love.,5,2017,07,26
121,"Excellent service, good location","Location is very good, close to the tube station. Service was also excellent, as one has now come to expect from a Taj hotel.  Some rooms are a bit dated, though very clean. It was nice to sit in the Lobby/Bar area and have a drink listening to some live music.",4,2017,07,26
121,The best part of our amazing trip to London,"My boyfriend and I travelled to London for his 21st and my mum kindly treated us to this hotel stay. We had many exciting things planned such as a tour of Buckingham Palace, but this hotel was our favourite thing about the whole trip. The staff were so attentive and took care of our every need, we informed Elisabet on reception of my boyfriend's birthday and she made sure we got an upgrade on our room and a complimentary cake.  I can't fault the hotel, it was the most friendly and relaxing experience.  My family and I stay in London a lot, but this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in there. Thank you so much for making our visit so special!",5,2017,07,26
121,Perfect place to stay!!,"Our first time in London and a wonderful experience!  This  hotel was perfect. We appreciated the delicious breakfast buffet, free Wi Fi, friendly, helpful and cheerful staff, the comfortable room, and close proximity to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station, the underground, restaurants , and shopping Would love to come back!!",5,2017,07,25
121,Faultless,Love staying at this hotel - excellent service & great location. Staff so very helpful & good management throughout. We normally eat in the Bistro but went to a show & therefore had to miss out this time. Always a good welcome - it feels like home. A tip: book afternoon tea...superb,5,2017,07,25
121,Wonderful stay in a great location,"We selected St. James Court based on its convenient location next to Buckingham Palace and other London sites as well as the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and were not disappointed.   We arrived very early in the morning and had asked in advance if our rooms could be ready.   The hotel stated they would try but could not guarantee the rooms would be available that early.  However, when we arrived, we found that they did have the rooms ready for us which we appreciated after the long overnight flight from the US.  The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated in all the common spaces.  We loved the lobby bar and the outdoor courtyard. The bathrooms in each of our rooms were updated and the beds were extremely comfortable.   The furniture in the rooms is very traditional.   The service we received, especially in the lobby bar, was excellent.  One waiter in particular went out of his way to make our experience special!   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London.",5,2017,07,25
121,Lovely stay great location,"I stayed here with my husband for a weekend. This hotel is in a great location, just off Victoria Street and near all the main attractions for tourists such as Buckingham palace and Westminster. Our room came with breakfast which was delicious. The staff was so friendly, our room was quite the small but the is London so is what we would expect. A lovely central hotel with friendly helpful staff staff, we would stay here again. ",4,2017,07,25
121,Is this London's worst 5* hotel?,"I am 1 night into a 3 night torment. The room is straight out of a deceased estate sale from the 90s, with mis-matched faux heritage furniture all jumbled together. Everything is extremely worn out. The 'minibar' is presented on a side table rendering the table unusable. There are all sorts of switches around the room that no longer appear to serve any function. There is rot in the wood and mold in the bathroom. 

The service is poor. There front door is often unattended leaving guests to struggle up the stairs or steep ramp with their luggage. The wrong newspaper was delivered to my room.

Taj should be ashamed to charge the prices they do. Do yourself a favour - go to a hotel that takes itself and it's guests seriously.",1,2017,07,24
121,The Taj in London is wonderful,"We stayed here for the first three nights of our honeymoon before flying off to another city. It was a lovely experience. The staff are friendly and attentive, the hotel bar was a great place to cap off a great day in London. The drinks and food were dynamite.   In our eagerness to see the city and do some exploring, we didn't do as much exploring throughout the hotel. The courtyard area was beautiful, along with the exercise room.   Our room was rather far from the lobby, which was a bit of a pain, but that is really the only gripe we can come up with.",5,2017,07,24
121,Great hotel and location for the price.,"The Taj Hotel and food was excellent, and the location was perfect for visiting London. When we're in London again we will stay at the Taj Hotel. The staff greeted you as you entered the hotel and said enjoy your day as you left.",5,2017,07,24
121,Excellent hotel stay,"I must point out that I was quite anxious about our booking given the reviews about less than par room sizes. 

We booked the classic studio and once we entered the room we were amazed at the sheer size of the room. It's was huge! 

Check in was a breeze at 2pm with a slight wait until 230pm.

House keeping was brilliant keeping our room nest and tidy every single day even for turn down. 

Breakfast was delicious although it was the reason I could not give the stay five stars. First we stayed for six nights and with the exception of the Indian menu the continental breakfast was the same every single day. Second the hotel was not equipped to handle the rush which occurred usually after 830am. Given the hotel has seven floors with over 100 rooms this is not acceptable for a Taj hotel. Third from day one of our stay our daughter who is four ordered pancakes off the menu and only on the last day were we told that pancakes was not included in the buffet. We were not charged in the end but this should again bit occur for a Taj Hotel. 

The hotel is exceptionally beautiful and service absolutely brilliant in almost all areas. 

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,07,24
121,Brilliant Hotel,"Fab hotel - excellent staff and mind blowing food! Go stay there! Very nice hotel room, very comfortable beds. Dined at a few of the restaurants in the hotel and they were unbelievable! Lovely hotel, highly recommended - great location and quiet for road noise etc too!",5,2017,07,24
121,Great Experience,"We had a great experience at St. James Court.  The hotel is in a great location. Several top attractions are within walking distance. Westminster Abby, Big Ben, Parliament Square, and Buckingham Palace are two or three blocks away. The tube/subway is around the corner and the train station is about a 15 minute walk. There are information people in the tube to help you.  Our room (king classic) was large with a large bathroom. The ac was good and if we wanted we could open the windows.  The noise level was low. We choose a  room facing the courtyard on an upper level. The buffet breakfast was included in the price of our room and we were very satisfied. We used the hotel website to make our reservation.  The people of London were very friendly and helpful. We had a great experience in London. Victoria Street around the corner from the hotel has more restaurants and are reasonable.  Be careful to ask if the price on the menu includes any added taxes or automatic added gratuities. When our bill came in two of the restaurants we were surprised to see the total larger than the price on the menu because of taxes and one added gratuities. After that we were careful to ask about hidden charges.  We enjoyed Albert’s Pub on the corner and All IN ONE on Victoria Street.",5,2017,07,23
121,Great Value for London Prices,I would stay here again and I would recommend this hotel to friends.  First class.  The rooms are small but typical of NYC or other metropolitan areas. The evening piano music was delightful. The Courtyard romantic and inviting.,5,2017,07,23
121,Wonderful welcome to London,"A top-notch hotel in all regards.  Our room was spacious and very clean.  The staff could not have been more accommodating and responsive.  I asked for an extra towel and an adapter for my curling iron and it was delivered by the time I arrived to my room. The full buffet breakfast was exquisite and most important, the hotel is very centrally located close to Buckingham Palace in Westminster.

I reserved and paid for our room eight months in advance, so I was able to get a great price, which included breakfast.",5,2017,07,22
121,Free upgrade to Junior Suite,Best hotel room I've been in. Really clean nice nespresso machine two TVs. Bathroom super nice and easily enough space for all you want to bring. Descent views of the city (not quite epic) but if you can afford would definitely go here.... ,5,2017,07,22
121,One of London's best-kept Secret Hotels at a Fabulous Location for Business and Leisure,"Excellent room, quiet, I was on floor six and slept well.Television offered many channels and all open to guests...a rare find in an otherwise greedy world. My room featured a dressing room and bathroom, both immaculately presented. Bed was king-size and very comfortable. Newspaper was delivered at 6am. Located right next to Buckingham Palace and Houses of Parliament. Positively a good experience for me. Breakfast was excellent and very good quality. Breakfast room was a little crowded but well-managed. Checkout was very well-managed and SWISH.....I like SWISH.. My advice to a prospective guest is to recommend this nice five star, reasonably-priced hotel to you for your London stay. Enjoy, Phil O.",5,2017,07,22
121,London Leisure Stay,Hotel was nice. Employees at desk and door men were all very friendly and greeted us daily. Twice a day maid service was a little much in my opinion but not a big deal. Rooms were clean but a little worn here and there. Food service was not our taste but there is a great Italian restaurant just down the street and a nice pub style restaurant just down the other direction. Close walk to St James Park tube station and manageable walk to Victoria tube station. Just right down the street from Buckingham Palace and the Mews and not more than another block from Westminster Abbey and Parliament. So very good central location for main London sites.,4,2017,07,21
121,Top notch,"Courteous, helpful staff with surprisingly large rooms. We've stayed all over London and think this is one of the best locals, being close to tube stops and parks. Ideal for the first time tourist to London. ",5,2017,07,21
121,Very nice hotel-close to most popular sites,"Very clean, lovely breakfast, polite, friendly staff. Within walking distance of Buckingham Palace,the London Eye, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square etc.with lots of nearby pubs and restaurants. The hotel has excellent restaurants on site. It is only a four min. walk to the nearest tube station.",5,2017,07,21
121,Great hotel!,"Lovely hotel in the perfect spot for sightseeing.  It is very large, with wonderful restaurants, but not much of a lobby area.  The rooms are quiet, clean and enormous for a big city like London!  I will be coming back the next time I'm in town.  I recommend it highly!",5,2017,07,21
121,Splendid London hotel,"From the welcome at the desk, through to the lovey room (with all the bit and bobs you'd expect), clean and tidy accommodation and nice  room service-all good :-)...I'm very likely to stay again...many thanks......",5,2017,07,20
121,My stay,We enjoyed every bit of our trip and in St James. Hotel staff helped us throughout and made our stay totally hassle free.  There is nothing that we found below our expectations. Even the trainee staff were most hospitable and supportive. Their willingness to make us comfortable and enjoy our stay is praise worthy. We were also taken round the adjacent hotel and shown around -- the elegant lay out and most impressive get up of the suites. Absolutely praise worthy. Please keep it up. Wishing you and your team higher success in the hospitality industry. Taj has always brought good name to my country. Jai Hind.,5,2017,07,20
121,Clean neat and Clasdic,"Me and my wife stayed here from 19th June to 22nd June, to attend ICC Annual conference. I have no hesitation to say that it is indeed a fine hotel to stay. Except that We had to wait a little over 20 minutes post check-in time bar, no othes reasons we faced to say anything unpleasant about this wonderful hotel. People attend us from Chek-in counter to breakfast to lobby drinks in-room lunch, were absolutely fantastic.",5,2017,07,19
121,Near the Tube,"Excellent service when we arrived.  Fantastic Afternoon Tea. Nice room with a, comfortable bed.  The garden is cosy and the service good. Good service at breakfast.  Close to the Underground and St, James Park.",4,2017,07,19
121,A memorable stay in London.,An excellent and unique hotel environment within distance with Buckingham Palace.  I have the quality rest and sleep through out my 7 days stay.

121,"Good Location, great food",The hotel is in good location. There is good dining options with plenty of variety. The rooms are old and need renovation and the prices are on the higher side. Staffs are very friendly and check in check out process is very smooth.,3,2017,07,18
121,Good stay,"Employees in all aspects of the hotel were well trained, friendly, and helpful. Food was excellent whether in courtyard or the Bank. Perfectly located to see all of London. Block and half from Buckingham Palace and St. Charles Park. Easy walk to Westminster and Big Ben.",4,2017,07,18
121,St James' Court Hotel,"Very pleasant hotel in excellent location, very close to Buckingham palace, and within a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station.  The room was very comfortable, and the service from the staff was very good. I would recommend the hotel.",4,2017,07,18

121,Excellent hotel well located,Great hotel with good service next to Buckingham Palace. Super location and walking distance to a lot of the London attractions. I highly recommend the Taj.  We traveled with 3 kids and reserved 2 rooms and it was perfect.,4,2017,07,17
121,"Very good stay, great service with a couple of things they could improve.....","I had to book a hotel a relatively short notice to stay over July 7-9. I'm from London but live in Boston. The service by everyone at the hotel was first class. We got to the hotel a little early, so not the hotel's fault. They gave us a free tea and coffee while they looked to see if a room was ready. After 20 minutes someone from the front desk came by and said that while a room was not available (it should have been by then) - they would give us a free upgrade to a suite. 

The room was great. Most important thing is that the bed was a large King size and was comfortable as were the pillows. The room was clean. The only thing I noticed was that two lampshades had big stains on them and one of the lights in the ceiling was buzzing and blinking. Overall though, this did not detract from my stay - although those are things the hotel should proactively fix. The bathroom was fine but the water pressure for the shower was pretty feeble. Like many London hotels, they don't have walk in showers. You have to stand in a rather narrow bath with a shower head with a flexible cord. For me this was fine, but if you are not that steady on your feet or have any other joint problems or are a large person  this shower could prove problematic and in my view is a slipping hazard.  

I must admit I am slightly puzzled by this hotel's relatively low ranking. The outside building is lovely. The hotel foyer is very tasteful and everyone working down there is polite and looking to help. I did not eat the food so cannot comment on that. The location is excellent - 3 minutes walk to St. James subway station on the District and Circle line and you can walk to Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament and many other tourist attractions in 10 minutes. Our room did not really have a view apart from a nice building across the street. The room was quiet. 

I was overall very pleased with the stay, but just some more attention to detail with the rooms is needed.",4,2017,07,16
121,St James Hotel,round the corner from Buckingham Palace and St James Palace Gardens and short walk to Victoria Station this lovely restored grand hotel e=was a great place to stay and from which to base a stay in London,4,2017,07,16
121,Two nights In London,The only peeve I have is that for such a luxury hotel the rooms are so small. Other wise it was a great place.It is a pity that all the luxury is in the pubic spaces and the rooms are tiny. There are so many they could knock down a few walls,4,2017,07,16
121,Good value for your money,"Hotel location is very good, nearest subway station is very near. Rooms are clean & comfortabe and every day there is few bottle fresh water. Breakfest is very good, and you can order omelets etc. Inside building is nice terrance where you can eat & relax. Consiergne desk staff is very helpfull. Wife signal can be stronger in rooms, but it works.
We find out one minus: you can´t get any snacks etc to terrance after 11PM.",4,2017,07,16
121,Great Rooms & Courtyard,"The hotel has a great, central location which is close to the subway. The rooms are quite large, clean and well setup to make them comfortable. We were here for 6 days and we had no issues during that time. The thing that really made the experience is the Courtyard, which is a nice  place to hang out. We have stayed in many Taj hotels in India, and we found this one to be a credit to their brand in terms of service and quality.",5,2017,07,16
121,Great hotel with lovely location. ,"Got to be one of finest hotels with great hospitality and best location, nice food and if you enroll for the Taj loyalty membership you get a 20% disc on food and beverage from the very first stay 
Must visit if you are looking to be in central London ",5,2017,07,16
121,Nice facade/back of house needs work,"4 night stay. Early flight from Australia had us arrive at 10am. Despite being promised a priority check in we actually didn't get our room until 1 hr after 'official' check in. The room was clean & quiet. The Bed was comfortable. Shower pressure reflected 200 yo plumbing. 
Breakfast was nice. 
Despite being assured our request for an early in-room breakfast on our final morning would be 'no problem' it was 30mins late & left us 10 mins to eat & check out. 
Great location, close to all the major attractions. Some attention needs to be to back of house. ",3,2017,07,16
121,Nice size rooms but staff needs work,"Our travel agent booked us here for about ten days during the time that we came to London mostly for Wimbledon. We do other sight seeing as well. This is a very good location for typical London sightseeing. Super close to Buckingham Palace, St James Park and a tube that will get you just about anywhere to wish to go.

The the rooms here are quite a good size for the price. The rooms seem mostly renovated with updated amenities. Our son did have a problem with his TV in his room. Unfortunately the staff was extremely unhelpful with the issue. He called down to tell them he couldn't get the TV to stop beeping. They told him to push the ""ok"" button which he had already tried. He tried again still no luck. They told him three times to push the same button and insisted that would work. It was very late and he needed to be up early. He got off the phone with them and finally found a way pull all the plugs on the TV and got the noise to cease. He immediately fell asleep only to be awoken by the phone with someone telling him they had researched the issue and all he needed to do was push the ""okay"" button. He was livid. I don't blame him.

Over the course of our stay between all of us we stayed in five different rooms. None of them had a working towel warmer. Not really a problem but if you are going to install them they should work.

We did really appreciate that when we arrived very early in the morning from our overnight international flight that they did provide us a room to grab and nap and freshen up while we waited for our booked room to become ready.

The elevators need some reprogramming. They are slow and don't work efficiently.

The breakfast is a pretty typical British buffet selection. It is great that they do allow you to order some fresh eggs from the kitchen. We did take advantage of this and had some good luck and some bad. I would say that the food was inconsistent with regards to quality of preparation. 

The biggest issue by far though was with the concierge. We were given poor or simply wrong information. The biggest flub was when we were told that the Globe theater didn't have an afternoon show and that they would be open for tours all day. Turns out that during the summer months they always have two shows a day so no afternoon tours. We wasted a bunch of time going over there, as a result we ended up having to cross some sights off our list because we had to come back in the morning on another day.  We some other staff issues as well, miss directed box breakfasts and inattentive wait staff.",3,2017,07,15
121,Pathetic Management,"Single word is terrible experience from day of checkin till checkout. Hard earn money wasted. No value to the guest request made initially for stay, more focused on commercial rather than guest comfort & requirements.",2,2017,07,14
121,Responsive Staff,"An older facility with well appointed rooms with all the required amenities. There is much construction under way in areas outside and around this hotel; our original room was near an active site. We asked for a room change as we planned to stay for four nights --none available that evening but the following day we were relocated to another room overlooking an internal courtyard. Staff were responsive and arranged for our belongings to be moved to the new room. Breakfast was included and the range of food available was excellent, as were the omelets which could be made to order! A very pleasant stay in a hotel that is super convenient for visiting on foot the many important sites of central London.",4,2017,07,13
121,Awesome London Stay,Room was large. AC worked very well. Food at hotel was excellent. Location was superb for easy access to anywhere we wanted to go.  Service was incredible.  Best vacation I've had in years!  I would highly recommend anyone staying in London to try and book this hotel.,5,2017,07,13
121,Disheartened  and definitely not Taj standards !,"Being a patriotic Indian and Parsi and designing a Taj hotel myself , I have always been a die hard fan of the Taj . Recently in February we celebrated our anniversary at the Lake place in Udaipur and were left speechless with the service and experience . Hence being our first holiday to London the but obvious choice was the Taj . We booked the classic studio room which is a larger room and in category of a suite .  Our duration of stay was  9 Days ! The checkin was warm and we were allotted our room . The room being outdated and belonged to the 1980's ! With very poor amenities and the bathroom and switches totally outdated . The housekeeping was average on some days and some days good and once the room was cleaned at 3 pm after repeated requests ! The house keeping staff was warm but had no clue on how to organise the room . The breakfast spread for a 5 star is the smallest and reminded me of staying in an IBIS budget hotel ! minimal spread I can understand being an old hotel and less space but even at the lake palace was the same issue but they would give an extra menu for us to order from . The breakfast spread was the same everyday and in unappealing. From 4 th day onwards we stopped having breakfast at the hotel and once we ordered waffles for my son thinking it would be part of the spread  they turned around and said it's chargeable! Eventually paid for it as it was for my son ... but shouldn't hotels of such stature and rating have this part of the spread ?  Today on the day of checkout I requested them for a late checkout at 5 pm so that my son and wife could change and use the washroom before heading to the airport as in the morning we were going out and having lunch outside . The lady at the front desk checked the system and I was sure the room was not booked and hence she went to the supervisor to request him to release the room. She came back saying no that we are fully booked is what the supervisor says ! What a stupid way to say no ! I forgot to mention that our bags didn't arrive on the first day and on the second day when they were to be delivered I went to the concierge to check whether I needed to leave the airlines baggage tag with him incase the bags came . He thought I was asking him to follow up with the airlines and rudely said it's not my job ! I said I don't want you to call anyone just send the bags to the room and do you need the tags he turns around and says "" I hope your names are there on the bags "" I just had a sarcastic  smile and walked away before I lost my temper.  Disheartened being a fellow Indian and a big believer of the Taj brand that I had write this way .

121,London hotel,"Awesome facilities and location, great people.  All of the staff was friendly and helpful.  We could walk to lots of cool places.  At our departure we forgot a piece of luggage, the staff delivered it to us at the train station with a smile just in time for us to get on the train.",5,2017,07,12
121,Perfect hotel,"My sister and I stayed here for one night whilst we went to the Adele concert at Wembley.
Check in was very simple and friendly. Only slight issue was we were given a room that couldn't be split to a twin but we were very quickly moved.
Gym was great everything you need from cardio to weights.
Great location for central London.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,07,12
121,Elegant,"Central botel, with beautiful courtyard, fantastic restaurants & for me the best part was the staff. In a large city centre hotel they all took the time to greet you & enter into a little conversation, important when your travelling alone. Spacious, clean & comfortable room, a little tired but everything you needed. Only temporary issue was building work to the rear outside.",5,2017,07,12
121,"St. James Court Hotel, London","An average dated hotel at a steep price. The staff is excellent and very helpful., aside from that there is really nothing special to recommend about the Hotel, Very average and no value for money. The hotel is old and showing it's age, needs an extensive overhaul.",3,2017,07,11
121,"Location, location, locataion!","The St. James Court, A Taj Hotel is extremely well located, at Buckingham Gate, a few blocks away from Buckingham Palace and walking distance to Victoria Street, Westminster Abbey, hyde Park, Mayfair and Picadilly Street.  Service was perfect! The concierge was very knowledgeable throughout our stay. Check-in and check-out were efficient and seamless. Breakfast was included in our rate and offered excellent variety of cold cuts, cheese, bread, eggs, fruits and cereals, as well as an Indian breakfast for the more adventurous travellers. The rooms were traditionally appointed; the bed was comfortable; nice shower and bathroom amenities. This hotel is a sensible choice considering the cost/benefit and it's location. It also has an amazing Indian restaurant in the premises.",4,2017,07,11
121,excellent location,"am an indian so that's why i used it once. and the experience was really good. feel at home and services was really good.

in the breakfast they offeres some indian dishes like paratha, paav bhaji or chole bhature.
in london you can not find anykind of indian variety in london. i have seeen first hotel offers because its TATA.

wifi service was really poor very slow speed. that was really very bad experience",5,2017,07,11
121,Taj St James Court Should Be Considered with Care Only,"Our hotel experience was poor and I would not recommend this hotel.  The location and stunning architecture of the Taj St James Court, plus the reputation of the Taj hotels, attracted my daughter and I (both women --- ages 30 and 67) to reserve a room with twin or, less desirable, a queen sized bed for two adults for five nights.  We were given a double bed room, complained, and next were taken to a room with a queen bed but a heavy mildew odor.  Both rooms were in outdated It was a bad enough smell that I was concerned about our ability to even wear our clothing for the wedding we were attending, not to mention any health or hotel standard concerns.  Housekeeping managed to bring the odor down to a tolerable, although not zero, level of unpleasantness.  The part of the floor where we were (Room 559) was in need of an upgrade, with floors in the hallways uneven and very basic baths.  Breakfast was fine with a short wait for tables. The spa services we purchased were expensive but well done, however, the facility was badly in need of an update.  Overall, I could not recommend the hotel.  I don't know if our poor room related to the fact that we were two women, not frequent Taj travelers, or any other reason, but buying an expensive hotel room and then negotiating with staff to get something that we could live with and then settling for a rather malodorous room, well, not my idea of a good hotel experience. We had high hopes and I'm sorry to turn in a poor review---the location and exterior architecture were fine. (By contrast, we had a terrific hotel experience at the Relais St Germain in Paris! I will be filing that review soon).",2,2017,07,10
121,Perfect Hotel Stay London,"Excellent service, Perfect location, Good room size. We loved the Breakfast! Right on Buckingham street.... Excellent concierge service. From the bellman to the hotel maids, everything was perfect! Will stay in this hotel again.",5,2017,07,10
121,Excellent Service,"The staff were extremely helpful and responsive. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a good size, very clean, and updated. The hotel is not necessarily geared toward family stays; however, it is so close to all the events and activities in London, that did not matter to us. We would stay there again.",5,2017,07,10
121,excellent service and location,"this hotel is in a fabulous location for visiting the major sights of London and for its transport links. The staff are very helpful,professional and attentive. We stayed in a standard room which looked over the court yard which was very quiet at night so we slept very well, however the bed was quite small and i found the bathroom tired and in need of a bit of attention. Breakfast was very enjoyable. A great hotel to choose to be in walking distance of lots of sights.",4,2017,07,09
121,"Good Location, Some Quesiton Marks","My wife and I as well as our niece booked 2  ""executive double rooms” for 5 nights at the Taj St. James Court, paying an average of $308 per room per night, including breakfast.    The positives at the hotel start with the great location, less than 10 minutes’ walk from Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace, and approximately 5 minutes’ walk to either Victoria or St. James Place Underground stations.  The hotel staff are unfailingly kind and polite.  Food at breakfast and in the bar was of good quality.  Rooms were comfortable and very quiet – we heard no street noise whatsoever and only rarely heard voices in the hallway.  Linens and bath products were of good quality.  The negatives are start with the smallish rooms – not truly European-tiny, but still smallish.   There was room to walk around the bed and a small desk in the room, but nothing more.  Another negative was breakfast at the Bistro restaurant, which was crowded and chaotic.  There was often a wait to be seated.  The additional breakfast seating in the bar area indicates that the hotel realizes breakfast is challenging, but this still isn’t a great solution.  The additional offer to have breakfast sent up to my room at no additional charge would only be OK if there were enough space in my room to sit and enjoy it.  Additionally, the Indian-themed breakfast options weren’t of interest to me (although, in fairness, there were adequate Western options and I of course recognize that Taj is an Indian hotel chain).  The fitness center was OK (treadmills, rowers, bikes, plus some machine weights and dumbbells) but small, with no room for ab exercises/core work/stretching.  Finally, I would note that the front desk was somewhat inefficient - check-in required 10 minutes at the desk, and a simple question about my bill upon check-out required a similar wait.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Taj and found the service and location to be strong positives.  We would stay again (mostly because of the location), but would probably not do breakfast at the hotel and might opt for a larger room.",3,2017,07,09
121,Home away from home,"An old world charm meets contemporary amenities in this very centrally located hotel. A stones throw away from the houses of parliament &  Buckingham palace, it sits on a relatively quite road with access to excellent restaurants on Victoria and Vauxhall Street.",5,2017,07,09
121,Close to Buckinham Palace,"Great location, larger than standard room, great service - walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, shops. Overall a fantastic place to stay. Hire bikes directly across the road, cinema around the corner.",5,2017,07,09
121,1 of the worst executive room in London Taj Saint James ex- Crowne Plaza,"As a Taj Member, we were expecting a good executive room when we booked this hotel months before we visited. We knew this hotel before as the Crowne plaza subsequently sold to Taj. We were impressed by the facade. And once again we expected too much based on this. The first room we had had no natural light, sheets had tiny holes, furniture was a three star like hotel, just two windows on fake polluted grass inside the courtyard on the second floor and that is all we could see. We complained. They gave us another one, a king size, so they said, just two beds close together. No fake polluted grass this time, but not much natural light, as for the bathroom, I did not have one that small since my twenty's. Breakfast now: it was my partner's birthday, we thought we would order eggs Benedict, they came back 1/2 hour later with two boiled eggs on top of a chewy piece of bacon topped up with overcooked hollandaise sauce. We rejected them. They apologized. The chef apparently can cook for 200 rooms but not eggs Benedict for two persons. Scrambled eggs were quite watery, I stop now and I informed the front desk: no more will we stay you. As for the Taj membership, it went to the trash the minute we arrived back home in Zurich. The cost of this hotel was 760 pounds for breakfast, 2 nights, and a lunch for 2.",1,2017,07,08
121,Was disappointed,"My sister and I stayed at the Taj Hotel in June. Our room was shabby. There was a bench with a big rip in it. The furniture was scratched. If you take a shower in the bathroom, the whole bathroom gets wet because of the awkward design. Many of the desk staff were rude. The doorman and one desk person was very nice. The breakfast that was included was very good, though with varying levels of service. We did eat at the bar restaurant which was good. You cannot beat the location though.
For the same money, I would recommend staying at the Conrad which is just around the corner.",2,2017,07,07
121,A beautiful stay in London,"A very pleasant atmosphere, efficient and smiling personnel, good location, beautiful and comfortable rooms that are very clean and of perfect size even for a long stay. Lovely bar on the ground floor where it's possible to listen to the music played by a talented piano player. Great experience, strongly recommended.",5,2017,07,07
121,Hotel Saint James Court,"The hotel was wonderful and the staff was very good. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.  The restaurants were excellent and the prices were good for hotel restaurants.  The location is great, walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.   The Saint James Park tube station was within a block which allows you access to the whole city.   Three great pubs within a block of the hotel. A Starbucks right next to the tube station and a Pratt Manger right across the street.  We didn't have the breakfast included in the rooms so we ate at the Pratt Manger and it was great.",5,2017,07,07
121,"Great experience, the true Taj way","St James Court, London lives up to the Taj hospitality. Great experience all the way. The people were friendly. they even cooked some Indian food not part of the menu to accommodate some of the vegetarians.",5,2017,07,07
121,Truly in the centre of the city!!,"Manned ny friendly people the concierge even knows where you can change the out of circulation notes and how!
You can walk to Victoria coach station,tremonus and St James court station is less than  2 mins by walk,Buckingham Place,St James Court garden are literally a stone's throw away!
Indian food is available at Quilon which is attached more or less
The beds are small and not very comfortable though",4,2017,07,06
121,Nice hotel in a quiet part of London,"We've stayed in many London hotels over the years and thought this one looked great after seeing it online and reading the reviews.  Overall, we had a great stay.  The location is in a quiet neighborhood, around the corner from the Ministry of Justice and the St. James Park tube station.  Our room, while not nearly as large as the one pictured on the website, was still nice and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  The construction noise out our window was unfortunate, especially early on a Saturday morning, but this is not the hotel's fault.  Our a/c wasn't on one day when we returned from sightseeing, and we couldn't figure out how to get it working-a repairman was up to see us in less than 15 minutes, got it working and cleaned out our filters-very nice!  
We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel-the queue line was always very long and there are many other options close by.  The courtyard is lovely and there are many food and drink options in the hotel.  Recommend Quilon next door for Indian food-very good.
Concierge, front desk and bar staff always friendly and helpful.  Can't really find much fault in this lovely old London hotel-we will definitely stay there again!",4,2017,07,06
121,room ok but getting to it a maze,Room ok but too expensive for what you get.  Breakfast NOT included. Good location. Getting to our room was like going through a maze. Bathroom sink had too little pressure. Clean room good firm bed good security.,3,2017,07,06
121,Nice and handy,"Had a couple of nights here first night was booked only a few days before so the cost was higher as it was a better room? so said about the second night and oh yes we can pop you in a room where you can stay both nights... yes the cheaper room id say and thanks still changed at the higher cost. i take it someone got an upgrade at my expense, still all very helpful and nice service had a great meal at the bistro.
room was a little dated and couldn't sleep well in the bed but the Location is spot on",4,2017,07,05
121,go for the location,"My stay at the St. James Court was part of a group tour (small, 18 people) but a friend and I decided to come to London 2 days ahead of the tour.  The staff made our two stays seamless without having to change rooms.  The location is a short walk to Buckingham Palace in case you have an audience.  The immediate area is rife with coffee shops and a couple pubs.  Another short walk is the St. James tube stop, yellow line, easy to get almost anywhere.
The hotel was built in Victorian times for overflow royal guests so it is not modern.  The room I stayed in was neat and clean, but could use more electrical outlets.  The bad news, it was on the inner courtyard side without a view; the good news, it was quieter than a country inn.  
My favorite part, the breakfast.  Superb.  Order any eggs but the buffet included a smoked fish, fresh cheeses, salad, fruits, buffet eggs and Indian dishes, and more.",5,2017,07,04
121,So dissapointing,"We booked this hotel as part of an anniversary weekend expecting something special. What a disappointment, the on suite in our first room was dirty and the toilet was faulty. After broken promises regarding attending to these issues we were given an alternative room, however by the time this was arranged we had missed the opening times of events we had arranged and could not rebook them for the following day. Did not even receive an apology! Will definitely not be returning!",2,2017,07,04
121,Back Again,"My home from home in London for both leisure and business,  Calm pleasant environment with efficient, friendly staff.  A variety of places to eat and excellent choices in each of them.  Don't miss Quilon!",5,2017,07,04
121,Disappointing !!,"The rooms were small and pokey though near and clean! The hotel was also not that attractive.
For someone who had stayed off Oxford Street, the area was also disappointing for a tourist . Apart from the Buckingham Palace which is located at a very close distance, the area is fairly boring .
I expected much more from the Taj group and was fairly disappointed by my stay!",3,2017,07,03
121,Spa day and lunch,"Excellent Spa day and lunch for five ladies. With a champagne cocktail In The library.
Wonderful day with very attentive staff. It was a special occasion for my retirement. Thanks for a memorable day.",5,2017,07,03
121,Birthday weekend,"I wrote a review regarding this hotel with regards to the condition of the room we were allocated which in my opinion was below expectations by a very very long way. I also at the same time emailed the hotel direct, upon receiving the email the hotel couldn't do enough for us we were immediately allocated a new room which was stunning, the  assistant front office manager Sunaina Soares was exceptional in handling the situation and couldn't do enough for us. When and if we travel to London again we will certainly give this hotel another chance, as I'm sure it will then exceed our expectations.",4,2017,07,03
121,Fantastic hotel and perfect location!,"We absolutely loved staying at this hotel. The staff is amazing, the rooms are wonderful and you cannot beat the location. We thoroughly enjoyed having afternoon tea in the restaurant, the buffet breakfast was very good and the overall experience was exactly what we had hoped for.",5,2017,07,03
121,Great personal hotel in heart of London,"Very good hotel in the centre of London...great décor, homely sort of place...just a stone's throw away from Buckingham Palace, St James' Palace, Green Park, Piccadilly Circus, and Soho. Only regret is no pool. Excellent service.",4,2017,07,03
121,Great stay at excellent hotel,Our overerall experience was 10/10 and the serrvice level could not be faulted. The staff could not do enough for us. The location is right next to the St James underground which was very convenient. There are plenty of good restaurants in the vicinity however the hotel has first class dining options. We will certainly be staying at this hotel again.,5,2017,07,02
121,All that glitters is not gold,"From first glance you could be fooled into thinking this is a place of luxury & high service alas it is not in my experience. 
I arrived on the day of check in @ 4pm only to be kept waiting for 15 mins for the to be available. Now considering check inn was possible from 2pm I find this extremely poor. 2 complimentary drinks were issued but frankly after a long journey all anyone wants to do is put down their luggage & relax for a while. 
The room was of a reasonable size & well kept.
But then the next morning we were woken at 7am by a staff member knocking at our door only to find he'd gotten the wrong room for luggage collection. So by now extremely unimpressed at the hotel in general. I did raise the issues upon checking out that morning we received an apology & then followed by the bill payable in full. Certainly not the way I'd hoped the matter would be addressed but then I guess as long as they got the money that seemed to matter the most. ",2,2017,07,02
121,The best place to stay in London for business or tourism,"The Taj St. James Court Hotel has everything:  1. The finest business centre overlooking a garden/courtyard. The best for Board Meetings, or otherwise. 2. All major tourist venues (covered by 100% tourists to London) are within walking distance from the hotel. 3. The best located hotel, has wonderful rooms, and wonderful staff. They never tire of helping you out!",5,2017,07,01
121,Elegant Experience,We were very impressed at the Taj Hotel in London.  The service was great and everyone was very nice.  The food and the breakfast was just OK.  They served a lot of Indian food which I sure was great but I was not very fond of.,5,2017,06,30
121,Great location,"Wanted to do a stop over in London for 2 nights before going on to Europe. St James Court Hotel near to traditional spots that we always do a quick visit, Queens Gallery, Queens walk beside Green Park, Ideally located.",4,2017,06,28
121,Not Taj Level,We had to change our room because of bathroom flush did not work. You are spoiling the name of Taj. Really bad experience. Even though our room was changed but the standard was very low and employees did not seem to care about the experience. It was a busy time of the year but service level should be maintained.,1,2017,06,28
121,Pleasant stay and close to a number of attractions,"A central hotel with a number of amenities and very helpful staff. Stayed for two nights over the weekend and it was a signature Taj experience - warm, personal and pleasant. Nice to see wifi included in the room rent. Lots of little things (water, chocolates, bathroom kits) make staying here quite nice unlike many London hotels.",4,2017,06,27
121,Great experience,"Overall a wonderful experience... right from the comfort in the room to excellent breakfast...and food both Vegan and otherwise... would surely recommend for the travelers as well considering the proximity to the Buckingham palace and Big Ben... you shall be closest to the tube station, bus station, or a taxi stand.... I will surely go back and stay at the same place with my family as well... they sure too will relist the experience I am sure...",5,2017,06,27
121,Pass on this one ,"This hotel is spotless and is beautifully decorated. Staff at tge check in desk were helpful and attentive, as were the concierge staff.  Disappointed with the room, especially the view and size. Tariff paid was £650 for 2 nights stay. This was for an executive double . For this price I would have expected something a touch special. The room size and comfort was on parr with a Premier Inn. The main thing letting this hotel down is breakfast. We queued with patience for 15 minutes before being seated. Other guests who complained and queried when would they be seated were told ....""when a table becomes available"" oh dear! Breakfast was self service. I had a choice from 2 hash browns, both dried up. The cheese board had just crumbs of cheese available.  The orange juice was warm. Our table had not been prepared. We had one portion of butter between us and the jars of ketchup and jam had been used be the previous guests. The poor staff were run off their feet, they showed signs of stress which made us feel uncomfortable and rushed. At one point there was a confrontation between a female member of the management team and a waiter. Cringe worthy viewing which should have been dealt with behind closed doors. We were quite disturbed by this and made a quick exit. We plan travelling to London again shortly but will pass on this hotel. Unfortunately, weighing up pros and cons I'm sorry to say I wouldnt be able to recommend this hotel.",3,2017,06,26
121,Excellent location and stay,I picked this hotel primarily for it's location. The hotel is centrally located to all the tourist destinations in London. There is a tube station few minutes walk from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is also nearby. Rooms are well appointed and I think it's value for money considering the size of the room and services included.,5,2017,06,26
121,Best stay ever ,"I've been to the Taj properties in India, but this was my first stay in london at a Taj property and I was mesmerized. The property is centrally located with welcoming, cosy yet avante garde ambience. The fountain in the courtyard retains its English identity topped with an Indian touch of the courtyard in the heart of the hotel. You'd think it ends there, but the staff and the food (only had the privilege of having breakfast there) is just the thing that steals the show. I was discussing with someone that whether the staff is especially trained to be this welcoming. Regardless, albeit the entire staff from the reception to Bistro (where the breakfast was served) and everyone else (because they all greet you with a smile and good morning/afternoon/evening) , I'd like to make a special mention relating to Mr. Binoy Nair (concierge). I did not have to plan my trip, worry about getting lost in the tube/bus and make reservations to swanky restaurants tailor made to my needs at the last minute. He has rightly won the concierge of the year.

Kudos st. James court. I'm definitely coming back soon. And thank you Mr. TATA and gang for the having the Indian National flag flutter in the heart of London city. ",5,2017,06,26
121,Unique Dinner Experience,"Rooms lovely and clean. Staff very polite and cheerful. Decided to try the ""Around The World In 80 Tastes"", a very unique dinner experience where you start your adventure in the bar with a flight of champagnes with canapés to match. You are then escorted to a different restaurant for each course which has a wine to match. This was a lovely way to try lots of dishes and styles that we may not have tried before.",5,2017,06,25
121,Poor value for money,During a recent hot spell the air conditioning wasn't functioning properly and when reported to staff it was never followed up and fixed. The bedroom was also extremely small and apparently that was an executive double room. Overall poor value for money,3,2017,06,25
121,Disappointing,"As somebody who has stayed in many a Taj hotel, this particular visit lacked ambience and the usual attention to detail I have come to expect. I was particularly surprised at the lack luster response to queries at the reception desk and lack of information provided at check in. This is not simply a pernickety review and I have years of experience in the hotel industry to justify such a response. Overall, I left feeling rather bereft.",2,2017,06,25
121,Great Location!!,"We spent four nights here as part of leisure trip to London:

Pros-

1.  Great location, close to St James Park Tube.  Walking distance to many of the great sites.  We walked pretty much everywhere from the hotel.

2.  Great staff, very welcoming, and quick service, a couple of times we asked for extra towels and water, the staff provided these within 10 minutes.

3.  Room was big by London standards, modern, very very clean.

4.  Minor point, but very important in my view, bottled water is complementary in nice glass bottles. 

5.  Breakfast buffet was great, many options hot and cold, custom egg preparation as well as lattes, espresso. 

Cons

1.  Bathroom - he bathroom seems out of place in terms of design from the rest of the room which is modern, bathroom is an older design with gold plating.  

2. Our room location was not good, all the way at the corner, quite a walk from the elevators and a pain since you are walking all over London the whole day, also the room was next to the bar, a lot of noise late in the night, disturbing sleep.  We thought about asking for a different room, but we did not want to repack move, and we were not spending that much time in the room.

I would recommend this hotel because of the location, great staff, size of room, and cleanliness, however ask for a room closer to elevator and away from the bar.  ",4,2017,06,24
121,Amazing experience,"The St James court, a Taj Hotel is truly an exceptional hotel. Right from the welcome to everything and anything is special. Sunaina Soares and Gagan Sharma and others in  guest relation team to Binoy , Conny , Grego and others at the Concierge . The gourmet delights under the chefs and the F & B led ably by Sid Oberoi are truly exceptional. Kudos to Mr Digvijay Singh and the entire team for making this an exceptionally memorable experience. Everyone visiting London has to make this their preferred place to stay!! We will certainly back again!!",5,2017,06,24
121,Cheers to The Taj!,"Our first trip to London and we could not have selected a better hotel for our stay. The service, suite and food were outstanding. We highly recommend this beautiful hotel if you want to be close to many of London's attractions. Also there is a quaint Italian bistro just across the street.",5,2017,06,23
121,Nice hotel,St. James Court is a very nice and accommodating hotel.  An easy walk to Westminster and Palace areas.  Staff is very accommodating and friendly.  We needed to store some luggage the day prior to check in as we were heading to Bath and Stonehenge for a night and they were very helpful.,4,2017,06,23
121,Tale of Two Cities,"Note, the hotel has updated rooms and those that aren't.   Our initial room assignment was unacceptable and we complained and paid for an upgrade to make sure we weren't on the lower floors.   Be aware, the hotel sits on top of the Circle/District line of the underground and you'll hear it the lower you are.   We upgraded to an executive King on the fifth floor which eliminated that issue.   The hotel staff were very helpful and the stay was good, but the hotel is a bit worn down from what I'd expect.",4,2017,06,22
121,Fantastic location near Buckingham Palace,"Family of 4 stayed in 2 rooms with first stop in London over an extended european vacation.   This was one of our favorites.  It was extremely close to Buckingham Palace in a quiet section of London.  Great pub a block over and near shopping and dining that is off the main areas of downtown.  And easy walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Parliament and across the bridge to The Eye.  Hotel was first class, breakfast in the morning was in a beautiful room with buffet items.  There are a few traditional american breakfast items (bacon and waffles - eggs are european scrambled, which tend to be a little runny).",5,2017,06,22

121,Excellent Hotel in central location,"Hotel in central location, at walking distance from London's main attraction. The service at our arrival was a bit slow, and our room was not ready despite it was 05.00 p.m. We however had an upgraded room that was wonderrful. The hotel is very clean Breakfast was very rich (not much sweets, however)",5,2017,06,22
121,"Nice hotel, terrible queue for breakfast","I stay at this hotel when working in London as it's location is convenient for my office. The price is astronomical at over £200 per night however it is London and other hotels are similar. The hotel is well equipped and the layout of the rooms works well considering the building is old and therefore you might expect compromised. There is a spa and gym. All rooms I've stayed in have ironing board, hairdryer, tv, tea and coffee facilities etc. Beds are huge and very comfy. 

Staff are friendly and patient despite the way they are spoken to by some guests.

Breakfast is difficult to get in to. The queue is long and you can wait 15 minutes to be seated at a table. Their dining room is too small in my opinion and they should utilise other restaurant areas on site to ease congestion.

It needs to do better here if it's to retain its status and continue to command the premium price.

121,Great experience in a very nice hotel,"The hotel is impressive, especially the moment you enter the lobby with its Indian style decoration. What is more important is the perfect behaviour of the personnel, starting from the people who help you to get out of your taxi, into the hotel and the people at the reception. You feel really welcome, in a warm atmosphere. The hotel is clean, comfortable, has a magnificent interior garden and very nice restaurants. The downside is the rather old look of the room with furniture, walls and especially windows that need some maintenance and modernisation. I am not sure about the heating in winter, in summer the air-con was more than enough, we actually had to shut it off since it became too cold in the room.",5,2017,06,20
121,A Great Hotel in Central London,"St James Court is an ideal Hotel for stay being conveniently situated near Bukingham Palace and other sightseeing places. The rooms are well lighted, spacious and well furnished unlike the small rooms in other London hotels. The foods is superb and so is the service. I cannot think of staying anywhere else in London. If you have a sleep problem ask for a room away from the school which can be very noisy in the morning.",5,2017,06,20
121,Great value for the money,"Excellent location, clean and elegant hotel.  Room was comfortably sized and the air conditioning worked well during a London heat wave.  Nice gym facility.   Location is perfect for city activities - walking distance to many popular attractions and cultural activities.",5,2017,06,20
121,We spent our 25th anniversary here and loved it!,"Great hotel, great location, great service, friendly and polite staff! Everything from the check-in to check-out and in between was smooth and easy. We would stay here again. Location is close to the Tube and nearby attractions but the neighborhood didn't feel like a tourist trap.",5,2017,06,20
121,nice hotel,"Hotel is in the best location. Literally a five minute walk from the palace, 15 minute walk to Westminster Abbey, fantastic! The hotel is kind of old, but it has been kept up nicely. My room window was near a school I think so I could hear kids screaming occasionally. Room service breakfast was delicious and on time every morning. I would stay here again.",4,2017,06,19
121,Great location - lovely relaxing stay,"Very enjoyable stay at this hotel. It has a lovely homely relaxing feel, service is excellent. They also have a very nice court yard/restaurant outside. Very good location, lots of cafes and shops nearby, tube is only a few minutes walk. Would definitely recommend...would stay again definitely.",5,2017,06,18
121,My daughters 7th birthday,Fantastic we had a great time! Highly recommend down the rabbit hole afternoon tea! Foot was amazing so much and we got to bring some home! Don't be fooled we thought more sandwiches should be added but once the cakes come u will certainly be satisfied 😜,5,2017,06,17
121,Avoid,"This is really not value for money and dont get carried away with Taj brand for this location, as this was my first bad experience with Taj . The rooms are very small as compared, the hotel is very quiet and the passage areas at all floors are quite uneven. Better to avoid this property",1,2017,06,17
121,Taj quality as expected,"Good hotel with service you expect from Taj. Nice clean room, very quiet and a lovely courtyard to eat and drink in on a warm summers evening.

Would have given 5 stars but the hamper in the room is massively overpriced, e.g. £2.50 for a packet of crisps. That's just greedy Taj..

",4,2017,06,17
121,Avoidable Hotel,"We were on our annual vacation to London and we booked here due to its Location and being a Taj Innercircle member we never thought twice to book five nights at the iconic St James Court. The experience of the stay was shocking to say the least. The checkin process  was smooth and service at check in and restaurant were good. However the lobby is very crowded and hotel has a lot of footfall in May. The Rooms are small and not at all worth the room rentals. The Bathroom plumbing is old and not UpTo mark. The rooms were one of the worst rooms of Taj I have ever stayed. The concierge desk experienced was awful. We encountered one concierge desk executive, Binoy was very arrogant and I have never experienced a service executive like him. In case you come across him during ur stay there, better avoid him and deal with others. Overall this stay was one of our worst experience. To top all of this Taj Innercircle has informed me that I will not be eligible for any credits for stay as the booking was done through a third party. I would highly recommend avoiding this hotel...It's not worth it...",1,2017,06,17
121,Service at its best!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at this splendid hotel.
We had experienced Taj hospitality a few years ago in India, and my wife was keen to sample Taj London.
Doorman/Concierge Diego is an absolute gentleman and couldn't be more helpful.
Sylvia in the courtyard an extremely pleasant and obliging waitress.
Check in staff friendly and courteous.
Room on 1st floor clean and ready.
Great service. We will return!

121,Very good Heritage Property in Central London,"It is a very nice heritage property almost next door to Bankigham Palace gate. Breakfast and Food was awesome and reasonably priced. Indian Food was very good and again reasonably priced.  Hotel rooms are good, staff were courteous and location was excellent.",4,2017,06,16
121,A Gem! ,"My husband and I recently stayed at St James Court for an unplanned night in London. 
The hotel is perfectly situated close to Buckingham Palace, soho district and West End. 
The service was exceptional, it was reasonably priced and the staff were very friendly and helpful. 
The rooms were quite large and very nice. 
We will definitely be staying there again on our next visit to London. 
",5,2017,06,15
121,Very nice,"This was a last minute booking, great location . Walking distance to soho etc or a 5 pound cab fair.rooms are a great size and the courtyard for a beer is very comfortable while your wife is getting her hair done at the hotel salon . Plenty of dinning options within a 2 minute walk . ",5,2017,06,15
121,Not what I expected,"Being a four star hotel, I had higher expectations. With the exception of one snitty desk clerk, staff has been wonderful. 
We reserved a King room, and requested two twin beds. We reiterated our request upon check in, and it was confirmed. We arrived in room several hours later (we were told it would take longer to clean the room because of the bed request), and there was only one bed. Our bags were not yet delivered. After waiting almost an hour and calling, situation was finally remedied. When the bags were delivered, we were told that there should be a rack for the luggage. None was in the room, so I called reception. She answered the phone, ""hello miss (my name), what is wrong now?"" Wow,I couldn't believe the sarcasm and rudeness with which she spoke.
The room is very clean. My pillow is very flat, had a stiff neck from it this morning. Bathroom is unbelievably tiny. You can barely get out of the shower without banging into the toilet or sink. There isn't even a soap dish. Unlike the advertising for the room we reserved, there was not a dresser, or chair and side table in the room. Only a very worn desk and an old bench with a rip in it. The very tiny tv is so far from the bed that it can barely be seen.
Perhaps we were given this room because we are two females? Idk?
Breakfast is good.
For the same money and similar location, definitely stay at the Conrad! 
Please see pics ...",3,2017,06,15
121,"Nice hotel located near ""everything""","I enjoyed the stay at this hotel which is within walking distance of Big Ben and other sights. The breakfast was very good and the staff very polite and nice.  The bed was very good with many soft pillows. Slept like a ""baby"". Big bathroom with a bathtub. Good shampoo and conditioner.  I am very pleased with the stay and would choose the hotel again",4,2017,06,14
121,The Lovely Sojourn,"This homely, lovely place is an ideal place to be in London. Located next to the Palace, all desirable wonders are located at walking distance. Ambiance, decor, heritage looks, food--everything is excellent.",5,2017,06,14
121,In midst of shopping paradise!,"Very conveniently located, nearest tube - St. James Park and Victoria Station. All the best brands located nearby at Victoria Street! Very helpful staff! Breakfast spread is very good. The ambience at the evening sit out area makes one forget that you are in right middle of the city!",4,2017,06,14
121,Good hotel and services in top location Westminster!,"The biggest assets of this hotel are the location, the service and the wonderful courtyard. Upon arrival our room was not yet ready but it was arranged well and we received a free drink as a token of compensation.
Room: The room is decent, but don't expect grand luxury. Everything is clean but a bit outdated, so it could use some refurbushing. We had better 4-star locations but it was okay.
Breakfast: We did not take breakfast in the hotel although it looked good. We preferred to go outside as we knew some breakfast spots nearby: The Wolseley, Inn the park in St James etc. Many options don't worry. 
Dinner: We had a really great dinner at Kona restaurant on the groundfloor of the hotel. A la carte items were really taste, well brought, good flavours, accompagnied with a bottle of wine from the wide selection in the menu. A must do if you like to eat 
close to your room. The next day dinner plans brought us to The Cinnamon Club, which is Indian inspired cuisine 15-minutes away by foot. The taste and cuisine there was really stunning, highly recommended if you like Asian/Indian cuisine but brought in a Western European manner. It's also a romantic venue located in an old library, we loved it! 3rd day we went to the 32nd floor of Aqua The Shard for dinner: reserve upfront, and bring your wallet, but the food is good and the views are awesome. Take your partner there for dinner, and it will be a success, guarantee.
Back to the Hotel: It has many amenities, good staff, the courtyard, the bar, the doorkeeper... They all made us feel very welcome. Thanks everyone.
Location: Located in Westminster in walking distance from Big Ben en Westminster (10min), Buckingham Palace (6min). In between the metro stations of St James or Victoria. Both a 7 minute walk. Top location in London!",4,2017,06,13
121,PERFECT STAY IN THE BEAUTIFUL CITY,"The property is really amazing with good food. 3mins walk for Buckingham Palace. 2 metro stations are at just walking distance, one is Victoria 6mins which is one of the main station of London and St James Park 2mins. What else you want. If you really wanna walk little more you can reach, Carnaby Street(or Soho) & Oxford street in 18mins-25mins via beautiful Green Park.  The staff is extraordinary and very helpful. It seems they all are well trained as doing there job very well. Staff From the entrance until your room all will greet you so nicely that makes you very special. Bar is open until 1am and they were so kind to provide us some sandwiches & Pasta at last moment when they were just about to close but managed to keep us happy. 100 out of 100 to this Hotel.",5,2017,06,13
121,"lovely hotel, situated just before the Buckingham Palace","Lovely hotel, shares a pleasant courtyard with its sister hotel, 51 Buckingham Palace. clean and absolutely comfortable rooms. The Housekeeping staff are pleasant and keep the rooms clean. The doorman will surely help you out with taxis  right outside the hotel. Beautiful Lobby and great offerings at breakfast. I would surely recommend this hotel",5,2017,06,13
121,Central to everything,"My sister and I stayed at the St. James' Court over Memorial Day weekend. Because we had such a short trip, I looked at hotels that were central to the sites we wanted to see. We were not disappointed. The hotel is about a five-minute walk along Buckingham Gate to Buckingham Palace. A 10-minute walk down Petty France and you're staring at Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Houses if Parliament. From there its a short walk to the London Eye. It's longer, but its and easy walk to Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus and 10 Downing Street. We felt energetic and walked along the water to the Tower of London. But there are two underground stations located minutes from the hotel. 

We had breakfast at Crumpets, a very friendly restaurant across the street. We also had delicious fish and chips at the Albert a few blocks away. There are a number of restaurants on nearby Victoria Street.

Our room was comfortable combining both a modern and traditional English setting. And we had a lovely balcony that overlooked the courtyard.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They arranged our return cab to the airport that was cheaper than the black car that we took from the airport.",5,2017,06,12
121,Excellent Location with great amenities,All the major tourism and business attraction is closeby and connected with underground station.A lot of nice restaurants & bars are also in a near vicinity and better to say just a walk-away. Value for money.,5,2017,06,12
121,"good breakfast, many flies in the room on the first floor, nicer rooms on the 6th floor","In our booking of the King Classic Room a couple of months before our arrival, we asked for a high floor room.  When we checked in, the staff apologized and gave us a room in the 1st floor, but promised to try to change the room on the next day. In our first night we shared the room with more than 30 big flies (we actually tried to count them and this figure is not overestimated). We tried to get them out of the window, but had no success. We don't know where these flies came from, but it was probably not from outside :(    Overall this room was not what we hoped to get, and the floor to the rooms on the first floor doesn't look like the floor of a 4 star hotel but more like a 2 star hotel floor.  On the second day we could change the room and got a room on the 6th floor. This room was a lot better. No flies at all, and the room looked a lot more nice in total. The floor to the rooms was also nicer than on the first floor.  The check in after arrival was very slow (we had obviously the slowest queue and the check in procedure was longer than we are used from other hotels).  The breakfast was very good!! Great choice and good quality of the food, for the whole breakfast time! Most of the staff at breakfast was very kind and helpful and made us feeling welcome.   At night after coming back to the hotel, we had one drink at the bar. My wife's cocktail was ridiculously overprized. The taste was good, but after the first swallow it was already finished and in the following she just had the melted water of the ice cubes (because she didn't want to order the next 14,5 GBP drink plus service charge just one minute after she got the first drink). My beer was ok.  The check out procedure was very quick and very easy. So overall some things were good, some others were below our expectations. If we had a room on the 6th floor for the whole time of our stay, our overall view on our stay would probably be a lot better.",3,2017,06,12
121,Poor value for money,"Rooms are noisy (doors slamming in the corridor and persistent purr) Poor breakfast service  A lot of staff, but inefficient, more interested in getting tips than helping their guests. Very poor value for money",2,2017,06,12
121,"Steady, comfortable and good value","We stayed overnight as we wanted a centrally located hotel. This is a somewhat traditional environment. The staff were efficient and the room a decent size though the outlook was uninspiring. Bathroom a bit on the small side and shower could be better. However bistro restaurant was good with adequate menu and nice mixture of options. Breakfast average but staff very solicitous. Overall, a decent recommendation if you want a good 4 star accommodation. ",4,2017,06,11
121,Nice Lobby and Great Concierge,"The concierge Binoy is knowledgeable, professional and wonderful. The lobby was not large for the size of the hotel but always seemed lively and was attractive. The room we were given was subpar and for that reason I cannot recommend the hotel. I was later told that the first 4 floors have been renovated but not the other floors. We were on floor 5. While the staff was kind enough to offer to change our room, we had already unpacked and opted not to.",3,2017,06,11
121,Wonderful experience & beautiful hotel!,"My first trip to London was this past January and we stayed at St. James Court A Taj Hotel. We couldn't have been more pleased. Amazing customer service, delicious breakfasts to start the day, spacious comfortable room with large bathroom. And the location of the hotel was perfect for us - easy access to the tube stations and walking distance to so many great places and streets. ",5,2017,06,11
121,Taj Hospitality,The true indian hospitality shines through every staff member.  the hotel is bustling and no room is alike.  the food is outstanding and the warmth of every staff member is true Taj style. Loved working with the team there and the attention to detail was super.,5,2017,06,09
121,"Tired, faded. Hot rooms","Not a night to remember. The room was over hot , the AC ineffectual and noisy, the bed plastic and heat reflecting. 
A dribble of a shower. & then an inability to cancel the extras guarantee on your credit card for 4 days. 
There are simply better places to stay. ",2,2017,06,09
121,Best Hotel in London,"This Hotel us the cream of the crop. I can barely fault it...it was walking distance to the Palace and most other attractions. The tube was 2 minutes walk away. Firstly it's huge . There are 7 floors . My room was on the 7 th floor with views of the  beautiful courtyard. The room was large and very comfortable . It was fully air conditioned . The bed and the pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was a generous size , clean and well appointed. The towels were huge and the shower head was great. I forgot toothpaste and within 20 seconds of my call to housekeeping  it arrived with a toothbrush and dental floss..
The mini bar was well stocked and my room was cleaned daily. It was quiet and restful.
The foyer was huge and the concierge desk were available to organise taxis, private tours , restaurant reservations,  shows etc. Nothing was to much for them. I was given a baggage tag for my luggage and it was bought to my room 10 minutes after me.
There was an outdoor courtyard eatery, a cocktail and snack bar inside along with the breakfast bistro. There was a beautiful Indian restaurant adjoining the hotel but beware, this is very exspensive..
The only flaw I have with this magnificent hotel is ...CHECK YOUR BILL.
Your Invoice arrives under your door the morning you leave. I had my room added twice to my account and there was a dispute over it. It was rectified but not before the manager got involved. The other thing to mention is after 9.00 am there is a que for the breakfast bistro.. Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.
In all though this is a beautiful hotel and professionally run. It's not cheap but you are made to feel very special .",4,2017,06,08
121,Perfect Location,"We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the St. James Court. We were surprised by the spaciousness of the room, and the staff at the hotel made our experience even more enjoyable. The food was delicious, so much so that we ate in the restaurant two nights during our four night stay. The hotel is located in a great area, as it is walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament and the London Eye. Thanks for making our visit to London very special. We look forward to returning!",5,2017,06,08
121,Discreet. Intimate. Fabulous.,"This immaculate, comfortable hotel is in a different league to most in London. Rooms are spacious and attractive, and the position is away from the cacophony in the centre of the city, but close enough to Westminster to make you feel part of the action.
Breakfast is average and needs more imagination but the dining room is super and staff excellent.
I would always stay here, or at St Ermins their sister hotel just up the road.",5,2017,06,07
121,Taj experience in UK,First stay at a london hotel in many years and found the Taj to be excellent for a tourist visit. The hotel is perhaps geared to the older tourist in terms of decor but my wife and I enjoyed the stay as we do in all Taj properties,4,2017,06,07
121,Friendly and cosy,"Nice hotel with convenient location, friendly staff and delicious food. natural floral decorations everywhere create a special subtle ambiance. very professional organization of business events. Diversity is very well managed in everything: staff, languages, tastes, food, which ensures flexible responsiveness of the hotel Team to the guests requests.",5,2017,06,06
121,Wonderful Staff,"It is a beautiful and comfortable hotel. In addition, the staff helped me solve a few problems of my own making. They assisted me with such kindness and efficiency. They will never know how grateful I was.",5,2017,06,06
121,Super Stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights in Feb 17. 
Fantastic location right in centre of London walking distance to most attractions. Beautiful old hotel.
Rooms were lovely and comfy.
Would highly recommend. 
Great experience! ",5,2017,06,05
121,Good hotel in an excellent location,"Stayed two nights 2/6/2017 we had a king room which was clean and comfortable and plenty big enough for a couple. I could find idiosyncrasies with the  room and the hotel in general, But the staff were so friendly and obliging that I am not going to.

We have stayed at the the langham on previous visits to London and the taj is as good in my opinion and nearly half the price. Would I stay again? Yes definitely.",4,2017,06,05
121,Outstanding Hotel; Reasonable Cost,"Fantastic hotel.  Very well located in relation to Buckingham, etc.  Outstanding staff who couldn't do enough for you.  Service was outstanding from check-in to maid service to bar service to room service to dining!  I'd recommend to anyone traveling to London!",5,2017,06,05
121,A serene oasis in the heart of London!,Exceeded our expectations from the moment we checked in to the morning we drove away.  The location is perfect for walking to major attractions such as Buckingham Palace as well as two underground stations.  The staff is extremely courteous and helpful from the elegant doorman to every server in the restaurants.  The lobby and bar are beautiful gathering spots and the central garden was a tranquil haven after a long day of walking.  Our room was large and well equipped with a beautiful marble bathroom and luxurious bed.  We slept soundly as it was extremely quiet in spite of the central location.  We would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who desires a luxurious experience in the heart of London.,5,2017,06,05
121,London stay,"We found this hotel on Trip Advisor. Glad we did,  It is an excellent hotel, excellent in dealing with luggage, and responsive to requests. The reception area is very comfortable. Hotel is near bus stops.",5,2017,06,04
121,Experience at A TAJ Hotel,"Overall fair. Air conditioning in the room was faulty. Reported and action was promised to be taken but no action was taken until I had to report at the lobby. Even then, the hotel staff at the lobby was not particularly helpful until i insisted to see the Duty Manager. Air Conditioning was reportedly fixed but still ineffective throughout the night",3,2017,06,04
121,Disappointed and disgusted ,"Please dont ever stay here. Thinking of Taj brand I stayed here but was waste of money. Room furniture was broken had stains on curtains.Had flies in the room. Reached at 11 pm and left the room in the morning. Never thought Taj would have this. Kind of food and service. 
Sorry but don't ever stay here",1,2017,06,04
121,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel and great breakfasts.  All amenities in hotel were as expected  and staff were very helpful. Fantastic location, so close to Buckingham Palace, however the union flag was hung upside down out the front of the hotel.",4,2017,06,03
121,The best hotel in London,"We ( wife and a 6 year old child ) stayed in St James' Court in May 2017. This was a family holiday. Right from the check in to check out, this hotel lived up to the famed Indian and Taj reputation for hospitality. The pluses: Location ... about 7 mins away from The Buckingham Palace, this is as central as it gets. Great reception staff ( Sahana was the duty manager when I checked in) Huge rooms , comfortable beds , nice sofas. Spotlessly clean Big range at the breakfast buffet Excellent multi cultural serving staff Very knowledgeable concierge staff on what to see in the vicinity I could go on and on. This was not my first time at a Taj hotel. I would strongly recommend staying at this hotel without any worries.  Thanks Big bath rooms, high quality toiletries",5,2017,06,03
121,Perfect for London Vacation with kids,"We traveled to london for 7 days and stayed in this hotel in May ,2017 for 4 nights. Checkin was flawless and very smooth. When we entered our room we found it to be too small, but charming. Since we traveled with out 7 year old and there was not way that bed could fit in 3 of us, we decided to upgrade to a larger , better room with 50 pounds extra per night.  During this entire moving to shifting to a new room the front end rep was with us and we felt very welcoming. 
Now if you are from India or have tasted Indian hospitality in luxury 5* hotels you have very high expectations and it is amazing how the hotel staff met all our needs throughout the stay. 
The bar in lounge is perfect for quick drinks and spending some lazy afternoons. We did not find it expensive at all. Breakfast was included in our package and was wonderful with some good Indian flavors.
Location is perfect with about 5 mins walk to Buckingham palace and St. James park. It is mostly walkable to all tourist areas nearby like westminster, Big Ben and London eye.
Will love to stay here when I am in London next time.",5,2017,06,03
121,Excellent ,Very good location. Accessible to the tube. Walking distance for regular shopping too.  Excellent service. Beautiful building. Food: They have a lot of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options starting from breakfast to dinner. ,5,2017,06,02
121,Not what I would expect for 5 Star,"The staff were lovely, the location excellent- but the room small and disappointing with a view into a noisy courtyard and the breakfast service shambolic- I don't expect to have to queue to get in to the dining room, then have to queue to serve myself from a hot buffet service when staying at a 5 star hotel!",3,2017,06,02
121,EXCELLENT THANK YOU GAGAN,"your way of dealing with costomers is flawless,highly impressed.
I spend my son's birthday here and Mr Gagan Sharma the Manager made our stay a memorable one
Food was nice
Location is perfect 
A Big thank you from our family ",5,2017,05,31

Ten minute walk to Buckingham Palace and one underground stop to Westminster Abbey and  Big Ben. Very positive experience overall. Would definitely recommend and go back again.",5,2017,05,31
121,Good Location,"This was a pleasant hotel, rooms rather small, we requested deluxe double, and we could not walk round the bed in comfort. Facilities were nice, staff friendly / helpful, we did not stay for breakfast but rather shocked at the queue for breakfast in the morning, having paid a considerable amount for breakfast i would not expect to queue for a table...",4,2017,05,31
121,Business Trip at the Taj Hotel,This is a beautiful hotel situated in the heart of London.  The hotel staff were excellent and extremely polite and helpful.  I particularly enjoyed the Asian food and custom.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,05,30
121,Costly but good,"Located quite near some must see places. But costly for a London stay. Some East court hotels are cheaper and better. Food is not all that great, some restaurants are better. The tube is walking distance. Rooms are old but cozy.",4,2017,05,30
121,absolutely no value for money,"Booked an Executive double room, Rate 293 pounds/night. Room was renovated but had like 16-18 square meters. View against a very small courtyard. Very small. Almost impossible to unpack my suitcase. Very noisy air-condition. I complained .
Got an offer for another room which was 2 square meters bigger. Refused.

Conclusion. Never stay in this hotel. No value for money. Absolute the opposite!
And; with a front office manager who just see problems and not a solution!!!!",2,2017,05,29
121,Great central London location.,"The hotel is well appointed, a bit rambling but the rooms are well appointed and a reasonable size for central London. The staff are helpful, well trained and give good service. It is easy to walk to Buckingham Palace and Westminster with plenty of dinning options around with convenience stores nearby to buy your 'room supplies'. The only negative is the breakfast room is way too small to handle traffic at busier time but do avoid being syphoned upstairs to a function room for the same breakfast - there is no daylight.",4,2017,05,29
121,Disgusted and disappointed ,"Classic king room. 

We had come for a 4 day city trip with our toddler from india. Having changed 3 flights and a two day trip to reach London we were hoping to settle into a nice hotel. Obviously being ""Taj"" one would hope that the name would live up to the reputation if not the pounds which were spending.

On check in we realized our room was a little small and paid some more for our upgrade. While my daughter and I settled into the room we were welcomed by couple of huge flies, broken furniture and a relatively dusty room. And of course, the bedside intercom wasn't working. Housekeeping came in with the big killing sprays without concern if we would or not be ok with my little one breathing it in (?!?!) ""Taj"" I ask you?? 

We were too tied to make any of the other complaints and decided to just speak to reception in the morning. Unfortunately there wasn't much they were able to
Do other than apologize. The manager gave a deal on the 51 Buckingham gate but that did not de-terrorize me from terrible terrible experience I had the night before. 

We checked into the other hotel around 11 am to find our luggage was still not transferred over by 7pm. It involved numerous calls and leaves me zapped that I had to still do this after a long day of hassles. 

The manager could merely apologize. I was very tied up with a tired toddler who slipped in the bath tub (by the way no shower options in this room), otherwise I would definitely not have paid a penny for the room they gave us. 

Please check the pics below. My favorite is the hidden food stains on the curtains.

I just wish no one else has such a terrible example and start to a holiday. ",1,2017,05,28
121,If it is the Taj it has to be good !,"Have been staying in this hotel for the past four days. . Excellent location, very clean and well furnished rooms, check in was smoothe and efficient, the concierge is excellent. Breakfast is very good though they could increase the number of seats as there is invariably a queue for seating in the morning.  In fact every thing about this hotel is superb - except the WIFI !  I do wish some one told the management of this very fine hotel that in this highly "" connected "" world the most important ""service""  a hotel can provide is WIFI ! Unfortunately their St James Court WIFI is erratic and excruciatingly slow. I was advised thst I should enter ""upgrade.com"" in my browser window but that did not work either. All in all an outstanding hotel that is highly recommended.",5,2017,05,28
121,Comfortable and quiet!,"The Taj London was a very nice experience.  Quiet, off the beaten path of the tourists, great bed, nice bar, delicious Indian restaurant, included breakfast!  What more could we ask for.  We had a couple of small issues which the manager took care of to our satisfaction.  We would return to the Taj.",4,2017,05,28
121,Great Place to stay,"lovely staff, welcoming and friendly, wonderful location and ambience, just ten minute walk to anything, substantial breakfast, nice restaurants, and outdoor courtyard bar/ restaurant, great fitness centre with sauna and steam room",5,2017,05,28
121,"Great Location, Bad Everything Else","If you want a great location, this hotel is perfect. It is near Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, a tube station, and lots of eateries.  The room is small and prison like, the hotel staff is very unfriendly. The food is absolutely terrible. If English is your primary language, you might have difficulty understanding the staff as many of them don't speak English well.",2,2017,05,27
121,Chelsea Flower Show Treat,"I enjoyed our stay here the reception was very lush and the staff welcomed us warmly. Our room was a little disappointing, the window was locked closed,we had air con but I cannot sleep with that on all night, so it was very warm. A bit dated and small but on the whole great location, and choice for breakfast suited everyone's palate.",4,2017,05,27
121,Comfortable stay for the London Marathon,"We enjoyed 4 nights here for our London Marathon stay and it couldn't have been better.  Aida who check us in and the excellent concierge staff were excellent despite the fact that the hotel was brimming with runners from around the globe.  We had an excellent dinner at the Bistro and thoroughly enjoyed the excellent breakfast buffet, including Indian items that reminded us that this is a Taj property.  Unfortunately the weather was too cool to enjoy the beautiful courtyard.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,26
121,Fabulous hotel close to Palace,"Outstanding hotel, brilliantly situated in central London minutes from Buckingham palace, Oxford street and Houses of Parliament. Rooms very good size, comfortable bed, windows can open for fresh air. Breakfast can be busy so be prepared for a queue.",5,2017,05,26
121,Great Stay,"I had a great stay the service was perfect and I don't have any complains. The location is also perfect to walk around the centre of London and to visit the most beautiful places of London. St James Park, Green Park are also in the neighbourhood.",5,2017,05,26
121,Well trained staff. ,"Had overnight stay. Staff are very well trained at customer services and make you fell very welcome and they help very much to get things done and explain things. Room very clean and comfortable. Breakfast has wide ranging selection. 
Only point was that the rail system can be felt in the room. I was in floor 5 but from around 5am I felt vibrations that I was conscious off and disturbed my sleep. As it's close to Buckingham palace the price is pretty high end but great nevertheless. ",5,2017,05,26
121,Very beautiful hotel walking distance from EVERYTHING,"This is an incredible hotel right in the heart of London. We walked to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and the London eye. I cant think of a better location if you are first timers in London without a vehicle. The Hotel was amazing and the food was great in the restaurant.",5,2017,05,26
121,Broken A/c and broken promises,"Was initially quite taken with the charm of the hotel and rather convenient location to my conference space.  Check-in staff Aida was friendly and nice. 

However the a/c was faulty in the room and I made   a request for repair the secone night.  Maintenance told me it was probably overheating with too many people turning on the a/c at the same time. Does not make any sense if you ask me, for a hotel to be so ill-equipped. Anyway the a/c was able to work then so I left it. 2 hours later the a/c went off again with an error message of drainage failure or something equally scary. 

The next morning I went to the front desk to request for a change of room at about 7am. Staff agreed but said the available rooms were dirty and would help me move my things when the rooms were cleaned. Asked that I pack my bags and allow them to help me move as I was going out for the entire day. But when I came back at 8pm, my things were not moved and there were no new rooms. In fact they told me there were no longer any available rooms and no records at all of promising to move me to a new room. Fully booked they said in case I asked for an upgrade. promised to send someone from engineering to take a look again and sent me an eletronic fan.  This time the engineer told me the a/c needed a full overhaul and that he would ask them to move me.  I am still waiting and there has been no response since an hour ago.

For this price of this hotel, I don't think this service is worth it.  Despite one lovely Aida, I would think twice before staying here again. ",2,2017,05,25
121,Service has been outstanding and I have not seen the hotel as yet.,"We had to cancel our trip do to a death in my family. Our 4 other friends continued on to the hotel. We are in the process of re-booking the hotel for August. Even though I have not been to the hotel as yet, the kindness, understanding and service I have received from Gabriela, Ashwin and Amita has been outstanding. It has been a very pleasant experience and I look forward to meeting these 3 wonderful people who have spent countless hours trying to help me cancel this trip which my friend booked though Expedia (never again). I am hoping that the new dates we sent to Sara are available. We look forward to staying at this wonderful hotel in August.",5,2017,05,25
121,good stay in the city center,taj expectations are maintained and d best part being in the central london ... very close to all the tourist attractions and also to the tube satation...very nice specially for vegetarians and indian foodies...,5,2017,05,25
121,Great Convenient London Hotel,My wife and I had a great 9 day stay at this hotel.  It is walking distance to most London attractions.  The staff is outstanding and helpful. Breakfast buffet was included and good.  We had a really good meal in the upscale restuarant.  We highly recommend this hotel,5,2017,05,25
121,Beautiful inside and out,Great location and fantastic service. Sometimes I just say in the he courtyard and enjoyed the lovely scenery in the morning. The breakfast was plentiful and filling. The service was impeccable. The decor was stunning and elegant. I felt very comfortable as soon as i stepped foot into my room. Very calming environment. Close to the metro train and walking distance to Buckingham Palace. My favorite was the friendly door attendant in the awesome blue uniform who agreed to take photos with me. Such a wonderful experience!,5,2017,05,25
121,Not a 4 star room!,Warning - if you book via booking.com you potentially will get one of the old / unrenovated rooms! There is absolutely no mention of this when booking and the pictures shown are of the new rooms. The old rooms are nice and large and light and the bed is comfortable BUT the overall state of the room is totally unacceptable. When I complained I was offered an upgrade when I next visit with a free afternoon tea! Ridiculous! They wanted another £280 minimum to give me a token sorry. Terrible customer service.,2,2017,05,25
121,really good hotel,this hotel was lovely inside and very close to Buckingham Palace. i couldnt really fault it apart from there was not enough milk in the room for tea and coffee but they did send house keeping up with more,4,2017,05,22
121,Great Hotel,Would definitely recommend this hotel. It's pretty close to everything. Victoria Station is a 15 min walk away. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Made my stay comfortable. I could come back to this hotel.,5,2017,05,22
121,very good,"It was very nice experience to be your gest every thing was fantastic.  food was helices, room very clean . I definitely will be your gest again and recommend to my family member and friends. we have been this time 2 days only, next time we going to stay longer.",4,2017,05,22
121,"Fabulous, but for the price, I was expecting more...","Firstly, I have to start this review by stating that normally, we would always stay at the Landmark Hotel, so our expectations, are naturally high, and I had heard good things about the Taj hotel.

It certainly looks the part and the staff are exceptional, however, I do have to agree with some other reviewers here - I was expecting more from the room.  We stayed in the classic double, and for the price, it is small, and quite dated in all honesty.  Having said that the service and friendly staff more than make up for this.

I probably had the worst nights sleep in a long time here - The mattress was lumpy and giving way in places, so it was particularly uncomfortable, but I think this could be sorted by spending a bit of money in some of the rooms.  

The shower isn't great either, very weak and not adjustable, so it felt like it took ages for my hair to get wet as the jets were too far apart (or some of them were just blocked), and I don't have much hair!

All in all - a lovely hotel that made up for what it lacked in comfort, in service!",4,2017,05,22
121,Another Fantastic Experience,"This was a very nice experience - I loved the Comfort of the Beds and the fact that they were Big enough... The environment is so cool, just what you need after a very busy day... I'll be back here every time I travel for Seminars and will recommend this to my friends.",4,2017,05,22
121,Classic double room,I expected so much more and ended up a bit disappointed on arrival. Don't expect a double bed in the classic 'double'. Smaller than a double and nothing special. Stayed in so many hotels that offer better rooms at a better price. Breakfast choices were good but the cooked options were only warm. Location of the hotel made up for some of the disappointment and it is nice and close to St. James tube. Doormen were absolutely lovely and helpful so deserve a wee mention. ,3,2017,05,21
121,"Beautiful hotel, amazing location!","We stayed in a classic king room and it was very nice.  It was a good size room (we didn't have an amazing view, but I didn't request anything special either).  Check in was a breeze and the lobby is lovely with plenty of plush seating and a nice lobby bar with live pianists at night.  Everyone we encountered at the hotel were very pleasant.  We loved that Buckingham Palace, Westminister Abbey, and Big Ben were so close!  It's a nice area to stay in and the tube station was very close as well.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London!",5,2017,05,20
121,Nice hotel in central London,"A very nice hotel, within walking distance from St. James' park, Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace.
Overall for London standard very good value for money.
The Bistro restaurant has a lavish breakfast and some nice dinner choices.
Amenities in the room include coffe/tea and a minibar.
Several other facilities in the hotel include a wellness centre, gym, sauna....
Overall a very nice stay.",4,2017,05,20
121,Great hotel in London,"This is an excellent hotel to stay near many London attractions and tube stations.  The staff and room were excellent.  There is also an in-house restaurant that is quite good.  Everything is a bit expensive but so is all of London, so with that being said, we think this hotel is a good value.",5,2017,05,19
121,Great Hotel and Value,"Great service, loved the breakfast, nice mix of British and Indian foods.  The courtyard is fabulous and they did a great job with the renovations.  Hotel is perfect for those that want some of that old school luxury",5,2017,05,19
121,A disaster,"I am really sorry to be writing this review as I had a lovely stay at the St. James' Court previously and was looking forward to returning. Unfortunately, just about everything that could have gone wrong at the hotel did during this last visit.

I arrived after a full day of meetings and was given a smallish room on the third floor (303).  The room was unbearably hot, so i called down and asked for maintenance to look into the problem. After about 30 minutes I decided to go out to a pub instead of waiting in the sweltering heat.  When I returned, the problem still hadn't been corrected. When maintenance finally did arrive, I was informed that there was a problem with the compressor and the heat issue could not be fixed,  Hotel management, while apologetic, explained that they could not move my room, suggesting instead that I open a window and offering up a fan.  I had a horrible night's sleep and was looking forward to changing rooms the next day,

The next day, I was transferred to a tiny (closet like) room on the 7th floor.  After returning late again, this time the lights in the poor little closet room wouldn't work. Maintenance was again summoned and I went to the restaurant for a pint only to discover that the taps were out of order and there was no draft beer! 

I sincerely hope my experience was an aberration, but I fear there is a systemic problem as the maintenance folks (who I got to know well) seemed to indicate that the compressors had been malfunctioning for some time.",1,2017,05,19
121,Living up to the Taj Standard,"The St. James court is a beautiful hotel with a British feel but Indian warmth & hospitality. 

We upgraded to a suite and the day we changed our room, we received a letter from the manager as well as miniature bottles of cognac, baileys, chocolates while my son got a personalised cookie & a strawberry smoothie!

The breakfast spread was good but not great. The eggs to order were average and there were no waffles or pancakes on the menu. Although they did oblige & brought waffles for my son.

We also had a bit of trouble with the TV set which kept turning on by itself with a beeping noise in the middle of the night. This happened two nights in a row & the technician informed us that the reason was the breakfast message which had to be communicated to guests.

Another pet peeve I had was the water served in the room. They placed small glass bottles in the room where one bottle would be consumed in a single sip. Also glass bottles are a bit dangerous with a child in the room. However they replenished our supply whenever we requested.

The hotel is pricey but the location is central & the team's hospitality is fabulous thus making the stay worthwhile.",4,2017,05,18
121,Good central location for walking to London's main attractions.,Room was a bit dated.  Mattress needed to be replaced as it was worn and sagged to the middle.  Linens were high quality.  Hotel staff did not appear to be well informed.  Concierge staff was excellent.   Overall nice hotel in great location.  It just didn't live up to the Taj standard I was expecting from my stays in other cities.,4,2017,05,18
121,"spacious, clean, pleasant hotel, great location","If given the option, I recommend against the included breakfast if you are staying more than a couple of days. It gets tiring to be offered the same breakfast selection every day. And plan on having to wait in line for 15 minutes or more to get a table.",4,2017,05,18
121,Taj St James shines in London,"My wife and I spent our 25th wedding anniversary at the Taj St James for 8 nights. We had a junior suite on the 6th floor facing the courtyard. Our room was excellent with 2X daily service. There was both WiFi and hard line connection in the room, that made computer use easy and fast. Our suite came with breakfast each day. The selection was varied daily from the buffet, which included a few vegetarian Indian dishes. You could also order a variety of other items at no additional cost. If one had to find ""any"" fault with something, it might be the slowness of having decaf coffee in the morning. It seems that it is made a cup at a time in the kitchen. However, that's stretching it for looking as something to nit-pick. 
Overall, the experience was fantastic, relaxing, exciting and we'll be back on our next visit to London.",5,2017,05,18
121,Very good,"Great hotel, well situated in the heart of London very close to tubes etc. Room was very clean and what I expected, staff very friendly and helpful with any requests. Stayed for a few nights including New Year's Eve and even arriving very late back and wanting drinks it wasn't a problem. Excellent keep up the good service. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻",5,2017,05,17
121,"Would make a good base for a trip to London, with or without kids","Stayed here for one night recently, very impressed with the hotel. It was a late check in, so we didn’t see much of the hotel, but the reception and staff were friendly and check in was quick and easy. The room itself was spacious, which is not always the case in the centre of town. We had a good sized double bed (kind or queen I’m unsure), room for an additional bed for my daughter, and cot for my son. The room had space for a chest of drawers and cupboard for storage, a writing desk, mini bar, sitting area, space for luggage by the door and good sized bathroom. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with all the usual that you’d need. Wifi throughout the hotel is free, which should be standard, but is not always. 

Breakfast was nice, not the largest spread I’ve seen, but a good selection of hot, cold, pastries, cold cuts, cereal and fruit, with additional items available to order like eggs etc. 

All in all, I’d recommend the hotel, I think it would make a very comfortable base for a trip to London, with or without kids.",5,2017,05,17
121,"Elegant, Old-style British tourist/ business hotel in great location","Booked this hotel for our mother/daughter getaway trip for one week. I knew it was in the general location we wanted and the price was very good, particularly for expensive London! It included a free, sumptuous,breakfast buffet every morning in a beautiful dining room. Rooms also came with free WiFi. 

Couldn't have been happier when we got there. It is a big, busy, beautiful old Victorian brick hotel on a side street literally just around the corner from Buckingham Palace. The street itself is a bit deceptive, as it is torn up at the moment, but the location is really central. If you travel one block in the opposite direction,it takes you out to busy Victoria Street,where you can walk a few blocks and be at Westminster Abbey & Big Ben! The St. James Tube Station is also right there. However, we chose to walk a lot  too , to Harrods, Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Piccadilly, Regent Street and Leicester Square/ Covent Garden. 

This hotel is not five star, but just a very comfortable, elegant, old style British tourist / business hotel. The public spaces included a nice Lobby area with a lobby bar and another large, modern bar off it. It features a Michelin star restaurant, Quilon, and another dining room in a solarium, overlooking a fabulous inner courtyard, as well as the restaurant/ dining room where we ate breakfast every morning. So it has lots of dining and drinks choices. The guest rooms were big and comfortable with nice marble bathrooms.

Another  big positive for this hotel was its very helpful Concierge staff. They were so  obliging with directions and suggestions and also able to book tickets for events, such as Diana's Dress Exhibit at Kensington Palace. All of the Dining Room and Front Desk staff were also very solicitous.

We really enjoyed our stay here and would  book here again without any hesitation!",4,2017,05,17
121,Above and Beyond! Truly exceptional service and great location,"Spent 3 nights is St James Court a Taj Hotel in London for our baby moon trip.
booked through an online third party booking system, put a request for early check in (around 11am), upon arival in the hotel, they manage to get us the room early, and the manager gave us a room upgrade, a very thoughful for my pregnant wife. When we came back at night, we recieved a cake saying congratulation for the baby. this personal touch from the hotel made us feel that they take care of us, and made us feels comfortable.
all the staff goes above and beyond to make us feels relaxed and make sure we had a great time during our stay.
The hotel itself : about 2 or 3 mins walk to St James Park underground station,and about 3-4 mins walk to nearest bus stops.
If you want to walk a bit, the other underground station, Victoria station is about 10 mins walk. You can walk for 5 mins or a bit more to Buckingham palace (on your way to victoria station), south korean embassy is about 2/3 buildings next to the hotel, and indonesian embassy is about 10 mins walk.
seeing big ben, parliament / westminster area, westminster abbey is about 5 mins bus ride.
The ambiance as soon as you walk in to the hotel , the nice open area in the middle (behind the restaurant/pub) in the lobby, the residential building in the premises give you a good feel of luxury of thr hotel. at evening time, musician played piano in the lobby, so that you can sit in the lobby an enjoy 15-20 mins after a long day walking.
Book your room with breakfast, and you'll enjoy a nice breakfast with a good coffee, and few options of continental breakfast and you can request how would you like your egg to be cooked.
If you're looking for relaxing, great location, and off course a great service from the hotel, this is the place you want to go and it's worth the money you're paying.
note that the space for breakfast is not that big, however, the hotel opens up two or three places for breakfast, and they give you notice of suggestion about what will be the peak time, so that you can avoid queuing, however, if you enda up queing, it maybe for 5 to 10 mins max.
the room size is great with lots of amenities.

",5,2017,05,17
121,Very Good,"Although the room was small, it was extremely clean, the bed was very comfortable. The included breakfast was excellent. and the staff were wonderful. The location was easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Cathedral, and Parliament Buildings.",4,2017,05,16
121,Excellent choice ,"We stayed here for 10'nights in may 2017 ,before finalising the hotel we explored many options , in central London and now that we are back ,
We are glad we chose this hotel !! Everything was fantastic , the hospitality , location , food an excellent choice for Indian travellers , specially families , as kids are really welcome here .. !! (Only one request
Please increase choices for vegetarians) rest everything was perfect !",5,2017,05,15
121,Not for Jooloos,"Jooloos and I stayed saturday night at the Taj hotel. Disappointed. 'Please wait while I find you a good room' said the check-in lady. Mmm... I guess we should've given her longer. It was an executive room (as booked) but cramped and soooo hot. A/C not working properly and cut out every 20 mins or so. Sorry folks, Jooloos forgot to take a pic of the view - a brick wall and some ductwork, avoid 3--, then! Also above kitchens so extract duct and kitchen staff noise. Also smallest hotel tv that we've seen in ages. Totally spoiled my late evening enjoyment of the Eurovision song contest - couldn't see the damn scores!
Went to bar to get some glasses as there is a minibar in the room but no wine glasses. I was told that it was against the rules to give guests a wine glass. C'mon guys, I'm a paying guest and within reason you should give me what I ask for, especially if I'm polite.
Breakfast a disaster. Queued for 10 mins to be told it would be a 20 minute wait - we should go upstairs where we would be looked after. True that. Staff good (especially guy who made me toast) but in an old windowless ballroom with a lukewarm buffet. Not impressed.
We really wanted to like this hotel as location is great and staff, mostly good. Quillon restaurant next door always good.
Hotel seemed popular with coach tours but not one for Jooloos
Sorry",2,2017,05,14
121,Luxury two minutes away from Buckingham Palace,"The hotel is extremely well situated: it is less than a two minutes walk from the Green Park tube station and less than 10 from the Victoria Station. Within ten minutes of walk, you can be at the Buckingham Palace, Big Ben or Trafalgare Square. The hotel is splendid. The staff is very polite and professionnal. Don't forget to have a drink (a gin and tonic, obviously!) at the bar in the lounge. In the evening there is even a pianist. The rooms are very (VERY!) big for London. We've stayed in much, much smaller for the same price. The only thing that could be bothering is the water debit. Don't even think about taking a bath, it would take at least an hour to fill. But this is really the only ''problem'' about the room and the hotel in general. Would gladly go back!!",5,2017,05,14
121,Excellent experience,"Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Hotel location was very good and on easy access to St James Station and Victoria station. was also close to Buckingham palace, Hyde park and many important locations for business and leisure.",5,2017,05,13
121,Fantastic!,"My sister and I try and take a trip together every few years and this year was London..
We chose this hotel mainly for its location and reviews.
Words cannot express the amazing service we received from EVERY single employee!
A smile and a "" can I be of service"" from each and everyone of them!
Just above and beyond anything I could have imagined! Kudos to each person who greeted us or helped us and to management who obviously runs a top notch establishment!
Beds very comfy , Our bathroom was quite large, breakfast  with soooo many choices was amazing !
Concierge helped us daily with tickets for different sights...   
Location was perfect as well!
I cannot praise this hotel enough!
Thanks for making our stay so comfortable!",5,2017,05,11
121,Great hotel in a great location,"We could not fault the staff, the service and hotel facilities. The location allowed us to walk to most of the places we wanted to see and the parks were a bonus for relaxing and exercise. We could recommend the hotel for anybody wanting a central hotel.",5,2017,05,10
121,Birthday Visit.,"My husband and I just returned from a trip to London with our stay at the St James hotel and can't say enough about the staff and how wonderful they were.  We were welcomed so graciously and very early for a 2pm check in they did their best to get us into our room asap. Everyone on staff was always pleasant and so helpful. The location cannot be beat if you are visiting all the tourist attractions. We walked to most places or Victoria station 10 minutes away. Concierge were the best, hooked us up with great seats for two shows and directed us to great restaurants. I was thrilled when inquiring about best way to airport concierge ordered a car service less than a taxi and a very nice ride. Loved everything and sorry didn't get to the Spa but so much to see and do, would definitely stay again. Get the breakfast included worth it.",5,2017,05,10
121,Excellent,Wonderful hotel with first class staff all very attentive - excellent suite very spacious and well appointed - overall a very pleasant experience - valet parking made stay there very easy - will definitely return,5,2017,05,10
121,Feels like Asia ,"As an Asian stepping into the St james court hotel gives a lot of comfort, front desk manned by Indian staff inadvertently gives the impression of proud but professional Indian colonial hospitality just like the Taj hotels in India. I was not disappointed, since having arrived 8am in the morning after 20hr flight the front desk tried for 30 mins to find me a room to check into immediately. For a weary traveler this service gesture perhaps is the most important if the hotel is serious about ensuring their guests' comfort. My Classic double room was very small, in a corner and had almost no view but it was comfortable in spite of tight quarters. Yes decor and such may be a little dated but it is charming in a classical way  (if you want modern go look somewhere else).bathroom is reasonably sized with good range of amenities including robe and slippers (is a treat, rarely found in European hotels). My only complaint is the sink keeps choking up and drains slowly, even as maintenance was called but it didn't fix the issue.  Breakfast lines are long indeed so go before 8am, the range offered is suitable for business travellers not looking to linger and quite delicious. Surprised they didn't offer a larger range of Indian or oriental food for breakfast. The gym is small but given the hotel is situated very near two lovely parks , take the exercise outside instead. Bistro and Quilon were very good restaurants on site which were well priced and good food. Overall nothing too much to complain except this hotel is very crowded so the number of people around the lobby or restaurants can be overwhelming. However this will remain one of my top choices should I come to London again. ",4,2017,05,10
121,good location,"Nice hotel with good location, service, breakfast and spa! The hotel is huge, so ask the room near the elevator, otherwise you will walk long to your room.The room was a little bit old, but still nice for a short stay",4,2017,05,10
121,Wonderful Stay,I felt awesome moment I saw ' Hindustani Tiranga' on top of the Hotel. It was an amazing view. Rooms were good. Ambiance was great. Food was exceptional. Liked every moment of my stay. Location is great. Center of London. Every major attraction is at a walking distance. Next to Buckingham Palace. Staff was good. I had gone for a office trip otherwise this Hotel is a really costly affair. I would recommend at least one night stay if you are visiting London.,5,2017,05,09
121,Elegant comfort,"The St.James Court belongs to the Taj group, the iconic Indian chain part of the highly respected Tata group which spans salt to software and everything in between. Jaguar Land Rover and Corus Steel is part of the group. 

Like all Taj hotels, there is a quiet and gentle elegance about the hotel, something the employees refer to as  ""TAJNESS "" which is in the DNA of the property. 

Right from check in to check out you are made to feel special. 

The location is impeccable, having the Queen as a neighbour. Buckingham Palace is virtually next door and the St James, Hyde and Green parks minutes 
away.

Rooms are elegant, house keeping is exceptional, breakfast is very food and the service across the board is helpful and friendly 

Really a top class upmarket residence in London. 

",5,2017,05,09
121,"Outstanding service, great hotel","Staying at the St James was a real pleasure.  Outstanding staff! Good location for sightseeing-walking distance to Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, etc.  Rooms are nice.  Beds are good.  Breakfast was also very good and helped start the day of sightseeing. Ease of access to underground is also close (St James station).  Will definitely stay at this hotel for any London visit.",5,2017,05,09
121,Dated rooms & overpriced,"Unfortunately the hotel didn't meet up to the standards we had expected (or those advertised by its own website). Our ""Classic King"" room, which I paid extra for, was facing a construction site, had a terribly uncomfortable bed, smelled of cleaning products, and looked like it hadn't been updated in a few decades. Breakfast (at £20 a person) was basic and served in extremely tight quarters - we were forced to listen to the loud conversation of a couple next to us who decided that a public dining room was an appropriate place/time to FaceTime their friends back in Spain. (The staff did NOT ask them to end their call). I'm 8 months pregnant and had to wedge myself into a tiny table next to them. We were also rushed by the waitstaff, who appeared eager to move us along for the next customers (even though there were several vacant tables nearby). All in all, I was left wishing I had booked a different hotel for my husband's birthday getaway and feeling like I paid a LOT more than this room/experience was worth.",3,2017,05,09
121,Wonderful Stay,"After reading all the great reviews, I booked the Taj due to its proximity to Buckingham Palace. And I was not disappointed! The Taj is literally a minute away from the Palace. The opposite direction, about 10 minute walk to Westminster Abbey. The underground is around the corner as well as taxi's available at the front door anytime. All employees were super courteous. We had the Junior Suite which was a really nice room. Had more of a 'homey' feeling than hotel room. Not sure why there is no door separating the rooms, but not a big deal for us. We had a nice view of the courtyard and I really liked being able to open the windows for some fresh air( hotels in America that I have stayed, the windows do not open ). Breakfast was included in our rate and it was really nice to have it delivered to our room each day. We could go to the restaurant as well. Went to the Bistro for dinner, food was really good. Service was ok. Didn't wait for anything until a picky family of guests showed up, then it took 15-20 minutes to simply get dessert for one ordered. That's really my only complaint. The thing that really stood out for me is how wonderful​ the hotel smelled everywhere. Very inviting and actually put me in a much better mood daily. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the Palace area. ",5,2017,05,09
121,Great Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay, not there long enough!! staff were very pleasant and nothing too much trouble Will definitely stay here in the future and use the spa and restaurant other than in the bar although the food was extremely good and staff great.",5,2017,05,09
121,Birthday stay,"Visited here as we were in London celebrating my cousins birthday. We arrived earlier than our check-in but were pleased to see our rooms were ready. Staff were very friendly and welcoming upon check-in. 

We had a deluxe double room which was very spacious and was really lovely. We had a good view out on to the courtyard. 

The reception is beautiful as you walk in and I have to say the interior of the hotel is stunning. 

Would definitely stay here again. Booked on booking.com and got it for £75 each, absolute bargain for a wonderful hotel!

Hotel is near Buckingham Palace so a good place to stay if you're wanting to visit. 

Can't comment on the food as didn't eat here but looking forward to next visit!

121,Recent 4 day stay in London,"This has been our second visit to the St James. To the wonderful check-in clerk, Valentina and Concierge Gergo, our trip was PERFECT again in London. Let's not forget the outstanding breakfast and the great service we received. It was like being home with the great attitudes and personal service we received. No better place in London.",5,2017,05,08
121,Great Place,"The location is near local landmarks and tourist attractions.  It is well worth the price.  I highly recommend this hotel.   The location is two blocks away from Buckingham Palace and location attractions such as the Churchill War Room, Westminster Abbey.",4,2017,05,08
121,Excellent hotel,"Stopped here for 1night and paid for an exec suite.
The suite was excellent, clean and very spacious
Our rate included breakfast and if you have this in your rate they will serve in room at no extra cost ... this was a nice treat.
Couldn't find anything to fault with hotel - we didn't eat there so cant comment on food.",5,2017,05,08
121,Taj Hotel in London,Hotel in central London. Near Buckingham Palace and westminster and walking distance to the houses of Parliament. Exceptional value for Money considering London hotel prices. Very quiet location. Quiet bedroom. Good choice of food for breakfast.. Friendly staff.,5,2017,05,08
121,Another great stay at St. James Court,"Third trip to London and third stay at this beautiful property - excellent service and amenities, great location withing walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Pier (for Thames river cruises), the London Eye, etc. Great bars and restaurants on-site and a pub one block away. Nice-sized room for King Classic with large bathroom.",5,2017,05,07
121,Disappointing,The stay did not achive our expectations. The room was not located in the main building and it was equipped with old furniture. Very poor breaksfast. This hotel must be refurbished. Very poor value for money,3,2017,05,07
121,Overall a great place to stay,"Service was great, rooms were nice, but  the beds were uncomfortable for being a 4-5 star place  . My husband had a back ache from the bed.  Bathroom ventilation terrible, bathtub dangerously high, difficult to climb into. I am athletic and I had a hard time with that.",5,2017,05,07
121,Great place walking distance from everything,"Stayed two nights, very nice hotel, we had a great last minute deal. You cabn walk 5 to 15 minutes to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbay, parliement, London eye. Comfortable beds, small but nice room.",5,2017,05,06
121,Quintessential British establishment with Eastern hospitality,"My first stay with a Taj hotel overseas, and it was very nice!

In the heart of London but a quiet street.",5,2017,05,05
121,Excellent hotel,"We booked the hotel without any special expectations, and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is charming, the staff very courteous and polite. The staff treated each request kindly. Breakfast is excellent, two bottles of water are waiting in the room every day. The hotel itself is beautiful and special, the restaurants are excellent, the cocktails were the best. The price is very reasonable in relation to the return. I would be happy to come back and recommend to friends. We must not forget the excellent location.",5,2017,05,05
121,Great Hotel,"This facility is wonderfully located only minutes from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park.  The neighborhood is peaceful and pleasant to walk in, much more inviting from other parts of London we toured.  I just can't say enough good things about this hotel.  The service is wonderful, beginning the first day you approach the hotel until the day you leave.  The concierge helped us book service on one of the hop on and off buses and gave excellent information about other questions we had.  Our room on the first floor (second floor for US travelers) was very large, quiet, clean and comfortable with a view of the garden court.  The free in-room Wi-Fi was reliable and easy to use.  This was our first visit to London but we will definitely return and stay at the St. James Court again.",5,2017,05,04
121,Pleasant stay,One night stay - in a back bedroom with a window that looked out onto a wall .  The foyer is more impressive than the bedrooms and hallways which are very dated. However - pleasant stay - had everything we needed and breakfast was good.,3,2017,05,03
121,London Visit,Very good hotel close to Buckingham Palace. Decent sized rooms in good overall condition. Breakfast choice varied and good quality although be prepared to wait 5 minutes for seating at busy times. Good value for money in central London location.,4,2017,05,03
121,Amazing Location!,My wife and I stayed at the St. James Hotel on our recent trip to London.  The location is just a quick walk away from Buckingham Palace.  The staff were amazingly friendly and really sweet on top.  Never a morning or evening when you pass the desk did they not say hello to us (Unless they were busy with client).,5,2017,05,02
121,Great hotel!,"On a recent visit to London, we made the decision to stay at St. James' Court. Best decision we ever made!   Although a bit pricey, it was worth it when you consider the central location and quality of service. 
Highly recommend it!",5,2017,05,02
121,"Corridors, Corridors and more Corridors","We really enjoyed our stay here From the time the door was held open for us to enter, to the ease of check-out. Room was decent size. Had a room safe. Was impressed as bathroom had towel warmer,  make-up mirror, and a retractable clothes line over the tub. Courtyard is really nice. There are many winding corridors throughout the hotel, which were interesting. Had breakfast included (see review of Bistro). Enjoyed afternoon tea at Kona. Considering the closeness to the underground, and all the places we wanted to visit, this place was perfect for us. Only thing I can tell you to be aware of is that lines do form for breakfast, and sometimes the service was way off, so just be prepared to give yourself extra time. Wished we were staying longer so would have had time to enjoy the other amenities at the hotel.",5,2017,05,02
121,Great Stay,I have been staying at the St. James for last few years and the experience i have each time is more enhanced that the previous stay. My special thanks to Mr. Sikka who ensures that my stay goes smoothly and I feel very much at home. Looking forward to my stay next month.,5,2017,05,02
121,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is a great one. geat location.There is a convenience store and lots of restaurants nearby.  Excellent breakfast.

121,Excellent stay,"Hi St James court Team,

Since Jan'17, I had stayed multiple times (long stays) in this hotel, and yes, I should share my feedback for the well being of team.

Firstly I wish to name : (Pls pardon me for error in name spell) Sunaina Sorares , Naveen Sikka, Arianna, Isabella, Anubhav, all Front desk personnel (day and night), F&B - Sidhaarth, Marcella, Younus, Lady name not remembered (who met with an accident in Mar'17), and entire staff. They have gone extramile to support and help me in my legible needs and always seen a ""can do"" attitude.

I wish to say thank you very much for making my long business trip away from home as ""feel at home"" and everyone really helped me and gone extra mile to satisfy the legible needs and shown a real customer centric approach. 

As I could not stop talking good things about this hotel, I used to recommend people in my entire circle and share good stories of my experience of the stay with my friends.

I would definitely recommend to colleagues, friends and relatives of mine.

The Hotel is very near to St James Park (Royal Park), Buckimgham Palace, approachable from Local Trains and tubes and nearest tube station is St James park and Victoria Station.

Very near to markets and excursions to entire Central London, Just all is walking distance.

Cheers!

121,first time in my hotel stay waiting for a breakfast,"to reach a room was like entering a labyrinth. the beds were exposed to the entrance door and there was no privacy and an ability for a good sleep. there was a line to check for the breakfast. the staff in the Bistro was absolutely aware of good service. first day the room was not cleaned, most possibly because it was at the end of the amazingly curved corridor.",4,2017,04,29
121,Wonderful hotel in a great central location.,"A luxurious hotel in the centre of London. Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Whitehall, St James Park, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery.

Service and the attention staff to guests is perfection.  Lovely bathroom with large soft towels and bathrobes. 

The only downside is that the rooms may be a little smaller than in similar hotels in the USA. But this is London!",4,2017,04,28
121,Great hotel,Great hotel at an excellent location. Amazing service. Very friendly and incredibly polite staff. Great food. They even sent me  an email asking me if I needed some items I had left behind. So caring and responsible.,5,2017,04,28
121,Great Hotel and Great Location,We went to London for the Marathon and I can not say enough great things about this hotel.   The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The rooms were great.  We had breakfast included in our rate and it was very very good.   The location on this hotel is amazing and you can walk to many places and very close to a tube stop.   I would stay here again.,5,2017,04,28
121,Faultless,"Return visit to this hotel and I can't fault this hotel in any way, rooms, service and staff are all excellent.  Other chains should send their staff here for training, for a lesson in customer service and standards. ",5,2017,04,28
121,Luxurious sanctuary in central London,"I loved everything about this hotel.  Stepping inside felt like an immediate haven of luxury and old world charm. The service was efficient, pleasant and friendly. The room was very nice, and the wood floors were a lovely surprise. The bathroom was spotless, the shower wonderful and the bath towels a very generous size.  Breakfast was plentiful, with choices to suit all taste buds.  The location is convenient to transport, and within walking distance of several major attractions. And for central London, the price was among the best I found for a good hotel. This will be my new go-to place when I want a comfy landing spot in London.",5,2017,04,27
121,Pleasant room and great location,"We recently spent 5 nights at this Taj Hotel.  We traveled as a retired couple who wished to see the sights of London.  This hotel had been recommended to us by another couple who had been pleased with their stay.  We were not disappointed!  We arrived in London at Victoria Station and walked to the hotel, which was about 6 or 7 blocks away.  We were quickly checked in and taken to our room on the 6th floor.  We had reserved a king executive room and were very pleased.  The room was large, actually divided into 2 sections by a partial wall.  The king bed and wall mounted flat screen tv were in one area and 2 chairs, a table, and desk in another.  The bathroom was large with heated towel bars and there was ample closet space.  It was a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing.

The location was even better!  Only about 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace and St. James's Park, and a nice 6 block walk to Westminster Abby and Parliament Square.  We took the tube which was 2 blocks from the hotel to other places we wished to visit.  The hotel had 2 or 3 dining options and we did eat at the hotel on 3 evenings of our stay.  There was a pleasant Italian restaurant diagonally across the street (Bon Gusto) where we ate on another evening.  The bar staff in the Bank restaurant were very friendly!  The hotel price was very fair for a good location in a major city.  However breakfast is not included unless you pay extra at booking.  We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning because it was convenient.  The buffet was 20 pounds and not very good.  It was actually less money to order ala carte from the menu.  I had waffles one morning which were delicious and eggs to order with toast another morning.",5,2017,04,26
121,Fun weekend in london,"We stayed in this hotel for two days, it was lovely to stay here and we would definit stay here again. Our greeting on arrival was very welcoming. Our room was very spacious & comfortable and clean, there was a good selection of teas,coffee and breakfast very impressive.  Service was efficient, staff friendly & helpfull. We found this hotel convenient for us as we going to see a show & winter wonderland. It's is also very close to Buckingham Palace.",5,2017,04,26

121,London marathon break,"We stayed 23 April 2017. We stayed in the junior suite which is very spacious with a nice lounge area and a large bathroom with a massive walk in shower, the bedroom has a king size bed which is so comfortable. The room was spotless clean and could not fault a thing. The breakfast was the best I have had with excellent service. We had evening meal in the bistro restaurant to celebrate my daughter completing the London marathon, the food was first class and very good value for money. The staff in this hotel are all so friendly and really go out of there way to make sure you have a great stay. We have booked to return in may ",5,2017,04,26
121,"Location, Location, Location","This was a perfect place to stay for us on our recent visit to London, the people working here go out of there way to make our stay as comfortable as possible.

121,Great hotel in the heart of London,"This hotel is well-located, near Buckingham Palace.  It is also close to the Churchill War Museum which is well worth seeing.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The rooms are wonderful and the gym is very nice.  We loved everything about it.",5,2017,04,26
121,Superb Hotel,"Third stay for us.  The room was once again clean, comfortable, and quiet.  The breakfast buffet, included in our package, offered a good variety of choices.  We were always promptly seated.  Lunch was relatively inexpensive--provisions from a nearby Waitrose which we kept in the room's mini-fridge.  As noted by others, the hotel's location is very convenient  to many London sights.",5,2017,04,26
121,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel , very clean  well located , good choice of breakfast , staff very informative , efficient service would recommend.  We stayed as a family of 4 with teenage girls and found the family room large enough.",4,2017,04,26

121,Good and convenient location to visit the city,"Nice hotel in a good location, near Buckingham Palace, perfect for exploring London City. Some minutes only to the next tube station, St. James Park. Staff friendly. Room could have been a bit bigger bed, but was as booked or described. The breakfast rooms (there are two) are a bit too small, it was always quite crowded and the buffets were not the same in the both.",4,2017,04,25
121,Not the service that I expected,"We arrived at the hotel approximately 5.30pm for a reception in the conference suites.  This was for people who had run the London Marathon that day and the charity they had run for.  The reception in the conference suites was fine, but a few smiley faces wouldn't have gone amiss!

We went into the bar to order some drinks.  Well I have to say it was probably some of the worse service I have received in a hotel/bar.  A friend ordered some drinks and we were not sure when the bar operative was actually going to hand them to her as he didn't even acknowledge what he was doing.  I then ordered a bottle of wine and that was a feat in itself!  I asked for three glasses, I got three, then one was taken away and then returned!  We had to wait for ages for the drinks and the lack of communication is not what you would expect in any establishment.  It does not matter what star hotel/venue is, service is service and should be at all times.

I do visit London a fair bit and stay in different hotels all over the country - for both business and pleasure - but the experience we had here does not make me want to visit again.  

The hotel need to sort out the attitude of the staff.  Maybe it was because we were dressed pretty casual as we had been attending the London Marathon all day - however that gives no excuse for how you perceive people.  I personally did find they were looking down their noses at us.  Never judge a book by its cover is something they may need to remember.

Shame as the hotel looked a nice place.",3,2017,04,25
121,Needs renovation ,Located close to Buckingham palace. Tube station also very close by. The rooms are very spacious compared to other hotels in london. The corridors are very narrow and you need to navigate as though you are in a maze to find your room. The hotel needs to be renovated . The quilon restaurant serving south Indian cuisine is very good. The breakfast is ok. The staff are quite helpful. It was a bit crowded because of the marathon. Overall a good hotel. ,4,2017,04,24
121,Nice location. Little tired,Stayed here for 4 days for London marathon. Room was quiet but we had booked a king and were into a double instead. Hotel is quite an amusing maze of corridors and I think is classified as vintage. Buffet breakfast was included a d was good with a nice variety of offerings. Service was very nice.,4,2017,04,24
121,Over priced ,"A standard business hotel which doesn't give any surprises or failures.   The food things about this hotel are the location (short walk to St James Park tube station and Victoria Station and ten-minute walk to Buckingham Palace and 15-min walk to Parliament Square) and the room service which is really good and fast.  Things that I found disappointing is that the room is pretty dated and desperately needs refurbishment.  My room smells of old furniture... all in all, given that the room is not cheap I would suggest choosing other hotels in London where there are plenty of choices. ",3,2017,04,23
121,average hotel,"Smoking room, whereas specifically asked for non smoking Location is good, but service average. elevator was out off order. Had to wait for check in.

121,"Nice hotel , very good location , friendly stuff ","If you looking for location , this is probably one of the best in London . Rooms are not so big , but not small for London. Breakfast is good , it was very busy on holidays , but stuff was very helpful.  ",5,2017,04,22
121,Wonderful stay,"This hotel was wonderful! We enjoyed our room, the service and the free breakfast was delicious! Perfect location in walking distance to all major icons. The staff was very helpful and the live music at the bar each night was wonderful! We will definitely want to stay here again!",5,2017,04,21
121,First Class Overall,"Stayed 4 nights. The welcome and concierge service is excellent. The room was extremely comfortable, with a nice view over the lane to the adjoining Hotel Apartments. The Hotel lobby also acts as a charming lounge area with adding bar, offering meals and snacks or a nice place to enjoy afternoon tea.
Breakfast is buffet with a wide variety of hot and cold options. An excellent way to start the day, served in a charming bistro. The location is excellent, walking distance to all the attractions, set in a charming little street away from the noise, an close to St James and Victoria stations.
Over all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone. If we are fortunate enough to return to the UK one day it will definitely be our 1st choice.",5,2017,04,21
121,"Stylish, Clean , Caring and Good value for Money","A Hotel par excellence. Lovely Spacious Rooms, a breeze to check in, awesome breakfast spread, caring & courteous hotel team. Kids were greeted and welcomed as well every time they walked into the Hotel or the Breakfast Room. Walking disctance to some of the great tourist attractions - Buckingham Palace,St James Park, Hyde Park, Traflgar Square . Victoria Tube and St James Park Station are both walking distance.

Would suggest this wonderful Hotel to anyone anytime.",5,2017,04,20
121,A lovely stay at St James Court,"This is a lovely hotel centrally located to many attractions like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben. Our room is adequate in size and nicely situated (i.e. Not noisy). It was I believe in an older part of the hotel as the lifts were so small! The people were all lovely and helpful, the concierge helped us with booking tours and gave good suggestions. Breakfast was ample-sure there was a line but the hotel did open up the lounge location near the piano for overflow so that was good. Overall good experience - we will stay in this hotel again!",4,2017,04,19
121,A bit disappointing,"I stayed in this Taj Property twice- in October and December- only because  my husband is a big fan of the brand.  After the last stay, I don't plan to stay there again, despite any objections.  The Taj hotels in India are splendid but in London, I was overwhelmed to say the least.  The room was pretty small.  The spa was pretty good.  The restaurant had good hours for London (until midnight I think) but the food was only so-so.  The service was mediocre.  The experience was so-so.  Overall, its not a bad venue but possibly below its star rating.  Its decent/average at best and the customer service did not make up for whats missing in terms of room size or attractiveness and other factors.
I'd prefer to pay the same place at other venues and get my moneys worth.",3,2017,04,19
121,Excellent experience!,"We stayed 8 nights at this lovely historic hotel.  We had drinks in the quiet relaxing courtyard every evening which was a welcome escape from the crowds while visiting sites.  Angelica, our room housekeeper, deserves honourable mention for thoughtfully stocking the fridge with ice every day after learning of my sprained ankle.  We would return to this hotel again without hesitation!",5,2017,04,18
121,BIG disappointment,"I'm sure this hotel must boast some lovely rooms. Unfortunately the one we shared for two nights must have been the noisiest in the place. Next door to the housekeeping cupboard, and underneath what sounded like a laundry complete with rolling laundry holders. The decor was tired and shabby too - chipped paint and wallpaper. 

The bed was comfy with lovely bedding though. 

Overall terribly expensive and not the excellent quality I was expecting for £445 (and no breakfast included). Certainly wouldn't recommend to friends and associates.",2,2017,04,17
121,"Charming Hotel, Exceptional Staff!","The staff were exceptionally polite and accommodating to our every need. My family and I were most impressed with the bar/lounge manager and staff, as they were always so friendly; they were very helpful with food and drink recommendations, making our dining and cocktail experiences a special treat, every time. We had two rooms, both were kept immaculate and well maintained by housekeeping staff. I was pleasantly surprised with, and appreciated, additional items such as the robes, slippers and the towel warmers in the bathrooms; these things, adding to our overall comfort while in room. Overall, the hotel is charming, well located and wonderfully staffed to meet every expectation. We enjoyed our visit to London and thank the hotel management and the staff for being such a pleasure to see and interact with everyday. We will be back!",5,2017,04,17
121,Not up to previous standard,"We have stayed here twice before when it was the Crowne Plaza, and decided to come back for our 25th anniversary as we had enjoyed it so much, and the food at the Quilon restaurant next door is fantastic.
My wife is on crutches temporarily, but we were allocated a room at the rear of the hotel, as far as possible from the lifts. The room itself was Classic, at £250 a night.
These rooms are quite small and ours was a bit tired and the cleaning poor, there was toilet paper under the sink, so the floor had not been cleaned. 
At breakfast we waited 20 minutes to be seated, and the queue was no shorter when we came out, so not just a sudden rush.
The bar area was very pleasant, and our meal at the Quilon was brilliant-I have reviewed this separately.
Even on checking out I was ignored by the receptionist who served someone who arrived at the desk after me.
We would like to visit Quilon again, but I am thinking of trying to find another hotel nearby in view of our experience. Definitely needs to sharpen up to justify status and prices.",2,2017,04,16
121,A Heritage Property next to Buckingham Palace,"St. James Court is a Taj property. It lets them down badly. The hotel is reasonably good but somehow fails to meet the lofty standards of the Taj. The lobby is cluttered and usually over-crowded. We had to wait on all the days of our stay  for breakfast.

My room was of reasonable size, however the windows opened on to other rooms.

The wi-fi was a big let down. It worked sporadically and the connectivity was quite poor. This in the heart of London is totally unacceptable.

The staff was courteous.

The best things of course is the hotel's location in the heart of London. I happily went for walks in St. James Park every morning. 

The only reason one would stay at this hotel is its location.",4,2017,04,15
121,Bad quality of rooms and horrible stay,"I am writing this review while still staying at the hotel. We were first given room number 203, on the second night someone came into the room next door and we could hear everything they were doing or saying. Tv, their talks and everything. It was very annoying as we could not sleep at night and it was really interfering in our privacy as i an sure even noises from our room would go to them. It was as if, they are sitting right next to us and it wasn't the fault of the other guests because they were not shouting or anything.
We requested for a change of room, to our surprise we were downgraded. Even though they called the new room with the same name, however the room was visibly smaller with fewer things in the room, n most importantly the bed was queen size. While the bed we had in the previous room was king size and its exactly what we had booked too. This was really annoying and disappointing as we kept waiting with our suitcases packed for quite a while. 
As any unpacking would cause us further trouble. Upon waiting and requesting them, we were told that the only room available was a smoking room as they were fully booked. We have categorically booked a non smoking room.
They should have alternatives, its not the duty of the guest to adjust.
So we decided to see the rooms before shifting again, as usual the other new rooms were also smaller with a typical smell of smoke, which is intolerable  for me.
They said they can change us the next day, so they expected us to again unpack for tonite and again pack tomm morning to change the room,
The only option they had was an upgrade for which we would have to pay 75pounds per night. 
We had a 5 nights stay which was completely  uncomfortable and disappointing, also a lot of our time which was wasted just sorting this out. 
Other than this, their service was good.",2,2017,04,14
121,Good choice for a treat.,"We chose this hotel for a one night stay in Central London as we going to the theatre as a belated birthday treat.  We had been in India earlier in the year at the time of my wife's birthday so this taste of India was a way of extending the pleasure of that visit.  We were therefore delighted to be able to enjoy some Indian breakfast dishes along with the Western breakfast, particularly as didn't have the chance to eat in Indian restaurant itself.    We did have the chance to enjoy their Royal Afternoon tea with all our London based family in the afternoon in the very cosy setting of its Kona restaurant.  Service was rather slow but most of us weren't in a hurry and to eat the quantity of food  provided needed some time to enjoy properly, 

The hotel has an enjoyably smart old fashioned feel.  Our room was not huge but reasonable enough and very comfortable - although we had to request a move initially because the last occupant had clearly been smoking and the smell was still there.",4,2017,04,13
121,"Good hotel, not great","The hotel has an excellent location. You are walking distance to many of the sites. We did have difficulty traveling with a six year old and staying at this hotel. They do not provide room service  for dinner or lunch. Also, there are not many restaurants for children nearby (there are pubs but they didn't allow children inside after 6:00 pm). There is a McDonalds about a quarter of the mile away. So, if you are up and about all day and your child is tired, you do not have many options for restaurants by the hotel. There are two high-end restaurants as an option, but, not child friendly. 

Also, I was provided with conflicting information from two concierges. The concierge scheduled for the morning shift quoted me a price for a car service at 10 pounds less than the latter when I went to book a car service to the airport.  

The customer service was excellent but not many amenities for children except for a welcome packet when you arrive. 

Arriving from Heathrow. I would recommend a taxi or Uber to the hotel. The train to Paddington then a taxi to the hotel was exhausting after flying all night from the States. The positive was that our suite was ready two hours after our arrival so we did not have to wait all day. 

Great hotel if you are traveling as adults. With children, you may want to stay at a hotel with amenities specifically for children.  Too pricy for family and not enough provided for young children.

121,Fine London Hotel in a Good Location,"Pros:  Great Location near Victoria Station (for those getting in from Gatwick, this was really convenient) and Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament, the Eye, and Westminster Abbey, Free Breakfast that was actually pretty decent, Wifi, Good Sized Room

Cons:  Shower Pressure was for the birds",4,2017,04,12
121,What a delight!,"My family and I recently spent a week as guests in the St. James Court hotel in London (room 677).  Housed in an elegant building that is obviously steeped in history, and which reflects the elegance of times gone by, the St. James still manages to provide all the modern conveniences one would expect of a newly built, modern luxury hotel.  The location is incredible, considering it is just down the street from Buckingham, and a stone's throw from Big Ben.  Our room was spacious with large windows, the service was excellent, the staff was extremely helpful, and the food was remarkable.  

As a special note, during our stay, our child became ill in the middle of the night with a stomach virus, creating a terrible mess.  A staff member from the front desk named Leo, was very quick to come and assist us with clean up.  In addition to being thoroughly professional in facing such an unpleasant situation, he also displayed both compassion and sensitivity, making the whole situation much better than it might otherwise have been, and even offering to call a doctor if we thought it were needed.  Having such excellent staff on hand, even in the middle of the night shows how far this hotel is prepared to go to help its guests have the perfect stay.  Thank you so much!",5,2017,04,12
121,Gorgeous Property,"Beautiful Hotel located in a quite and extremely central area. Buckingham Palace, St. James Park and the Tube station are just a stone throws away.  Extremely warm service which makes it feel like a home away from home. Would stay there every-time we visit London.",5,2017,04,12
121,Hotel,The lobby is very elegant but the room is very disappointing for a five star hotel and there was no turn down service which I expect with a hotel of this standing. Have had to wait in a line before given a table for breakfast which in my opinion is very poor for a five star hotel and there was no choice of alternative breakfasts although the waitress was vet attentive,4,2017,04,11
121,"Again, another great stay at this Hotel!","This is the second time we have stayed at this Hotel in two years - admittedly the first time, the rooms were better than what we had this time.  Not sure if it's because I asked to stay near the lift (as it's a huge hotel and some rooms can be quite far to get to)? But the rooms were definitely not in the range as the first time, however, I still love this Hotel as it's extremely clean and the staff are lovely.",4,2017,04,11
121,Business trip,"Perfect location in the city center, near famous attractions like Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey; Underground station in walking distance;
friendly and supportive staff, clean facilities; bathroom in the standard room small and gave not enough space for toiletries; 
in the night noise from engines from outside could be heard",4,2017,04,11
121,Avoid the Executive Studio Suites,Booked the captioned suite on the basis of the photograph on the hotel website. Got a cramped room with an awful view of neighbouring apartment walls. Apparently all suites in this category have poor views. This suite category is not cheap and definitely not worth the money.,2,2017,04,11
121,"Classy hotel, classy treatment","This hotel has old world charm and a very beautiful entry and ground floor.  Rooms are simple but very comfortable.  All of the staff were very friendly, always greeting you on the way in or out.  Very conveniently located by Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.  Close to St. James Park and Victoria underground stations.",5,2017,04,10
121,Perfect for Sightseeing,"Having stayed in a Taj hotel in Boston USA we knew it would be good.Its perfectly situated for sightseeing tucked away in a side street.The staff were all friendly and helpful,the room was spotless and had the most comfortable beds.The linen and pillows high quality.Beware of minibar costs and the water in room.Breakfast lovely.Drinks expensive and we were charged for bar nibbles.Hotel close to bus stops and it's easy to reach anywhere.Its quiet and we were woken with lovely birdsong.Would definitely stay again.Its cosy comfy and a lovely ambiance.",5,2017,04,10
121,great location,"The hotel is ideally situated in the walking distance to the major attractions and tree key subway stations. Our room was of good size, clean, and quiet.  The bed was very comfortable. I would stay in the hotel again.",5,2017,04,10
121,Great Location - Pretty Lobby,"The location within the Victoria neighborhood was very walkable to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben.  Also nearby the tube station.  The lobby is pretty, the rooms are decent sized, but a bit older construction.  Also, we were disappointed that they did not clean our room the first day.  We were out all day sightseeing, so they had ample time to come in.  When we returned late at night, we had to call for fresh towels.  The service manager came to our room stating the maid had checked off she cleaned our room, but we had to show her clearly it had not been cleaned. She told us to put the ""service sign"" on the door handle the next day when we leave to ensure it gets cleaned.  Breakfast is overpriced and not that good. Save money and walk down the street to get tea and pastries instead.",4,2017,04,10
121,Corporate Stay,"This is an excellent hotel for corporate travellers working nearby. We stayed here for 3 nights in April 2017 whilst working in Westminster, just around the corner. Location is convenient to Mayfair, Oxford St, Regent St, Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace and Westminster. Service is excellent and the hotel has a lot of character. Room service food is restaurant quality.",5,2017,04,09
121,Luxury at it's best,"me and my partner are luxury travellers living in London and we decided to try this gem 2 weeks ago, I did not forget to write a review as we just got back from our mini UK trip! Out of all the hotels we stayed in, I think this one tops it all off! It is absolutely beautiful as you walk inside bringing you a modern culture feel of India and it was as if I was in a different place other than London.. well done to the interior design! 
The service we received was spotless, everyone seemed to know exactly what they're doing and are fully knowledgeable.
We had the lamb for dinner in the restaurant with a bottle of your wine chosen by the kind waiter who served us that evening. 
All in all, we really loved it and will be coming back!",5,2017,04,08

121,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London","Simply put,  St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London was a beautiful experience.

121,A Great Week In London,"The perfect location for a business trip to central London.    Quiet rooms, and a well run hotel with attentive staff and comfortable rooms.

121,A hotel with character ..,"Stayed for two nights and had one and a half days of meetings in the hotel meeting room. 

Not your typical hotel ... it's a hotel with character. Luxurious and classy room, although it looked a bit ""aged"". But no complaints. Very convenient location. 

Very friendly staff.

121,Very poor wi-fi.,"First impressions were of a frosty receptionist who seemed stressed out. The room we had allocated was of a generally good standard. The rooms was comfortable and looked over the courtyard. I've also previously stayed in a room looking over the road and can honestly say that I'm undecided which is better.
On my previous stay last year I complained that the wifi signal was poor to non-existent. I was told that the hotel was aware of this and was making plans to resolve. I was told that the room had a dedicated LAN connection but this was useless as my device only runs on wifi. On my most recent stay (on another floor, in a different room) the wifi signal again was very poor, again (6 months after my last stay) I was told that this was being looked at. Therefore on both occasions I was unable to work in my room and have now decided to no longer stay at this hotel. It is unacceptable for a hotel of this status to have such poor wifi. I have stayed in budget hotels that have far superior wifi arrangements.",3,2017,04,05
121,Well situated for major attractions,"lassic double room was reasonable size (for London). Decent sized Bathroom altho we had a problem with water slow to drain from the shower). Very quiet overlooking the courtyard garden. Few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, 20 mins to Piccadilly or Trafalgar Square, 20 Minutes to the Tate Britain.
No 'freebies' in the room, even the bottled water is chargeable (£3.50) although this is not obvious. Breakfast very expensive - so we went to a cafe nearby.",4,2017,04,04
121,Great stay and surprisingly quiet,"I never look forward to staying in London as the hotels are invariably expensive, noisy and too darn hot/stuffy. The Taj is only expensive and has the temperature right and was very quiet so I got a really good few nights sleep away from home.

Internet was good, bed was comfortable and room well serviced. The downstairs bar is a bit small but given the space available it does well. Bar food is quite pricy but for a decent hotel in London its not too over the top - £12 for a tuna sandwich is a bit silly, but its a business stay.

Breakfast is a bit disorganised - unfortunately I only stayed once so the fun of trying to find things tucked away on alcoves and corners didnt need to be repeated and some of the staff language grasp of English wasnt nearly good enough - its not a good sign when one waiter has to ask the other what I mean and I'm a native speaker with no accent.

Good stay though - taxi rank 100 yards away if you dont want picking up at the doorstep and a place I will definitely use again.",4,2017,04,03
121,disappointingly old(fashioned) hotel with thin veneer,"totally old-fashioned hotel accommodation with very thin veneer of shotty updates: old carpeting in de corridors, broken chair seat, old plugs and phone (that do not work), old fashioned bathroom with taps that only half work, mini bar does not open ... really disappointing ! only salvation is that the staff is friendly and tries to do what they can, within what they are allowed. but room I ordered I did not get !! NEVER AGAIN !",2,2017,04,03
121,Very comfortable classic hotel,"I chose this hotel from the description on its homepage and if fully met my expectations. Very friendly staff, big comfortable room in a quite location. Piccadilly, and Oxford Street are in walking distance. This stay was for business but I will come back for private stay in the future.",5,2017,04,03
121,Great potential and fantastic location!,"Stayed at the St. James' Court for 5 days. Lots of positives, and some criticisms as well. First and foremost: location. This hotel is perfectly situated - a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and a 10 minute walk to Piccadilly. If you are taking the tube it is close to several stations. The lobby and courtyard are both beyond gorgeous, and there is often live music performed in the lobby during the evenings. I used the gym frequently, and it was well equipped. Great cardio equipment including a heavy bag. I treated myself to a massage on my final day, and that was great too. 

In terms of the negatives, they mostly revolve around the restoration of the hotel. It seems to be moving SLOWLY. When we exited the elevators, we could tell that the block of rooms over on the left looked more recently renovated than those down the right hand hallway. Even the rugs and paint looked different. Unfortunately, our room was down on the right. Our room showed this assumption to be true: very worn rugs and chipping paint. This did not disrupt my stay, but it is important to note that many of the promotional photos may differ from the actual aesthetics of your room. Maybe this is a factor in Europe, but all cups and mugs were pewter and glass rather than anything sealed in plastic. I generally prefer the wrapped plastic cups to ensure they are sanitary. When our room was serviced we also did not receive any new mugs or cups - existing cups were simply replaced to their original locations. 

Overall, this was a good home base for my time in London. I'm not sure if I would stay again next time I'm in town - while the rate was competitive, the uncertainty over how the room would look would probably incentivize me to risk it at a property where I have a chance of being upgraded.",3,2017,04,02
121,Beautiful Stay,"Absolutely loved The Taj. The hotel is just gorgeous, the staff was extremely elegant and kind. The location was superb.... Within a quick walk to the Buckingham Palace made catching the Change of the Guards super easy. Quilon and Zander were phenomenal and Bombay Brassiere, Quilon's sister restaurant, is a must see/taste. This is a spot I would return to within a heart beat.",4,2017,04,02
121,Very convenient ,"St. James'Court, centrally located within 5 min walk from couple of subway station and surrounded by iconic landmarks like Buckingham palace, Churchill's war museum is a short 10 min walk from the parliament and Westminster Abbey. The building reminds you of colonial times, having the majestic appearance of a maharajah's palace. 
The rooms are rather large for London, and are clean and updated with all the modern necessities. The staff is professional and very helpful. Within the hotel there are several bars and restaurants, one of them ,""Quillon"" being a Michelin star restaurant. So for the first time in London traveler, I do recommend St. James Court, which will combine convenience with luxury at a relatively decent price. ",4,2017,04,02
121,Great break,"We booked our room at St James court The Taj for a weekend away sightseeing combined with trip to the theatre. I was travelling with my 9 year old son. The hotel is in a great location minutes from the tube station. When we arrived my son was warmly greeted and received a Kids at the Taj bag, he particularly liked being given his own Guest card to complete. I also requested a kids dressing gown in the room which was in place when we arrived.
We are current guests at the hotel and have just received a complementary cookie with his name on and hot chocolate. If your children are happy so are parents!
Great size room with bath, which is very rare in London. Room very clean with comfortable beds. Breakfast was busy but fresh and plenty of choice. Great service from Yohonnes at breakfast he deserves a custom service award. Overall a great stay and choice for the money we paid for our break. We would return. ",5,2017,04,01

It's location is a stone's throw to Buckingham Palace and walking distance to Westminster Abby and other important landmarks. The underground station is also close by.

121,Excellent hotel,"We have stayed here twice already (my mum treats me for my birthday every year) and are coming back again next weekend (we cant wait)! It is an excellent hotel within a fantastic location. You can easily walk to most of the London tourist attractions. The rooms are decorated and equipped to a great standard and are very comfortable. We have always found the hotel very quiet at night for sleeping, this helps when you have a toddler with you. Breakfast had a great variety of food and the Indian extras were fab. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Overall it is a great experience staying here and I would definitely recommend.",5,2017,03,31

121,Stay at London's Saint James Court Hotel,"Service, accommodations, location and food were all excellent.  The hotel helped us make a very memorable vacation. our stay (my wife and  I and our son and daughter-in-law) was for 7 nights.  We couldn't have asked for anything more!",5,2017,03,28

My fiance and I decided to spend our last weekend in London being in the Central area and even though we are not the most fashionable, I feel like we still dressed better than usual . Since my fiance wasn't wearing a suit and I wasn't wearing pearls, we were ignored by most of the staff whereas the other guests who looked like they were made of money (I mean it is a very posh hotel) were being greeted like their farts turn regular objects into gold.",3,2017,03,27

It is in walking distance to many sites and the tube is right there for further sites.   The staff is very friendly and helpful, made dinner reservations for us and answered any questions we had.

The staff are professional, friendly and attentive to all your needs. Nothing seems to be too much trouble.
The rooms are quiet, spacious and clean with a huge great comfortable bed.

121,Weekend in London,"A perfectly pleasant two night stay in London. The hotel is in a good, albeit rather soulless location (near the Wellington Barracks and the Ministry of Justice), however there are a number of redeeming features. The Edwardian architecture of the building is lovely, the interior is well-appointed, the room was quiet on the weekend - thankfully (a building is being erected behind the hotel, so there was a lot of noise on Friday afternoon). The furniture in the room is a little tired (faux-classic and rather damaged), and the bed far too soft for my liking. The bedlinen however, is lovely, and attention to detail very good. I didn't have a chance to eat at the hotel this time, but will do in the future.",4,2017,03,22
121,Excellent stay and close to underground,"Very good hotel, facilities are excellent and helpful staff. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice. The hotel is central and close to underground stations so easy to get to.  The hotel is in good condition  and well maintained. Worth staying at for business or pleasure",5,2017,03,22
121,Great Place for Visitors,"If you going to London for the first time, this hotel is so centrally located, you can walk to a lot of the most visited sites in town. We did not use public transportation until our 3rd day due to this. The hotel is very nice, has a great feel and wonderful staff. I didn't open a door to leave to come in or hail a taxi with the staff there. The concierge took care of our needs, including mailing post cards out for us. The only with the concierge was their accents as we are from the US. Bank restrarant was great. Overall great experience.",5,2017,03,21
121,2 or 3 star quality hotel.,"This was supposed to be an anniversary present for my wife, nice hotel and show. The room didn't look anything like the one shown on Booking.com it was a lot smaller. The bathroom was very small, probably the smallest I have ever uncounted, nowhere to put toiletries. There was no mirror over the dressing table, just a mirror near the room door with no power socket, so my wife had nowhere to do her hair. The tea and coffee was in the wardrobe on a tray with no power, so had to find somewhere to place with a socket, of which there was only one available on the dressing table, now no space on dressing table. On check out the person on reception was not interested, no smile and didn't even ask if everything had been OK. Very poor. I have stayed in may hotels in my time all over the world and this one has to rank as one of the worst for the price paid. We would have been better off staying in the Premier Inn down the road, bigger room, bigger bathroom and a good sized dressing table with mirror and tea & coffee available. Will be staying somewhere else on next visit to London and not recommending this hotel.",2,2017,03,21
121,St James Court Hotel,"Excellent location, great staff, old systems that need replacement, especially the heating and air conditioning systems.  Get breakfast with your package, it was excellent and very expensive a la carte.  Have the staff male all your reservations, they are excellent.",4,2017,03,21
121,Amazingly kind!!!!,"This hotel was wonderful and pretty reasonably priced for being right in the middle of London, walking distance to everything touristy. We were greeted by a very kind doorman who jumped into action when he saw I had a sleeping child in my arms, before I even had the chance to grab luggage he grabbed it for me. The room was very well appointed, and the room service was delicious. Try the afternoon tea it is a must experience after a long morning of walking around. They are very family friendly, even given my youngest a backpack filled with goodies. They even arranged a vey reasonably priced private car to take us Cambridge and the countryside. This was one of the absolute best hotel experiences I have ever had.",5,2017,03,20
121,Excellent stay,"We had an excellent stay at the hotel, having that all personnel was extremely nice and helpful.  A plus to the attention given to our daughter at arrival, and also during the stay. I would definitely recommend the hotel.",5,2017,03,20
121,Customer oriented personal ,"My husband and I love this hotel, very well located, nice service and customer oriented personal. Rooms are clear and some of them with a very good view of their garden in the center of the building. I strongly recommend it. ",4,2017,03,20
121,"Location, location, location.","The Taj St. James Court Hotel on 54 Buckingham Gate street, is a beautiful hotel. It is very easily accessible from Heathrow airport. The Heathrow Express brings you to  Paddington Station in 15 minutes.  From there it is a short taxi ride to the hotel. 

Location is one of the biggest draws to this hotel. It is located steps away from Buckingham palace and a short and medium walk from several of the great sights of London like Hyde Park, Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens Harrods etc.  It is a short walk to the nearest Tube station, the St James Park station from where you can pretty much get connections to anywhere in London and beyond.  You can even purchase your Oyster card at the convenience store next to the hotel. There are several pubs, restaurants, coffee shops and the lovely Pret Manger (love their sandwiches) within minutes of the hotel.

Having stayed in Taj hotels all over India and being members of the Taj Inner Circle, we have tasted and savored the Taj hospitality for several years.  This hotel for the most part did not disappoint. The moment you arrive the hotel staff take over - from the door man to the concierge to the front desk. We had arrived early and they were very accommodating about getting us a room ASAP.  After a long international flight the first thing you want to do is get to your room.  Kudos to the front desk team who were updating us about our room status periodically.

Our Junior Suite was lovely. It had a spacious sitting area with coffee/tea service, desk, comfy couches...  The bedroom was very roomy with two large windows and great lighting.  The best part of the bedroom was being awakened every morning by birds chirping out in the courtyard. There was a small dressing area and a bathroom that had a hot towel rack - warm towels on a cold day is simply divine!  The bed was amazing, soft sheets and luxurious pillows  - you just sank into bliss!   One caution about the bathroom, the tub was a deep one so getting in and out of the tub one had to be a little careful.  

The evening scene in the lobby was a lively one with happy guests mulling around and a wonderful piano player in the background.  We had fun sipping our drinks and watching the folks.  It was so nice to hear several languages being spoken, some we recognized and others we did not.  This is why we come back to London again and again because it is truly an international city.

My only peeve about this hotel was the breakfast scene.  We had breakfast at the hotel on three mornings and all three of them were stressful.  One of the major joys of vacationing is coming down to breakfast and enjoying your eggs and toast in a leisurely manner.  Here it was not possible.  The breakfast area is cramped, the tables are too close to each other which made it very hard to get in and out of your chair.  The wait staff seemed a little confused. We would wait for almost 10 minutes before anyone came over to take our order for coffee/tea.  The breakfast spread itself was adequate and at the rate they charged per person it was a shame.  

I recommend this hotel highly and will certainly stay here the next time we are in London.  

And last but not least, any hotel is only as good as its staff. I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Binoy Nair, the Head Concierge.  He was very informative (recommended great restaurants and sights), attentive (listened carefully to our questions) and always smiling.  Thank you, Mr Nair.",4,2017,03,19
121,Overnight stay in London,"Stayed here last night for our 30th wedding anniversary. Lovely welcome and all extremely comfortable. Some furniture, particularly in the breakfast area was very worn and tatty. Breakfast was also just ok for me considering the price. ",4,2017,03,19

Because our room wasn't ready when we arrived we were immediately upgraded to a suite, which was gorgeous and most appreciated. The hotel itself is a stunning building with decor and ambience to match A special mention must go to concierge and to the doorman for impeccable service. The hotel is a great location for theatre, Westminster and other tourist hot spots. We will definitely stay again. ",4,2017,03,18
121,A hotel in a class of it's own,"Simply exquisite hotel.  Centrally located. Attention to detail superb. Wonderful facilities and excellent staff. An oasis of calm. Breakfast beautifully presented. Wonderfully quiet rooms, overlooking lush courtyard. A slice of heaven.",5,2017,03,18
121,Very good stay,"Rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. Service was good. Breakfast menu was quite wide and all tasty and freshly made. 
Only issue was a noise possibly form a pipe somewhere which however did not alter sleep anyway.",4,2017,03,18
121,Wonderful Hotel,We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. All the staff we dealt with were extremely helpful and charming. The room was lovely and big for a London hotel. A very quiet but central location and excellent service. Perfect,5,2017,03,18
121,Mother Daughter holiday,"My 9 year old daughter and I stayed at the St. James Court Hotel for a week this March. We loved the hotel! The staff is outstanding - everyone from the doorman, concierge, reception people, waitstaff... scored an A+ for superb service and lovely, friendly demeanors. We felt so welcomed each time we returned to the hotel and we were greeted by at least 4 people : )
Our room was large, I think it was an executive double, and the bathroom was really first class, spacious and well appointed. We had the buffet breakfast at the hotel each morning which was good, but... perhaps some smoked fish would be nice?
The location of the hotel absolutely can't be beat - we couldn't have chosen better!",5,2017,03,17
121,Common Rooms Galore,"Our room was sizeable (king bed) and very comfortable.  Good closet space, mini fridge, desk, lots of places to charge things. The bathroom was nice but you had to literally turn sideways to get past the sink to the loo and the shower.  Otherwise, nice large soaking tub and housekeeping excellent. The lobby, restaurants, outdoor space is amazing!  Lovely, comfortable, and never too crowded.  Good location to walk to St James's Park tube station (0.2 miles) and to Victoria Station (0.4 miles).  Safe area, food cafes, always a cab available!  Staff is very accomodating.",4,2017,03,17
121,"Wonderful hotel, great location and terrific staff.","The hotel is close to a Tube stop and that makes it especially convenient. It is located in a very nice area, close to embassies and other business. The staff was fantastic and went out of their way to assist me.",5,2017,03,17
121,100% recommendable,"A hotel that makes you feel very good, with excellent staff, quality in service. Not only has it a very good location, it is close to the emblematic Buckingham Palace, next to the St. James metro, very close to everything! You will really find a hotel of excellence, from the entrance to your room.

121,A most relaxing stay,On arrival we were greeted by a very polite friendly member of the reception team.  We had arrived very early and it was no trouble to take out bags.  We enjoyed a day in London and coming back to the hotel we were given our room key and our bags had already been delivered to the room.  We were impressed by the level of service in general in the hotel.,4,2017,03,14
121,Luxury at the heart of London,"I stayed for 7 nights about two week ago. the hotel is located within walking distance to Buckingham Place and also close enough to walk to the Westimester Abbey. The room was luxurious and the staff were very attentive. they were friendly and ensured that you had everything you needed to enjoy your stay. yet, they were discreet and gave you space when you needed it. the room was wonderfully designed and the hotel had so much finess about it that it hardly felt that you were in a hotel.",4,2017,03,14
121,Loved staying here,"I loved this hotel. The staff was very friendly, great and clean rooms, and the breakfast was amazing. With just a couple minutes walk to both bus stop and Buckingham Palace, the location was also very convenient. Will book this hotel again next time.",5,2017,03,13
121,Stunning,The staff were absolutely brilliant. Very welcoming and friendly. The double room we had was stunning and the hotel in general was beautiful. We wish we could have stayed longer. We will be 100% coming back and staying here again.,5,2017,03,13
121,Absolute perfection,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Everything, from the staff to the accommodation to the food to the amenities, were above and beyond. I visited for a couple weeks in the summer with my extended family and the staff really went out of their way to make sure it was a wonderful vacation for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the stocked essentials in the kitchen and the complimentary happy hour each night. Would recommend 10/10",5,2017,03,13
121,Excellent stay,"Friendly staff and hotel with excellent location in central London, very close to Victoria station. Breakfast was abundant and perfectly cooked. The room was clean and confortable and all our stay was very pleasant and we'll be happy to return soon.",5,2017,03,13
121,Superb location and highly rated room,The excellent location of St James's Court manages to cater equally for business and leisure. We have stayed here three times now and always allocated an excellent room with good amenities. Only eaten in 'Bank' on one occasion but rated the food highly. One criticism would be the price of breakfast!,4,2017,03,13
121,Smiles and more,"Having tried a wide cross-section of hotels in London I have now settled on this for a combination of factors. Good rooms, great location, good value and excellent service is a bouquet hard to find in Central London but this hotel manages it well. The service is particularly to be mentioned, and the Taj Group must be complimented for being able to replicate their hospitality ethos in London too. Definitely recommended when in London.",4,2017,03,13
121,Birthday celebration,"We visited London this weekend to celebrate my birthday. Our hotel stay was fantastic, the room was beautiful and clean, the bed was comfy and the staff were friendly. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in this area in London.",5,2017,03,12
121,Great stay in London,"Enjoyed our 4 night stay.  Able to walk from St. James station to hotel within 5 min.  Hotel in quiet area but central to all sights. Two minutes to Buckingham Palace, 15 min. to Big Ben and Thames. Rooms clean and comfortable, great ambiance. Friendly welcome from staff (especially Diego the bellman) Helpful recommendations for sightseeing.  Piano player every night  in lobby bar made a nice relaxing place for a drink and a bite to eat after a long day of sightseeing.",5,2017,03,12
121,Superlative,"The St James' Court Taj Hotel in London provided us with a home away from home. The lobby is gracious and welcoming. The room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast is scrumptious and provide  both quantity and quality. The staff is, without exception, knowledgeable, friendly, and thoughtful. This hotel set the stage for a beautiful experience in an exciting city.",5,2017,03,12

Staff great!!!!

121,Always a great experience,"This was my 3rd or 4th stay at St. James Court in London and as always, it did not disappoint. I stayed here from 26 Feb - 3 Mar and although I booked at short notice, I got a great non-refundable (without breakfast) rate of GBP 176.25, wonderful for this centrally located Taj property. As always, the service and ambience is great, Indian Food is wonderful, and for me, access to 3 parks for morning walks (St. James Park, Hyde Park and Green Park) was most satisfying (despite the morning chill this week). The fact that you are 100-200 metres from Buckingham Palace and walk by the icon every day is energising. If you can get <GBP 200 prices, it is always a steal!",5,2017,03,12
121,"Wonderful Property, Location, and Amenities - but the best part is the People who work there!","Just got back from spending five nights at the St. James Court Hotel. My family and I simply cannot say enough good things about our stay. The hotel location is excellent and our 6th floor rooms (adjoining executive king room and family room with sitting area) were perfect for our family of 5 . . . large, quiet, completely updated, and sparkling clean. The breakfast buffet (included in our rate) was generous, delicious and served in a room surrounded by floor to ceiling windows in the middle of the gorgeous and colorful hotel courtyard. With interesting guests from all over the world the hotel has a very cosmopolitan feel which adds to the richness of the experience. In the end, though, what made the St. James Court truly special for us were the many, many members of the hotel's management and staff who routinely went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and that they met all of our needs. This includes, but is not limited to: surprising us with two delicious and beautiful chocolate mousse cakes in celebration of my wife's birthday, being extra diligent in taking my son's food allergies into consideration and making sure that my son had plenty of safe choices (some specially prepared for us), sending first aid personnel and numerous ice packs to my room when they heard that I was injured aboard a tour bus, and then sending a bowl of fresh fruit to cheer me up and checking in on how I was feeling. I would highly recommend the St. James Court hotel to anyone planning to visit London. ",5,2017,03,11
121,A true gem of a hotel,The wife and I recently stayed 4 nights at this hotel in a executive king room. The Hotel's staff was very attentive and the location and price can not be beat in London. We were 600 yards from Buckingham Palace and a quarter of a mile from Westminster. This will be our hotel of choice on all our future trips to London.,5,2017,03,10
121,Review,Hotel was good but room was not ready when arrived at 18:00. Room was upgrade to suit room but difficult to wait after travelling 7 hours. staff was good. not much choice for food in bar. Breakfast was perfect,4,2017,03,09
121,Favorite Hotel in London,"For me this is the only place to stay in London - excellent service, excellent room, excellent location...treat yourself to the St. James Court.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  And you cannot beat being 200 meters from the Palace and Green Park.",5,2017,03,08
121,"Perfect ""Home Base"" For Family Vacation","We stayed at the St. James' Court for six nights during February school break and couldn't be happier with our decision!  We traveled with our three children (ages 9, 11 and 16) and their grandmother, and everyone loved their stay.  We had a regular room (for me, my husband and 11 year old son) and a junior suite (shared by our daughters and their grandmother).  The suite gave provided and additional area to gather and also eat on those nights some didn't feel like going out to dinner and preferred to get something from a nearby shop.  The hotel was the perfect place to begin our site-seeing each morning and to return at the end of the day.  It is centrally located and an easy walk to Westminster, Buckingham Palace and the tube.  We loved the mix of the building's classic charm and the hotel's modern amenities.  Breakfast, in particular, was a treat each morning.  We very much appreciate the special care the staff took with our daughters, who are both gluten free (Celiac), ensuring they received GF food directly from the kitchen and taking precautions to limit the chances of cross-contamination.  We also enjoyed the hotel's bars a few nights after the kids were in tucked in bed.  We're looking forward to our next trip to London and St. James' Court will be our first choice - whether traveling with family or as a couple.",5,2017,03,07
121,Convenient Location to Metro,Great Location. Fabulous service. Warm staff. Looking forward to my next visit to London St. James Court. I strongly recommend this hotel. It's the first time I stayed in a hotel in London always stayed in a serviced apartment & will probably never stay at any other venue.,4,2017,03,05
121,Great stay in London,"Perfect location for our stay in London.  It was a few minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, a couple of pubs/restaurants, the underground and the Hop on/Hop off bus stop.  We also were able to walk to Westminster Abbey, the Churchill War Museums, and Big Ben. We chose this hotel for the location and it didn't disappoint.  Staff and room were wonderful.",5,2017,03,05
121,Wonderful hotel,"This was my third stay at the wonderful St. James Court Hotel situated conveniently in the St. James district of central London.  All the staff are highly trained, friendly and efficient and make you feel really welcome and comfortable at all times.   I have stayed at other London hotels on previous visits but none can compare with the St. James Court Hotel for their truly excellent service and care.",5,2017,03,05
121,Tranquility in the city,"I have stayed here twice now and I have not been disappointed. The bed is comfy, the bathroom is spacious and the living area is also very spacious.

The noise from outside is non-existent within the hotel. It is probably the only hotel in the U.K. where I get a good night's sleep without any disturbance.

It was lovely to put on a robe and slippers after a late flight back to the UK.

All in all, a lovely romantic place to stay and relax in a busy city.",4,2017,03,05
121,Great location and very quiet,"I stay in London frequently and I very rarely deviate from my tried and trusted hotels, but on this occasion I wanted to stay near Victoria and got a great deal on the A Taj, so took a chance. 

I was impressed by the location and frontage...although disappointed that the reception service was flustered and not at all organised. 

Despite checking in after the 2pm check in time, they were struggling to locate a room for which I'd prepaid. After a lengthy wait and no offer of refreshment, they finally found me a room on the 6th floor. I wasn't directed to the lifts and had to ask another member of staff for directions. Clearly I wasn't quite important enough! 

The hotel is very glossy but it really feels like style over content, as I didn't receive the level of service I would've expected from such an establishment.  

The room was fine and large enough, if a little dated, however the bathroom really needed refurbishing. I noticed that some wings were being refurbished so maybe this is part of the overall plan?

On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the room very quiet, so I did have a very slumberful sleep. 

Location and peacefulness won it over, but I really wasn't wowed by the service. 

Treating every paying customer equally might go a long way here; I might be on business but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't return on leisure if I felt like  a valued guest. ",4,2017,03,03
121,"Great location, wonderful premises, excellent service","It's a beautiful hotel with a wonderful courtyard. I had a feeling being in paradise after very noisy streets of London centre. My room was overlooking this courtyard and didn't here any noise. Room service is excellent thanks to a wonderful girl Vlada, front desk staff is more than friendly, breakfast is good.Rooms have to have sone updates i believe but it's for sure wonderful place to stay in London. All major hystorical monuments and parks of Westmister are in 5-10 minutes walking",5,2017,03,03
121,Service was a let down,"I found the service at this hotel sub-standard. The reception staff I have encountered unfortunately let their colleagues and this highly regarded brand down. The interior design, location and room was good. Since we are spoilt for choice in London I will certainly consider a different hotel in future. In this class especially one expects professional, helpful and friendly staff.",4,2017,03,02
121,A London Gem,"I stayed at St. James Court in February of 2017.  I went with a friend for a ""girls weekend.""  We were so please with the décor, service, room, and breakfast.  Everything was really wonderful.  The location can't be beat!  So close to Buckingham Place, Westminister Abbey, Big Ben, etc.  Our room was nice and big!  Especially for two girls getting ready to go out every night.  Each night we would have a night cap at the hotel bar -- so much fun!  I highly recommend the St. James Court if you are visiting London for either business or pleasure.",5,2017,03,01
121,Looking Forward to Returning !,Very enjoyable stay from the initial warm welcome to the fast and efficient check-out. Great location. Friendly and efficient staff. Room facilities and bathroom of very high standard. No hesitation in recommending. Looking Forward to Returning !,5,2017,03,01
121,Wonderful stay,"Our stay included a lovely British Pullman trip to Bath on the Saturday, a Xmas present from our children, a one off experience not to be missed.  Our other 3 days were extremely pleasant from our room service breakfasts to our excellent dinner in the adjoining Bank Westminster Restaurant. Location was brilliant for Victoria Station and sightseeing in general.  Would definitely return as no complaints at all.",5,2017,02,28
121,Very classy hotel,Lovely classic hotel in great location. Staff were excellent and well trained and extremely helpful and the facilities were very good.  Loved the ambience and the classy lounge and bar area. Thoroughly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,02,28
121,The only disappointment of the trip,"I have lived in the area for years so when visiting this time after moving decided to book this Hotel that Looks great from the outside - nice valet and doormen, Grand entrance, classy style and cozy reception. 
That'a about all nice things I can say about this Hotel... Really disappointed.

It started from the check-in: we stayed 2 nights and the receptionist tried to block 500 Pounds on the card for the Minibar without asking. And the room was already paid for. I understand sometimes it is the hotel's policy, but in this case it was just totally unnecessary and we had to stop her, good that we noticed.
The she tried to force us to upgrade the room.. Most of the Hotels upgrade the room, if at all, free of Charge or when offered to upgrade they give you the Price straight away.. We might have upgraded but she startled us with the question and the room wasnt cheap already so we said no. Unfortunately.

Then we went to the room. Took us 10mins Walking every time we went to the room or back. It was located very remotely, 15 smelly corridors and weird Little stairs away. I know old british buildings are like this but very poor choice of room for us and layout of the Hotel. 

The room was a disaster - very old bathroom, whoch didn't seem too clean. Tiny as well, you couldnt fit two People there, bathtub, toilet and sink are very old and very closely situated.
Tiniest TV I've seen in a Hotel, room very old, without any design, Need I say no toilettries (was surprised to find Slippers there), maybe 10 sq.m. Maximum, most probably less. 

Luckily we didn't have to spend a lot of time there, just sleep, but when we felt like chilling we had to go to a friend's place or outside. Anywhere but there really. 

If you are looking at Hotels in that area... Well, don't choose this one.",2,2017,02,28
121,good experience,"the stay at the hotel was good and satisfying, the rooms clean, and nice. there was a little bit noise from the street, but the rooms are confortable. the treatment from the staff was very kind and efficient",3,2017,02,28
121,"St. James Court', A Taj Hotel","Excellent location in Westminster in the centre of London, just 10min by walk from Big Ben and 3min from Buckingham Palace. Clean hotel with very polite and pleasent staff. I would recommend it, especially if you're in London for business purpose.",4,2017,02,27
121,"Gorgeous hotel, brilliant location ",I stayed here for 1 night with my husband whilst visiting London.  Location  it was ideal. Tube was a few mins walk away. Upon arrival we asked for an early check in but they didn't have a room.  This was OK so we were told to come back at noon. Which we did and we had a room ready. The hotel is 5mins from Buckingham Palace which is ideal for sightseeing. Lovely cafe across the road if you want a coffee and cake. We visited the apollo theatre to see wicked which was just 1 tube stop away. We didn't use facilities at the hotel or eat in the hotel as we had other plans . The bed was soooooo comfortable.  The shower was not brilliant but ok. The room was ideal for what we used it for. Good facilties and free shampoo and condition etc. Overall a great hotel. Lovely smiley staff. Perfect decor.  For the price paid for a central London location I think it was well worth it.  I would definitely return. ,5,2017,02,26
121,"Good hotel, quiet location","The hotel, we found, was quite tricky to find in the first instance, having got lost in Victoria station due to its many exits!! After negotiating the Westminster streets late at night, we finally arrived at the hotel. Check in was seamless and no hard sell for the breakfast (£22 each! No thanks!) room was small (double room) but met our needs and was extremely clean. A nice touch were the chocolates on the bed. There are roadworks going on just to the left of the hotel but as we were at the back of the hotel this wasn't too much of a bother. Having stayed closer to Covent Square/Drury Lane on previous visits, this hotel was very quiet in comparison. Would recommend for people who want to see Buckingham Palace, the Mall etc as they are easily in walking distance. ",4,2017,02,25
121,Oasis Near Buckingham Palace,"This hotel is beautifully located with a wonderful internal courtyard, good fitness facility and an extremely helpful staff.  The breakfast buffet is ample with traditional Indian fare as well as more traditional English breakfast.",4,2017,02,24
121,What a lovely hotel!  Luxury and serenity in the heart of London,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here; staff were welcoming and friendly.  The location is amazing, rooms well-equipped and there is a good selection of bars and restaurants to choose from within the hotel.  We enjoyed a good few cocktails in the cocktail bar!  It was my birthday and the hotel surprised me with a piece of cake and a 'happy birthday' message delivered to our hotel room.  We had a really happy, romantic and relaxed stay at the hotel.  Just lovely.",5,2017,02,24
121,beautiful!!,"amazing hotel in the heart of the city! lovely staff, wonderful facilities, lovely cocktails. I wish I could have shared this experience with my partner, but over all it was fantastic. Really loved the gym/spa area, which I could have gone more than 1.5 times. Walking distance from every where necessary. Good restaurants around, and overall fantastic service.",5,2017,02,23
121,Great Hotel Stay in London,"The hotel was very nice with very nice, attentive staff. The location was great for walking to see most of the major sights like Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Big Ben, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. The hotel is also located very close to St James tube station.",5,2017,02,22
121,Friendly staff and good location,Good location just 10 minutes walk to Victoria Main line station and 3 minutes walk to St James underground station.   Booked a classic double room - 4th floor.  Room was clean and well appointed however the view was non existent.  Dined in adjacent Bank restaurant.  Would recommend.,4,2017,02,22
121,Good experience,"Excellent staff, hotel very clean and beds perfect for a restful sleep. Restuarants very good food, wine a little pricy. Breakfast selection very good. Taxi rank just across the street but easy walking distance  to Victoria Underground. Not a lot of traffic comes by, so noise level is low. Coffee shop across the road if you want to do that. Would I stay again, yes for sure.",4,2017,02,21
121,Quality Hotel  & Staff.,"The hotel staff were all warm friendly and welcoming,our room was comfortable clean and quiet, although the view out of the windows could have been better.  The hotel itself was very smart ,very clean and clutter free.   And situated in a nice part of London.",5,2017,02,21

very well organised , staff very friendly and helpfull .
room was clean and spacious.
Bogdan on The Hamptons was very helpful and professional attending.",5,2017,02,21
121,Construction works avoid!,Understanding all hotels have to maintain a high level of comfort which involves constant improvements but when this involves very high cellulose odours  passing throughout the main reception causing short of breath and stinging in our eyes it is not acceptable.,2,2017,02,21
121,Pleasant Experience ,"Very nice hotel overall!
Staff were very polite and helpful. Lovely view of the courtyard from our hotel room. Breakfast included was very good and staff were very efficient with their service.
Only critique I have would be the quality of the room, the walls were a bit damaged and could have easily been fixed. 
Happy to stay here again though simply because of the welcoming staff!",4,2017,02,21
121,"Grand lobby, tiny room, shabby customer orientation","Arrived at 8pm on a business trip and had booked an ""Executive room"". Normally I stay at Marriott Hotels but wanted to give Taj a try.

Nice welcome by a porter, helping with my luggage.
Grand lobby with piano music, good first impression.

Got a room on 7th. Floor and had a really bad surprise. Instead of ""executive"" a tiny chamber.
Nice furniture and bathroom, but not at all the size as announced on Taj's webpage, thought this must be a mistake.

Back to the lobby to ask, if I really got an ""Executive room"". Got the explanation that ""this is normal in an old building, that some rooms are smaller"".
Fine, but smaller than promised on the webpage????

Then the lady disappeared to ""discuss with her manager"". This took some looooong time.
Result: no room change but the offer to pay 75 pounds extra for a Junior suite.
What???????

Back to the room, steaming hot. Calling downstairs to ask for a technician. As nobody showed up for 40 minutes I checked the a/c control out in further 30 minutes.

Ok, was a nice try, nice public rooms but lack of service and customer orientation. This will remain my only try.
",2,2017,02,21
121,A lovely hotel in a perfect location,"I cannot understand how anyone could give this hotel a negative review. It is absolutely lovely. From the minute I arrived until the moment I left, the service was impeccable and the accommodations of the upmost comfort. 

The location is very central. It is just a five minute walk from the st James park tube station, but on a quiet street only steps from buckingham palace and a short walk to Westminster abbey, parliament, st James park and many shops and restaurants. It is the perfect location from which to see London. 

It has a lovely courtyard that is even appreciated in winter. The lighting in the evenings is enchanting. There are so many restaurants from which to choose, both at the hotel and close by. Breakfast was not included with my stay, but there were good options within a two minute walk for a quick breakfast. 

I loved the fitness facilities. Some of the best I have used at a hotel and I always visit the fitness centre. While I didn't use them, there was even a sauna and steam room, as well as classes offered. 

The room was very comfortable. I booked just the double, so it wasn't large, but much larger than others I have stayed in in London. It had every amenity you could wish for and offfers to supply any you had forgotten. It was so quiet, which is important when traveling and jet-lagged. 

I will absolutely return here on my next visit to London.",5,2017,02,20
121,"I am speechless, this Hotel was a great experience!!!!!!","OMG, this hotel had the best rooms, best staff, and best restaurants!  Binoy Nair, the head concierge, and all of the concierges and front desk staff are of the highest caliber!  We were treated unbelievably as royalty!!!  Would I stay again?  of course, thank you, my new family!!! Dolsie and Ralph",5,2017,02,19
121,Very nice but current renovations could disrupt your stay (planned through 3/15/2017),"The building was beautiful and the staff friendly and effective. The room i stayed in had some sort of on demand water heater which made a loud noise when you used any hot water heater. I felt like a bad neighbor on the days when I started very early.
 
Temporary note: I was in room 703 and for some reason the fumes from the renovation work on the 1st floor restaurant made their way into the room multiple times. The management moved me to a new room far away from the lifts and the fumes went away. The renovation is intended to run through 15/3/2017 so be careful about what room you get through this date.",4,2017,02,19
121,Amazing,"I have stayed in a fair share of hotels but this has by far been the best hotel til date. I've never left a review for any other hotels but I can't not leave one for this hotel, was honestly very impressed by the standard. 

Staff was very helpfu and friendly. Room was nice and spacious. My girlfriend organised a little surprise for my by having the room decorated with rose petal as it was Valentines day and it was amazing. 

Thank you all for a wonderful experience.

p.s if you do happen to stay here, i definately recommend one of the nearby restaurant Quilon, very delicious food and worth the money. 

Thank you again!",5,2017,02,18
121,Amazing Luxury in and excellent location,"London for business and extended my stay to explore.  Stayed at this wonderful hotel. Found an excellent deal on their website for an executive room with breakfast and also a 25 LST voucher per day - the front desk didnt even know about it lol (25lst was two free drinks at their bar per day).

Concierge staff was excellent as well booking things etc.  Rooms very large for London and very comfortable.  Close to all the history of Westminster.  Great buffet breakfast.",5,2017,02,18
121,Top class service makes up for its somewhat tired appearance,"Not only is this close to Buckingham Palace, but it's walking distance to Victoria Street which is fast becoming a street of many modern steel and glass buildings (Google is there) with many good quality retail and food options. 

The lobby has a classic English ambiance and is welcoming. Check in and out at Reception is handled efficiently and warmly. The lobby and bar which are closely located to Reception are cosy

I occupied the Classic Junior Suite which was quaint and had a cosy and comfortable bedroom and dressing area and spacious bathroom. The living area is small and the desk and chair are too tightly squeezed in and probably requires a rethink to make it more comfortable 

I was very impressed with the housekeeping staff who were prepared to accept a few items of laundry to was in house overnight. Many other hotels would have just rejected my request. 

I dined at the nearby Quilon, a 1 star Michelin Indian restaurant. The food was good to average and the service was outstanding. 

I would quickly recommend this hotel if you need t0 be located in this part of London.

121,Great place to stay.,"Beautiful hotel, the staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Upgraded room when arrived from a Classic Double to a Classic King for £50.00 a night. This was due to being able to have a smoking room. Room was clean and a nice size. Lovely view of the courtyard. Breakfast was lovely, delivered to room and set up for us. Had a meal at The Hamptons Bar, food was good, quiet so able to have a conversation without shouting. Staff were friendly throughout. Easy access from hotel to undergrounds and within walking distance of the Apollo Victoria Theatre. All in all a fabulous stay, staff couldn't do enough to help.",5,2017,02,17

121,Very grand and exclusive hotel although dated,Very beautiful with gorgeoues court yard! feels very glamorous in lobby although the rooms are  a little bit dated and feel like they have been left out from makeover. Wall paper peeling etc.. Could do with room revamp and would be an amazong place to be in and sleep too.,4,2017,02,16
121,Wonderful holiday,"Great hotel, very good location, friendly staff.The hotel is close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster abbadon, Big Ben.

They had a wellness centre we didn't use.we were given free upgrade on arrival so very pleasing.

121,"Lovely hotel, great staff","We stayed here for two nights, great hotel, lovely architecture.only minus point in the room was there was no separate shower. Breakfast excellent with a couple of Indian dishes. Would stay here again. Recommended!",5,2017,02,15
121,Real Satisfied,"Everything excellent, not only good location, but also the breakfast, the bar, the confortable room and the service, the equipment etc.  I have stayed hrer for five days, if possible I would like to stay in the hotel next triip...",5,2017,02,14
121,Great hotel in a good location,"I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good hotel in London.  We found the location was great for getting around London but its also fairly quiet around it so had a good nights sleep.  Staff are professional and personable too, what more could you ask for.",5,2017,02,14
121,Great Hotel,Great staff and great decor. Fantastic location. beds were a little small to share so book a bigger bed if possible. Staff are very helpful food great. Rooms are great tea making and dressing gowns. Tv great stayed here withe girls and. Reception had beautiful furniture.,5,2017,02,14
121,Location perfect.,"Less than a 10 min walk from Victoria station, easy to find. Well appointed hotel, decent size room for central London and well appointed. Check in was smooth and welcoming and although we were early a room was ready for us. Always nice after a long flight and early morning arrival. My only negative was the service in the lobby bar was slow inattentive, and I was twice served cold espresso.",4,2017,02,14
121,Lovely Hotel,"This hotel is beautifully decorated with some really nice finishes- I would have liked to stay longer to take advantage of the spa etc.  Perfect location if you're exploring London. Everything was lovely, efficient and spotless and as expected from the website and pictures, my only criticism would be that nothing and no one went out of their way to exceed expectations which would have been nice since this was for my birthday weekend. I would definitely stay again.",4,2017,02,14
121,After dinner drinks ,"Visited this hotel on way home from Sunday lunch, drove past & thought it looked lovely so went in for a drink. Gorgeous building, lovely courtyard. Bar is in foyer with big comfortable chairs 
& sofas. Relaxing atmosphere & attentive friendly staff. Really nice way to end a good day out. Will be back. ",5,2017,02,14
121,Very nice!,"Considering the costly prices of some London hotels and many of them quite shabby this one is a real gem! Paid £140 for a king sized room which is great value..staff great too!
Drinks expensive there so pop round corner to the All Bar One!",4,2017,02,13
121,Simple and efficient hotel,"Stayed for one night (again) . The hotel is well run and efficient. A good place to stay for business in the centre of London. A word of caution, drinking alcohol in the Hamptons bar is a very (even for London) expensive experience",4,2017,02,12
121,Efficient and friendly,"A very good central London hotel, convenient for Buckingham Palace, Westminster and St. James park.  3 minute walk to St. James Park tube station. Efficient and friendly staff. Delicious buffet breakfast.",4,2017,02,12
121,"The Taj, St. James Court","There is no better place to stay in London than this Hotel. The rooms, the service, the staff and the personal attention are excellent. For someone who has stayed in the best hotels of the world this one truly stands out.",5,2017,02,12
121,Anniversary stay,Spent a lot of time researching hotels for our anniversary as two years ago we stayed at the Landmark in Marylebone which I knew would be hard to beat. St James's Court is in a very nice area close to Buckingham palace and the tube station. First impressions were good and the lobby welcoming and friendly. We had a Junior classic suite which was nice with a large king size bed and separate seating area. Bathroom small but clean. Overall the hotel was nice but needs updating. Pleasant but wouldn't rush to go back.,4,2017,02,11
121,Great location,"St. James is located near a couple of great tube stations which makes it very easy to travel to all corners of London. The hotel itself is well maintained except the extremely thin walls. I could hear what the family next door was saying and watching on TV which only means they can hear us as well. Thankfully we didn't spend too many hours in our room as we had a very packed schedule. The service was friendly and the room was small but adequate.

The only negative was that some of our most cherished souvenirs (pro photos taken of my husband and I in front of the Eiffel Tour) had completely vanished from the room. We kept all of our souvies in one corner and the bag from Paris had just disappeared into thin air. We told management and they came up to take a look and apparently asked all the housekeeping staff but no one claimed to have seen it. The staff did try to make amends by being very apologetic and deducted 50 pounds from our bill, however, it still left a bad taste. 

I would recommend this hotel if you want to splurge a bit for a standard room but advantageous location. Just be careful of what you leave in the room!!",3,2017,02,11
121,The opulence of the Raj at the Taj,The St James' Court is beautiful building built around an old Courtyard. You expect to see horse drawn carriages pulling up and disgorging guests. The hotel is a myriad of corridors but there is plenty of signage and short cuts can be found. The service and food could no be bettered. The standard rooms are not large but what can you expect in an older building.,5,2017,02,10
121,Highest quality hotel in excellent location with the best staff,"I've stayed at St James Court for the last 18 months and had a positive experience each time. Although the hotel itself is excellent (rooms, facilities, location etc) what really makes the difference is the staff. Anubhav on front desk for example. Always kind, sincere and welcoming. 

I highly recommend St James Court for business and leisure travel. Consistently the best hotel I've stayed at in this part of town. 
",5,2017,02,10
121,Nice and comfortable hotel,"This hotel is situated in the most convenient location from a tourist perspective. Its really close to Tourist attractions like  Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, London Eye and London aquarium. All these places are just walking distance away from the hotel and would save a lot on transport for tourists. This property has room service with good variety of food options.
The rooms are comfortable and nice.
Highly recommended",4,2017,02,09
121,in central of london,"near of center , very nice place where you are in india , excellent service and very professional  typical hotel every body is very nice and considerate with you the decoration was great  thanks very much i will come again",5,2017,02,08
121,My experiance,"Extremely comfortable and close to most of sightseeing places and especially to IMO headquarters,London. The ambiance and location is very good and would recommend your hotel to family and friends during their visit to London.",5,2017,02,08
121,Great Hotel!,"The hotel had the best gym I have seen anywhere in the world (for a hotel).The breakfast was very good, although the wait for food to be served was a bit longer than I would have liked.  The hotel was in a great location very close to Buckingham palace and a short walk to Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey.  Short cab ride to Convent Garden, Lester Square, Soho, and Trafalgar Square area.",4,2017,02,08
121,Stunning hotel,"Great location for business or pleasure the hotel is gorgeous and the team genuinely welcome you.

The lobby area is impressive and the process to check in was smooth and efficient and Isabella was really friendly.

The room was spacious but with a hint of a smell of smoke (why do people smoke in hotel rooms) the view from the window was awful - think it was air conditioning units which were also quite noisy.

The bed was really comfortable the TV small in comparison to the room.

Lovely big bathroom with toiletries provided fluffy towels and dressing robes.

Breakfast in room without a charge which is a nice touch - great choice of food and it was delicious.

Would recommend but try and get a better room if you can afford it!",4,2017,02,08
121,"Beautifully appointed, spacious, well priced rooms","Good location, spacious, with everything you need for a short stay in london. Great breakfasts, friendly staff and good gym! Walking distance Soho, Trafalgar Square, west Minister abbey and plenty of good restaurants nearby and in hotel.",5,2017,02,07
121,A beautiful place to say in the heart of the city.,"I only stayed with the taj for one night which after a day of traveling was a perfect place to find myself.   I was greated into the hotel by the very prossional staff who offer to help me with my bags. I was checked in quickly and the rrom i was staying in was on the 6th floor. This room was much more than i expected, it was more like an apartment with a living room and seperate bedroom. Erythi was immacualte and well presented. All of the ammenities i required were already in the room.  The room at night was very quiet and peaceful and extremely comfortable.   I will be very happy to stay here again for work or pleasure.",5,2017,02,07
121,Nice stay but...,"I spent a different we in this hotel.
Firstly, I visited this place almost 6 years ago (when it was a Crowne Plaza) and at this time, I have noticed some differences...
Reception: nice atmosphere and attentive staff (in my opinion the concierge was a bit superficial);
Bar: great ambience and good drinks! Perfect place for a pre/post dinner drink.
Room: I reserved the entry level room (so no big expectations) and it was a bit small (then what I expected) with nice furnitures (the wardrobe needs a sliding door) but quite noisy (starting from the heating to the noise from the court - but as we were staying there 2 nights we did not complaint).
Breakfast service: the rooms services breakfast just amazing! On the 2nd day we went to breakfast room and the view on the court was just lovely. The buffet was rich and various but, I found the staff a bit disorganized...",3,2017,02,07
121,A perfect stay in Taj hotel,"We were travelling to London for the first time. We have investigated so many hotels and read lots of comments. We cancelled tens of rezervations until finalized to Taj Hotel. We lowered our expectations indeed and nothing would be suprised for us. It really exceeded our expecations. We stayed at 5th floow looking into entrance road. The room size was big enough; we were able to sleep all together on a king size bed; my wife and my 8 y.o. son. The room was cleaned every day; there was no noise outside. It is very close to Buckhingam Palace. Even we walked to Westminster area (Big Ben, The London Eye etc)",4,2017,02,06
121,Indian tones,"A very spacious hotel with generously proportioned rooms that are adequately equipped.
Breakfast is a mix of Indian , continental and English.....efficient and friendly service.
Needed a few taxis as a little 'tucked away' so check where it is you want to be in London, but central enough to get to most places.

Upstairs corridors are a little tired and souless but room size and massive comfy bed and good quality sheets more thank make up.

Impressive courtyard ",4,2017,02,05
121,Comfortable Stay,Stayed here for one night in executive junior suite. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable. The adjoining living room was nicely done up with good views of city around. The breakfast is excellent with lots of choices. There might be some wait for breakfast due to limited availability of tables in restaurant. The check in check out was smooth and hassle free.,5,2017,02,04
121,Service & Care,"The Taj philosophy is based on service and care for guests. These are the main features of the St James' Court, London. There is a wonderful combination of formality and  genuine warmth and friendliness.Management and staff take every request from guests very seriously and are prepared to ""go the extra mile"" to make certain that the guest is satisfied. It is a genuine pleasure to stay at St James Court.",5,2017,02,03
121,Not great,"Booked an ""Executive King"".  Room was small and when I arrived it was laid out as a twin.  Air conditioning in room did not work.  No soft close mechanism on the doors, meaning I was woken by slamming doors.  Terrible smell of paint/glue throughout the hotel.  Lobby freezing cold as doors open to combat smell.  Wifi speed woeful to the point of being unusable.",3,2017,02,02
121,"Great hotel, but beware of cheapest rooms on 8th floor","The St. James Court/Taj is amazing.  And, we got a ""great deal""...but the deal was for rooms on the 8th floor which likely are former maids quarters.  Again, that is fine given price, but expect a tiny elevator ride, and we had several problems with our room.  In addition, the gym is disappointing.",4,2017,02,01
121,Great Experience,"This hotel is a first class gem, but not stuffy or pretentious. It is around the corner from Buckingham Palace and close to many restaurants, pubs and shopping.  The rooms are a bit smaller than USA standards, as is typical for the UK, but the bathroom was very large. Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.  They had a piano player adjacent to the bar and lobby in the evenings. Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,02,01
121,REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE,"Experienced 1st class service from the moment checked in. It was a long haul flight and I arrived at the hotel at 6am, the front desk Manager at the time was kind enough to allow an early check in, in most cases is a taboo for hotels is London.  This gesture and service goes a long way. The hotel staffs are kind and smiling all the time which made my stay more pleasant.   The location is fantastic and the breakfast is something to write home about. I usually don't write reviews but this time I'll make an exemption for this fine Hotel.  Highly recommended...period!!!",5,2017,02,01
121,Excellent stay and hospitality ,"Wow! I must stay a great hotel to stay with, I was on business trip to London from india and I found same taj hospitality is there as it is in India, I liked the breakfast Indian dishes, everything is great!! Thanks for making my trip memorable and will surely visit again",5,2017,01,31
121,"Worn and dated, photos not representative","A very disappointing stay.  The photos and the website are not representative of this hotel in any way.  The hotel and the rooms are very dated and worn.  Our room had wallpaper pealing off of the walls, chipped furniture, and the bathroom tiles were chipped and dirty.  We will not be returning.",2,2017,01,30
121,Great place. Fantastic location.,"Lovely hotel not far from 'Buck House'. Close subway, room very clean and tidy. Nice bar, friendly staff. Good for business and family travellers. Great breakfast in a pleasant spacious dining area. Value for money. Would stay here again.",5,2017,01,30
121,Leisure ,"One of the best hotels in London. The locations is near many Great landmarks, like the New Scotland Yard, the tube, great eating locations. The hotel staff provides great service and the staff is very friendly and helpful.
",5,2017,01,30
121,"It's a Taj, what do you expect?","The hotel is an oasis in a very busy business district. It is well  located with regards to transportation and proximity to landmarks, but the neighborhood is not residential. Fortunately, the hotel has several excellent well priced restaurants offering a variety of well prepared foods. The Indian foods are particularly good. The hotel is in a quirky old building which is lovely band renovated. The rooms are roomy and well decorated. The staff is extremely helpful> This will be my hotel for London going forward.",5,2017,01,30
121,Good location...dated hotel ,Location is fantastic and easy to get about. Hotel rooms are slightly dated with decor. Phones in room are dirty...ironing board was broken...beds are small and bathroom needs a face lift. Rooms are clean and staff are polite and friendly. The lifts are really old and sound like they are about to break. ,3,2017,01,30
121,Great location,"The Taj, James Court is in a great location for visiting central London, it is close to many sights, handy for the tube if you want to explore further yet is located in a quieter mainly office area.We had two rooms one nice but smaller room on the 7th floor and a very nice larger room on the 5th floor.Staff were very pleasant and we enjoyed the lovely piano playing in the foyer on Saturday evening. Only negative was adding a 'discretionary' 12% to bar bill, the hotels discretion rather than the guests presumably??",4,2017,01,30
121,"Beautiful Hotel, Spacious, and Great Staff","Room was spacious and clean. Bed was very nice.
Staff was very kind, courteous and helpful.
The public areas were well kept and nice. The location was great, within few minutes of the palace. slightly off Mayfair, but within walking distance, as well 30 min. stroll to Soho. Further areas were well served by St. James tube station, a few minutes away.

All in all, great hotel in a very nice neighborhood.",5,2017,01,30
121,Close To Buckingham Palace,"The St James Court, A Taj hotel is in a central location.  The room was large, the bed comfy except that I am pretty sure I had bed bug bites on my leg.   My husband didn't get the bites but I did.  The breakfast that was included was delicious it had a little bit of Indian food - yum!  When we arrived we were put in a room that was smoking, two twin beds and a small room.   We had been up for over twenty hours and I didn't understand why our room was not ready.  I had specifically requested a quiet, non smoking and not near elevators, classic king room nine months before our arrival.  They moved us within twenty minutes - I did appreciate that!  If this hotel did not have bed bugs I would definitely stay here again but unfortunately I had the tell tale bit marks of three in a row.",3,2017,01,29
121,"Good hotel, Great Location","We recently spent a week at the St. James Court Hotel. The location could not have been better for us, easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Victoria Train Station. Lots of restaurants, and coffee shops near by. The hotel also has several restaurants, we had dinner in the Bistro restaurant twice and breakfast there almost everyday. The food was very good and the menu was nicely diverse. We ordered room service several times (great after a long day of exploring the city) which we also enjoyed. The hotel its self is lovely. Nice reception and bar area, very accommodating staff. The only negative I could say that it is an older hotel and some of the rooms might be due for a refresh. I am looking forward to staying at the St James Court again on my next visit to London",4,2017,01,29
121,"Pleasant stay, good location for the sights of London.",A well maintained hotel.Staff were very good and attentive. Bathroom could do with a renovation as the bedroom had already been done. No full length mirror in the room. Bar area was nice especially with the touch of the pianist.,4,2017,01,29
121,Nice business hotel,"Our superior double room was on the fifth floor,not a large room and adequate size room for 2 people with 2 large suitcases. Room was nicely furnished, no view from room windows, Bathroom was modern and FD staff was friendly, so why only 4 stars?

The modern bathroom was missing two important features for me, an electrical socket for hairdryer and a bathtub. Would've been nice to soak my feet after all that walking from sightseeing. Why there wasn't any electrical socket for the hairdryer but has one for shaver is beyond me...It very frustrating to use the socket by the desk area to style my hair under poor lighting. They had a strange feature in bathroom which I couldn't understand.  There was a overhead speaker in the bathroom of the bedroom television outside...why??  If I can't watch television in the bathroom why do I want to listen to it?
Their compliment coffee and tea tray is a joke. No coffee maker, Instant coffee packages only with an electrical hot water pot that couldn't plug in because the table was up against wall with no room to fit the plug.  Makes me wonder how much thought was put into the design of their rooms?!

Location is excellent, close the circle line St James metro station. But is relatively quiet at nights due to the fact the hotel is within a business area. 

This is a great hotel if you are here for business and quietness.",4,2017,01,29
121,Not the same Taj standard we experienced in India,"For guests who have been to several Taj hotels in India, this hotel was below standard. Our king bed bedroom had a good size and que quality of the bed was good, but the bathroom was a disaster: small, old, with a curtain that did not stop water from splashing and, unbelievably, with mildew (see pictures). The breakfast (at 25gbp) was regular and the burger we order via room service was tasteless. Not a place I will be going back to. ",3,2017,01,28
121,Very good for service - rooms really dated 3.5 star,"The only reason I have given it 4 stars is taj is absolutely brilliant at its service. We travelled with an infant, and the room had a little selection of baby products in a beautiful pouch in her cot..At the check in my daughter was given a little toy by the staff. We were out most of the day and only returned later at night to find a small cake with happy anniversary written on the plate. The taj experience all in all great.
Now about the room the room really needs a facelift. We booked a classic king room. The window pane in the bathroom has chipping paint. The back of my bed was broken with a sharp edge that is a hazard especially with an infant in my room.
The night lamp can't be switched off unless you squeeze your hand through the tiny side table at the bottom is a switch to turn it off. The ceiling had a funny bright red tape at a corner. The layout of the room is a bit funny not a standard one. The duvet provided for my daughter wasn't clean, had some dirt and marks on it. Although I was offered to change the room at night I didn't want to do it at 12 in the night. A big thanks to Anubhav at the front desk he was great.",4,2017,01,28
121,Perfect,"I had to attend a seminar nearby and the company got me a room here. It was very decent, there was a little bit of noise, probably the insulation after midnight.  Everything else was spot on. Service was decent, staff friendly.",5,2017,01,28
121,Beautiful hotel in a great location ,"This hotel was awesome. Beautiful inside and out, great location (close to Victoria Station,walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Westminster - you can hear Big Ben at night if you open you window, the tube is literally across the street, and close to lots of pubs and restaurants), and friendly staff. The breakfast was really good too. I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2017,01,28
121,Can't sleep,"Currently in the hotel... staff is extremely friendly,polite and professional however, had to request a room change due to train noises....

Now as i write this, the noise from outside my door is VERY loud... I hear EVERYTHING ,people closing doors..talking..walking.. whispering..laughing.. there is no ""sound"" proofing at all... I think being close by the elevator is making it THAT much worse 😩...tired and cant sleep, gonna be a long stay  ",2,2017,01,27
121,great hotel and location,great hotel but we had some issues with the room being cold the first day and a half.  The heating issue was resolved after the second call to maintain. No one asked us upon check out if there were any issues,5,2017,01,27
121,Really Enjoyed Staying Here,"Stayed there in late November, check-in was easy, stayed on second floor, room was nice and big had everything we needed and was very clean as was the bathroom.

Good choice of cooked breakfast food and lot of fruit juices to choose from, stayed here for my wife's birthday so it had to be good, would definitely stay again.",5,2017,01,26
121,Great hotel because of its location,"The Location is without doubt the stand out of this hotel. 

Rooms are well sized and comfortable but slightly dated given the rates you could pay the the hotel. 

The staff are always friendly and willing to help wherever they can. 

The adjoined restaurant serves nice food but more expensive than some local restaurants - not sure the quality is worth the additional expense unless paying for convenience. 

Hotel is overall a good place to stay centrally and you know you'll be well looked after. ",4,2017,01,26
121,30th birthday visit,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends 30th birthday! Our stay was exceptional & we had a wonderful experience!
The bed was comfy & enormous! I booked a classic suite & we were upgraded to a executive suite which was lovely! The only flaw in the bedroom was having to shut the door to see the things at the same time!
We also feel that as the bath was so large & inviting a tv or sound system would be fabulous in there for an extra piece of luxury! There was a volume button on the wall but despite hunting & various attempts we couldn't link this to anything! 
The hairdryer is a good one - for me this is essential for a good hotel stay!! It wasn't a silly bathroom hold the button down for 10 hours one! 
The room had an iron and ironing board, we had dressing gown robes & slippers as well as complimentary toiletries!
A thoughtful touch is the complimentary toiletries listed should you have forgotten anything, the hotel we're happy to provide disposable razors, toothpaste, toothbrushes, a comb, cotton pads & sanitary products should you have forgotten them! I think that's a lovely touch for visitors who may have done just that having been that person in the past!! 
I advised the hotel of my boyfriends birthday and they delivered a birthday cake to our room, although this said congratulations it was a lovely hilarious gesture as we laughed at the thought of ""congratulations you made it to 30""! 
The coffee machine was also a fab addition to the room! So lovely to have an espresso first thing! 
Thank you for a wonderful stay! I've highly recommended this hotel to family and friends already! ",5,2017,01,24
121,Everything was excellent! Perfect location. Highly recommended.,"Everything was excellent! Perfect location. Highly recommended.

We came to London for my birthday and stayed for one night in this hotel. Everything was excellent: location is one of the best possible (Buckingham Palace is ~450 meters away, Big Ben - less than a kilometer way), exterior and interior of the hotel is really beautiful, classy, rooms are quite big, with all the necessary stuff (there was even an iron and ironing desk, which is not that common), staff was extremely polite and helpful. I can‘t think of a single thing that I could complain about. Well, maybe one small thing – our room (503) was in some corner of a building and half of the inner yard view through a window was blocked by a wall. But this is really not a big deal at all.
The price for such a hotel and location was really good - £184 (~214 EUR) per night. Breakfast was extra charge and we opted out as it was pricey (Continental breakfast - £24, English breakfast - £26), decided to choose one of the great restaurants nearby.
Would I recommend it? Without a single doubt!",5,2017,01,24
121,Lovely service and overall great hotel,Cant fault this hotel and the service received from all staff. Rooms are lovely and spacious and some beautiful architecture. Its location is extremely central and very convenient for public transport,5,2017,01,23
121,Lovely Hotel,This hotel is a very nice place to stay. Its close to the centre and all the main attractions. Staff are friendly and professional. I would come back here and no doubt will do next time we visit London.,5,2017,01,23
121,"Beautiful hotel, perfect central location.","Hotel lobby is beautiful, the design throughout the hotel is particularly nice. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Excellent location - few minutes walk to Houses of Parliament, Westminster Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace etc.",5,2017,01,23
121,Lovely location though small room but don't waste money on breakfast as there's Crumpets over the road at half the price,"I booked an executive double room for a two night break. 

The location of the hotel is a hidden gem. A step or two away from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. 

The hotel is all you would expect from a 4-star hotel. Good quality service and high quality fixtures and fittings

Disappointing room size though. I booked and executive double and it was smaller than a premier inn room by quite some way. 

The TV in our room was quite out of date and really need updating. The kettle had to be plugged in across the room as there was no plug where the coffee making was. 

The air conditioner unit was very noisy and even if it was off you could hear most of your neighbours units churning away. 

We did query the room size first thing in the morning but they couldn't help. When we returned from the Theatre at midnight there was a letter posted under our door offering a room change. Bit late to be changing rooms and the housekeeping team had dated and timed the letter at 9 pm. So it took 12-hours to react to our comments...hummm. 

To sum up - Location great, no real surprises and an adequate stay",4,2017,01,23
121,Excellent Hotel...Stay Here....,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location If Planning A Trip To The Theatre, Excellent & Friendly Staff, Smoking Rooms Available, Breakfast In Bed Top Notch, 100% Recommend This Hotel.... Will Be Staying Again For Sure.....",5,2017,01,22
121,Excellent in every way,"A quick review to say this place is now The place for me to stay in London - perfect location, close to all main sites, great value for money too - the staff were spot on, we had a slight issue with the bill but resolved quickly, room was great, and even had a balcony - to be honest it feels like a real 5 star place, it has real syle and class but donw to earth with it. The entrance, the guys on the front door were very good and helpful, and tip of the day is the Italian cafe round the corner - great for brunch. 

Overall no critiques at all really - highly recommended",5,2017,01,21
121,Excellent service & good value for money,"I had a weekend holiday with my daughter. The hotel offered a very nice overall experience with excellent service. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and cosy. Excellent locations. I definitely recommend this hotel. Good value for money.",5,2017,01,21
121,terrible!!,"Rooms were cold, staff was horrible. We had guests with us and we were there for official government duty. Our guests stuck at the elevator for 40 minutes. Staff was so slow responding to the event. They were distant, and did not realize how serious the situation was. After waiting for minutes and literally went crazy to have ""the engineer"" bring the elevator key to rescue the group. When we saw that the staff was hesitant to open the elevator door and pull them up we threatened them to go to court! Then they panicked and started to act. A hotel with no emergency plan!!! I would say; do not ever consider them!",1,2017,01,20
121,"If you want the ideal location, you pay a bit more for a somewhat dated room.","My fiance worked at this swanky hotel 21 years ago, so we thought it'd be fun to stay there one of our evenings in London.  This was one of the more expensive hotels during our trip, but worth it for a night.

Staff--from doormen to front desk to servers in the lounge--were all top-notch, couldn't be better.  We felt welcomed and the lobby was beautiful, as were the grounds.  

As we neared our room, our enthusiasm waned a little, as the hallways looked as they had not been updated since my fiance worked here 21 years ago.  The room was about the same.  It was well kept and spacious, but felt dated all around and not really worth the price per night, if it weren't for the location of the hotel.  I imagine that this property would have been at its zenith in the 1980s, but it really does need an update.

And that's it, really, the location couldn't be better, so if you want to be close to Buckingham Palace and the Mall, it's worth the money spent. Just don't expect sumptuous, updated accommodations for the price and you're golden.",4,2017,01,19
121,Outstanding everything,"Chose the St James Court Taj for location but found everything about it superlative! Warm, welcoming staff with the highest standards for courtesy, comfort and professionalism.  Room was lovely and meticulously maintained; restaurant and lounge provided quality food and service as well as delightful ambiance.  We had the good fortune to encounter Sunaina Soares, Asst. Front Ofc Mgr, upon our arrival and she is the model of professionalism married to gracious hospitality.  Happy to recommend; happier still to return!",5,2017,01,19
121,Great hotel location and good value,"This was my wife and my second stay at St. James with our first in 2014.  This time we stayed in a King room (the first was a queen), which was a slightly larger room and this rate was pre-pay and included a great buffet breakfast.  My only compliant about the king room (although it was larger) is that the bathrooms were very outdated and cramped.  Also a very long way from the bed to the very small tv.  Very small nit-picky things, but after really enjoying the updated queen rooms in 2014 the larger, less updated room left a little to be desired.  However, that is easily over looked by the amazing location the hotel offers, and the great staff service we both encountered.  Not sure when our next visit to London will be, however I would still recommend this hotel to all family, friends and colleagues.",4,2017,01,17
121,An Oasis in The Heart of London,"Lovely staff, lovely environment, range of catering facilities excellent, 3 minute's walk from Buckingham Palace.  The hotel is an Edwardian building around an award-winning courtyard.    What else could you ask for.",5,2017,01,17
121,Needs a little improvement,"This hotel has a good location and is situated in a nice building but the staff needs a little training. I was told I have to leave a deposit from my card at check in but instead of just blocking the amount on my card they charged the full amount for it and at check out I had to wait until a full refund was done on my card and charged on business card  instead 

I was given a very small room that had a strong smell of weed! I opened the windows for the entire evening and the smell wasn't gone. I had to upgrade the next day to get another room. 

The person taking calls for room service is not very friendly, hung up the phone even without saying goodbye, but the food arrived in a timely manner. The food was delicious!

I would stay here again, but I would like to see a better service",4,2017,01,17
121,"Great location, lovely garden","We stayed in the hotel for 4 days in January, so had what I assume was a reduced winter rate. Great location and value. Beautiful building, lovely lobby, well-maintained courtyard garden, full buffet breakfast, large bathtub in marble bath.",5,2017,01,16
121,Great location!,"Our family of four just returned from a lovely stay at the St. James Court hotel in London.  This hotel is in a great location.  It is just blocks from Buckingham Palace and walking distance to Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.  The neighborhood is very nice with many restaurants and even a movie theatre right around the corner.  The hotel is well maintained, has a lovely bar in the lobby and the staff was wonderful.  The deluxe king room we had was quite large and well appointed.  The rooms are a bit worn but still very nice and well kept.  My only complaint would be that there were no electrical outlets in the bathroom.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,15
121,Great value in London,"The St James Court has always been a great hotel but the staff and new furnishings make it one of the very best places to stay while in London.  The food, service, ambience, and overall ""feel"" of the hotel make it the perfect haven for resting after a long day.  And if you need more space, the suites are ideal and a great value.  I could not recommend this hotel more strongly.",5,2017,01,15
121,Stay at St. James Court,"Our journey started with a smile, was escorted with fabulous services and attention to detail,  entailing memorable and fabulous stories which will last forever. Expect us very soon to St James Court!!  Thank you and god bless !!",5,2017,01,15
121,Convenience and quality,Flexible late check-out was the cherry on the top of a top rate experience - especially useful for guests travelling long haul in the evening. The hotel is attractive and has great character. There were absolutely no disappointments ever and only good surprises with the service.,5,2017,01,15
121,A really lovely stay ,"My partner and I stayed for three days just before Christmas. It was really lovely! The staff were fantastic; nothing was too much. 

I'd recommend - this is a solid four star hotel in the heart of London with great character and really hospitable staff. ",4,2017,01,14
121,"Great choice for a city visit, with very comfortable bed!!!! ","Taj hotel was a perfect location, minutes from the tube at st James park. The service was perfect, friendly and polite with the concierge being incredibly helpful... Extremely comfortable bed in a modest room, but the bathroom was a little dated. Every amenity at your fingertips. For a 4 star hotel in this location it was excellent value for money for our two night city break. Highly recommended. ",4,2017,01,14
121,Very good hotel,The hotel is big but still intimate. Rooms are spacious for London standards. Beautiful courtyard and very skilled and friendly staff. Breakfast is expensive so I choose to have breakfast outside the hotel. Rest is good price quality. ,4,2017,01,14
121,"At last, I've found it!","After staying in London very 5-6 weeks for 2-3 days, I've not, until staying at St James' Court found somewhere that's really quiet, very comfortable, well appointed, beautifully maintained, clean with excellent food and service and all this, at a very sensible price. I'm looking forward to a return visit in February .",5,2017,01,13
121,"Calm luxury unless you are in a ""classic twin""","Majestic building, luxury ambience, discreet service, lovely food. But if you are in the ""basic"" room, despite good fixtures, mine was cramped and noisy. When I come again I will upgrade because everything else is genuinely first class.",5,2017,01,12
121,Pleasant hotel in St James district,"Needed a room for a quick business trip to London so found this on Booking.com at a great rate.

Lobby and reception very nice. Friendly staff and an upmarket feel.

Room small but quite pleasant. Comfortable bed and a well priced stock of snacks in the refreshment centre

Good breakfast with nothing Indian and western food in the buffet.

Valet parking not cheap ( never is in London)

Overall, more than adequate",3,2017,01,11
121,Great Value,"Great location and quality of hotel for the price. Staff are very welcoming, great breakfast; a touch of old-English luxury and service. Within easy walking distance of many of London attractions; nearby parking expensive during the week but so is most of London.",5,2017,01,11
121,Central London Hotel,"Reasonably expensive but great location, food, service.  Near many London attractions within walking distance.  Staff are polite  and professional. Rooms spacious and classic in appearance. Would recommend.",5,2017,01,11
121,Fabulous location and building is stunning,For fractionally more than a budget hotel we decided to stay in this stunning building and it was beautiful with the inner courtyard and interesting architecture. Some areas of the interior could do with an update but the staff are all extremely welcoming and friendly. The location is excellent too and a short walk from the Houses of Parliament and the river Thames. Value for money is excellent.,4,2017,01,11
121,Classic full service hotel,My 17 year old granddaughter and I stayed here on a trip to London and Paris. The room was somewhat small but I understand that this is the norm in Paris. Furnishings were not luxurious but adequate. The beds were quite comfortable. There was a fitness center which my granddaughter appreciated since she was missing the first week of basketball conditioning (we ARE from Indiana). The restaurant overlooking the court was excellent and our server was fantastic. The service in the entire hotel was impeccable. The doormen in their waistcoats and top hats were quite professional but friendly. The location of the hotel was great. Many attractions were within walking distance. I would gladly stay here again.,5,2017,01,10
121,excellent Hotel,"good location! But  also a ""good"" price . It is convenient to go to the great centre of london, you can travel around city centre by walk.  Staffs are well trained and always have been give me exactly information whenever I needed any help. Defintely to be command.",4,2017,01,09
121,Lovely hotel,"Myself and my sister stayed here for 2 nights from 6th - 8th Jan. I was slightly apprehensive after reading some of the not so good reviews but as they say 'you can't please everyone'. We booked direct and got a good deal for the weekend (£350 for a twin room with breakfast). The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from Victoria coach and rail stations. The hotel is very impressive, very nice lobby/check in area and check in was swift and friendly. Our room was on the 4th floor, basic but very clean, the room was quite chilly as the window didn't quite close properly. We went down to reception and told them about this, they were very apologetic and we were swiftly moved to another room in a different part of the hotel across the courtyard. We stayed on the 8th floor, room was lovely and warm and very quiet with a nice view of the courtyard.
All of the staff here were very friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble. A special mention to Justin the concierge who was very helpful advising us of restaurants nearby and offering to book us a table of a place of out choice. Breakfast was lovely, and hot, plenty of choice and even provided gluten free sausages for my sister. Piccadilly is only a short stroll across green park passing Buckingham Palace along the way.
As i said before, the hotel is lovely, very clean and all staff very pleasant and very friendly.
Would we stay here again? Yes, definitely.",5,2017,01,09
121,Welcoming Stay at St James Court,"I have stayed at this hotel on four or five occasions now and every time I have left extremely satisfied.  The staff are all very helpful and friendly, the rooms nice and the location is perfect, being close to St James tube station and within easy walking distance to many tourist attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Trafalgar Square.  I haven't had dinner at the hotel but the breakfast is great, with a good variety of food.  Will definitely be booking this hotel again when back in London in the future.",5,2017,01,09
121,BEST LOCATION,"Stayed here over Christmas and New Years, the location of this property couldn't be any better! You step out of the hotel, make a left and you are at Buckingham Palace (3 min walk) or make a right and you will be near Big Ben (5-7 min walk) PERFECT location. The place is immaculate and the staff was friendly and helpful. Would recommend",5,2017,01,08
121,Birthday weekend ,"Beautiful hotel with lovely staff , welcomed warmly from the moment we walked in until we left   Had an exec double room which was lovely , no complaints very warm , clean and stylish. Had a small birthday cake wAiting which was lovely. Toiletries in bathroom lovely too 

Had cocktails in the bar ,mojitos which were fabulous although very pricey even for London £18 Rach plus £3 service charge ! We ate in the bistro food was lovely Indian fusion but overpriced again with 12.5% service chArge added , would much rather tip individually

Breakfast at £20 pp for buffet was not good , tea coffee not included either and again £5 service charge added when we didn't really receive any service. Offered hot drinks but not until we had finished breakfast which was mainly cold. 

Overall loved the hotel and would definitely stay again but not eat here. Had lovely hot cooked English breakfast the morn we arrived over the road in local cafe for £5 

Staff were all amazing tho ,so big thank you to all of them ",5,2017,01,08
121,New yr and birthday celebration,Great Hotel with its location . Ideal for central London shopping and restaurant’s. Also easy access to sightseeing places and museums . Having a swimming pool at the hotel  would have been great for my teenage son.,4,2017,01,08
121,"Overall, an excellent & enjoyable stay!","I decided to take my 8 year old son to London for a pre-Christmas treat.  

After spending ages deciding on a hotel we finally plumped for the St James Court.  

We travelled down by train on 17 December, arriving into St Pancras at around 7.40am - with only 2 days in London, we had a lot to fit in!

Anyway, we arrived at the hotel around 9.am after taking some breakfast at St Pancras.  We had booked an executive junior suite for the two of us and had hoped that we might be able to check in early - but unfortunately our room was not going to be ready until 12pm.  Not to worry, we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel whilst we started our sightseeing.

We did not return until around 2pm and check in went smoothly.  Our room was a good size on the fourth floor with a separate living area and bedroom, two TVs, nespresso machine, bathrobes and slippers and a turn down service. The bathroom was also modern and well lit.  It did not have a view, but for the one night that was not s problem.  My son thought it was superb! In addition, he got a Kids at Taj back pack with activities and a teddy bear inside - this was a fabulous touch and much appreciated & he swapped his own backpack for this one for the rest of our stay!

At the end of our first sightseeing day, we took room service.  They had an exceptionally good kids room service menu with 3 courses for £15.50.  There was plenty of choice, the food arrived quickly and the portions were a really good size.  All in all, excellent.  We had hoped to try the on site Michelin starred restaurant Quilon but didn't have time!

Anyway, the excellent room service meant that we were looking forward to breakfast the next day and we were not disappointed, with the food anyway.  There was a wide selection including the usual continental pastries, breads and cheeses, cereals, cooked items including bacon, eggs and different types of sausage, but for me the highlight was the vegetarian dishes which were so tasty.  I did feel let down with service at breakfast, however.  Whilst there were a number of free tables, my young son and I were shoved into a corner - we had little room to manoeuvre and it was a real squash.  Having paid for one of their top room types, the executive junior suite, I would have expected a bit better service at breakfast.  However, I did not complain at the time as I didn't want anything to spoil  my son's time on this short break.  This is the only thing within the hotel's control that let it down.  The staff were otherwise very polite, friendly and helpful. 

Outside of the hotel's control, whilst the location was good for this trip because it was close to venues that were on our sightseeing priority list, it is very quiet and next time we would perhaps try a busier area.  

All in all, the positives far outweigh the negatives and I would certainly recommend the hotel and would return!",5,2017,01,08
121,"Great location, comfy hotel, spot on service","We (three couples) stayed at the St James Court over the holidays and had a wonderful stay. The rooms were a good size with everything you would need, clean and modern. The beds were comfortable. I cannot say enough about the service which was spot on. The lobby has several sitting areas, a great place to wait while everyone is gathering, along with a lovely bar. We were happy with the fitness facilities and the business center for staying on top of work.
The holidays are a very busy time and the two lifts were challenged to keep up with the demand so we had some lengthy waits. A small price for an otherwise wonderful stay.",5,2017,01,07
121,New Years Meal in the Kona,"We had recently stayed and ate in this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it , its extremely good value for money and the staff are excellent so we decided to eat here before going to see the fireworks. There was a set 7 course menu for £80 and it certainly did not disappoint us . When we arrived we were shown to our table in a lovely stylish  room with a modern twist of Art deco . There were Art Deco party hats on the table and the staff were extremely attentive. The menu was varied and inclusive of vegetarian, fish and meat options. Everything that arrived was beautifully presented and of a very high quality. We had a great evening , arriving through the foyer where there was a piano playing at 8.00 and leaving at 11.45! Just in time for watching the Fireworks outside Buckingham Palace! Fabulous evening - really good food (better than some very expensive restaurants we have eaten in ) and once again smiling happy interested staff. We shall try to come with a bigger party next new year !",5,2017,01,07
121,"Our ""Go To"" Hotel in London gor MANY REASONS","We spent our first and very delightful10 day visit at St.James Court over Christmas which was our 10Th visit to London over the years. SCJ satisfies in many ways that set it apart from similarly priced properties. The proximity to key tube and bus lines is well known but its location on a quiet side street is a welcome surprise.The size of SCJ is well balanced having an attractive lobby with quiet bustle and excellent adjoining dining areas. Our reception from Noedl(Nost) was gracious, warm, helpful and sincere.
Our room on the 5Th floor overlooking the quiet and elegant courtyard was splendid (maybe the Queen has better views).
Summarizing KEY distinctions:
1-Breakfast or brunch served to 11:30AM weekends and 11:00AM weekdays enables one to forego a stop for lunch and simply have a wonderfully leisurely visit.
2-Mgmt. was excellent correcting a reservation and honoring a request.
3-Housekeeping was exceptional tidying up better than one can do in their own home.
4-Service from the entire restaurant staff was world class and very cordial.
5-The doormen and concierge were fun and professional.
We would visit London again simply to stay at the St.James Court, it is a world class property.",5,2017,01,07
121,Very disappointing,"In nearly everything this hotel is scoring far below par.  That the building is old should not per definition be bad, that it is loosing its functionality is bad: windows not closing, toilet not flushing adequately, heating system not working.  Our first room was small, with a very dusty tapestry on the floor, with heating not functioning.  We payed for an 'upgrade' for (larger) room with wooden parquet.  Again: heating not functioning, also in the bathroom temperature never getting higher then 16°C.  After our request for assistance, a technician came by to put the thermostat at 31°, obviously without any result on the final temperature.  Whilst the food in the Kona restaurant is excellent, also here people had to sit with coat on.  This heating problem seems to be an issue overall the hotel.
Kona restaurant for the rest was very fine, the other restaurant however (Studio 51) really scores ways below par.  The food was absolutely not the quality expected, the way is was cooked was even worse.  We had to send back a plate because it was absolutely not acceptable.
Whilst crew always is very friendly and nice (combination of the Indian and English culture, very interesting), serviceability does not go very much further: they listen empathically, pretend as if it is the first time they hear about the problem, but then don't do anything extra with the information.
We stayed 4 nights.  On the 2nd morning, because the breakfast room was too busy, we were diverted to an extra breakfast room.  It was like traveling 15000 km: we landed in an all Indian breakfast room, no decoration at all, just one long table with food and a number of small tables to sit on.  Very helpful, all Indian waiters.  Very strange experience.
On the way out a €160 mistake was made on our bill, printing of the official VAT invoice was not possible but would be sent by email.  I had to request for it after we got back home.
Very bad experience, we will never book in this hotel again.",1,2017,01,07
121,Good Hotel in Suberb location,"This hotel has a good service, larger than average hotel rooms for London and is in an extremely good location to the Buckingham Palace as well as only a few minutes away from the next tube station. 10 Minutes from Victoria Station. Next to it are a few restaurants from $ for breakfast to $$$ for a great dinner experience",4,2017,01,06
121,Home away from home.,Taj has always made me feel at home during my holidays. Fantastic service with well experienced staff and upper management. Thank you for the consideration and response given by your staff and management. I will definitely come back to stay with Taj.,5,2017,01,06
121,Finshing touches let the hotel down,"On first impressions in the hotel it was lovely, but checking in let it down and once in our room we noticed the finishing touches also let this hotel down.  As we were only staying for one night (new years eve) it wasn't worth mentioning but if staying longer I would have said something. We requested a early check in at around 1pm and had a email confirming this, but they do not allow you to officially check in until 2pm, so we had to walk around for the hour.  In our room we would a damp patch on the bedroom ceiling by the wardrobe, a lose socket in the bathroom, the shower screen was very lose, and the tv/radio speaker in the bathroom did not work.  The hotel was a perfect location for the NYE firework display we were attending.  We chose to have breakfast in bed and the service and quality was top class",3,2017,01,06
121,Short family holyday,"Nice hotel -more outside and down at reception than room. Close to Big Ben. Medium sized room. Old, classic furniture. Nice bed. We didn't eat there so no idea how food it is. Not so much to say about personal as we had minimum interaction at check in/out, only that they seem to be too many.  Overall ok hotell, but next time will probably try something else.",4,2017,01,06
121,Taj Magic,"It is several years since we stayed in this hotel and despite the favourable reviews which now appear on TripAdvisor I did wonder if things had improved quite so much during the intervening years because back then the hotel was distinctly average. 
Well it seems that Taj have worked some magic. From the moment you enter the hotel there is a warm welcome from all members of the staff. The bedroom was bright, well equipped and spotless clean The hotel offers an excellent range of choices for eating and has a comfortable cocktail bar. 
For visitors to London such attractions as Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey are literally a short stroll away.
I wish that I had found out about the changes sooner. But now that I have we will most certainly return.
Well done Taj!",4,2017,01,06
121,Exceeded Expectations!,"We booked our trip online via Travelocity and selected the St. James Court hotel for the location despite a few negative reviews.  I'm not sure what those people didn't like, but our stay was stellar!  The hotel was clean and beautiful.  The staff was courteous and very attentive.  The food - especially the breakfast - was above average for hotels.  We would absolutely stay there again.",5,2017,01,06
121,Great location near Buckingham Palace,"The St. James Court is located a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace, and around the corner from two very useful tube stations. We traveled in and out of Gatwick and you can easily take the Gatwick Express (a 30 min train) from the airport to Victoria station, which is a short walk or taxi ride from the hotel.

The hotel is rather grand; it felt like a big place, though I'm not sure how large it really was. The lobby is ornate and has a nice bar area in the back. The room was nicely appointed, though a tad small (and we were in an Executive King Suite)- but I'm told that that is normal for a British hotel. 

The breakfast buffet in the morning was nice, and staff was welcoming. It was a rather generic place- I have no complaints, and would stay here again.",5,2017,01,06
121,Great property with a great location!,"What a great find!  The St. James' Court is maybe five blocks from Buckingham making it a great location to many attractions.  The rooms were very nice - quiet, lush enough and plenty big.  The property has a variety of restaurants within and our stay included breakfast.  Do try Kona for High Tea if you can.   The bar staff and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.   My only criticism was the concierge who was less than helpful with theater tickets.  This is a definite return to location.",4,2017,01,05
121,Wonderful ,"Stayed here for one night with a friend - it was utterly adorable. The hotel exterior is gorgeous, the interior is stunning. We had dinner at The Hamptons Bar and thoroughly enjoyed the food (and the cocktails were gorgeous).  
The room was wonderful - I've stayed at other hotels in London but never found a bed as comfortable as the one I slept in.
The staff were brilliant- they made the stay something I will remember for a long time. I will have to visit again. 10/10. ",5,2017,01,05
121,Superb Experience at St. James Court Hotel,"Excellent stay at St. James Court Hotel over Christmas. Excellent service - really well looked after. Beautiful lounge and good room after being moved to one with a bath. Great location - easy walk to Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,01,05
121,Turism ,"Great fantastic location, 2 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, short walk to Trafalgar Square, Big Ben and Piccadilly Circus. 

We stayed in a junior suite, good size room, and the hotel staff has excellent customer service skills.  

",5,2017,01,05
121,Prime London Location,"Excellent location and value for touring Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and other London sites.  Warm and gracious hosts.  Doorman handled luggage, offered umbrella on rainy day.  Festively decorated lobby for the Holidays.  We felt pampered!",5,2017,01,05
121,Almost perfect,"Great hotel, service, rooms and location. An array of bars to see and restaurants. Needs a little spruce up in the corridors to make it great again, and a note about the beds. Slightly too small! If I was tall I'd be stuffed with my feet hanging over the edge and was a little crowded with two of us in it as not quite wide enough. Other than that very good. ",4,2017,01,04
121,Nice Hotel with a Great Location and Wonderful Staff,"I stayed in this hotel in December, traveling with a colleague/friend who had business in our London office. We chose the hotel based on proximity to our office and her previous experience with the property. We flew from the states overnight, so our room was not yet ready when we arrived at the hotel at 8am. However the staff was more than accommodating, escorting us and our bags to the spa where we were able to shower and change before heading out for the day. They even retrieved our bags from the spa so we never had to tote them around ourselves. Our room was a bit small as expected, but the layout provided plenty of room to store bags, etc. The bed was comfortable, we had cable tv and USB plugs, and a very nice and well-lit bathroom. The hotel loaned us two outlet & voltage converters after we discovered the one I brought did not work, which was very much appreciated. We enjoyed free breakfast during our stay, which was a nice buffet with several options. We had nothing but good experiences with the staff, being greeted by everyone we saw on our way in and out. Our room had a view of the building next door, which didn't bother us since we were rarely in the room, but I might ask for a street view next time. Westminster Abbey, the House of Parliament, Big Ben, and the London Eye are all walkable in one direction, Buckingham Palace and a main stop for all of the bus tours are walkable in another direction, and there is an underground stop just a few blocks away which made it very easy to get about town. The street the hotel is on is quiet at night so we never heard any road noise and felt very safe walking back from a night out. I really cannot think of anything negative about this hotel. I would stay here again for sure.",5,2017,01,04
121,Great Hotel,"After reading the negative reviews that some people had written about the bedrooms I phoned the hotel to reassure myself thay I hadn't made a mistake by booking this hotel - On arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was nicely decorated clean and a good size .King size extra comfy bed. Bathroom was a good size, our shower was over the bath,(not everyone's choice)
We ate in the restaurant first evening,steak was excellent, priced ok for London 
Enjoyable lounge bar to relax in the evening listening to the piano player
Location, short walk to Buckingham Palace",5,2017,01,03
121,Magical in the festive season.,"I chose a Taj hotel as we had recently enjoyed a stay in their Cape Town hotel.  This was a mixture of business and pleasure with two friends who are also colleagues. 
The location is fabulous and the lobby and bar area at Christmas is decked out extravagantly but tastefully. 
Service was fabulous, particularly in the cocktail bar where the barman made his signature cocktail for us.  Lots of good eating options in and around the hotel.  The food in the main restaurant was really,really good( foie gras starter especially tasty) although we were the only diners a week before xmas so it was a little lacking in atmosphere.  
The only real downside of our one night stay was that my room, due for refurbishment, was very cold due to badly fitting windows. On complaining I was immediately moved to an executive room which had plainly had a recent makeover and though not as charming as the original room was much better suited to the business traveller.
I will definitely stay here again - great value for money, excellent staff and a grand location.",4,2017,01,03
121,Ok ,"Myself and husband stayed here just st before NYE, when I opened this as a surprise in xmas day I was over the moon!
However as glamorous as it looks it's very deceiving. 
The room
We stayed in was a smoking room, which my husband wanted, did smell very smoky as we hit the corridor (would not recommend)
Room
Was basic 
However we used room
Service and had breakfast in bed this service was great and staff were brilliant, just think the rooms could be updated. ",3,2017,01,03
121,IDEAL PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON,"Went to London for the New Year celebrations. This hotel is situated on the fringe of the popular tourist areas. It is in a quiet spot, which is ideal if you want to have a break from the hustle and bustle. The hotel is of a very high standard , as is the food and service. The price is reasonable in comparison to other hotels in this location. We would stay there again and recommend it.",5,2017,01,03
121,Good location with a Taj Brand,"Good location within walking distance /15 mins drive to most of the central London places to visit.  Though centrally located, its on a quiet road with close proximity to St. james Park ( 2 mins walk) and Victoria Station (10 mins).  Behind the street, there is a department store - House of Fraser and few other stores - Mango, Zara, M&S, Clarks etc. which are so less crowded compared to the oxford street. Someone who is looking for a peaceful shopping, they can find their stuff here (within 5-10 mins walk). Tried to make our stay as comfortable as possible, there was a Christmas present for the kid, which he quite enjoyed.  Service was good and food at Bistro was tasty and fast to the table.  Manager on duty, Concierge and Security - in general, they were all nice and welcoming.  All in all, a good stay.",4,2017,01,03
121,"Great hotel, great location; although poor service","Great hotel located in a strategic place with walking access to great sights. Overall, the service is a far cry and does not match the promise. The concierge service was least helpful; room service quality poor and overall service standards not in keeping with the Taj brand.",3,2017,01,03
121,New Year's Eve 2016,"We stayed here for New Year's Eve with some friends.  The location was ideal for us as we were going on a river cruise for the evening which ended with seeing the fireworks.  From this hotel we could walk to Westminster Pier, which was great.  Certainly good for getting home afterwards as so many of the underground stations round the area had to be closed for safety reasons as everyone is leaving at the same time!

The hotel was lovely, room ok and adequate.  We only booked a double room, so I am sure the 'executive' rooms are better, but as we did not arrive back to the hotel until 2am, this was a good choice.

Bar prices were very high, with a service charge added, but was expected for a London hotel.  Breakfast was included and was good, even though service was a little slow, but as breakfast was up until 11am and we arrived around 10.20, I think it was their busiest time.  Food was good though and the staff were working extremely hard.

I would recommend staying here.",5,2017,01,03
121,Beautiful ,"Stayed here for the New Year weekend, beautiful hotel and decor, very friendly helpful staff, and in a great central location 
Room had a lovely view over the courtyard and rooms were spotless and decorated beautifully 
Would definetly return!",5,2017,01,03
121,Enjoyed my stay but disappointed with service ,"I stayed here for 2 nights, lovely hotel but upon leaving I left my phone charger plugged into the wall and rang about 2 hours after checking out. The lost property department were very unhelpful and didn't even offer to ask what room I was staying in or what item I'd lost and told me to wait a few hours before they looked for my item even though new customers were in the room by then as check in is 2PM. Rang back and surprise nothing was found so someone else clearly has a new iPhone 6 charger and this is why I don't trust any maid service and certainly isn't no point in lost property if people are going to keep your items anyway. Won't be staying here again. ",1,2017,01,02
121,Very impressed ,"I usually only write reviews when I'm either very satisfied with an experience or very dissatisfied. My boyfriend and I stayed in the St. James' hotel for a few nights around Christmas time. And, In this case, I was very impressed with the hotel itself and the staff. It was spotless, and the staff would have bent of backwards to make our stay even more enjoyable! 5* standard. Our room was very roomy - especially for London, and fully equipped with everything we required.
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
",5,2017,01,02
121,Elena Vavilova,"We didn't get the room we paid for for the first night. Even when we got a better room for the second night, we couldn't open the window due to noise from an air conditioner outside the window. The first night room was clastrophobic with frosted window. When we open the window we got piping and air conditioners in front of our window with constant noise. The room had no bath as was promised on the room photos on the hotel website. Generally there was a shirking contrast between website photos and the room. It was very disappointing especially taking into account that we booked the room 4 months in advance.",1,2017,01,02
121,Favourite London bolthole ,"I've been going to this hotel since it was a Crowne Plaza. The rooms are clean, well-appointed and very comfortable. The rooms facing the internal courtyard are very quiet. Since the Taj Group took over, the service has improved immeasurably, particularly in The Hamptons bar. The bar manager (lovely bloke, beard, don't know his name) makes sure the service is great. If I had a request, I'd like to be able to get a small breakfast without having to pay approx £25. The Royal Quarter Cafe over the road is full of Taj guests wanting the same. The concierge, housekeepers and  door staff are really friendly and helpful. ",5,2017,01,01
121,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London.","Excellent Hotel in a beautiful setting surrounding Victorian buildings The Bank Restaurant in the hotel has the best setting in London! Excellent service throughout Friendly helpful staff, immaculate rooms and reception. Highly recommended",5,2017,01,01
121,"st james taj hotel, buckingham gate.  a rare gem in the heart of london",you could not find a friendlier hotel anywhere in london.  the staff are wonderful and make you feel very welcome.  it is very central and the concierge can get you a taxi very quickly or park your car for you. there is a very pretty courtyard and the rooms are perfect.,5,2017,01,01
121,another great stay,We love staying at the St. james - location is perfect for whatever you want to do - and see and the staff are all very helpful and waiting to be of service to you.  we have stayed at this hotel 2 times - and both visits were excellent.  We found great places to eat around the hotel - and also found it easy to get around the city.  We had lots of sightseeing to do and found it very easy from this location,5,2017,01,01
121,Very convenient,"This hotel is have bigger size for standard room than other hotel in London. Very convenient location in the centre, walking distance to most attraction place in London.Near location tube station and easy to find taxi.Also friendly staf",4,2017,01,01
121,Only Place We Stay When Visiting London!,"St James' Court Hotel and Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites are the only places we stay while visiting London for business or leisure.  The management and staff are the best!  

Special thanks to Sunaina (Mgr), Mr. Paul (Chef) and the room service team, the Bell Desk Team and the Housekeeping Team for their excellent service.  

We highly recommend St James' Court Hotel and Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and we look forward to returning again soon.",5,2017,01,01
121,Best value high standard London hotel,"We had been impressed everyday during our stay at St James' Court, A Taj Hotel, by the size and comfort of our room, service and knowledge of the concierge, cleanliness of the common areas and the guest room, ambience of the lobby, it's very central location close to London Underground, and best of all, a diverse buffet breakfast was included for our stay!   This hotel can easily be rated as 5 star, and I think it is 4 star just because it does not have a swimming pool.  ",5,2016,12,31
121,Flight canceled so a last minute booking,"I missed my connecting flight due to a five and half hour delay and was stuck in London for a night.  I panicked since it was the holiday weekend and hopped on booking.com. 
This hotel was available and affordable.  

I was not disappointed.  This is located two short blocks from Buckingham Palace and not far from any other main London attraction. 

The hotel has a beautiful lobby and several restaurants and bars located within.  

My room was a typical London room - small, but quaint and lovely.  Carpet is an it outdated but the bathroom was nice and had towel heaters.  

I had dinner in Bistro 51 which had a eclectic menu.  

The staff was very warm and friendly.  I was very happy with the property and would definitely stay here again. I would just be sure to pay for the larger room. ",4,2016,12,31
121,Jewel by Buckingham Palace,"A first class, friendly hotel with excellent facilities, food and service levels, and a warm caring staff throughout. Walking distance from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Westminster the Cathedral and Houses of Parliament. All ran smoothly, even on a very busy Christmas Day!",5,2016,12,31
121,A delight from start to finish ( or canapés to dessert),"We booked on the recommendation from our daughter who has stayed on business ( she loves it )  & was in the area we needed to be, Westminster, although we didn't find it first time as it is so subtly signed , (local workmen didn't know it either!).  Checkin was quick & easy, but we still took time to appreciate the main reception area which was beautifully decorated for Christmas . We were delighted with our room. 
 However St James' Court will be forever remembered by us for the  taste adventure which they call 'Around the World in 80 Tastes' .   Look it up on their website, book it & enjoy . The price may seem a tad expensive but it is in fact a fabulously priced dining experience , accompanied by matching wines, showcasing signature dishes for each restaurant . We spent approx 4 hours enjoying the 'tastes', & were accompanied from each venue to the next by a staff member, a thoughtful touch.  Probably one of the best dining events we have been fortunate to enjoy.
The most contact we had with the staff were the Food & Beverage staff who were professional at all times, but also very personable & friendly towards us . They seemed proud to represent the hotel, a great impression for guests.
All in all,  our stay was a delight from start to finish......& it's so close to tube & visitor attractions!",5,2016,12,30
121,Management failure,"Executive King no-smoking room booked and prepaid - early bird rate - for night 27th December. Notified the hotel in advance re late evening arrival (9-10 pm).
Checking in, we (wife and self) were told by staff that hotel was over-booked (management failure!). 
Then we were, without notice, given a small room with a non-king bed.
On discovery of this, immediately phoned reception, who apologized and arranged another room for us. However, without informing us, the new room (did have king bed, but) was a smoking room - quite smelly and unpleasant. Too tired after whole day travelling, and not offered another alternative, we decided to stay in smoking room. Staff tried to help with Febreze sprays etc. Then we found TV not working. Maintenance staff tried to fix - no go. Then we found a light not working. Then we found the safe not working. Dreadful management.
We decided just to tolerate everything and get out as soon as we could in the morning.
Staff were very friendly and tried to help - we see the management at fault here. Suspect they will try to blame staff - unfairly.
Our advice after this experience - stay away from here.",1,2016,12,29
121,"Great location, wonderful stay","We were very pleased with our stay at St. James' Court. The location was absolutely perfect for us - a great central location with a very quick walk to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and Westminster Abbey. Easy access to both the St James and Victoria tube stops and a good number of delicious restaurants nearby (we loved La Tasca down the road in particular for dinner and Sangria and the Royal Quarter Cafe just across the street for breakfast!) Main lobby and courtyard are gorgeous, and staff is very polite and helpful. Our room was a little ""dated"" but we were not looking for modern and were happy with it and the room and bathroom were much bigger than expected! All in all, we had zero complaints, and would absolutely return! ",5,2016,12,28
121,the perfect place in London,"Near the most important London places. The staff is very kind, the room is very big, the standard one as well. And an amazing food. More than one restaurant is available; and the spa is included in the rate. During the Christmas Eve, at the bar, musicians play live jazz music. The perfect stay!",5,2016,12,28
121,Best hotel,"Best hotel in London location , value , service . any one need room  nice big , best suite been and size of the room was very good . cleanliness  ..... in general best hotel I been in London rooms near every thing ,  team of the hotel very good and do what u ask them",5,2016,12,27
121,Enjoyable one-night stay with spa treatment,"Booked a one-night stay as a pre-Christmas treat for my wife. Included a spa treatment for her. Arrival was smooth and welcoming, staff gave our 3yo son an activity pack that kept him entertained while Mum went for a massage and facial. She loved it! Lovely room (if slightly dated decor), comfortable and generous. Excellent night's sleep! We really liked this - made all the better by a bargain last-minute rate secured through Booking.com. Highly recommend this hotel, shame we never managed to eat at the Michelin-starred restaurant, we'll be back!",5,2016,12,27
121,Manager helped to make our stay better after noisy guest,"Naveen, the manager at the St. James Court hotel, helped to make our stay pleasant after the neighboring guests woke us up with loud noise early in the mornings.  After pleading with the guests in the next room to keep their voices down to no avail (they exploded further when asked to keep their voices down) Naveen solved the problem by moving us to a different floor and a nicer, quieter room.  Naveen handled the difficult guests as best he could and, by moving us made lemonade out of lemons.  Very skilled manager.  We would highly recommend him.  
",5,2016,12,27
121,Another Great Stay at TAJ,"Knowing many Taj hotels in India, the Taj St. James's Court did not fail to meet expectations. The hotel is of an excellent quality and very peaceful. Ideally located for major attractions. Plenty of taxis outside and 5 minute walk to a tube station.",5,2016,12,26
121,Paper thin walls!!,At first glance a lovely hotel in a wonderful location. Unfortunately the walls are paper thin and we could hear the family next door in the evening and early mornings. Calling down to complain didn't seem to help. Won't be coming back.,2,2016,12,25
121,Wonderful :),"This was the first visit to London from my girlfriend and I and I can honestly say we could not have picked a better hotel to stay in. 

The hotel was spotless, from the entrance to the rooms. The staff were very welcoming and well spoken. The vibe that they gave off was out standing, they really are a credit to the hotel. 
Alexsandra from reception is one of many outstanding employees we came across during our stay as well as Mimide (waitress) who were very professional and helpful for the duration of our stay. Thanks guys!! :) 

The hotels is located within a 5 minute walking distance from Buckingham palace. It is in such an accommodating location nearby many attractions such as Big Ben, West Minster and so on. The tube is literally 2 minutes away, which is easily the best, quickest and most regular form of transportation available. 
Our room was very comfortable, with a big comfy king bed! We slept like lambs during our stay. The housekeeping team were very efficient on servicing our rooms for the 3 nights we stayed. I requested a dental kit one evening and it was delivered very quickly, so I commend them on their fast pace service delivery! The lady to answered the phone too had a lovely voice, it wasn't too overly friendly to the point where it sounded fake and robotic, but rather it sound genuine, which made us feel more comfortable. 
I just love this hotel, they really do go above and beyond to maximise guest satisfaction. 
I highly recommend staying here! I myself will 100% return to this hotel whenever I find myself in London in the future.
Keep up the great work :)

121,Birthday treat,"My son had booked us a room so we could have a birthday dinner in Mayfair. As soon as I mentioned my name to the check in receptionist I felt extremely important as I was given a personal butler and shown to my suite as I had been upgraded
The suite was stunning as was the hotel. The service from every single member of staff was impeccable and will certainly stay there again",5,2016,12,24
121,Very positive experience,"A very good hotel:  location, service, and value.  Excellent presentation in lobby, etc.  Could walk to many attractions, and the subway was very convenient for distant travel.  Excellent presentation:  lobby, personal, etc.",5,2016,12,24
121,Surprisingly large room,"Although quite pricey the room was spacious with a separate lounge area and a huge bed. 
The gym was small but adequate although in a different building and we got wet getting to it, maybe invest in a covered walkway? 
The bathroom was a little dated and light for doing makeup was not great. Good location although quite a long way from shopping areas. 
Breakfast was good but squashed into a strange restaurant. ",4,2016,12,24
121,Taj Suites,"This was the second stay this year at the Taj. It is definitely on par with the Four Seasons. A fantastic place to stay with attention to detail. Let's hope they open more hotels in London major cities. 

No complaints and I look forward to my next visit.",5,2016,12,23
121,Friendly Staff,"We had a pleasant two night stay here last week. There was excellent furnishings and friendly/attentive staff in the lobby/reception area.

However we were disappointed in the upkeep of the room. There was a lot of wear and tear i.e. mark on the front door, skirting pulling away, the bath tub peeling away. I'm not usually bothered by this when staying in hotels too much but this room felt especially like it hadn't been as cared for as the main areas.

On a positive note the location of the hotel was perfect and we walked everywhere - if you don't mind a lot of walking this would be perfect! ",3,2016,12,21
121,Amazing,"We stayed at this hotel on 17th for one night. Honestly can't fault it. Best hotel we have stayed in when visiting London. Would highly recommend for families. Our 2 year daughter received a kids back pack with wax crayons and colouring pad. When we got to our room the was a wash bag for our daughter which had Johnson's shampoo, body wash, oil, wipes and a foam duck. This hotel is in the perfect location. Set back from the hustle and bustle but within walking distance to all the main tourist attractions. Can't wait to stay here again. ",5,2016,12,21
121,Fantastic place,"This is a wonderful hotel. My husband and I stayed for one night as an early celebration for my birthday. We were offered an upgrade and a cake which was wonderful. The hotel has a lovely feel to it ... with very comfy beds! 
I had a facial in the spa as well which was so relaxing. 

I would highly recommend this hotel - we certainly hope to visit again. ",5,2016,12,21
121,Weekend break,"Stayed in the hotel at the beginning of December.  It was very nice, the staff were friendly (may be a bit to much) rooms were very clean and tidy hotel was well kept. Hotel was close to The underground and The palace.",4,2016,12,21
121,Great all round,The hotel is beautiful and the staff were fantastic. Had a lovely meal in the Bistro 51. We will definitely be back. Excellent location short walk to Buckingham Palace and the houses of Westminster. Thank you.,5,2016,12,20
121,Fab Place to stay,"This is our third stay at this lovely hotel. I can not fault this hotel, the staff cant do enough for you, the rooms are clean and just perfect. The location is just what we like about this hotel, I would recommend this Hotel to anybody with out hesitation.",5,2016,12,20
121,Stay at Taj Hotel - London,Overall good hotel - Evening offered to post me my electronic toothbrush which I had accidentally left behind! Room was satisfactory - Management Conference facilities are good but more staff awareness to direct us to appropriate locations,4,2016,12,19
121,Fantastic romantic stay,"Great hotel and in a very handy location for visiting numerous London attractions.  Just beside two tube stations.  Hotel room was massive and on 5th floor so very quiet.  Used the KONA restaurant for a High Tea experience and were treated like royalty.  Cant wait to go back.  So much better that a ""New Box Hotel""",5,2016,12,19
121,hospitality at its best,"just a 1 night stay this time, I have used this hotel over the years in all its guises for business and pleasure as the location and room rate is hard to beat . This was a trip with my wife for her birthday, and the place has now had some investment and has come into its own and is reaching its obvious potential.
Thanks to the front desk for accommodating our room-type request and also a nice touch to return to the room late at night to find a nice cake too.
Very well done",5,2016,12,18
121," Corporate Travel Agent Review ","We stayed here in December for our work Xmas party, it all started well, the check in staff were polite and helpful and checked us in as quickly as possible for a large group of people at a busy time between 2-3pm. 
However, when I arrived to my room, it was a box room in comparison to my colleagues  rooms who had paid the same amount and booked then booked the same room type. for. Also the room I arrived into had a dirty condom on the floor, I didn't complain on this occasion as I didn't have time due to having to be at my work Xmas party within an hour.
Upon arrival back to our hotel coming out of the lift, we quietly said goodbye to our colleagues who were continuing up to a higher level of the hotel and surprised to be told to ""be silent, you are in a hotel"" by the night manager Johann Rodriguez, bearing in mind the lifts were right next to a conference room and we was quietly saying goodbye to friends and no other words were spoken, upon arriving back to my room it had a ""noxious smell"" considering we are in a non smoking room/floor this wasn't very comfortable for us. 
I felt really disappointed by this treatment and by the size of the room, I have stayed in many 5* hotels and have never had to pay a rate for something very unsatisfactory for what it actually is. 
All in all, I would not recommend staying here and most certainly wouldn't stay here again when there are plenty of other hotels within the area who offer much larger rooms and more complimentary service which is personal and friendly service like the St Ermin's where I stayed last year. ",1,2016,12,16
121,All round winner,"Booked through Evoline.com (£215 B&B per night v Hotel £330) the hotel was extremely welcoming upon arrival with good humour & an informative overview from Isabella. Room 758 was more than ample room size with a comfy double bed for my single business trip occupancy. Facilities were all operational, lifts were quick and the staff and food in the restaurant were excellent. Highly recommend this hotel as 5 mins from St James tube station and within 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace or Westminster Abbey, 25 minute walk from Trafalgar Square and the West End. Highly recommended venue, thank you.",5,2016,12,16
121,Taj Hospitality Close to Home,"Having travelled in India on several occasions both for business and leisure I love Taj Hotels for their style, spirit, excellent service and hospitality. Here in the UK its a pleasure to stay at the Taj St James in London.Its a haven of comfort and luxury after a busy day at work or play; close to St James Park underground its well connected too. In my experience it's great value compared with some of it's illustrious competitors on the Mayfair side of the Park.",5,2016,12,15
121,Duke of Edinburgh Awards. ,A great hotel. Me and my mum aren't really used to hotels of this quality. All of the staff were great and all very helpful. The cocktails we had in the evening were amazing. Great stay the only area for improvement would be to have more than one tea bag in the room. ,4,2016,12,15
121,Cozy Hotel in heart of London,"I have been here more than 20 times during past 30 years. This place has improved a lot under its new Indian ownership. It's still the ""best buy"" in entire central London. The restaurants and bars have also much improved since the new Owners took over. I saw that Barack and Michelle Obama signed the guest book in the Bar last year - Congratulations.",4,2016,12,15
121,Very pleasant stay,Very good experience for a one night stop over. Staff pleasant and welcoming. Bathroom showing signs of aging. Bar service in lobby on slow side.

121,"Excellent, friendly hotel","I have been using the Taj since it opened.  The accommodation is excellent as are the food and service.  The staff are exceedingly helpful, polite and friendly, in fact they are one of the hotel's greatest assets.  And, what's not to like about a hotel that includes a curry dish at breakfast!",5,2016,12,14
121,another wonderful experience,"this was our third time at the Taj and again the hotel and staff were amazing, we wouldn't stay anywhere else, we have had different rooms each time and they were all excellent, the staff were very pleasant and attentive, I had an incident at breakfast where I felt a little unwell and left my table to go outside for some air while standing one of the waitresses came out with a glass of water and asked if I was ok, I wasn't even aware of anyone seeing me leave, she was very busy but still came to make sure I was feeling better. the food in the restaurants was delicious and again we were not disappointed with service. Will be back next year!!!",5,2016,12,14
121,Christmas visit,Stayed on the 9th December for 2 nights. The room was good very clean but I think the price for the mini bar was very expensive. The staff were excellent if a but over the top. Never gave me a minute over breakfast even poured my tea took my plate away as soon as I put down my fork. Hung  around whilst you were eating Luke crows. Would stay again.,5,2016,12,12
121,Good Hotel,"This hotel is situated in a very good location, it is near Victoria Station and not far from the West End.

I will defiantly come back.",4,2016,12,12
121,Pleasant surprise,"Due to unforeseen issues, my husband and I had to book a hotel in London to go to American Embassy.  We used booking.com and this appeared to be the best value at the last minute.  I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experiece.  We were never treated as inferior guests, our room was spotlessly clean, close to the elevator and each member of the staff was warm, wecoming, efficient and helpful.  I would rate this as one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.  I wish we could have stayed longer. Loooking forward to returning someday and will recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues.",5,2016,12,12

121,Fantastic food in the Bistro,"Please pass on thanks to your staff for making us feel most welcome from the moment we arrived in Hampton's to the welcome in the Bistro through the professional service and friendly but not over familiar service to the farewell at the end. it is always a pleasure to dine here and gives me great pride knowing i can always rely on such consistency.

Needless to say the food was most excellent and too the high standard i have come to expect from the Culinary team at the Taj;Saint James Court; please pass on my thanks and best regards to Vinod, Amarjit and the Bistro team working that day.

once again many thanks and look forward to formulating an excuse to return.",5,2016,12,11
121,Beautiful experience,"We stayed at this hotel as my sister was receiving her MBE at the palace and the location meant we could walk in a few minutes. She uses a power wheel chair and there needed the disable room, which was fantastic, I had the adjoining room with interlocking door, which meant we could share the experience of getting ready etc really easily. We had room service which was bought up and set up on a lavish table, really enhanceing the specialness of the stay. All the staff we happy, helpful and polite.the live piano music in the evening made for a lovely atmosphere in the reception area.
We are in the restaurant , which was delicious and had he royal afternoon tea in the adjoining building where they made a fuss of my sister and treated us very well.
Can't recommend enough!",5,2016,12,10
121,"A bit 'posh' for our taste, but great breakfast and base for London visit","Hotel is indeed in great location as other reviewers have also mentioned. Room was nice, a bit noisy though. The bathroom was small because there is a tub and a shower, and a recommendation that the door needs to be closed during shower to prevent the fire alarm to go on due the steam. So whenever one was in shower, the bathroom couldn't be used for a while - so foggy, damp and steamy it was. Bed was pretty soft, but ok. 
The tea, coffee and waters were complimentary, which was great! Cleaning was done a bit too properly: every single time, the soap was replaced even if I had used it only once! Not very environmental friendly way, so I wasn't very convinced about this hotel's sustainability. 
Breakfast was truly great! Everything was so yummy and you could taste that everything was done properly, no processed food. Service at the breakfast was very good, also outside, where there was always someone taking care of the taxi service :) Our check in didn't go as I hoped and I was very disappointed how it was handled. Otherwise the service we received was very good, so it depends on who serves you. 
All in all, very pleasant stay, but maybe for our next London visit, we'll select another hotel.",4,2016,12,10
121,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights. This hotel was ideally located near the underground, St James park and Victoria.  The staff were very professional and engaging. The lobby was lovely all decorated for Christmas. Our room overlooked the courtyard. It was very quiet, you wouldn't think you were in London. The bed was very comfortable.  The room was spotless.  Water pressure in the shower was good.  The room was warm but at least you could open the windows for some air. I would recommend this hotel for a special trip.  The breakfast was expensive so try to get a deal with breakfast.  Overall an excellent hotel.",4,2016,12,10
121,Very pleasant stay,"Excellent hotel and professional staff made this trip wonderful experience. Will highly recommend the hotel to our friends. Are most likely to come again. The hotel is luxurious and the location could hardly be better with Buckingham Palace, close and Victoria station in the neighbourhood.",4,2016,12,10
121,Always dependable,"Great value, convenient location, helpful staff. They have a fabulous restaurant where I eat every chance possible. My room was comfortable with a separate sitting area. No view, but nice space. I have stayed here 3 times now. There is a reson I go back!!",5,2016,12,09
121,"Lovely Stay, great location, friendly staff","Although I would agree that some areas of the hotel seem dated, upon closer inspection, I found this hotel to be lovely, upscale and quite regal in nature. I would say it is more like classic and traditional, with upscale touches. We stayed upon arrival in London and then again just before departure. They upgraded us. The bar is quite nice and the drinks are wonderful. Nice smoking area just in the courtyard. Room was well equipped. Bed was comfy. Short walk to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and plenty of shopping. I would consider this hotel as upscale and classic. Well equipped and the staff is really quite helpful and attentive. Great choice for a London stay. Easy walk from Victoria station",5,2016,12,07
121,"Basic hotel, but great location","Normally a Taj hotel is luxurious but unfortunately this one in London offers more of a 'Holiday Inn' interior and service quality....even though we had a relatively good rate for booking early and staying 5 nights, we expected a more elegant hotel especially as it is conveniently and centrally located near the palace, the Mall, the parks and a 15 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Sq...but as it was, the hotel was mediocre at best, the rooms small and old, the buffet breakfast limited and not comforting and the service a tad laisser faire....I would stay again but you really have to insist on a decent room before settling in...it was the 3rd room I saw that was acceptable but the other 2 were shoddy...",3,2016,12,06
121,perfect,"We had a (larger than standard in London) room on the 6th floor, overlooking the courtyard. Very quiet and well maintained with a very large and perfect kings size bed. Bathroom not too big, but with all amenities needed. Very friendly staff, breakfast buffet with warm and cold dishes (and some more to order). Also paid a visit to the spa: small steamroom (good eucalyptus-mint smell) and dito sauna. Location is perfect.",5,2016,12,06
121,A spectacular hotel,"This hotel is wonderful! The location is perfectly situated with easy access to all London has to offer. The staff is extremely helpful and always eager to assist if need be, I was greeted by name and with a genuine smile throughout my 4 day stay. My room was attended to in a timely matter and the room attendant was fantastic, each night returning to my guestroom, I was relieved to know I would step into a clean and fresh room. I had the opportunity to make an appointment at their on-site salon, DAR BLO BAR, one word....Incredible! Their prices for a blow out were reasonable and Dar  and his assistant Jessica made me feel right at home! I would highly recommend their services. Overall, perfect stay and I would recommend and return in a heartbeat!",5,2016,12,06
121,Excellent Hotel Value,This is a beautiful hotel that is very well located to many of the prime sight seeing locations in London. Staff is not only very courteous but is extremely willing to answer questions and make recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants.,5,2016,12,06
121,A wonderful stay at the Taj,"Great location. Superb hospitality, exactly as one would expect from the Taj Group. Excellent room and amenities. Staff at all points were very courteous. No complaints whatsoever. Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,05
121,Good location good staff average product,"Front Desk staff was really good. The young lady was very professional and very descriptive on amenities location and restaurant. The Bell Desk guy was also very professional. 
I wasn't a fan of the rooms. Bathrooms are dated. TV is small. That said, staff was good. And so was the location. Got a great rate and was overall happy. ",3,2016,12,04
121,Nice hotel in a quiet central location,"My nephew and I stayed here for a week during Thanksgiving week. We got room 567, which has a nice view of the newer/modern buildings in back of the hotel. It was pretty quiet; we did not hear any of our neighbors. We got a classic king room and the size of the room was sufficient for two people. The bed was comfortable and you could adjust the temp in the room (own thermostat). Small TV though.

I had informed them beforehand that it was my nephew's birthday when we get there - they surprised us with a chocolate cake with a happy birthday greeting when we got back to the hotel after an afternoon/evening of exploring London. That was a nice touch.

The hotel lobby is lovely. They have a very responsive/helpful/friendly staff. It is very close to the St. James tube station and a block away from the closest bus station. It is also very close to the Victoria Coach Station, where you could catch a ride to Oxford University.  

I love its quiet central location - far enough from the sea of people you find in the Mayfair, Piccadilly and Leicester areas of London - yet central enough that you are walking distance or a short ride away from the tourist attractions.

There are restaurants/pubs/bars/cafes around the area. There's also a pharmacy and a small grocery store close by. There's also a small theatre around the corner that we tried during our trip.",4,2016,12,02
121,Leisure trip,"Classic double room which was a good size and equipped with everything you could need for a comfortable stay, and it was lovely and quiet with a view of the courtyard. Breakfast was good with a choice of English and Indian cooked items and some lovely pastries, although the buffet area was a little cramped. Good to be served both tea, coffee and toast at the table. Hotel was in an excellent location for visiting sights, shopping and for the Apollo Theatre to see Wicked.",4,2016,12,02
121,Birthday treat for my wife,"The icing on the cake for my wife's birthday. Every thing was topnotch - complimentary upgrade and birthday cake !   The staff were welcoming friendly, helpful and courteous. the room was welcoming and well fitted and the hotel itself was quite special. No hesitation in going again.",5,2016,12,02
121,Should not be a Taj,"Tired rooms, with broken fixtures and fittings and draughty windows.  The service at the front desk is good and the public areas are great but if you choose one of the non-refurbished rooms don't expect anything like Taj standards of quality.  Peeling wallpaper with patches, stained marble and the sense that you are in a 25 year old room with a thin veneer of paint to make it look acceptable.  The rooms are noisy too partly because of the gaps between the windows and the frames which let in cold draughts.  If they had any sense, they would only offer the upgraded rooms.  Right now they risk their reputation, and they will find it hard to get it back.",1,2016,12,01
121,MatureTravelers,"Historic Luxury Hotel is in great location. Catch a double-decker to anywhere just blocks away.  However, this is not most comfortable place to stay: mattresses, squeaky floors, weird hallways with stairs, and tiny room-size with minimal soundproofing will detract from experience. Staff is very courteous, but don't expect to check in early. Location near restaurants and Victoria Station plus new ""mall"" could overcome all the drawbacks for some.",3,2016,12,01
121,A memrable stay,"Having stayed at the Taj Boston with an excellent impression of it I made a reservation at St.James' Court, also a Taj hotel, for a week-long visit with my sister. It is a beautiful hotel in an historic building with an amazing inner courtyard. The service was extremely efficient and professional and most notable was Naveen Sikka whose friendly smile and willingness to help were memorable. He made our stay at the hotel great and I have recommended St. James' Court to my daughter who will be visiting London next year.
Thank you Naveen Sikka and the rest of the staff!",5,2016,12,01
121,always great,"I have been visiting this hotel for years, the staff are brilliant, the location is great for business and leisure. The hotel continually looks for ways to improve but still keep its traditional heritage. Whilst I did not eat this time the standard of food completes the picture. A 4 star hotel with 5 star service it is always my first choice when staying in London",5,2016,11,30
121,Wellness Centre,"Very helpful and efficient staff and general hotel amenities, although I didn't have any meals in the hotel.  Be prepared for a few twists and turns in corridors to find your room.  Only slightly disappointing aspect was the steam / sauna area (part of the Wellness Centre) which was quite small and in need of a makeover.",5,2016,11,30
121,Excellent place to stay,"Loved the people, the concierge group was unbelievably helpful.  The location in the best so close to many attraction in London and an easy walk to many.  Food is good.  Bar area very nice and relaxing.  Piano player at night adds to the atmosphere. You won't go wrong staying here....",5,2016,11,30
121,Another Good Stay,"As we expected our stay was what we expected.  The room was comfortable and well serviced and the hotel has excellent services.  It is ideally located for access to the attraction software London whether Sites, Shops or Restaurants",4,2016,11,30
121,exquisite!,"stayed in ""Classic Family Room"" with 2 double beds. I have stayed here before in the early 2000s and it was just as incredible! The concierge was super helpful to tell us some great restaurants and bars in the area as well. I can't say anything bad about this hotel other than I couldn't stay here longer!",5,2016,11,29
121,First rate staff and service,"Front desk staff welcoming and charming. The bedroom was a bit cold but the duvet was lovely and warm and the pillows were plump.  There was a dressing gown and slippers available in the wardrobe too.  TV had plenty of channels and the bathroom was nicely equipped with towels and toiletries.  Breakfast was served in one of the restaurants and was a help-yourself buffet, though you could have fried or poached eggs cooked to order.  It was all good quality and plentiful.  My only dislike is having coffee poured at the same time as receiving my fruit juice, as by the time I've finished my cooked breakfast and started on the toast, the coffee is cold.  It's not  problem for anyone else, it seems as it is standard practice.",5,2016,11,29
121,Christmas,We arrived from Riyadh early Monday morning. My husband was due to go to work and I was staying at hotel. The reception staff managed to get us our room early. We were very grateful. Room lovely and clean. Wonderful toiletries. Hotel in a wonderful location to central London.,5,2016,11,29
121,Excellent stay in center of London.,"Walking in to the Taj St. James' Court was a breath of fresh air.  The lobby had a live pianist and was nicely decorated for the festive season.
Rooms were clean and washrooms well fitted.
Room service was prompt and served hot.
The courtyard was lovely providing shelter from the rain.",4,2016,11,29
121,better options to choose from,"non-smoking room, was used for smoking, no option to change the room. Outside a lot of noise from the airco/heating unit, so opening a window was neither an option.     Location of the hotel, but i would take another one next time.",2,2016,11,28
121,Truly Taj ,"The name resonates with luxury and great hospitality and the st James is no less. The hotel is a great mix of a British town house with modern twists. Very centrally located (Victoria is like 5 mins) and all the the sights are pretty close by, we didn't have an opportunity to try the food there but we can imagine with 2 Michelin stars it's something to look up to. We had two rooms and I got upgraded since I am a Taj member (which I suggest you become once you check in , since it saves you a lot of money in the hotel) but my colleague was in the basic category room. He was on the 8th floor which is sort of underwhelming and tiny ! Also seems a bit dated sort of got overlooked while the renovation drive was on. Apart from the room sizes all in all a great hotel ... ",5,2016,11,28
121,Girl's Weekend Getaway,"Great location not far from Tube.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Problem with heat in room and a couple of unsuccessful attempts to fix.  When the manager came in on Monday, it was resolved very quickly.  We were in London for only 4 nights and when a change of rooms was offered on night 3, it didn't seem worth the effort so we declined that option.",4,2016,11,28
121,Great Location,We had to stay in London for a few days as we were attending a Reception at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.  Didn't realise how near the hotel was to the Palace so we were even able to walk home from our Reception.  Staff were extremely polite at all times and it was great that you could order food up until 11.00pm.,5,2016,11,28
121,Mr,"First class !! However the cooked breakfast is much better in less star hotels in London , we paid £20 per person for breakfast and felt over charged !I would stay at this hotel again because of its position but would decline paying for breakfast !",5,2016,11,27
121,Very good hotel,"It was cozy and clean room And they served very delicious breakfast It is the best location near bigben and westminster abbey, etc. When I go to London, I'll visit this hotel again. My boyfriend was satisfied with this hotel.",4,2016,11,27
121,Location is the only benefit why this hotel is still there,"We have booked several nights in this beautiful Hotel (according to the Pictures you can see everywhere - e.g. booking.com). However, we had been disappointed in every way.  Booked a classic room, where the bathroom looked like it had been never refurbished till today and was dirty. Hotel tried to hide the completely dirty window with a Kind of Jalousie.  After our complaint, we had been moved to another room - executive which was ok. we had been told that this was refurbished and the other is more classic Old style!?! There is a difference between an Old rotted room and an Old well maintained room.  Moreover, it´s a nice trick by the Hotel to don´t Display the real Hotel room (especially bathroom) on various platforms for their classic rooms. One will be misguided by the other better rooms. I can´t understand why this Hotel is still ranked with such a high Rating.  Entrance hall was really beautiful - friendliness of staff was ok but not comparable with real Taj Standard in India.   Food Corner is comparable small and staff not really well trained, especially in the second floor where you will be moved most of the time as breakfast hall downstairs is really small.  LOCATION is the and only Advantage of this hotel. Easy to travel everywhere...  In contrast to all above mentioned Facts that rate what you pay in this Hotel is not justified at all!  Not recommended from our side...",2,2016,11,26
121,Good hotel needing some TLC,"Excellently located in S James, within walking distance of most of London's tourist sights, in a beautiful historic former hospital building.

Public areas reflect the Indian management, and add a touch of glamour. Restaurants and bars are elegant and cosy.

The bedrooms and corridors let the hotel down, and a soft refurb of these areas are long overdue. However, this is reflected in some of the discounted room rates offered online.

Staff are highly professional, polite and friendly with a sense of humour.

Food is excellent, and breakfast is comprehensive.

A good base for a luxury weekend break in historic London.

",4,2016,11,26
121,A warm blanket of hospitality...Recommended for Single Travellers,"This was my first experience with the hotel and definitely not my last. As a single traveller it is important for me to be surrounded by kind people who are authentic and professional, so I was very happy with the kind reception I received, everywhere in the hotel. Usually the rooms for singles in London are extremely small, but not so with this hotel. That together with the excellent housekeeping and overall atmosphere... well there is a great change Taj St James will become my favorite London hotel! Thank you!",5,2016,11,25
121,Nice hotel close by the center ,"Nice hotel clean and friendly staff and good welcoming but we had the room on the 38*and the Internet single was so poor and keep cutting all time even the Internet is free 
 
There are a quiet good restaurants around it and thy are good ",4,2016,11,25
121,Business hotel visit,"Nice room and very good service at the bar.  Awful restaurant and breakfast service.  The location is perfect and the character of the hotel is intriguing.  However, despite a nice atmosphere the important things are failing.",3,2016,11,24
121,London Delight,"Nice Hotel with groomed staffs, good food, clean room, proper gym, perfect location, promptness, excellent concierge etc. we enjoyed our stay in this beautiful environment and continue staying while in London",5,2016,11,24
121,Everything was perfect,"Check in was easy and the lobby is beautiful.  They let us check out the room before bringing our bags up,  and the room was lovely.

A living room with beautiful decor that was comfortable and a joy to end the night in.  The bedroom had a king bed and the mattress was very good.  We had an upper floor, so no noise at all. 

The bathroom had everything you needed and all the amenities you look for and expect.   Robe/slippers were supplied and loved.     Air Conditioning throughout was welcome in the hot weather....when it comes in London, it's a must to have AC after a long day in the heat.  

The breakfast was probably the best we have ever had anywhere in the world.  The scrambled eggs were perfection.....I've tried to replicate, but can't.  All the food we ordered was fantastic.

The courtyard is beautiful and we loved being able to eat outside in such pretty surroundings.

The staff were all wonderful, helpful and professional.  Buckingham Palace close and we walked to most all attractions.   Loved London & can't say enough about this hotel.  Totally recommend.",5,2016,11,23
121,Wonderful!,"We loved this hotel. It is an older building that has been well maintained and upgraded. The staff were helpful and the complimentary breakfast buffet was wonderful. The location is great, we walked to lots of sights. Try Quilon, the Indian restaurant in the hotel. We had the best dinner, it was delicious. My only complaint would be that the bed is a little smaller than we are used to but that is it.",5,2016,11,22
121,Unresolved issues let this good hotel down,"Having stayed the previous week for two nights in a deluxe room (and eaten with our family of 8; a really poor meal in one of the hotel restaurants) we were still looking forward to our one night stay the following weekend having booked an upgraded room. 

Imagine our surprise and disappointment when there was no note of our upgrade and no upgrade rooms available, even though we had been assured that this was ""on the system"". I complained and was told on a number of occasions by reception that I would receive a call from the Manager. I never did.

Nevertheless, we do like the hotel and would stay again.",4,2016,11,22
121,Location is the only advantage.,"The hotel is out of date, service is average. The only reason I stayed here is the proximity to the main attractions of London. Chauffeur service upon request. Quilon restaurant is 2 Michelin stars, worth trying. Stay away from the Royal sandwiches.",3,2016,11,22
121,Saint James Court London,Perfect location close to Victoria Station and Saint James Park underground - walking distance from Buckingham Palace and Parlement. Parts of the hotel haven been recently renovated.  Good price / quality rates especially for the area where it is located. Hotel staff friendly and very helpfull,4,2016,11,21
121,Great Place,"Excellent journey - Central, High quality - Easy access from Victoria station from Gatwick airport with Gatwick express - Close to Buckingham palace and Westminster Abbey & Westminster Cathedral - Excellent restaurants - Food and Service",5,2016,11,21
121,The NUMERO UNO PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON,"The NUMERO UNO PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON..nothing compared to it. The hospitality, service, rooms, food and even the atmosphere is amazing. Be it business trip, holiday, with children it the most recomended place to stay.",5,2016,11,21
121,Wonderful Visit,"Loved this stylish hotel which is situated in an excellent position for Buckingham Palace and the parks plus a pleasant walk to the West End.

Check in was easy and there is a lovely feel to the lobby area and adjoining bars and restaurant.

We asked for a quiet room on a high floor away from the lifts and our requests were met.

Lovely room very well appointed and a comfortable bed.

We were lucky with breakfast as we arrived early but a longish queue developed as we left.Breakfast excellent as were the staff.

Would not hesitate to return.",5,2016,11,21
121,Clean and good quality,"Always get a clean room, good service, and a very good restaurant - I like staying here.  I'd stay at the Doubletree out of preference  since it's normally a bit cheaper), but this is always my next choice!",5,2016,11,21
121,Great Location Beautiful Place,"We stayed here for 5 days.  Our first trip to London.  We were so impressed with the staff and the rooms were very modern.  Enjoyed the teas and surprised by the instant coffee. The location was perfect to see all of the sights. Only downfall...my Husband thought he was using a 1-800 number for AT&T.  To get a $240 bill! Honest mistake, but the hotel only took $40 off.  Great stay except the phone. Would def go back.",4,2016,11,20
121,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed overnight at the hotel. Room clean and well equipped (gowns, slippers, hairdryer, tea/coffee, cleansing products).  Reception staff very friendly and all staff helpful.   We did not eat at the hotel due to other commitments. Lovely décor throughout Very central for Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey.",5,2016,11,19
121,Afternoon tea - delightful ......,"My wife and I had afternoon tea in November 2016, choosing this location because all our other regular haunts for afternoon tea were unavailable.  Thank goodness they were because the afternoon tea on offer here is wonderful in terms of service, ambience, taste and value for money. We shall be returning for afternoon tea quite regularly.",5,2016,11,19
121,A Wonderful Experience - we were looked after so well,"My partner & I were welcomed on our stay for the Memorial Service. We were simply blown away by the level of excellence we experienced. We were so happy with every aspect. Our room was quiet & extremely well appointed, not to mention spacious.

Our dinner at the Quilon restaurant was exceptional & we were surprised with a birthday sparkler & desert as well! The little touches by the staff made this weekend very special & truly memorable - thank you so much for your dedication.",5,2016,11,19
121,Simply Stunning,We were treated exceptionally well throughout the whole stay. It was truly a wonderful experience. We could not fault the service & cleanliness.  The food was the best cuisine I had ever experienced. We will definitely be staying again.,5,2016,11,19
121,One of the Best!,"An amazing Hotel with friendly staff and best in class service. 

Location of the hotel is perfect to visit most of the London's Tourist attractions. 

Hotel Spa is amazing with experienced and courteous staff!  

Would personally like to thanks Mr Anubhav for making my family stay at hotel a great experience. 

Would definitely visit again! 

*****",5,2016,11,18
121,Excellent - Quiet and Comfortable,Lovely hotel interior.  Large room (we upgraded to a king).  Comfortable bed.  Adjustable room temperature that worked quickly and well.  Large towels and heated towel rack - a nice touch. Very quiet - we had a room looking onto the courtyard.,5,2016,11,18
121,Large comfortable rooms in Central London,Definitely one of the largest hotel rooms that London Central could have. Excellent Service and great location. Well connected by train as well as walk to all key locations. There are multiple restaurants in the vicinity as well which are great for an early breakfast. They are spacious rooms and the classic rooms are a tad bit dated but definitely well maintained and value for money.,4,2016,11,18
121,Aweome,Just couldn't get over the beauty of the lobby.  The hotel room was big and so was the bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet The hotel had a lot of character and pizzazz and I would definitely stay there again.  They have 4 restaurants and are not too far from Buckingham Palace or Victoria Station.,5,2016,11,17
121,"Perfect location, accessible to major attractions","I stayed here two nights while on business in London. The location is really ideal - very close to Buckingham Palace and the major sites in Westminster as well as to the St. James' Park tube station. My room was quite comfortable. The only issues I had was that you can hear the tube / trains in the rooms - I know this is a factor of location and many city hotels are loud due to the city being 'loud,' but I've stayed in other hotels in this same part of London and found my room to be particularly loud. The other issue is needing to go outside / cross the courtyard to get to the fitness center. When the weather is cold and rainy, it's not the best having to go outside to access it. That said, the service was great and the staff were very helpful.",4,2016,11,17
121,Good location and excellent service,The hotel is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and St James Park. Staff are friendly and helpful and if you want to eat in the hotel there is a good choice of restaurants. Our classic room was quiet and reasonably spacious.,5,2016,11,17
121,Oustanding,"Cannot speak too highly of this hotel. Staff and service were superb. I would have no hesitation in recommending it. My wife and I visited for remembrance weekend. The location was perfect and so too everything else. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the hotel. Always offering a friendly smile and ""good morning"" as you walked by. Loved it.",5,2016,11,17
121,A weekend in heaven aka London ,"After having promised my wife a trip to London for 10 years we finally came. And it was all worth the wait and not least our hotel. It was an exquisite pleasure to spend 4 days at St. James' Court. Everything from the room, staff, food, location, in short everything was perfect. There was nothing bad to point out. I have through my work been around the world and this hotel is on my top 3. So if I get the slightest opportunity to return, I'm there right away.",5,2016,11,16
121,"Great Hotel , Super F&B","Very Good Hotel, location & Food / Beverage and the staff .  Good & Clean Rooms , very good Housekeeping .  Recommend to all who are looking for a very relaxed stay in Central London .  Use the Restaurants as they are very Good and value for money .  Lobby Bar is very Good with Super Staff .  Taj @ St.James's is a Classy Hotel that I would always want and will stay .  RP.",4,2016,11,16

121,"Short stay, excellent experience","I had a very short stay in this hotel. The rooms are not big and the bathroom is very simple design but overall all very clean and very pleasant.
And I must say that the service was good and restaurants (european and Indian) are excellent. Delicious food. I was few times and all the time I really enjoyed. The service in the restaurants was impeccable. 

Great location, 2 sec from Buckingham palace,  Green Park and St James park.

I would highly recommend.",5,2016,11,16
121,Alot of buck for not alot of bang,"Stayed recently in a single/double room,and have to say it was very nice and very comfortable. But have stayed in similar hotel rooms for alot less money. Drinks were massively overpriced and service wasnt the quickest. My friend fell over coming down some steps in the reception area to get an ""Oh dear"" from the girl behind the reception desk. No offer of help!We did have a good time as area is where we needed to be for the  Rememberance services. But don't think we will be back",3,2016,11,15
121,Superb stay,We loved the hotel. Great lobby to sit and relax where time seems to stand still. Reminded us of hotels we stayed at in India. Staff were excellent in all ways. Great location and availability of restaurants both linked to the hotel and elsewhere. We were happy with our room. We will definitely return.,5,2016,11,15
121,"Great location,excellent staff,great care",Excellent hotel in good location. Has old charm of England and India. Excellent&spacious rooms with luxurious amenities.Very caring staff .Great dining facilities.I enjoyed the evening drinks with the piano&singer in the background.,5,2016,11,15
121,"Superb hotel, almost a 5-star stay","First off great location. This hotel is a short walk from Buckingham Palace, and if you enjoy a good walk only 30 minutes to the West End and a show. It's also less than 15 minutes to Victoria Station, an Underground station with excellent access to multiple lines. 

The hotel itself is quite pleasant - what you'd expect for a hotel of this class. The staff is friendly, but I did not get the sense that they felt they need to go out of their way to please or serve guests. The rooms are well sized and quite clean. 

However this is not a 5 star hotel, if only for the aforementioned service element. The room was also a but outdated with a relatively small TV on a fixed stand so you can only watch from bed! In addition, although there is a fitness center, it's a bit of a drab place in the basement of the spa. 

I would stay here again if the rate was right (£200 but not £300). ",4,2016,11,15
121,Good Hotel but Not the Best,Hotel location was perfect and really close to Buckingham as described however all bars and restaurants around it close early as 11:00 pm and or 10:00 pm. You will have to go to another area if you want to dine and hang out at a pub for late dinning. The hotel ground was beautiful and safe. We pretty much walked everywhere in London and just caught the bus when we were too far from our hotel. Our room was straight to the point with nothing fancy about it. We did not have a view nor did we care about it as we weren't in our hotel all day but rather out exploring. The hallways in each floors were very narrow and long. The morning/ afternoon concierge was really nice and helpful in directing us to our tourist destinations.,4,2016,11,14
121,I'll be back,"An excellent location to see Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, South Bank and so much more. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful The accommodation was spacious, spotlessly clean and very well appointed - there was nothing it lacked.  Puclic areas were lavish It made our stay very relaxed and enjoyable",5,2016,11,14
121,Taj visit,Staff very nice. Hotel lounge staff excellent and always greeted upon entering/exiting. Questions always answered with knowledge. Room clean with good amenities. Restaurants on property excdellent. It was close to sites for walking.,5,2016,11,14
121,Excellent Hotel for London!!,"Elegant, nice and extremely confortable room. The hotel is perfectly situated for move easily in London for business and for leisure. The private ""cour"" is an hit for take a break in the heart of London. I strongly suggest this hotel.",5,2016,11,14
121,Recent stay at the St. James Court,"The hotel offers excellent location, old and basic accommodation for the prices charged, improved services but a below par Taj experience. Overall average stay. If you expect old world charm from the Taj, a little bit extra services from the staff to make your stay special, you may be disappointed.",3,2016,11,13
121,excellent hotel - excellent service,"found a great deal online for this hotel 200 gbp per night exec king with a 25 gbp discount per day....couldnt have found a better deal anywhere - great location great service, great concierge desk.  central to everything, all within walking distance",5,2016,11,13
121,My new favorite hotel in London,"A fabulous find for business traveler or tourist!  Old world style, service and charm with all the modern conveniences. Close by the St James subway, comfortable room and desk setup, fabulous gym open 24 hours, and exceptional restaurants.  I loved the contemporary Western food and exceptional service at the Kona restaurant on my last night !",5,2016,11,13
121,Large room!,"The bad bits - there aren't many. Dreary corridors, slightly old fashioned decor in the room, small bathroom. That's it. Everything else was really good. Cheery check-in, excellent sized room for sub £300 a night price (2 sitting chairs, sofa), marvellous king bed which we both agreed was exceptionally comfortable. The room overlooked the courtyard. Mini bar reasonably stocked. Tasty breakfast in the morning was complimentary. We walked to and from Victoria station which was about 10 minutes away. We would definitely stay again - mainly for location but particularly for the room size/price/quality ratio which is considerably better than we could find in other hotels near Victoria.",4,2016,11,11
121,Location Location Location!,"First time in London and we blindly booked our hotel online ..... what a pleasant surprise when we arrived at St. James! The building is gorgeous and the service was first class from the minute we arrived! 
 The best part was the location! We were a minute walk to the tube and minutes from Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, The War Rooms, the Thames River and Westminster (many more as well that I am failing to mention). You are right in the center of everything and being right by the tube allowed for quick train trips to further destinations. If you are a big walker, as I am you could even walk the Thames and end up at the London Tower Bridge! It's a hike! But you can't beat a river walk!  There are also a few pubs scattered just around the hotel, perfect for a quick pint or a fish n chips lunch!
 Our room was spacious, the bed comfortable and the bathroom included a tub which was wonderful for soaking after a long day of walking! The staff were friendly and always had a smile on their face. We had a breakfast package included in our stay which was perfect for filling up before a day of sight seeing. The breakfast buffet was tasty and they offered a wide variety of breakfast options. 
All in all it is a classy, clean, centrally located hotel. Perfect for your trip to London!",4,2016,11,10
121,Visiting London,"Friendly hotel, great quality, great service, very attentive and friendly staff. Great location. Interior decoration nice, building very beautiful and with many services available.Very likely to repeat experience.",4,2016,11,10
121,a TOUCH of history in a modern world...,"St. James' court, A Taj hotel is a mix of past and present with bits of English and Indian culture, which was quite new for me, therefore, I thoroughly enjoyed. 
The rooms are fully up to the standards of their rates.
The corridors gives you the real touch of past, so you can appreciate it, or hate it...
The Service was great: kind and professional. 
The food was excellent.
The prices are high like anywhere in London, so I don't think that it is overpriced and I would definitely return.",5,2016,11,09
121,a fine stay and well looked after by staff,"the bed was very comfortable, we travel a lot and it was one of the best beds we have slept on during our stay.   we really enjoyed our stay here, we felt very relaxed, we did not eat so cannot comment on the food, but if it was good has the service there would be no problem,",5,2016,11,08
121,Great Hospitality,Our second stay at St. James was just as satisfying as the first. The location is great. The service was excellent. The room was large and well furnished. The food at Quilon was delicious. The bar in the lounge continues to have a nice buzz.,5,2016,11,08
121,Excellent visit to St James court Hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyable visit. Staff were very courteous and attentive.  Very good location especially if you wish to visit St James Park, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey. We would definitely stay here again",4,2016,11,08
121,"Nice rooms, mixed service","This is a large hotel, the corridors definitely feel old, but the room was very nicely appointed.

I had a couple of issues with the service though. Upon check in I found that my reservation had been cancelled, even though I booked directly through Taj. On checkout, I had to ask for the £25/day meal credit that my reservation had. It's also very confusing where you can and can't use the credit. If you're going to give an offer like that, at least provide a letter at check in explaining everything.

Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.
",4,2016,11,07
121,disappointing,"looks great outside and reception. room was a massive let down. Quite old and run down, better quality furniture, fittings and bedding at the premier inn. No information on checking out time given or found in room but had people knocking at the door on 2 occasions at 10a.m and again shortly after, no explanation-just said they would be back later-couldn't be bothered to ask when checked out",3,2016,11,07
121,"Overpriced and dated hotel.  Service and location was great for the most part, but look for a deal.","The rooms definitely need some attention and maintenance.  There were cracks in the ceiling, stains on the carpet and the cabinets were bowing and cracking.  We stayed in room 777, and the noise from nearby construction and the courtyard was almost unbearable from about 7-7 every day.  While the hotel overall seemed very nice, it is definitely dated for sure.

The concierge and bell staff were absolutely amazing, and ensure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in to departure.  The location was absolutely amazing, 5 minutes from the nearest tube, which was awesome!

The staff was always awesome though, except when we had to stay an extra night due to our flight being cancelled.  They made it seem as though it was them doing a favor to charge us almost 3 times our original rate to accommodate us.  We were fortunate enough to be a able to book a room online with them for the same price, but the GM couldn't offer us this rate on his own, seems a bit odd to me that a GM can't adjust the pricing of a room in his hotel.

Other than that situation it would have been an excellent experience whole heartily.  Not sure if we will utilize this hotel on our next trip to London, as it seems a little pricey for what you get.",4,2016,11,07
121,"Well priced, central and luxurious hotel","London hotels are over-priced but this one is reasonable for London. The welcome was exceptional and the rooms are good, with fast, free wifi. I had a very pleasant stay. I didn't go to the restaurant so can't comment on the food.",4,2016,11,07
121,Very good service,Hotel staff were excellent and hotel is beautiful. Good gym with cardio and weights and coffee! Hotel is near to St James Park tube station and within walking distance to Buckingham palace and High St Kensington.  Rooms were small.,4,2016,11,07
121,A great experience in a 4* hotel yet smug bar staff,"Booked a room through booking.com for my boyfriends birthday surprise.
Soon after I booked I emailed the hotel to inform them of the occasion to which they replied and gave me various options for gifts upon entering the room, I asked for a bottle of prosecco which was of course at an extra cost but also added a nice note.

When arriving at the hotel we checked in, and much to my surprise we were given a free room upgrade at no extra cost, after half an hour of settling in the room there was a knock and we were given a complimentary beautiful chocolate cake for my boyfriend.

Our stay here was spectacular and the hotel itself is absolutely stunning, there was just one downfall...

After dinner outside of the hotel we went to the hotel bar for a couple of cocktails. We sat around the bar area which gave us an insight to the workers conversations.

With orders pouring in its understandable bar staff can become stressed, But we were shown a more unprofessional side to the staff which was impossible to go amiss. Other tables were ordering commercial cocktails that weren't on the menu, this made the member of staff making the orders unhappy, smug and was seen laughing with other staff members about customers who didn't favour the cocktail menu on offer.
Much to our dismay the Bar manager was also in on the jokes as well as the glass washer.
This was the only downfall for us as it was so unexpected in a hotel as highly rated as the Taj.

Aside from that our experience with every other member of staff and the room was A* for us.",4,2016,11,07
121,Meets expectations of 4 star,"Very good hotel and excellent location. always very happy staying here when in town on business. The staff and service of the hotel treats me very well. only slight criticism is that the beds are comfortable, but not as good as other 4star hotels I've stayed in.  This is a good hotel and value for money and I do recommend",4,2016,11,07
121,Worst hotel experience ever.,"Dysfunctional house phone system, worthless wifi signal, lots of noise every night from surrounding construction, hallways smell of body odor, poor customer service. Please don't waste your money here!",1,2016,11,06
121,Excellent staff good location nice rooms,"This 4 star property in Central London should be your choice if looking for really good service from staff a nice location near tube station & well appointed good clean rooms

Location - a 4 min walk to St.james tube station. Victoria station is a 10min walk. Buckingham Palace is 5 min walk.

Rooms - clean and good size for london

Breakfast & food in restaurant and bar is great

Nice gym & spa options available",5,2016,11,06
121,Excellent hotel in the heart of london,"Excellent service, exceptional location close to St James Park and Buckingham Palace; efficient, friendly and polite staff and great food. Had a fantastic experience. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,11,05
121,Excellent hotel- great location,"This hotel is excellent. Very central and with-in walking distance of many major attractions. The staff were very attentive and helpful. I had one concern with our beautiful spacious room and spoke to the duty manager who took onboard our suggestion and I trust him to have rectified the issue. I look forward to staying there very soon in the future.
My negative points were the room was,t cleaned on the second day perhaps due to us being there at the time but I would have expected a note to be put under the door telling  us to ring housekeeping when we going out again so they could refresh towels and milk ext also moved a chair and lots of dust underneath also under the small table.",5,2016,11,04
121,Nice hotel - poor check in,"The first experience of the hotel was not the best. The check in was poor - the first person said they were too busy and passed me to a second person. The second person was polite and efficient. 
The room was spacious, clean and tidy. The bathroom was clean and well laid out and the toiletries were good.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was really quiet.

A pleasant stay. ",4,2016,11,04
121,Wonderful hotel with exceptional service,"We have recently enjoyed a 4th stay at this fabulous hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and both the public areas and the guest rooms are spotlessly clean. The hotel is in a fantastic central position, within walking distance of the West End and many of the main London attractions. The courtyard is beautiful and after travelling down to London, it is lovely to just sit there and relax with a couple of drinks.  I would very highly recommend the restaurant Bistro 51. There is lots of choice on the menu and the food is delicious. The service there is exceptional. Thank you to all staff. Looking forward to our next stay at the Taj",5,2016,11,04
121,"Great location, helpful staff and comfy rooms",The hotel is very central just a short walk from Buckingham Palace and St James's park. We had a nice stroll to Trafalgar Square. Staff are friendly and helpful. Lounge is a pleasant place for a drink. Courtyard is stunning.,5,2016,11,03
121,Excellent experience in family for long we,"Top services and attention from everyone
Great connected rooms
Ideal location near Buckingham
Design and decoration charming and pleasant
Breakfast is the only critical point with non exceptional tastes of some food but if you ask waffles or pan cakes you will be pleased
Enjoy",5,2016,11,03
121,quite place,"little bit old style for the room, maybe is better if the cleaning service will be better. Service about the baby very low profile. All people at the reception has been very gentle and with attention to the guests.",3,2016,11,03
121,"Very Nice Hotel with Friendly International Team, delicious food and perfect location","Stayed at St James Court London Taj Hotel in September this year. It was mainly business trip. However, nicely combined with leisure.
It was late check in due to the late flight and we, as a group, were checked in very quickly which allowed us to have a rest after long distance flight.
My non-smoking room happened to have a strong cigarette smell, which was nuisance, and I informed the hotel management. The Reception Attendant sorted it out immediately and helped me to move to another room, thus showing flexibility and professional attitude. 
I stayed at Executive King Room on the 6 level. The room was nice, quiet and quite normal in size for central London, overlooking a very nice internal court yard of the hotel.
The hotel is comfortable both for leisure and business. There are meeting rooms convenient for business meeting and well organized and we did use one of them. Everything was in place and in line with our request and even some of our requests at short notice were managed by the business center professionally and timely.
The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. It is in the very center of London, close to St James Park, Westminster Cathedral, Victoria station and many other attractions like Buckingham Palace, House of Parliament, Hyde Park are within walking distance.
The hotel has several restaurants offering very delicious menu. 
We enjoyed Bank restaurant for group parties, it was packed in the evenings and rather noisy, the dishes and service were perfect. There are separate rooms in this restaurant allowing more privacy, but you’ll miss then the atmosphere of the Bank restaurant, which is enjoyable. We preferred the main hall with one round glass side overlooking the internal court yard of the hotel. 
If you need a private talk there is a lobby bar with a separate private corner. 
And the Bistro with delicious menu and welcoming service. 
I enjoyed this hotel atmosphere and the welcoming friendly people working there, it’s absolutely international team.",5,2016,11,03
121,Nice and cosy,"Very convenient location. Within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station and St. James Park. Very courteous hotel staff and helpful concierge. Value for money. The restaurant is quite good and offers choice of multiple cuisines.",5,2016,11,03
121,Great Historic Hotel with Good Longer Term Rates,"The hotel was built in the late 1800's, and the centerpiece is a very impressive courtyard.  But generally, the public areas are gorgeous, especially the check-in desk.  Our room was large and comfortable, though in need of a bit of updating, but totally serviceable.  There was a clean (not open) crack in one window, replaced at the end of our stay.  We stayed here for 8 days, and qualified for a longer-term-stay rate of just over $200 - quite good for central London.  Bed was fine, service good, everything quite clean.  The hotel has a wonderful location within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and the St. James Park Tube stop (and the Park itself, of course), and not far from Victoria Station.  We ate twice at The Bank restaurant, inside the Hotel, and the seating puts you right in the middle of that wonderful courtyard - and the food and service are good, too.  The Hotel is run by the Taj group from India.  It still has very much the look and feel of a British historic hotel, but with just a few Indian accents, like an optional Indian breakfast dish selection, and a highly rated Indian restaurant in the hotel (though we did not eat there).  Overall, it is a great place to stay.",5,2016,11,02
121,Poppyg,"Found this hotel on Hotels .com. Great rate and great place. Amenities and staff are awesome. All extremely friendly. Room was clean and luxurious. Great location if you are site seeing. Close to many main attractions all within walking distance. Make sure you go to the ""Regency Cafe"" for breakfast. Great experience!",5,2016,11,02
121,Excellent location and perfect service,"A very good place to stay in London. Convenient location, friendly staff and enjoyable atmosphere. Nice choice and quality for breakfast. I would also highly recommend the restaurant Bistrot 51 for the quality of the dishes and good service. Hope to be back soon !",5,2016,11,02
121,Very Very good!!!,"Everything was so good!!! The position, the hotel and its cleanliness, the staff that was always so kind... I surely will advice this hotel to everyone who want to visit london both for affair and funny. Tx",4,2016,11,02
121,Ms,"Well located. Excellent service. Not too far to walk if you do like walking. Modern especially on the top floors.  Try renovated rooms 
Breakfast was mediocre not in terms of  variety but of flavor 
People very well trained",4,2016,11,01
121,Great hotel in great location,"Although in central London, just down the road from Buckingham Palace, the hotel is very quiet. Breakfasts were very good. Tube station just 5 minutes walk away accessing rest of London. The room was adequate and tastefully decorated, but not over large. Bathroom was clean modern and complete with bath and shower.",4,2016,11,01
121,"Warm welcome ,great location and friendly helpful staff.","Friendly welcome from the concierge staff and doormen and a great inside team headed up by Naveen Sikka.  The food in the Bistro is always tasty and the light meals served in the lounge are brilliant. 
The addition of coffee machines in the well appointed rooms means I can enjoy a my favourite double expresso when I wake.
Being able to get drinks under heated cover in the Courtyard is a real bonus.",5,2016,11,01
121,Every comfort catered for,"We had a 2 night stay at St James' Court and we were so comfortable: this is a hotel which thinks of everything to make their guests' stay perfect in an unassuming way, no fuss, they just get the job done. Apart from the obvious facilities, the staff in every area are helpful, polite and friendly. The room was fairly standard for this level of hotel, outstanding were the peaceful nights, no noise from other guests' doors, furniture, plumbing or footsteps. Breakfast was well- cooked and presented, with attentive and well-trained staff.",5,2016,11,01
121,"ST. JAMES COURT, TAJ HOTEL London","A well presented and friendly hotel. Very clean with good facilities (Includes a GYM but no pool?). Nice Reception area, good sized quiet rooms. Nice Restaurant and Bar area with Cakes! Friendly Staff can't do enough for you. Door man and Conceirge very helpful.",5,2016,11,01
121,Excellent ,"So many hotels to choose from in London... i thought i would give the St James a try for a change. Having previously stayed in Taj hotels in India and experienced excellent quality and service I had high expectations.  

Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the doorman and were a little shocked to see so many people. A large party had arrived and what seemed to be hundreds of suitcases were veing luned up by the conceirge staff and there was a large queue for the breakfast room. 

We fought our way through the throng of people and made it to reception and remarkably were attended to immediately.  Reception staff were excellent, helpful, courteous, and efficient.  Our room was ready early and the receptionist wished my husband a happy birthday...its the personal touches that make for a warm and friendly stay.

Our room 558 was clean, bright, well maintained and of a good standard. Nice comfy beds, wifi strong, and more amenities than we were expecting.

Hotel location very good, but on Sundays be aware that the Mall is often closed off and that can cause iasues woth taxis being delayed getting through traffic.

Breakfast was good but could have been excellent. The breakfast room was full , wity queues, and the staff were completly overrun... working extremely hard, but virtually running around looking stressed trying to serve guests. More staff are needed to create a calmer atmosphere, also the tables are too close together as they need to cram too many guests into a breakfast area that isn't sufficient to be comfortable. Breakfast food was very good quality, only scrambled eggs were available from the buffet, however we asked our waiter for poached eggs which appeared without delay. However, we felt that we should have been advised that alternative selections were available, rather than have to ask. Lovely cappuccinos and very fresh food.

All staff in this hotel seem to work hard and aim to offer great service. Its so close to being excellent ! We will definitely return again overall its great value and a lovely hotel.",4,2016,10,30
121,Great hotel for a stay in central London,"Very nice place, great spacious rooms, friendly staff and a nice bar. Was here only for one night but really enjoyed it and actually would go back - I just needed a hotel in the area for an early appointment the next day, and accidentally I found this gem. Booked it on a deal and well worth it, very comfy.",4,2016,10,30
121,Comfortable stay,"We stayed for 1 night at the Taj, it was an enjoyable stay and the reception, concierge and breakfast staff were very helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 683, which is the furthest from the lifts on this floor. It's like a rabbit's warren getting to your room! It's a fact that some of the rooms and hallways are outdated and are in need of updating, but the room was clean and well equipped with extra: towels, bath robes and toiletteries for the extra person. On entering the room, it smelt slightly musty as if it hadn't been used in a while but we opened the window and the smell soon left. Our television wasn't working and when we phoned reception they sent two nice men to fix the problem in a matter of minutes. The only let down of the stay was a large stain on the duvet cover of our rollaway; by the time we had noticed it, it had gone past 11pm so just mentioned it to the receptionist Arianna upon check out. We showed her a picture, which she then showed to her manager and she removed the cost of the roll away from our bill - which was unnecessary but very nice of them. The breakfast was lovely with a great selection of: fruits, pasteries, meats, cheeses and hot food! We will be returning but maybe once the hotel has undergone some refurbishments! ",4,2016,10,30
121,Fantastic Hotel,"Along with my wife & parents, stayed at the St James Court for 5 nights.  I just state that I was extremely happy with our experience.   the hotel is located in a great area and the size & quality of rooms was absolutely excellent, especially considering what you would normally expect from hotels in London  being an Indian myself, the two Indian restaurants in the hotel were quite a boon, though a little bit too expensive in my view  the staff too were very nice & warm",5,2016,10,29
121,Beautiful hotel but with bed bugs,"Stayed here for one night in September. The hotel was beautiful, and the staff lovely. My room was big and the bathroom was amazing. Great breakfast, lots of food all fresh and plenty of choice.
I didn't think I could find a single fault with the hotel until I realised it had bed bugs! This is a relatively simple problem for the hotel to fix but I won't be staying again until they have dealt with the problem, especially as they would be so easy to bring them home.",2,2016,10,29
121,EXCELLENT STAY AND SERVICE,"Our stay here was wonderful!  The staff was great and very pampering.  We unfortunately blew a fuse with our converter, and they sent someone up right away to fix it, AND they also provided us with a replacement.  Great location!!  Just minutes from everything!  Breakfast had lots to choose from and their Banks restaurant was delicious!!",5,2016,10,29
121,Stay at Taj St. James Hotel,"I highly recommend this hotel. It is clean, with welcoming staff, and centrally located. The response time to requests is so fast. The ambiance at the reception is commendable. In addition, architecture of the hotel is one unique one of a kind.",4,2016,10,29
121,Perfect London getaway,"Old world charming and historical hotel. Quite a treat after all modern hotels, and the service is outstanding. Well appointed room, facing the courtyard has a great view and the restaurant has a decent menu, no need to go eat in the city. London attractions are very close by, but took the cab to the theater.",5,2016,10,28
121,Perfect Location with Excellent Service and Generous Breakfast,"What impresses at St. James' Court is the lovely welcome from every member of staff.  At the door, at reception, in the bar (have the champagne and canapé flight!), and at breakfast, each and every member of staff greeted us with warm eye contact and something cheerful to say.  The room (executive king) was as described on the web site - all London rooms are small, but this is just a few square feet larger, which makes a big difference.  We chose a package that included breakfast, and enjoyed exploring the generous buffet offerings each morning, including British standards, Indian specials that changed daily, and a wide variety of classic choices for every palate.  Obviously, the location is ideal to the central sights:  Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey are at either end of the street, and the tube stop is three easy blocks away.  Great stay!",5,2016,10,27
121,Great Location in Central London,"This St James Court lived upto its reputation as one of the finest Taj Hotels. The hotel is within a few minutes of walking distance from the Buckhingam Palace, Victoria Memorial, the St James Park. It is walking distance from the Big Ben. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and explored central london by walking around the picturesque parks and imposing buildings and memorials. And being 10 minutes of walking distance from the Victoria Station and about 5 minutes from the St James Park underground I found that connectivity to go around London and beyond was very good. 
The rooms were clean and comfortable. The Buffet spread at Quilon was nice. I found the staff very courteous and helpful. I enjoyed my stay very much.",5,2016,10,27
121,3 night stay in a classic double room,"Overall, the Taj St. James Court experience was a good one.  It is dated: my room had cables that lead to nowhere, a tiny and very dated bathroom, but it was a good size for one person. The bed was very comfortable. The wifi reception was terrible but that could have been my phone as others in my group seemed to have no problem.  The check-in / check-out was quick and efficient, the staff are helpful and friendly. The location is also quite good, with an Underground station a couple of minutes walk away. Drinks at the bar are quite expensive. Overall, quite good value for money, especially for London.",4,2016,10,27
121,WORST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED,"Poor service. Reception is not helpful at all. Food at breakfast was stale. Lying for hours. Those piranhas were hard as a rock. Concierge not helpful at all. You need to pick your bags yourself. Paid for a King size room, got a queen size bed. The exhaust in the bathroom never worked. Called the reception no solution at all.",1,2016,10,27
121,Wonderfully quirky,"The Taj is in an excellent location, has extremely helpful staff and has an attractive quirkiness about it.  My only non-positive comments are the rooms which, whilst comfortable and adequate, are a tad cramped and set in a confusing system of corridors.  Overall though, if you can avoid paying full price and only use it as a base for sightseeing, then this is a great hotel.",4,2016,10,26
121,NYCboys,"Our entire experience at this hotel was perfect, from the Front Desk to the Bellmen. We had a great time and look forward to staying at this hotel upon our next trip to London. This hotel had many options for food/drinks.",5,2016,10,26

121,Royal Peace,Beautiful location next to Buckingham Palace and a 5 minute walk to Victoria Street for some convenient shopping. A stone-throw to the underground station. I looked forward to being back at the hotel everyday to enjoy peace and quiet in my room. Bistrot has a nice menu and service is fast. Nice lounge area to chill. Absolutely loved my stay there and am sure I will go back.,4,2016,10,25
121,Birthday ,"Stayed at the St James Court last weekend, just a stones throw from Buckingham palace .The hotel was great , the staff were very friendly, upon check we were upgraded to a suite which was extremely nice . Everything was clean and very well presented. Had a few drinks in the bar , service was again fantastic . Nothing too much trouble ",5,2016,10,25
121,Very quiet hotel in late October,"Room 430: nicely appointed, quiet as long as the windows are closed and no one is in the courtyard; mattress a bit firmer than I prefer.  Housekeeping staff is phenomenally quiet.  Beware of getting wet on the toilet if someone is simultaneously showering.  Dining room staff usually efficient but there can be a bit of a wait for breakfast on the weekends, at peak time (around 9AM) - good full English breakfast buffet with small sprinkling of Indian foods,  Made to order eggs were always done as ordered.",5,2016,10,25
121,Two nights for a business trip,"We spent two nights with my wife in this hotel for a business trip, the quality of reception was outstanding. The room was very large and comfortable by London standards albeit a little aging. The adjacent restaurants are very good and taxis always available opposite the hotel.",4,2016,10,25
121,Great hotel in the city center,"I arrived at the hotel super early (8am) and the lovely receptionist was able to check me in. Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights, the location is great. I didn't try the restaurants and the women sauna was unfortunately out of order however the Spa looked beautiful, make sure to book your treatment in advance if spending the weekend. Live music was too loud for my taste.",4,2016,10,25
121,Luxury in the heart of London,"A hotel of real character where every member of staff works hard to make guests welcome and happy. Standards of cleanliness and fittings are excellent and there is plenty of choice of dining venues. Buckingham Palace is around ten minutes away, Westminster and the Thames a similar distance, and St James' Park tube station is just around the corner. The Wellness Centre provides exceptionally good services, unlike many hotels. Worth a visit.",5,2016,10,25
121,Comfortable hotel in great location,"Firstly the location is so central, close and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Victoria, WestMinister Abbey, Covet Gardens and to plenty of good restaurants and pubs nearby. The Executive room where I stayed was not that spacious but good size and had all the amenities. The breakfast a good spread and the downstairs bar is cozy and vibrant with live music. The feel of Taj hospitality was evident with the staff being courteous and prompt in their service.",4,2016,10,25
121,Very impressive ,"Great hotel.   

Arrived late and found myself upgraded.  Some nonsense ensued trying to get the two single beds I reserved instead of the king size we were offered.  Neither Sir Gordon Lord, nor I, were terribly pleased with the possibility of sharing even a king size double together.  My main excuse being that he is physically repellent to most other humans and - most of all - me.  I do know where my bread is buttered.

Thankfully he was re roomed (to something much more ordinary) and I was left with the suite upgrade to myself.

A very pleasant breakfast in the a.m. Followed with underground and a stroll to HQ in order to watch the one day county final.  

A delightful stay in a very good hotel.

",4,2016,10,24
121,Value for money,"Stayed for one night only. Greeted by doorman on arrival, friendly and efficient reception staff. Room spacious and clean and had all the little niceties you'd expect from a Taj hotel. Great choice of food at breakfast, good service. Less than a five minute walk from Buckingham Palace. Only downside was a change of tube line and then quite a few stops to get to Oxford Street, so with all the shopping best to get a taxi back! ",4,2016,10,24
121,Excelent hotel!,"St. James Hotel is a beautiful hotel, very clean and confortable rooms. The location is excelent with good and easy acess to London main spots. The personal is very friendly and helpfull. And there are very good restaurants!",5,2016,10,24
121,Excellent Stay,"A very nice hotel, ideally situated for my business trip.  Friendly, professional staff and excellent facilities.  Food in the Bistro was delicious and very good value for money.  I would definitely recommend for both a business or leisure trip.",5,2016,10,24
121,Good find and all round good place,"Stayed for 1 night, and impressed. Great location, great buzz, good bar layout with good live music, (jaz), nice rooms and well equipped. Only downside was that breakfast was very busy, so we never had any, but enjoyed a coffee and pastry in the bar area instead, 
Overall good value.",4,2016,10,23
121,City break,"My wife and I arrived at the hotel to a friendly welcome  from  the receptionist and from the start the service was exceptional nothing was a problem for her ( sorry I missed her name ) with our requests ,booking afternoon tea to our room requirements ,5star check in and out , we booked afternoon tea ( themed Alice in wonderland ) amazing table set up and food was just amazing ,service also faultless again nothing was to much trouble on request,rooms were clean and spacious everything you would want in a hotel ,location less than a mile from Buckingham palace and a parliament and Knightsbridge,we are already looking to book again in December 
Thanks to all the staff for a great stay

121,Great hotel and base in london,"the property is well located within walking distance of all the best areas such as, hyde park, fitzrovia and chelsea. the restaurants are excellent, as is room service. the gym is well appointed and the spa service excellent. there is also free parking nearby over the weekend.",5,2016,10,22
121,Great London hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for the second time whist visiting London. Great location,great for visiting Buckingham Palace  Staff were very attentive and not bad value..No complaints about this hotel at all  would stay again.",5,2016,10,20
121,Beatiful Place in the city center,"It was a pleasure to stay here with my family during the weekend in October 2016. Useful service, impeccable staff, the room cleanliness and location (is a 3 minutes walk from buckingham palace) make this hotel a little gem in London.",5,2016,10,20
121,Perfect for Family,"We took our two kids young children to London for the weekend to see the sites. We were looking for the impossible - a room that can sleep 4 in a good central location and at an affordable price! We found it at the Taj. Great location a couple of minutes from St James or 5-10 mins from Victoria. 

And their family room was absolutely perfect. It was in effect a junior suite with a separate sitting area which was ideal for me and my wife when the two young ones were asleep meaning we could read whilst not disturbing the kids. The room was spacious and had been recently modernised and was very comfortable and we paid only a fraction more than I would have expected for a standard double.

Service was good as one would expect for a hotel such as this, bar and restaurant typically pricey for London hotels but we would return to this hotel and would definitely recommend it to others , particularly those with families.",5,2016,10,20
121,Lovely hotel and great location,"Husband and I stayed three nights at the St. James Court.  Check in was quick and easy.  We had just arrived from four nights in another city at an extremely noisy hotel.  We asked for a quiet room and were placed in a room on the 7th floor facing inward.  Perfect!!  Super quiet and a wonderful room.  Very roomy, updated and comfortable.  The hotel's location was convenient and walking distance for a number of tourist sights such as, Buckingham Palace, Westminister Abbey and the Parliament.  All minutes away.  We were so busy we never had an opportunity to use any of the hotel's restaurants or other services.",5,2016,10,19
121,Walk to all tourist attractions,The staff at this hotel is amazing. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Only a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. On a quiet street so no noise. We were in an executive room and it was very large and had everything we needed. Hotel is very clean and well maintained.,5,2016,10,19
121,Unbeatable locstion,"We visited the Taj for a friends wedding in Westminster.  We stayed for 1 night it was bank holiday Sunday in August and the journey was a nightmare, however as soon as we arrived we were greeted by super helpful attentive staff and the car was valet parked for us.  We had lunch in the hotel restaurant next to reception it was good as you would expect with an Indian theme.  We sadly did not get to visit the Michelin starred Indian restaurant but it looked divine and the aroma of the food meant we would definitely return.  The wine list was also surprisingly impressive and I enjoyed several good glasses.  The rooms although small were beautifully presented very clean and had good light and mirrors.  The bathroom was well designed and the shower was powerful too.  All the soft furnishings felt luxurious and the curtains and the bed linen were of a very high quality.  The bed and pillows were both very comfortable and the mini bar well stocked and reasonably priced.  Check in and check out seamless despite the hotel being very busy.  The location of this hotel I feel is superb as it is in a quiet clean locstion yet off one of the busiest streets in London with all the important landmarks and some fantastic bars and restaurants.  The best of both worlds I wouldn't hesitate to return.",5,2016,10,19
121,Amazing!,"I stayed at the hotel the past weekend as a trip I had won through work. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by fabulous staff members, all who were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was fantastic, it was very spacious, well cleaned and looked after. We ate dinner in the Kona on th first evening which is a lovely very intimate restaurant. The food you could not falter it was delicious. There was a slight issue with the main which meant mine was taken away to be kept warm whilst they rectified this, however we were offered dessert wine with their compliments for their apologies. 
My only issue about the whole stay was the high tech tv remote. It was a touch screen remote to control the tv, DVD and iPod system. However this remote was very difficult to use and did not work very well. We had to call room service and the engineer a few times to fix it, because it took us an hour to get the DVD playing. Everything was exceptional, however this little bump did put a slight down on the stay. Every time you would want to sit down, relax and watch tv it took half an hour to get it to work. 
Overall, beautiful hotel, beautiful people and I would recommend this stay to anyone! I throughly enjoyed my weekend.",5,2016,10,19
121,A Perfect wedding Anniversary stay,"One hours drive from London City Airport, almost next to Buckingham Palace.

Were received very cordially, rooms and amenities were perfect.

Breakfast was included but as the hotel was full service was bit slow.
Dinner at their Michelin star Restaurant Quilon was delicious, unfortunately the rule in the resto says if you want the tasting menu all the guests at the table must order the same!! being a small eater had to eat a three course meal and wasted a lot.

Bar is well stocked, the service was excellent and small eats were tasty.

Over all a pleasant stay.",5,2016,10,18
121,Great  stay in London near Buckingham Palace at Taj,"Extremely polite & helpful staff, well trained in hospitality , clean rooms ,lively lobby and courtyard. Warm Bistro restaurant  with efficient staff.Mr Sikka Manager always willing to assist guests  and make the stay pleadsant.Definitely worth staying when visiting  London again",3,2016,10,18
121,Superb Hotel,"Amazing stay at the hotel, staff was amazing and always greeted you with a smile. The hotel was a few steps away from Buckingham palace and a block away from the tube. Their in room dining was also pretty good and their rooms are very very clean. ",5,2016,10,17
121,lovely hotel great location,"great room, service, location, breakfast. found it odd a 12.5% service charge was added to everything - even a drink ordered directly at the bar. receipt said it was optional but dit not seem to be a clear process to remove this. cocktail at £12.50 seemed excessive - adding a 12.5% service charge shows how out of touch london is...? hotel room great but would steer away from purchasing food/ drink in-house given excessive charges.",4,2016,10,17
121,Great location,Stayed over one night on our way to Dover and enjoyed the hotel very much.  The lobby was very comfortable and the Staff was amazing. Took care of my every whim and gave wonderful directions to where ever I wanted to visit.  Very nice.  My daughter made the reservation for us as she had stayed there before on a trip to London.  Had a bit of trouble with my air brush.  The staff did everything they could to help with the problem.,5,2016,10,17
121,Weekend trip,"Staff very professional particularly Leonard in the bar and the front door staff.  Had tea and scones one afternoon and have never seen scones so tiny, needed a microscope but they tasted OK.  Poor housekeeping staff as they didn't notice the loose hanging shower head which would not remain fixed in the holder and had to be held by hand whilst showering.",4,2016,10,17
121,Gem in the shadow of Buckingham Palace,"This was our first trip to London and we chose the St. James because of its central location.  We were able to walk to most tourist attractions and had easy access to a tube station for any locations farther away.  The Taj was elegant in a very comfortable way.  It is a beautiful hotel and the staff is exceptionally professional. It has a luxurious wellness center, including a steam room and sauna which provide the perfect way to end a long day enjoying London.",5,2016,10,17
121,"A bit so-so, but friendly staff and location worked for us","We picked this hotel because we had a meeting in the area... friendly reception and staff, but the room felt a bit long in the tooth. Nothing too bad, just a bit dated/tired. All in all a good stay and not too expensive by London standards.",3,2016,10,17
121,Great experience,"I have been to London many times because of bussiness, but this time I was travelling with my family to visit the city. The hotel was a great surprise with a warm welcome and a family-friendly enviroment. Besides, the location of the hotel is superb.",5,2016,10,17
121,Spacious room close to many activities,"Overall: This is a very large hotel so people’s experiences will likely vary depending on which part of the hotel they were in. The Taj has spent a lot of money making its common areas very elegant, but our room did not reflect that same level of attention to detail--could see the touch-up paint on patched drywall, bathroom didn’t have a fan so ceiling had black marks from too much humidity. I realize London’s expensive, but there’s no way I would’ve paid what I did at this hotel for a comparable hotel in Canada. The room, although dated with window's facing a schoolyard basketball court (separated from us by razor wire) was likely far more roomy than other hotels in the area, based on reviews I’ve read.
Like
Room was very spacious. Mattress was comfy enough, although it seems that many hotels in England simply bandaid mattresses in need of replacing by putting more toppers on them.
Staff very friendly and accommodating. Came to immediately address any issues I called about. 
Didn't like
The hotel put a hold on my credit card for an extremely high amount citing incidentals that I might incur over our stay. In my experience, a hotel charges guests for costs incurred AFTER they leave, not before purchasing. This hold was not stipulated in any reservation information beforehand and put an undue hardship on my finances.
Housekeeping on most days was pretty good, but service differed by staff. And I am still appalled that regardless of cost per night at every calibre of hotel, housekeeping staff still cut corners. For example, not providing clean glasses that have been put through a dishwasher due to the time it takes to remove and replace glasses from multiple rooms over large distances. Instead, it’s common practice for housekeepers to wash/rinse glasses and cups in-room and dry then out with a rag. This was most certainly the case at the Taj. The thing that displeased me the most, but was positively  remedied by the head housekeeper or night manager, was that during the day, one housekeeper unpacked our grocery bag, removing some stuff and keeping other stuff. This resulting in us losing some of our purchased items. Never should hotel staff unpack a guest’s belongings and make decisions about what’s good and what should be thrown out.
Not terribly soundproof. Fireproof doors can't be pulled shut so people just walk away from room doors, which then slam shut, which are loud enough to shake the walls.",4,2016,10,16
121,"Great hotel, great experience","I stayed for 2 nights at the Taj for a little weekend retreat. The hotel was beautiful and all of the staff were polite and friendly. We ate the morning buffet both mornings and the food was fresh and very good. There was lots of variety to meet everyone's needs. The room suited my needs perfectly  - it was spacious, comfortable, quiet and clean. I had a really enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel to others.",4,2016,10,16
121,"Great location, good enough hotel","The location near Buckingham Palace is a great location for many different tourist venues. The hotel rooms and public spaces itself are nice enough, but not the reason to stay here. The restaurants and bars are also fine if not exceptional. The service from the hotel staff is noteworthy, as they seem extremely focused on guest comfort.",4,2016,10,15
121,Nice surprise,"I just returned from a trip to London where I stayed at 2 different hotels in the same area.  The first 4 nights were at the St. James Court and the next 4 nights were at the Goring.  Honestly, i had such high hopes for the Goring because of it's reputation that I wasn't really thinking much about what to expect at the St. James Court.  Now that I have returned from my trip and can compare both hotels, I can easily say that I'm a big fan of the St. James Court.  

Pros: 
- Location on a secluded street and just a few steps away from the St. James tube station which is a lot less hectic than the nearby Victoria station. 
- Common areas (reception, bar, concierge) was stylish and comfortable.  
- Nice buffet breakfast included in the rate which included a mix of British, Indian and American foods.  
- Beautiful courtyard area.  I'm sure it would be even nicer in warmer weather.
- Air conditioning in room.  I know this may not be a big deal to some travelers, but I really enjoy a very cold room which is hard to get when traveling in Europe.  The air conditioning in my room was much better than other European hotels I have stayed in which is impressive considering this is a historic property.
- Internet speed was reliable and fast.
- Room size and decor.  I stayed in an Executive King which was very spacious and comfortable.  
- Bath amenities were nice.
- Airport car service that they arranged was very nice and reasonably priced compared to a taxi or train for 2.  
- Great housekeeping. 

Cons:
- I slept fine but my partner said the bed was not the most comfortable.  May have just been our room. 
- TV was small and not as responsive as I would like.  In other words, there was a significant delay when trying to navigate the menu and change channels.  Oddly, the menu and software was the exact same at the Goring.  

Overall, we had a great stay and even debated about changing our reservation after staying in the Goring for 1 night to come back to the St. James Court.  We felt very comfortable in this hotel and would recommend it for business or holiday travelers.",5,2016,10,15
121,COULD DO A LOT BETTER!,"A nice hotel run by a very established company. Could be a Standard Bearer for Indian Hospitality in London but is overlooking the opportunity. We stayed for 5 nights but were asked to move to another room after 2 nights- on some technicality. What does that say about Empathy? The second room was not of the same quality,poor bathroom drainage etc The Bistro is a good restaurant offering good value. The Lobby Bar on the other hand is a bit of a disappointment both in physical ambience as well as service. Very good Concierge.",4,2016,10,15
121,St James Court,"Amazing hotel experience, beautiful rooms with amenities close by. Well worth the price paid. Within 5 minute walk to Westminster Abbey, Westminster Palace, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace. Pubs and coffee shops near by. Quieter area of London which was really nice, as I have stayed off Oxford St in the past, and you are unable to open the windows, as it is way to loud. Victoria station within 10 minute walk, which was great as this station has a direct train to Gatwick Airport. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast. Would most definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,14
121,Very good hotel,"A family visit from overseas and we all had a lovely stay at the Taj.
Excellent service thru out and as always well appointed rooms.
Front desk a tiny bit slow on check in being the only issue.
Highly recommend.",4,2016,10,14
121,Beautiful Hotel,"We absolutely loved the St. James Court Hotel. The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace, just blocks away. The staff were absolutely amazing. The doorman actually crossed the street to help us with our luggage. All the staff we encountered were friendly and so eager to help us. Our room was beautiful, elegant, comfortable and very clean. It was very nice having a balcony overlooking the courtyard. The only complaint with the room was the shower enclosure on the bathtub doesn't prevent the water from spraying all over the floor. We dined at Michelin star restaurant Quilon and it was amazing, one of the best meals of our trip. St James Court Hotel was the perfect finish to our 10th anniversary trip and we can't wait to go back.",5,2016,10,13
121,Unforgettable,"Typical Taj hospitality. Which is no bad thing. In fact its excellent. Ive been privileged to stay in many Taj Hotels in India and this is right up there with the best. We were lucky with the weather in so far as it allowed us to spend a lazy afternoon in the beautiful courtyard, which divorced you from the rest of London. We had a suite which was beautifully and immaculately presented. Wonderful staff. Wonderful hotel. Thankyou Taj.",5,2016,10,12
121,Nice Place,"Excellent location.  You can walk to the city attractions.  There are many restaurants in a little walk from the hotel.  The hotel has 5 restaurants, but the prices are bigger than the others restaurants in the city.  The staff is very gentle to attend the guest’s solicitations.",4,2016,10,12
121,Outstanding,"The St James' Court goes above and beyond to provide outstanding service and quality. It really is a ""home from home"". These comments apply also to the events and banqueting personnel who expertly handle the events that my company holds on the premises.",5,2016,10,12
121,Excellent Hotel,"Everything perfect!Nice City and Hotel hope back soon and stay in this Hotel. The location is really amazing as well, you have everything you need near of this place. And you can walk to BigBen, LondonEye and BUCKINGHAM Palace.",5,2016,10,12
121,"Service, Service and Service","Service is their number one priority. Everyone is helpful. Room was clean, well equipped and QUIET. Great location - one short block from Buckingham Palace. Nice piano lounge for a nightcap.  Did I mention great location ? We walked to just about everything, with no difficulty.",5,2016,10,11
121,Excellent Location but Small Rooms,The hotel is well located right next to Buckingham palace. Being a Taj property the hotel does indeed provide exceptional service. However the rooms are indeed quiet small. Similarly the age of the hotel shows up as one walks through the corridors of the hotel. All said and done may not stand up to five star standards offered by other hotels in the city. Excellent yet expensive food options.,4,2016,10,11
121,The Fantastic St. James Court Hotel,"Beautiful centrally located, quiet hotel with outstanding service! We were just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace. All the staff we encountered were professional and gracious. The room was elegant and very comfortable, very good amenities. Michelin star Quilon Restaurant was absolutely amazing, one of the best meals of our trip from Dubai, Paris to London. We were so well looked after from the minute we crossed the street to the front door and the doorman crossed the street to help us. Fantastic hotel, we can't wait to go back.",5,2016,10,11
121,Classic London hotel - perfect location,"St. James Court hotel has an excellent ""long stay"" package with significant rate reductions for week long stays - perfect for tourists spending a week in London. An excellent hotel with good breakfast package, perfect location and very friendly staff - we had a great time.This is not our first visit and we will use the hotel again",5,2016,10,11
121,A Wee Gem In The Heart Of London,"Seriously, if you fancy a wee jaunt to the big smoke. Book well in advance to get a good deal. It's a super hotel, perfectly located for business or pleasure.
Very attentive staff, with super service.
This was my first time staying in The St. James, normally favouring a more central 5* hotel, but i most certainly will return.",4,2016,10,10
121,Is this really 5 starts hotel !!! Very Disappointed.,"In the hotel factsheet writes  “ Once the home of Lords and Ladies of the Royal Court, Taj 51 Buckingham Gate now provides its guests with some of the most spacious and  luxurious accommodation and finest personal service in London, featuring Taj’s acclaimed Golden Keys Concierge Service” Really!!! Definitely it is not true. 

I booked the hotel for 6 nights and you expect best service and attention . But unfortunately I could not find it what they promise us. 

First of all the room is so small and a specially bathroom. You even can not move and  it is not comfortable. 
Secondly and the most disappointed point is the hotel can not provide you a iPhone charger. Imagine… Where is the finest personal service here? A very sample service you expect.

I came to London for business purpose. Unfortunately I forgot to bring it with me and I accept that the Golden Key Concierge Service hotel can provide me easly without any doubt. I called Front office and they told me that they can not send the charger to the room as it is missing afterwards. I can only charge in the reception if I leave my phone. Due to my business purpose and  the privacy reason I did not want to leave it there. I even purposed to take a deposit from me. After such a long conversation Front office manager was agreed to send it to the room for 2hrs. Then I handed it over to them. The next day after my really long business day I came to the hotel and asked the charger to use it as I was already out of battery. Guess what? Front Office manager told me that charger is missing!! He does not have an idea or information that where is the charger.!!!Seriously.We are talking about a 5 starts hotel. No further comments any more. 

I highly suggest to any one please make sure your bring your own charger, incase if you have to stay in this hotel otherwise do not prefer to stay here. I am sure you may find a better service in near by hotels.

Thank you
Yeliz",1,2016,10,10
121,"Birthday stay, outstanding hotel with matching service ","I arrived to the hotel Friday 7th October in the afternoon and was greeted immediately at the outside door and my cases were taken care of. 

The reception and lobby was immaculate, the staff were very inviting and friendly. 
Chiara served us, she was very nice and both my partner and I went to the desk to check in. The only thing I would say was she mentioned the price several times out loud and this was a birthday surprise for me. This was known to her as she wished me a happy Birthday upon arrival, which was lovely, it was in the notes, and we were able to get an upgrade to a suite!!

The room was outstanding, blown away. The room was immaculately clean and we had a stunning view of the courtyard. 
The bed was amazing!

From start to finish we were treated very well by staff and the overall hotel was stunning and immaculately clean. 

I cannot wait to return to this hotel and book a suite. 
I Actually cried when we had to leave. 

Outstanding hotel, should definitely be a 5 star hotel. ",5,2016,10,10
121,A Gem In Buckingham Gate,"Thanks to friends who had flown over from Germany to spend a few days in London. I decided to fly down to join them in this hotel that they had booked. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this little gem in Buckingham Gate.   From check in to check out, the staff were all wonderfull, and couldn't do enough for you.  The location is perfectly situated for tourists, (and Business). Buckingham Palace, with the changing of the Guards twice daily is within a 2min walk. If you are a keen walker, then everything that you want to do and see is all within easy walking distance.",4,2016,10,10
121,Excellent all round. ,"Excellent, everything. Even my special request was granted: I had said I would be grateful for a high room overlooking the courtyard.
A special shoutout to Aleksandra at the reception who went the extra mile to look after me when I checked out of the hotel. ",5,2016,10,10
121,excellent hotel,"stayed in the hotel many times and wasnt disappointed this weekend!
staff were helpful and polite. 
room comfortable and spotless.
a real treat to stay here as always!
reception area is very grand and welcoming.
we enjoyed a lovely bottle of wine in the bar.
just one gripe the breakfast area is a little cramped for such a large hotel, not sure why the larger conservatory area isnt used? and the bacon a little on the soggy side i did find it amusing to watch everyone wrestle with the tongs as about 10 rashers were stuck together every time someone wanted just one or two!! (just a small issue for an otherwise perfect hotel)",5,2016,10,10
121,Taj Hotels,Hotel in excellent position. Good service and food. Courteous staff. Everything worked. Clean rooms. Quiet comfortable rooms. Good for access to Westminster / Buckingham Palace / Victoria. No problems,5,2016,10,10
121,Enjoyable Weekend Stay,"Stayed at the St James in July when I was down in London for the weekend to attend a concert in Hyde Park so location wise this hotel was idea was it was a 15 minute walk away as were many attractions only a stone throw away as this hotel is very central London. From arriving to leaving the staff were fantastic and friendly, I used room service for dinner & breakfast both of which tasted great and arrived fast to my room.

For being in the center of London I was surprised at how quiet the hotel was in terms of outside noise or noise from the bar and other guests etc, it made sleeping at night not a problem. For the price I was a little disappointed with the room I had, i'd booked a double room which had it's own mini bar, bathroom with shower & bath, free Wi-Fi, safe, iron, desk, TV along with the usual room supplies but the room itself looked abit dated and in need of some TLC while the bed wasn't the most comfortable. 

Overall I would recommend the hotel and rate it 7/10, this would raise if the rooms were nicer.",4,2016,10,09

121,Great classy hotel,"We were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel and size of our suite with a separate living room.  Very comfortable.  Bathroom could have been bigger.  The bar was great with excellent service.  Restaurant next door - Quilon, though slighly expensive, was exquisite.  Best part was the location, 5 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, the park, and the Tube Stop (St James).  Super convenient, with several cafes across the street.  All in all, we were very happy.",5,2016,10,08
121,Disappointed,"Booked this luxury hotel as a surprise 80th birthday weekend and was very disappointed to find that Room 879 did not reflect the luxury on entering the hotel and public areas.   The room was large enough but dated, drab and dusty.  Informed reception about disgusting urine acid staining around the toilet on marble floor.  This was checked out but informed it was due to cleaning products.  Sorry but been around long enough to recognise 'man urine' stains!   Other guests must have noticed this and the hotel should either replace the affected tiles or provide a mat around the toilet.  Better still, it would have been nice to have been offered a change of room.  Staff were polite, hotel in great location but this is definitely the worst four star hotel I have stayed in and grateful it was only for one night.",3,2016,10,08
121,Superb stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Taj. Staff were fabulous, polite, help & friendly. Our room was a perfect size, we were very comfortable. Location was excellent, very central but without traffic & street noise. Easy walk to parks, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, pubs & Red Bus Stop.",5,2016,10,08
121,Expected more out of Taj,"•There were insects in the room. •A fly was sitting on the food, for which the housekeeping staff sprayed insect spray on the food. But, we were still charged in full, even though they were aware of the whole situation. •The staff behave in a better manner at check-in than check-out. •In terms of location, it's not bad. But if you want to do sightseeing or shopping, you would have to go to different areas. If you get a decent price, its better to stay in Covent Garden.",3,2016,10,08
121,Superb Experience,"My first stay at Taj London and I was very impressed by the service and quality of care. The rooms are excellent, staff super courteous and food is pretty good. Anubhav at the front desk was very helpful, ensured that all things are taken care of and personally checks periodically to see if the stay is comfortable. The hotel has excellent decor and for the price point and location, it turned out to be great value for money. I would be happy to return and experience the Taj hospitality again. Thank you to Anubhav and the team.",5,2016,10,05
121,Wonderful location,"Just returned from a two week trip to Europe that ended with a 4 night stay at the St. James Court Hotel in London. It is in a perfect location in the Westminster area. From the moment we checked in, we were treated wonderfully. We received an upgraded room because of the MasterCard we used. We had a corner room overlooking the courtyard and it was perfect. It was quite large, with a huge bathroom. The concierge ordered a car for our return trip to Heathrow, and everything went off without any problems.  Our room came with breakfast, and the breakfast was perfect. We were introduced to some Indian food that we hadn't had before and everything we tried was delicious. I will definitely stay here again if I return to London. ",5,2016,10,05
121,Great Hotel and Service,Excellent check in process. Great Food and Beverage offerings. Staff is very professional. True Indian hospitality. The  location of the hotel is great. Next to Buckingham palace. It is very close to St James Park tube station. Just 2 min walk. Westminster abbey and Victoria station is also 10 min walk. Great amenities.,5,2016,10,03
121,Good service and convenient,"We stayed at the Taj recently for a week as a family trip from the US. 
We wanted a place centrally located to the main tourist places yet a comfortable place with a good breakfast. 
I was impressed with the breakfast buffet which was included in our room. They had a lot of selection of cereals, breads, fruits and always had a warm Indian dish as a breakfast item.  They can also even custom make a few dishes on request. A good breakfast was nice to have before a long day running around the city. 
The service was excellent and felt we were treated very respectfully and appreciated.  The always greeted us when arriving or leaving for the day. 
The rooms we had were clean and the maid service was good. They do have some older rooms as well as some remodeled rooms. I stayed in an older one for a couple days ( it was not as impressive as the remodeled ones) before taking a weekend trip to Scottland. The hotel was kind enough to hold our luggage for those days. When we came back we were placed in the updated rooms.
The hotel price is high but relative too the location, the service and breakfast it's not too bad for a comfortable and nice holiday. I would look for specials on their website for possible better pricing. ",5,2016,10,03
121,Value for money relation just decent,"Spent two nights on a business trip. I think a fair rating would be 3.5 stars but we don't have that option in TripAdvisor. The room was ample however the maintenance was really poor. Humidity stains on the bathroom ceiling, scratches in the room tables and the curtains working poorly. The WC didn't flush properly. The building is huge and I got a room that was a 1:20 mins walk from the lift! (130 steps!). It looks like they give the rooms closer to the lift to frequent guest that was not my case. Maybe the ""frequent guests"" rooms have better maintenance. 
The service from the staff is very good and I had dinner in two of the restaurants and also had some snacks at the lobby bar, everything went very well regarding dining options. 

My guess is that you can get better options for that money in London.",3,2016,10,03
121,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this hotel. I even tried to cancel our next night's stay. For the price we paid, I expect ALL service to be excellent. It was not. The concierge lacked knowledge of what we asked about in the city and was not at all helpful. Same with the rest of the staff. There are very limited restaurants or coffee shops nearby, we had to catch a cab to eat. The lobby and room is nice and very pretty. That's the only positive thing I can say about this hotel.",2,2016,10,03
121,Great location with a few hiccups,We loved the location and the service was good but we did have issues with spotty internet service (actually it was rarely working) and our request for 2 beds which delayed our first nights sleep.  Overall it was a good hotel and I would stay again.,4,2016,10,03
121,Great Location,The hotel sits just 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace and a short distance to Westminsiter Abbey and Big Ben.  The rooms are spacious but not all are as up to date as they should be. Luck of the draw as to which one you get.  Be sure to get breakfast include as the restauarant charges a whopping amount for walk-ins.,4,2016,10,02
121,Nice but not 4 star....,"The Taj St. James rooms are more of a 2-3 star. Or at least the room they put us in.

Concierge is fantastic as are the folks at the front desk. 

We had a superior king room on the second floor. We'd asked for a quiet room away from the elevator. They gave us a room right behind the elevator, overlooking a noisy school yeard and nasty dumpster! Far from quiet! It also looked right into 2-3 huge office buildings...whose lights are on all night...right into our room! To make it even worse, every night, there was a hideous alarm noise coming from one of the buildings which make sleeping pretty difficult. It's a good thing I packed extra earplugs (for flying). 

The room smelled like a smoker had been in it, so we opened the window only to find a good 2 inches of bird poop on the ledge! The bath window had the same...totally disgusting and unacceptable! 

Our sheets had (small) holes in them, the walls were in desperate need of painting and the ceiling was cracked and peeling and needed repairs as well. The drapes were dirty, had holes in them and were falling off the hooks.

According to the front desk, the hotel was completely booked, so moving us was not an option. 

The location is fantastic...just a few minutes walk to Parliment, Buckingham Palace, The Thames, etc. Right around the corner are numerous restaurants and a little grocery store. There's also a great pub, The Albert. 

We did get a great deal on Hotels.com, but I doubt we'll ever stay here again.",4,2016,10,02
121,comfortable,"Excellent service during my visit. Their restaurants provided good service and their meals well done. Room spacious, clean and nicely decorated.  Places that I wanted to see were walking distance from the hotel.  

The least I liked was the sofa and end table in front of the elevator on my floor.  It was not kept up.  Coffee stain on table was not clean for two days, sofa was played on by kids.",4,2016,10,02
121,Great value for money.,"* Extremely well located. * Comfortable. * Excellent ambiance. * Reasonably priced. Given all of the above, this hotel is my number one choice when in London. Hard to beat its value for money. A classic.",5,2016,10,01
121,Not worth the value,"The only good thing about this hotel is its location, the patio and its history. Other than that, do not expect to feel at a 4 star hotel because it needs serious maintenance, the beds are extremely small, as well as the rooms with very old TV sets with no channel options, no music dock... The lobby area is also small, breakfast is expensive and nothing great. Cheaper and better? Go across the street.",3,2016,10,01
121,Return to London,"First stay at this central London hotel, very favorable location. Excellent rooms and staff. Did not eat at hotel, personal decisions. Within walking distance of many tourist sites and central London Parks. Close to theatre district. Staff helpful with any travel needs.",4,2016,10,01
121,Perfect!,Lovely hotel in a great location with superlative service and good amenities. Small gym (get there early or late). Close to tube and rail station. Rooms small but functional. Fun bar with live pianist in evening. Coming back!,5,2016,09,30
121,considering the room rate,"I think I paid a little more for the room. everything is very good/excellent as far as food, location, service goes. may be booking early might get room on a discounted rate...but still the hotel can be consider for other things.",5,2016,09,30
121,A really nice hotel,"A very friendly experience from start to finish. Clean, comfortable and relaxing. We had breakfast there but the dinner prices were a little more than surrounding restaurants. A central place for attractions, rail and tube.  Would certainly go back again.",5,2016,09,29
121,Staff was exceptional,"We just returned from a week staying at the St James Court Victoria Street in London....was very pleased with the look of the hotel, the bar, the breakfast, the staff, the kindness, the cleanliness ..all was exceptional.  The concierge staff was just so accommodating and helpful...would recommend highly....the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the size of the rooms but beautiful view of the garden and would love to return.  They couldnt be any nicer!!!!",4,2016,09,28
121,Could be better,"Upon arrival, there was no one at the entrance to help with luggage.  The hotel lobby is very impressive and quite beautiful.  check in service was very pleasant.  Our room was very dated and worn with a very narrow bathroom that had no exhaust.  There was a sign to keep the door closed during showers so as not to set off the smoke alarm! The TV was the smallest I had ever seen in a hotel.  Air conditioning was exceptionally quiet, but stopped working the last night.  Asked for an updated room upon check-in, but was told there were no other rooms.  They would let us know if any became available, but never did.  Upon checking out, again, there was no one to help with the luggage.  With so many luxury hotels in London with similiar pricing, I would not choose this one again.",3,2016,09,28
121,Classy Hotel for Business Stay,"I stayed in this hotel during a recent business trip to London. The location was fantastic, as was the onsite restaurants and hotel services. Easy to commute to from any of London's airports and is a 5-10 minute walk away from the nearest underground station which gives you access to all of London. I would definitely recommend staying here on any business trip to London!",5,2016,09,28
121,BEST VALUE FOR MONEY IN LONDON,"Excellent staff, very good location and Indian food. Fast service even tough the hotel is very big. good for walking in the morning as the Buckingham palace is just next to the property within 500 meters. The Bus / tube stations are near. Oxford street is within 20 mts walking distance.",4,2016,09,28
121,"Location, and Great Staff","I just finished a 5 day stay with this being my sixth trip to London. The St James Court or The Taj as local taxi drivers call it is by far my favorite for the price. I got breakfast daily included, coffee in the room. My room was cleaned before noon every day. This hotel is so centrally located, you can walk two blocks to Buckingham Palace and theater and great shopping is a 10 BPS taxi ride away. 
Everyone I interacted with at the hotel was delightful and all were more than happy to help in any way they could. 
I try to come to London once a year and when I return, I will return to St James Court or ""Taj"".",5,2016,09,28
121,Very nice but could be outstanding,"This is a beautiful hotel; good service and spacious rooms. However, although we had a lot of space in our King room, it lacked the extra touches... No complimentary water, no coffee machine (only instant coffee sachets), no turn down service, the TV was tiny and the toilet seat seemed very cheap.
On the plus side: lovely big comfy bed, good food, good service 2pm check and 12 noon check out, clean and tidy and excellent location.
This is a perfect hotel if you haven't been spoilt by the Langham or Four Seasons.",4,2016,09,26
121,A nice stay ruined by overcharging,"I was upgraded without particularly wanting it.  An amount was authorised on my card which was over and above what I was expecting to pay.  I was told the difference would be refunded when I checked out.  Next morning I explained the situation to another desk clerk and paid the amount I expected to pay.  When I returned home and checked my bank account I saw that the previous, higher amount was gone from my account as well as the expected amount.  I phoned the hotel, they said it was a system error.  I will be refusing all upgrades in future.  Beware of this.  Apparently the amount would have been returned to me at the end of the month - which for me would have caused significant problems.  So I paid more than twice for my stay and am still waiting for reimbursement.",4,2016,09,26
121,A Very Good Stay,"The location of this hotel has to be the best selling point, it is very convenient for any landmark or tourist spot in central London. The hotel itself is very grand and it has a stunning courtyard. The room I stayed in was spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and for London prices, the hotel was reasonable. Overall my stay was great and I would recommend.",4,2016,09,26
121,St James top class,"Great Location. Lovely Hotel. Rooms are spacious and interior is classy. All the stuff like Tea, coffee, Water bottles, Toiletries, Bed furnishings top class. All the restaurants are very good and food is distict. Staff is very warm, prompt. Above all once you know that it is a Taj Hotel of Tata group you can trust them for every thing. I find rates reasonable.",4,2016,09,26
121,Great hotel,"Stayed here for one night because we were in London for a party. 

Fantastic location. Polite, efficient and professional staff. Beautiful courtyard. Room was large and spacious, very clean and given the age of the building they have managed to make it feel fresh and relatively modern. Bed was very comfy!

Only complaint is the bathroom. Good size but really badly designed. Toilet so close to the bath/shower. And to flush the toilet the seat cover has to to be down. Wouldn't stop me staying again though.

Can't comment on good as we didn't eat there but would imagine it's good.

Would recommend a stay here!",5,2016,09,25
121,Disappointed For The Price,"This is a stunning hotel. Hands down. And the staff were beyond excellent. That said, for the price we paid, we were disappointed.  The bed was average comfortable. Though, I was thankful we had a King sized bed which is hard to find in the UK. Needing a tutorial on how to run the lights and  heating  was intimidating. The thing it, we never did find all the light switches, and as you had to leave your room card in the light switch box at the door, to operate the lights, using the facilities in the middle of the night might mean turning on more lights than you intended and waking up others. We also never figured out the television, which was annoying as we're somewhat technologically inclined. Overall the stay here was fine. I was expecting far more for the price. That's all.",3,2016,09,25
121,"Staying for one night after our Son's wedding at National Liberal Club, London","I booked hotel direct and our stay with our family of total 12 was superb.  Rooms clean, kids loved the family room, very spacious.  Breakfast delicious and nothing was too much trouble, very accommodating and friendly staff.  Would certainly stay again when in London.",5,2016,09,25
121,Good and bad,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful with its atrium courtyard which it shares with the other Hotels within its group. It has a feel of being abroad. The rooms were spacious and clean but a little dated. And the lift is minute, two people and two cases was a squeeze. Our check in experience however was not the best, the staff though pleasant did not appear to be fully trained in what to do, we did not arrive till almost 9pm so were shocked to find our room wasn't ready. As we had been travelling since late afternoon we were anxious to freshen up and find somewhere to eat but had to wait almost half an hour before being given our room key. 
The hotel is in a perfect location for Buckingham Palace on the left and Victoria station and shopping area on the right. On our second night we ate in the restaurant attached to the hotel which was fine dining and very reasonably priced. I'm not sure I would return as I found it very expensive for room only. ",4,2016,09,25
121,Exceptional,"The best hotel in London, period. The service, location and food are really great stuff. The hotel is so beautiful that we want to stay there all time. I am totally satisfied with this place to stay at London, no better place to be.",5,2016,09,24
121,Great Hotel,"Loved the hotel, the food was great, the service was great. It was clean and the staff could not do enough for you. I will be staying there again for sure. My only moan is you can't park your car near the hotel. But that's London for you.",5,2016,09,23
121,Great hotel,"Excellent stay. The staff was very polite and helpful. Made me feel relaxed - which was my intention with the trip. The location is very central. We visited the wellness Spa as well, and we really enjoyed that too.",5,2016,09,23
121,"Great Location, Average service","Great Location, were very proud to book & stay, but was disappointed as my daughter could not feel special on her birthday on 20th June 2016. The breakfast was good but Housekeeping was a great disappointment. Finally we completed the trip & returned.",3,2016,09,22
121,SERVICE,Enjoyed the stay. Thanks for he car and service.  Location is ideally suited to stay comfortably and also visit places. surronded by good shopping and eating places. Also very near to tourist spots. Cordial staff and caring service. THANKS.,5,2016,09,21
121,Delightful Four Days!!,"Great hotel, we  enjoyed our stay very much.  Walked to all the sites in Westminister. There is a cab stand and tube entrance very close, so transportation was easy.  Lovely breakfast and the hotel restaurant was one of our best dinners in London.",5,2016,09,21
121,Open London,An ideal location to visit the many sites and sights of London that are open and free of charge for this one and only weekend each year. I heartily recommend this hotel to all who value opulence and timeous friendly service.,5,2016,09,21
121,Visit to Buckingham Palace,"We were taking our elderly parents to visit the palace so the location of the hotel was perfect ,even though one of our party were in a wheelchair it was a short walk to the Palace .On arrival the Lady on the check in desk was very helpful and during our short stay all the staff were friendly and helpful.The hotel is very grand ,rooms are roomy ,well equipped and clean. It also has an outside area which is nice to sit and relax in.The only slight critism was the cost of breakfast and as my parents don't eat too much we felt it was too much to pay,however there are lots of places in vicinity that serve breakfasts at reasonable prices.",5,2016,09,21
121,Amazing Hotel/Staff,"I can't say enough about the service and staff at this hotel.  Top notch!  Birthday cake in the room when we arrived.  Bright, large room with a nice selection of teas.  Staff very friendly.  Thank you for a great stay an we hope to return.  I will definately recommend the hotel to my colleagues.",5,2016,09,20
121,Five Star Hotel  - Excellent,"St. James Court is a classic hotel with lovely decor and excellent service. From the minute you check in, you are treated like royalty. This hotel is within walking distance of all the major attractions. Buckingham palace, Westminster Abbey, London Eye and Parliament/Big Ben. The rooms are very comfortable and updated. Simeon from housekeeping was extremely helpful and goes above and beyond for the guest staying at the hotel. St. James Court was a true pleasure to stay at during my stay in the UK.",5,2016,09,18
121,Great Location,"Little Veg options for breakfast, quite a walk from the lift to the room untill you get a room closer to the lift and also doesn't live upto the Taj Indian hotel standards & hospitality.   Location was fantastic as its a close walk form the train station and the palace and other sites are close by.",3,2016,09,17
121,Poor facilities,Aging hotel with poor facilities. Dated plumbing and air-conditioning system that did not work.  Alternate room offered was not satisfactory and in fact worse. The box room air-conditioner was noisy and inadequate.,2,2016,09,17
121,Courtyard Restaurant - Little India,"We were invited to lunch here and found the experience to be mediocre at best. This hotel operates like any Taj hotel in India. Staff have the lackadaisical attitude we see in all but the best hotels in India and both the meal and service were poor. Small portion sizes and quick ""coffee shop"" style that you find in hotels catering to tour groups. Not at all worth visiting.",3,2016,09,17
121,Good location but not upto TAJ standard whatsoever ,"Overall the experience was underwhelming, due to poor and inexperienced service:
- check in: despite requesting early check and being gold member, was told to wait in a crowded lobby 
- check in : long wait to speak to someone and not very friendly counter staff

- room service: inexperienced staff taking orders and this was shown since they brought 2 wrong dishes

- breakfast: poor selection of breakfast (could get better at a Novotel honestly)

- breakfast: ill mannered staff that are super frantic (clearly not very experienced) - too many people for such a small area

",2,2016,09,17
121,Amazing experience,"This place is brilliant from top to bottom. Everything you'd expect and more, and what a location. Had a room overlooking the courtyard, which was lovely, and beautiful to walk through the park after the fantastic buffet breakfast.",5,2016,09,14
121,London for 2 nights,"Having only 2 nights in London I wanted a location that would afford me quick access to all the attractions and this one did.  Lovely hotel and staff, well priced for a mid range hotel, great location. Would stay at again.  Beautiful and relaxing courtyard.",5,2016,09,14
121,excellent,Fist class hotel with first class treatment and not overpriced. Staff very welcoming and helpful.  Room perfect and comfortable and quite.   Excellent location and a must to stay at. Try it  Triple A*plus,5,2016,09,13
121,Proud feeling having Taj here,"I must say that no hotel or restaurants can beat Taj when it comes to customer service, tradition & atmosphere. Friendly staff. Loved being there with my friends & was feeling proud that we have Taj here similar like have one in India. Must visit. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,09,13
121,Mad Hatter Afternoon Tea,"Went to Taj Hotel on the 8th September for my husbands Birthday, we LOVED it. 
The theming was excellent, the food was gorgeous and the staff were really helpful/friendly. 
I also did inform the staff when I booked it was my husband birthday and towards the end of our experience, the staff came out singing ""Happy Birthday"" with a lovely quirky Victoria Sponge Cake. 
The whole experience was amazing and would HIGHLY recommend. 
Already looking to book the Jungle Book Afternoon Tea at St James Court. 😊",5,2016,09,13
121,Mrs,Just ended a week at this wonderful hotel. Everything and everyone was excellent.  Very helpful staff. Location was great walking distance to so many place.will return for sure. The beds were very comfortable. We were very pleased. ,5,2016,09,13
121,Worth a visit,"Enjoyed a very peaceful two night stay.  The staff at the hotel were very professional, friendly and helpful. The hotel offers a variety of meal choices at its various restaurants. Great location for many main attractions.  Enjoyed it so much that we are considering returning to the hotel before we return home to Australia.",4,2016,09,13
121,Nice Suite,"Stayed for 4 days in a One Bedroom suite (Kings 1011).  Lots of room with a kitchen, living room and bedroom with separate bath.  Large by European norms.

Room was services twice a day.  Staff was very helpful.",5,2016,09,12
121,Great location in the city ,"Lovely hotel ideally situated in the heart of the city.  Two minutes walking distance from Buckingham Palace and round the corner from Westminster.  You can easily walk anywhere from this hotel.  

Room was nice and clean.  The only thing I didn't like was my room was at the opposite side of the hotel from the elevator.  Long walk to my room 

Spa was lovely and treatment by Jane for my facial and massage was excellent.  

I would defiantly return to this hotel ",4,2016,09,12
121,Fantastic stay,Loved St James Court. The beautiful courtyard right in the middle of London. Hotel so close to Buckingham Palace - almost a stones throw. Easy walk to Trafalgar Square with Portrait Art Gallery.  We walked back through Hyde Park over the bridge with the swans. Amazing view of the Palace over the water. We had afternoon tea - The Jungle Book - and added the Prosecco - which topped it off well.,5,2016,09,12
121,Excellant,"Stayed just the night as we had a day in London.
Straight away you feel welcomed and know it's going to be a great place to stay.
The staff from the reception to the waiters are top class from service to the way they treat and interact with the customers.
Cocktails are wonderful, breakfast is first class, room had a king six bed and everything you needed.
Will definitely return when we need to stay in London.",5,2016,09,11
121,Very good location,A very well located hotel. It lives upto its Taj experience reputation. Hotel staff is friendly. We had a special request of freezing a cold compress pad which the staff went out of its way to have it frozen in their in room dining refrigerator.,5,2016,09,11
121,taj london,stay at Taj hotels in India so tried this one in the UK. Not as sumptuous as India and service not as good. Cant really compare but nevertheless an excellent hotel in the heart of London. Would definitely visit again.,4,2016,09,11
121,Very nice place,Stayed here for 3 nights at the start of a vacation trip. Very nice location and overall excellent facility.  Room was very nicely appointed and breakfast was excellent. My wife left something there and staff was very responsive and helpful.,4,2016,09,11
121,Everyting we wanted  from location to service,"We stayed for 5 nights end of August 2016. Perfect location!! Minutes from Buckingham palace , tube , hop on/off bus, 10 mins to Westminster, about 18 mins to strand !!!! Café across the road , hairdresser a minute away, minutes away for money change - perfect location!!! Went to West End for 4 plays Kinky Boots/A sunny afternoon/ Funny Girl/ Mousetrap - finished around 10.30 walked back around 11.00 -11.30PM and it was always safe as well!!! Hotel room lovely and comfortable and the bathroom well laid out and worked really well. All the  staff  were always helpful and courteous. Always found the  the doorman welcoming!!  Dinner at the bistro - great food and again great service and great breakfast . I find it hard to relax sometimes but  I found the ambience in the courtyard wonderful. The bartender made wonderful cocktails and was very helpful. Found the rooms very quiet and peaceful. Highly recommended and as a five star hotel price was great!!",5,2016,09,11
121,Amazing,"Of all the hotels we've stayed at around the globe, St. James Court in London is #1 in customer service.   Having had an awful traveling experience with British Airways and losing my luggage, it was a relief to arrive at St. James Court to such a warm and friendly staff.",5,2016,09,10
121,Great location,"We recently stayed at the St James for 14 nights in a king size room with breakfast included. We enjoyed our stay and found the staff very freindly and welcoming. We went down to breakfast early and found it relaxing but we did notice it was very busy later on. The courtyard is beautiful, but we only had drinks there twice and left quickly because of other people smoking. Not nice for non smokers and there is no way would I would want to order food there, which is a shame. 
Our room looked out over the side entrance and the window can be opened which is good. The  bathroom was nice and had a handheld shower which I prefer. I could hear people in the next room talking during two days of our stay.",4,2016,09,10
121,"St James Court, a Taj Hotel","This hotel is in a wonderful location, 5 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and 10 minutes walk from Westminster.  There are three pubs across the road and in Petty France a few yards away, and 2 cafes across the road.  A lane down the side of the hotel (go right as you exit and right again) takes you to Victoria Road and more bars and restaurants. Our executive room overlooking the courtyard was a good size, light and airy, all the windows opened and there was no traffic or other noise, a very nice room with a very comfortable super king bed.  The courtyard makes a lovely place to sit out and to dine in warm weather. Service was mostly excellent, we ate in the Bistro, the starters were brilliant, but as so often happens, the main courses were disappointing.  There are 4 restaurants however so it would be worth trying the others.  Drinks etc are expensive as you would expect in a hotel like this in the centre of London, but I wouldn't let that put you off staying.  Ask for a room looking over the courtyard, 430 was very nice. Overall the hotel is very smart and luxurious, but location and the courtyard make it a great place to stay.",5,2016,09,09
121,Great value,"A five star hotel but much cheaper than some of the other posh hotels in inner London. Lots of character and a great location. Rooms are spacious and modern, and other amenities (such as the fitness room) are excellent. We had no complaints at all about our stay.",5,2016,09,08
121,Nice Hotel!!,The Hotel location is very nice if you want a pleasant evening in the city. You can walk around nearby in the London streets. I stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip. The rooms are comfortable and clean. I enjoyed my visit here.,4,2016,09,08
121,Hidden Gems,"This is one of the hidden gems in the heart of London near Buckingham Palace. Went to see one of my business partner that logged in this hotel and the warm welcome that I received is overwhelming . The staff were caring, beautiful and lovely. Just too excellent ",5,2016,09,07
121,An Oasis in busy London,"After our long flight from Melbourne, Australia we received a warm welcome from the Staff. Our room was clean and comfortable. We spent 4 nights at St James which gave us easy access to Pubs, Restaurants, shops and sightseeing. It was a perfect location with many things within walking distance",4,2016,09,07
121,Is this the TAJ,Arrival check in was unpleasant and has to wait 25 mins to get room on the same floor as my colleague but still did not get one. This hotel does not have a standing shower and the tub is so raised that  the chances of people  falling is more and the shower in the tus is a hand shower that needs to be adjusted. Breakfast place was so filled that there were no seats. Not staying there again ever.,3,2016,09,07
121,Classic and modern,"For a London stay, A Taj Hotel was a great place to stay. Short walk to the underground, great and quiet location and very friendly staff. The bed was firm, though a bit short for my 6'3'', as well as the showerhead wasn't adjustable height-wise. No issues with the staff - and the breakfast in the room was very nice!",5,2016,09,07
121,"Great Location and Staff, poor rooms","Great Location and Staff and food! However some areas of the hotel are run down and our bathroom was not up to the standard of the bedroom - dated. We also had to ask twice for our room to be serviced. Overall we would stay again, but be very definite about room allocation.",4,2016,09,05
121,"Good location, met expectations","This hotel lived up to expectations,although the first room that was allocated was really not up to the standard expected but after a bit of a wait we were offered a much nicer room overlooking the internal courtyard. 

Breakfast was reasonably good and serving staff were obliging and helpful.  Free Wifi worked well. 

Short walk to Buckingham Palace and there were many restaurant optIons nearby. Bongusto, an Italian restaurant on the corner was an excellent choice for a really good, appetising meal - so good we visited twice. 

The stop for the hop on hop off bus was only a short walk from the hotel. 

Took the public bus to visit Borough Market which was a worthwhile experience. 

Would recommend this hotel for easy access to what London has to offer.",4,2016,09,05
121,An experience ,"This was my 1st visit to the uk and had heard that staying in central london was ridiculously expensive. Had an amazing visit to St. James court london, the staff and the overall experience reminds us why there is so much faith of the people with  the taj hotels. Being an inner circle member was upgraded to a exec. Junior suite. The room was excellent, the breakfast as much to be desired from, it's a typical English breakfast and for those who have stayed with the taj before know that they can do a much better breakfast. Overall I think was a fabulous experience, and would recommend anyone who wants to visit and stay in central london to just stay here.",5,2016,09,05
121,My favourite hotel,"Myself and Partner have been here twice now and are back in November. We have always had lovely service! Polite and friendly. We Celebrated my partners birthday the 1st year (hotel supplied a cake! Great gesture for free) and last year we got engaged in London, the hotel was lovely and perfectly timed a surprise (rose petal bed ECT not free but worth it, was lovely)The rooms we have stayed in have been great, spacious, clean, courtyard view and we had a fantastic and very yummy breakfast in bed. The location is great to get around london which is the icing on the cake for our few days away treat. We Will look forward to coming back! :-) :-) ",5,2016,09,04
121,Wow!,"What a fantastic trip. We took advantage of an offer which included afternoon tea.  Our experience at the hotel was fantastic from the friendly check in, to the room, the food the cocktails. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and would not hesitate to return. Highly recommended ",5,2016,09,04
121,A bit disappointing ,Booked the St James for a family weekend. Location is great and was perfect for our trip to see Wicked in Victoria. When we got back from the theatre there was a terrible low rumbling noise in our top floor room. We phoned down about 10.30 and by 11.30 the noise stopped - possibly the roof fans apparently. Next night noise was less noticeable but still there. So don't go for the 7th floor. Breakfast disappointing for such a high end hotel too. ,3,2016,09,04
121,Shame about the breakfast,"The lobby of the hotel is stunning, and the staff courteous and helpful. The room itself was large and the bed extremely comfortable. The let down, and it was a big one, was the breakfast. It was the usual buffet style but the bread and the croissants were stale. The prepared fruit selection was meagre and the toast was shop bought sliced. However, the middle eastern potato dish and spinach pancake my husband had was delicious. We also were seated at a dark table next to the serving hatch. Considering the difference between the room only and the B&B rate was about £30 per head it was a great disappointment. For that reason I can only give an average rating. ",3,2016,09,04
121,Last minute booking,"It's a last min booking. Our original booking was a lie, we have to find a place to accomodate our elderly parents at the very last minute.  The location of Taj is good and convenience. Easy to get around, like 10-20 mins walk to Westminister, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Churchill War Room. It's prefect for us as we travelled with elderly.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Surely I will recommend my friends and family to stay at Taj.",4,2016,09,04
121,Always an outstanding stay,"I stay at the Taj frequently and always have an outstanding stay. Welcoming and efficient staff, good sized rooms quality , and an excellent location. There is also a good range of restaurant options at the hotel",5,2016,09,04
121,Welcoming 2 night stay,"We arrived at the hotel, and our room was ready to check-in, and that was half hour before the normal check-in time, we had rang ahead and said when our train from Yorkshire arrived in Kings X, and they said they would try and have our room available a little early, and they did. We had paid for 2 night stay in a King Size room, and that's what we got. It was lovely spacious room in a quiet location across the courtyard, so we got a great night's sleep.
I had mentioned it was our 20th wedding anniversary and the hotel very kindly sent us some chocolates and drinks to our room which was lovely touch.
There was a good hairdryer in the room and the usual shampoo, conditioner and body wash / shower cap. There was a mini bat but we warned it is very expensive, so we did not use. 
Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and we could not fault the customer service. We did think that breakfast at £20 each was on the pricey side. Worth signing up for the Taj Rewards as easy to do, and free, and gets you discounts off food and drink in the hotel over your stay.
The lobby is very luxurious, and the piano playing in the evening a lovely touch by the bar. We did eat in the hotel on the first night. There is a choice of 4 diff. restaurants, we dined in the bistro, which was reasonably priced and very nice food. We did look at the menu in the Michelin Starred Indian Quilon also, but found it to be quite expensive so we left it and dined at the bistro.
Overall, we had a lovely 2 night stay here. It was only a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace to see Changing of the Guard the next morning, and we got there for 10.30 am and saw lots. very close to St James Park also, a lovely area. A tube station is only 5 mins walk away too. taxi from Kings X to the hotel cost us £18.",4,2016,09,02
121,Average,"Stayed here for one night last week.
Position is ideal for sightseeing, being minutes away from Buckingham Palace and with easy connections to other attractions.
Check in was quick and easy but we were a little disappointed with the room which was badly in need of decoration but was rather cramped but reasonably clean.
Bathroom was a good size with a supply of toiletries and a pleasure to have good size and soft towels.
Breakfast was a disappointment. I found the cooked breakfast tasteless especially the scrambled eggs which were very watery..
Apparently I could have ordered a fried egg along with other choices but that would have been extra.
All in all reasonably average and nothing to shout about",3,2016,09,02
121,How to relax in the middle of London...,"A great one night stay to refresh both body and mind, right in the middle of London. Sipping champagne in the courtyard, eating canapés and chatting with friends was a million miles away from the ""hustle & bustle"" of London....",4,2016,09,02
121,A blip in experience - I hope,"I am a regular stayer at St Jame's Park, using it for business regularly.  This time I brought my wife for a rare night out in London.  I'd set her expectations high, as my experience has always been quite good [during the week].  

Check in took 10 mins!
Our room was old and tired!
We went to the hotel bar for a drink before going out - the staff were uninterested and the service poor / lazy.
Drinks were expensive.
Not a great impression in our first hour.

Check out was fast and efficient - unsurprising as we left at 7am on a Sunday.  We couldn't face breakfast.

A blip - I hope.",2,2016,08,31
121,A touch of Eastern promise,"From the minute we entered the building to the minute we left, we experienced nothing but exceptional customer service.  We had a minor problem with our room, and within 10 minutes we were upgraded at no extra cost.  There are three restaurants within the hotel; all fantastic. This four star hotel, is better than a lot of the five star hotels I have visited previously; we will definitely be returning very soon. ",5,2016,08,30
121,Good location but over priced ,"I have recently stayed in this hotel with my fiancé and found it to be pleasant overall. The lobby, bar and restaurant areas are lovely and modern/well decorated and the service was overall very good with concierge and waiters/waitresses being attentive and polite. However, we booked a double room which was tiny, including the bed! Our bed at home was bigger than the bed in our room, although it was comfortable. Our room and the corridors to rooms are tired and in need of decoration. Unfortunately I also found a couple of thick black lobs hairs in our bathroom (not ours!) during our stay which was a shame. The room however did appear to be clean. We have stayed in a lot better presented a modern hotels in central London for less. Overall the hotel was nice, but over priced for what you get. Don't be fooled by the smart lobby area! ",4,2016,08,30
121,The best stay overseas,"Fankly, I have visited all part of the world & have always stayed in hotels of some or other big chain of hotels. But, the experience, I had with ST. James Court, London was out of the world. The staff made everything possible with ease. Thnks",5,2016,08,30
121,Great Value and Location,"First time to London and a friend recommended the hotel  to us due to proximity  to their more expensive timeshare at the Taj nextdoor. This was a beautiful hotel and priced very reasonably, especially for the great location. Due to construction noise in the very near vicinity, we were glad we had a ""sound machine"" to help us sleep.",5,2016,08,30
121,London Stay,"This hotel is a luxury hotel to stay, which is within walking distance of many London attractions. The level of service is faultless and any needs were attended to immediately. The atmosphere and ambience of the hotel is calming and welcoming and will look forward to revisiting again",4,2016,08,30
121,Oasis in London,"This was a short 2 stay for us to go around London and this hotel helped us do that and more.  This is an oasis of luxury located right in the middle of the city, close to the major attractions and 5 mins from the tube.  We also had a great staff that made the stay memorable.",5,2016,08,29
121,Week end in London,Ideal location for visiting London or going to any show down town. Very friendly professional personnel. The room was very comfortable and all we needed was there. A highly recommendable place for Business or Leisure.,5,2016,08,29
121,Best hotel and location,"We stayed here for 6 nights. The hotel, rooms , breakfast and the service was superior!!! We loved the location and the courtyard was nice and peaceful to sit and relax after a long day. Thank you for making our stay so perfect in every way. When I come back to London I would stay here again!!! Perfect ",5,2016,08,29
121,EXCELLENT POSITION,"Excelent position, the breakfast was very poor. The stuff was very polite and the rooms was comfortable.The wi-fi was fast and the room was clean and quite.The place was nice decorated and the stuff was very helpful",4,2016,08,29
121,Taj service in London,"This was our first stay at St James's Court and will hopefully not be the last. The hotel is lovely both inside and out. Given the good weather, the courtyard is a lovely tranquil place for a pre-dinner drink. The outstanding thing about this hotel is the staff and the service they provide. Many are Indian with most others being from eastern Europe. But what a pleasure to find such a high degree of customer service in a London hotel. It is after all five star rated but is modeled on their Indian hotels which we have stayed at in the past.
We had a classic room which was fine, although an odd shape.It overlooked the courtyard and was very quiet. Maybe next time we will try to get an upgraded room if we can get a good deal.
The buffet  breakfast was OK although I would avoid the powdered scrambled egg which was a let down for a 5 star property. We had poached eggs on two mornings which were far better. I am not sure that small packets of butter are 5 star. We ate in the Bank conservatory on two nights. The food was variable one night, very good on the second. I have also eaten at Quilon which lives up to its Michelin star.
So a lot to recommend especially if you are going down the road to see HM!",5,2016,08,28
121,Great location,"The St. James' Court hotel is located very centrally in London, only about a five-minute walk from Buckingham Palace, and close to the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and the St. James Park Underground station.    The hotel is full-service and provides a number of nice amenities.  I stayed in an Executive King Room, which featured a modern decor, particularly in the bathroom.  It appears that the Executive rooms are more contemporary in decor, while the Classic rooms feature a more traditional look.  Based on reviews on other sites, I decided to book the Executive room and was glad I did.    I have no real complaints about this property.  It's probably a bit overpriced, but that's not surprising given its central location.  The breakfast room gets rather crowded in the morning.  However, on only one day out of the six we were there did my friend and I have to go to an overflow room to eat.  In all, I would recommend the St. James' Court to anyone visiting Central London, though I would recommend finding a discount price if possible, or perhaps consider pre-paying for the cheaper rate (which is what I did).",4,2016,08,28
121,Visited twice perfect location and hotel ,"Previously, visited twice in the last few years. Lovely hotel, great decor and brilliant location for shopping, site seeing and business. Really enjoyable stay. Cocktails were delicious and so was the room service full English breakfast I ordered. Lovely and traditional at Christmas. ",5,2016,08,27
121,Great hotel,"Well priced hotel in great location, very clean with friendly helpful staff. Good selection of wine and being an Aussie the beer was cold. The doorman was quick to hand us an umbrella as it was raining.",5,2016,08,27
121,Outstanding property close to all the landmarks in central London,"This hotel would be classified as luxury and is one of the closest to Buckingham Palace. It is also within easy walking distance of St James’ Park, Westminster Cathedral, Big Ben, The Houses of Parliament, the War Museum, and Trafalgar Square.

The walk to the Tower Bridge, the Tower of London, and St. Paul's Cathedral is a bit longer but easily doable. We only took taxis when attending live theater shows in the evening.

We had breakfast included with our meal but that is only with special promotions.

There is a nice little coutyard with a fountain out in the back as well.

The concierge is also very helpful.",5,2016,08,26
121,Exceptional stay at Hotel,"Really enjoyed myself, all staff were very professional and helpful.    Enjoyed their breakfast buffet in bistro restaurant on ground floor (next to reception) which I went in about 6am. I enjoyed my room, very quiet and no issues. I'm glad I picked this hotel over Amba Hotel Marble Arch, London because of its' reasonable price and location.  I've already booked hotel in advance for 2x more times over next month as I'm still on holiday traveling around western Europe.  Looking forward to coming back soon!",5,2016,08,26
121,Very conveniently located,A decent hotel very near to buckingham westminster etc. The service is good and they offer indian dishes in their morning buffet too. Not a noisy area but still near the attractions. The building is a bit old but the rooms are well maintained. The wifi speed is just ok for a 4 star hotel,4,2016,08,26
121,Lovely stay,"Grand hotel with every thing you need
Perfect location 
Near enough to everything but just out of the crazy traffic
Very obliging staff 
Concierge especially helpful
Will definitely return
Breakfast is good but very busy so go early
The courtyard is lovely and great for smokers without bothering other guests
Best smoking room in London 
Westminster Buckingham palace ,west end,Knightsbridge all in walking distance
",5,2016,08,24
121,definitely coming back,"The hotel is in an amazing location, specifically by the Buckingham palace, Buckingham gate. All the tourism attractions are 5-10 minutes drive away. Thank you to all those who made the stay comfortable and unforgettable.",5,2016,08,24
121,Weekend in London,Hotel well placed for easy access into central London. Rooms lovely and quiet. Service was second to none. Only downside drinks in bar very expensive but I expect this is the same in all hotels in London. The Bank restaurant attached to hotel served nice food at average London prices but decor let it down. Needs a refurb unlike the hotel which was impressive. Would stay here again if visiting London.,5,2016,08,23
121,Grand Style in Wonderful Location,"The service at this property is top notch.  From the reception, housekeeping, etc.  The continental breakfast is worth it if included in the price.  The location could not be better for Buckingham Palace & The St. James's tube stop. --- Wait!  Please be advised that not all rooms have updated bathrooms.  I booked a Classic Jr. Suite and the
bathroom was old.  Was kindly moved to an Executive Jr. Suite at a 20% premium per night, but it was worth it. --- The friend I was traveling with had an executive room & it was fine. --- There is a bit of age showing here & there with chipped paint & worn carpets. --- The lobby is beautiful. --- Overall I would give this property a very good rating.---- Room 609.",4,2016,08,23
121,Vacation at the Taj,"A wonderful hotel right in the heart of London!!!  Across the from the palace guards barracks short block from Buckingham Palace one block over from beautiful St James park. Quiet!!! Hotel staff are an A+ in service from checking in the door man ,and the man who delivers your luggage and the wonderful concierge,who remembered our names by second day!!!It is an old hotel with upstairs and room a little worn (but working on that) we upgraded for an extra $ 25 and got a two room suite with a view of the beautiful courtyard where there is a small outdoor restaurant .  The room had the most comfortable bed and the softest sheets sparkling white sheets!  A couch two chairs coffee station with fridge and three dressers a bench and good size closet and desk and two tv's , bathroom was a good size too.  
 
Breakfast was included in the room charge a buffet that had everything plus omelette and any eggs ordered at table. Was located in the restaurant that becomes Bistro 51! The food at that restaurant was terrific a 10!!!  
 
Other restaurants in hotel are also 10's with a bar my husband said made great drinks.
Then there is the room service -had it twice for dinner table is brought to room fully set white tablecloth to flowers and great food also a 10!!!  Said it would be there in a normal 25 minutes but was therein 10!!!! Server was also the best!!!

Been there twice now this time nine days and will be back again 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

121,Great Hotel !,"I came with my 9 years old son to show him London. The Hotel is very nice ! The concierge was very helpful while booking us tickets for many attractions, even Harry's Potter studios which we couldn't get as we were trying to book them only few days before. The check in was fast, the lady in the reception was very kind. The room was very clean, breakfast is just great ! It seems that all the staff in the hotel is very kind, nice and helpful ! The location is also great, 2-3 min from st. James tube, close to Buckingham palace, and the area, and have places to eat and drink around the hotel. Next time I will be in London I will sure book this hotel again.

Yaniv ",5,2016,08,22
121,Perfect Location,"We stayed in the hotel for 5 days. The location is perfect, near Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament and Victoris Station. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The staff is very kind and helpful. We will come back on our next visit to London.",5,2016,08,22
121,Best Hotel in Central London,"very good staff, big rooms, big bed, good hospitality, agreed to keep my luggage for 3 addiitonal days...nice gift pack for my daughter..room nos 166 is very good..good connectivity..st james park station is 5mins...new scotland yard bus stop is 3mins walk",5,2016,08,22
121,great hotel,"We enjoyed a wonderful week at the St.James Court and felt well taken care of by the staff. The hotel is lovely,clean and comfortable and aesthetically very pleasing.The location is wonderful,just steps from Buckingham Palace and St.James park.Underground around the corner and so convenient for navigating London easily.Highly recommend it.",5,2016,08,22
121,Treated !! ,"What a beautiful exquisite hotel ! Staff are the perfect mix of professionalism and friendliness ! Location is fantastic, next door to The Palace ! Rooms are as expected, large , comfortable, bathroom lovely but the best thing is the staff ! Cocktails are well worth the money ! Treat yourself!! ",5,2016,08,21
121,Afternoon Tea at the Kona Cafe,This was a great experience with careful and very helpful service.   The tea rooms are quiet and tables set apart so that quiet conversation can take place.  The selection of teas are good and the taste excellent.   Our sandwiches were good if a little under exciting.   However the elderflower jelly was pretty tasteless and the little Victoria sponges were rather stale.  The scones were also a bit dry.   Yet I would certainly return as everything else was perfect.,4,2016,08,21
121,Week end with friends from Australia at the Taj,"We had a one night stay at this hotel and could not fault any aspect of our stay. Hotel staff welcoming and happy to assist. Our room overlooking the court yard was perfect and the room clean and very comfortable with all the extras, robes, safe , mini bar, hair dryer, etc etc .... Full breakfast was fantastic with again helpful and happy staff to assist. Location of this hotel is excellent if you are doing the Buckingham palace or Hyde park visits, and is only two minutes walk from St James park tube station which is on the circle or district lines which link up with most tourist areas in London. Not the cheapest in this area but well recommended for an enjoyable stay in London for the week end.",5,2016,08,21
121,Back to London,"We were booked in for 5 nights but in fact were away for one night unexpectedly  Location, location, location.....within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, yet it seems to be in a quiet corner.  We were greeted by the Commissionaire and our luggage was immediately attended to.  The Lobby is opulent.  The rooms are smaller than in some hotels due to the age of the place which was once a hospital we understand but more than adequate to accommodate us and our luggage and bedroom and bathroom were immaculate.  Unlike some older hotels in England it is fully air-conditioned plus the windows can be opened.  Free WiFi a bit patchy but better in the Lobby and Bar area. Service excellent!",4,2016,08,20
121,"""Amazing Taj hospitality "" - at its best ","5 star is less. I wish I could give 7 stars to this hotel. Location - Central London . Awesome. Quiet . But very close to happening spots . Our check in was smooth. Yamini & Nisha @ the reception desk were great. Our executive suite was beyond words. The staff was very warm. Very good Breakfast . Restaurants are amazing there . Quilon is a must try for all Indians and international tourists . Yamini helped us throughout . Lots of upgrades for us being a Taj Gold inner circle member. 

Very comfy rooms & beds. You just can't complain . For central London - it's not a hotel but a resort . As it is very spacious . Pictures that are online don't do justice. It is better than it looks. 

In short it every penny worth it. !! 
Don't waste your time booking holiday inns, hiltons @ busy streets or Amba hotels , they are overly priced for the quality they give. 

Very happy customers of Taj . 
Regards

121,Great Hotel,"My daughter & I stayed for 4 nights. The room we were given was lovely, very clean & tidy. We unfortunately had a slight leak through our window from rain the second night but the staff couldn't be more helpful and upgraded us to a larger room. Our overall stay was very enjoyable and would definitely recommend. The hotel is close walking distance to the palace & Victoria station. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,08,18
121,Good hotel in central London. Short walk from Victoria & Buckinham Palace,The hotel is very nice. The family room we had was fantastic. Saying that this is not somewhere to entertain children but is a good base from which to do the tourist days. It is a 15 minute walk from Victoria Station and 5 mins from Buckingham Palace. Quite expensive but good value. Didn't eat here as that is too expensive for a family of with young ish children. ,4,2016,08,17
121,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here for three nights with my 12-year old son. We were both very pleased with the hotel. Great location, excellent service, lovely breakfast, nice room. Overall a fantastic hotel. Will definitely stay here again next time I go to London.",5,2016,08,17
121,Beautiful luxurious hotel - wonderful stay,"My daughter & I stayed at this beautiful hotel for 5 nights July 30-August 4, 2016 prior to attending a wedding in Camberley.  It was our first time in London and I was leary of it being only the two of us without my husband who usually traveled with us.  The hotel staff was friendly and welcoming, and kindly accommodated my request for a paid upgrade to a larger room than I originally booked.  There was always a doorman present outside the hotel to greet us upon our return or hail a cab for an adventure.  I always felt safe in or around the hotel.

After much research & comparison prior to our trip, I found our room to be quite spacious by European standards.  Friends of ours also in London for the wedding stayed just around the corner from us at St. Ermins, a Marriott hotel - and I felt our room at St. James Court was far superior to theirs in size, comfort & luxury.  Their bathroom was noticeably smaller compared to ours and didn't feel as if the room was nearly as luxurious as ours.

Our room had ample power outlets, USB outlets, free WI-FI, an iron, a standard hotel hairdryer, bathrobes, an assortment of tea &coffee, bottled water, and a minibar/fridge. The only thing that could have made it better would have been a mini-microwave, which the suites probably did include.

The neighborhood felt safe and was only a couple of blocks (a 5 minute walk) from Buckingham Palace and ample dining & shopping. The underground station was one block away also making getting around convenient.  If we were in a hurry, all we had to do was step out the front door and Mark or one of the others ( bellman/doorman) would simply blow his whistle to hail a famous black taxi for us.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the St. James Court Hotel and most definitely would recommend it to others!",5,2016,08,16
121,ottima ed elegante struttura,Charming Hotel on Central and strategic position even. Nice building and nice rooms even if they have not any view. Cleaning sensation not adeguate expecially on the central places. Inside restaurant service non too much fast and poor level on brekfast,4,2016,08,16
121,Great value in freindly surroundings,"We decided on the Taj for its convenient location - walking distance to a lot of the places we wished to visit. Having stayed at the Taj before, we new the quality of the overall package and as we were visiting London with family, we wanted to make sure that everone would be comfortable and enjoy their stay. The staff were exceptionally helpful and freindly, needless to say, we'll be returning to stay at the Taj again.",5,2016,08,16
121,Weekend Visit,"Second visit to this hotel for a weekend break and we were not disappointed, great location, friendly helpful well presented staff , excellent breakfast sets you up for day of shopping and sight seeing. Room clean and comfortable, definitely stay again if visiting London.",4,2016,08,15
121,Indian Hospitality in UK,"Taj was one hotel I had heard a lot about over the years from friends and family who have always stayed there. 100% we were not let down, hotel location is excellent, Victoria is now a budding locality so one really can't complain. The outdoor courtyard of the hotel and the service was like sitting at a Taj back in India.  Thank you Naveen and team for a wonderful experience.",4,2016,08,15
121,Buisness Trip,"Beautiful hotel minutes, a very warm welcome with very pleasant staff.  The hotel is in a great location, a 10 minute walk to Westminster Abbey, so great location for visiting all the main attractions.  Will differently stay again in the future.",5,2016,08,15
121,Ideally located!,"My husband and I stayed here in 2009, back when it was the Crowne Plaza St. James. It was a very nice hotel with comfortable bed, generously sized bathroom for a European hotel and was perfectly located. Buckingham Palace was only a few minutes walk away. We took a Jack the Ripper tour that ended near Trafalgar Square and it was a comfortable distance to walk back to the hotel. We also did a tour to Stonehenge and the pickup/dropoff location was around the corner from the Palace, so again, ideally located. There were plenty of bars and restaurants located within reasonable walking distance from the hotel. The staff was very helpful with questions we had. The housekeeping staff was superb! My husband and I are very big on living like the locals wherever we travel, so finding local markets was a must. There were plenty of vendors and markets within a couple of blocks from the hotel. My husband purchased a flower for me even though he knew I couldn't take it with us when we left. So I left it on the bed, along with a monetary tip, for the housekeepers to enjoy. A wonderful hotel for our three night stay in London. Even though it has been re-branded, if we return to London, we will consider this hotel again.

Traveled August 2009",4,2016,08,14
121,"2 Night stay, August 2016","Hotel is in an excellent position for sightseeing, about 5 minutes away from Buckingham Palace. It took about 25 minutes to get from Kings Cross to here taking the Tube to Victoria then walking.

Check in was quick and friendly and we were asked if we needed any information about activities and sightseeing.

The room was a King Executive, we had stayed before in a classic room which seemed a bit dated, however this room was more modern, especially the bathroom. TV had Sky Sports and a large range of other international channels.

Breakfast prices were very expensive, luckily there are several cafes near the hotel. We ate in the Kona restaurant, the food was very good however the atmosphere was a bit lacking as there were only a couple of other people dining and there was no music playing.",4,2016,08,12
121,Wonderful Hotel,"My original booking was at the 4 star St.James Taj Hotel. As the Hotel had difficulty to provide connecting rooms (which was necessary for my family of 5 ), the hotel management were so kind by upgrading my family's stay to its 5 star Buckingham Gate No 51 suites & Residences. We were given 2 magnificent connecting suites . We had stayed at 3 "" 5 star "" hotels in Austria and Germany during our trip; but Buckingham Gate No 51 Suites were out of this world.The generousity of the management was extraordinary.Daily fruit platters and mineral water bottles were served .Cleanliness was exceptional and room service and in room dining was superior.The hotel wellness center is of the highest level and 4 restaurants provided so much options to indulge in different cuisines.We particularly enjoyed our afternoon tea at the hotel's Lobby.
Locaton was perfect .
All in all my third time stay at this hotel was my family's best.

121,Great hotel ,"Had a great stay at st James court by taj.
Highlight was the smile on every staff at the hotel, right from breakfast time. 
Breakfast was a good spread and staff was very attentive and great at the service. Special thanks to Joanne for taking such good care of us during our stay",5,2016,08,11
121,"Great location, professional and helpful staff","Hotel is very well located, staff is very professional and helpful. Rooms are very big and clean (its quite unusual to get such a big room for the price we have paid - we stayed in a simple room). walking distance to the most important tourists attractions. great gym!",5,2016,08,11
121,Good Central Hotel,Had a Lovely Stay. No Complaints. With a lot of things to do in the city did not get much to explore within the property. Advice to book the table in advance for the breakfast to avoid queuing in summer months.,4,2016,08,11
121,Very nice hotel,Extravagant is a good adjective. The room was clean and the bed extremely comfy. Very nice personnel and enjoyed my stay thoroughly!  The day spa was very nice the only thing is afternoon tea included was a bit uncomfortable since your hair and body is full of oil. Personally would have preferred the sauna and going to my room to have lunch or tea after cleaning up a bit since it is an elegant afternoon tea. Overall great experience😀,5,2016,08,11
121,Not Taj service at all! ,"Currently staying at the taj st james court in london with a group of 4 families including 8 kids ranging from 2-12yrs old. We chose to stay here since, being an indian hotel chain, we figured the kids' meals will be easier to manage since thats their familiar cuisine and our previous experience with Taj hotels in and outside of India has been impeccable. We knew that st james court taj was run down and in need of redecoration but dint think much of it since we thought we were guaranteed the Taj customer service. 
And how wrong we were!! On arrival to our room, there was an issue with plumbing that welcomed us.. Shudve picked up on that sign. Breakfast was overbooked the first morning and we were allocated a table in one of their dingy meeting rooms devoid of any natural sunlight and extremely claustrophobic. I had to speak with the duty manager and get the table changed. 
Later in the day, tried ordering indian food for the kids without any spice, and i was informed that ""all our food is premade, and so we cant alter the spice level. Sorry. "". Generally establishments pride themselves on providing fresh food but not this one! Then i called the kitchen directly and spoke to chef amarjeet who (seemed to be in a hurry and promised to call back but dint) took my request for the kids' meals for the following day to be delivered at 1245, and 615pm. I get a delivery at 615am instead!! The whole family got an unwanted wake up call with a request to open the door to accept our dinner 12 hours beforehand! Lunch was on time and excellent, dinner was spicy and had to be sent back while we had to scramble to close by restaurants to feed the younger bunch. Such a shame for all that effort!
Next, called housekeeping informing them to only have still water placed in the room and these were replaced promptly that day. The next 3 days no water was given, 4th day sparkling and still were placed again and so another reminder given. 
This morning at 8am was awakened by constant chatting of some girls loud enough for me to hear their conversation once i had come to my senses. Turns out they were from housekeeping in the adjoining room and again started another saga of phonecalls to sunaina the morning duty manager who dealt with it promptly. Been here 4 days with 3 more to go and in constant touch with patricia the evening duty manager for one reason or another. Shes been helpful but its annoying that i need to keep asking for her ! Our room keys stop working on regular basis despite making an effort to keep them away from mobile phones. 
This is supposed to be a holiday! Certainly doesnt feel like it the moment we enter the hotel at the end of every day. Wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone.. Stay somewhr else especially for the price point. ",2,2016,08,10
121,"If it gets much better than this, going home won't be an option...","Well, this isn’t the review I thought I’d be writing… 

When setting out for my stay at St. James’ Court, I made sure to pack my vitriolic pen, my caustic intolerance for everything sub-perfect and my power hungry stomach for a fight…

Sadly, try as I might to wield such tools of the reviewer’s trade, the hotel out-smarted me. They only went ahead and gave me the last thing the internet gun-slinger wants to write about: an incredible holidaying experience!

The hotel itself, by no mere coincidence one guesses by its intimate proximity to Buckingham Palace, is a majesty of opulence, sophistication and that indefinable quality that makes class so hard to mimic. 

The foyer is a welcoming visual delight. The staff, friendly and attentive - but effortlessly so that speaks of genuine consideration and respect.

The room was perfectly appointed – enough furniture to cater for one’s every need, but not so much as to make it feel cluttered or controlling.

Everything worked, and everything felt to be in its proper place. Attention to detail was clearly high on the agenda – but certainly not pedantically so. For example, the hair dryer was of a chrome bespoke design that simply conveyed efficiency and elegance in equal measure. Thus, unlike many other hotels I’ve stayed in which opt for a cheap generic brand – or god forbid, those wall mounted noise generators that have the breathing power of an asthmatic grass snake, when I regarded myself in the mirror as I proceeded to dry my locks, staring back at me was a picture of unexpected stylish refinement that made me feel just that tad more special than before I had embarked upon this mundane of endeavours… 

Surely, that’s what staying & paying to be in a top hotel is all about…

Even more importantly, and with an impact that lasted the whole day long, I personally found the mattress to be the best I have had the pleasure of sleeping upon in all my sojourns in London. For the first time ever, when away from my own ol’faithful, I awoke feeling refreshed and without a trace of stiffness or lower-back spasm. At some point, once I’ve returned a number of times just to make sure this wasn’t a fluke, I’m probably going to have to get the bed manufacturer’s details…

I was on the sixth floor, and neither heard nor saw the many behind-the-scene workers that undoubtedly kept the place and the rooms looking a picture of attentive care.

The breakfasts were in keeping with all else – as near to perfect as one wants without making the rest of life seem like a forthcoming anticlimax.

Taking afternoon tea in the cocooned splendor of the central courtyard was a bonus that once enjoyed quickly became an indulged necessity…  

So, unless I just got very lucky, I would certainly highly recommend this hotel.
I will probably return again in 2 weeks. If my first impressions aren’t seriously compromised, it’ll take pride of place as my preferred stopping-off point whenever I’m London-bound…

Thank you all at St. J’s.",5,2016,08,09
121,Wonderful Hotel,"I made our reservation almost a year ago and was apprehensive when I saw some new reviews that were quite critical. The hotel is located in a very convenient location close to Victoria Station, the Thames and of course Buckingham Palace, Westminster, and Big Ben. The service was outstanding and we found the housekeeping to be excellent. Booked a Classic King room and it was comfortable for two people. Compared to other hotels in London, the price was very fair. The courtyard was so pretty and very relaxing to sit in. 

The management is excellent and professional. One evening the couple next door were fighting at 11:00 at night. Called the front desk and within minutes, security came up and handled the situation. The evening manager, Johanne called up with sincere apologies and comped our breakfast the next morning. This is good business! Spoke with Ms. Soares the next morning and she was thrilled that I was so complimentary about our stay.

Reviews are always good to explore, but sometimes you need to read between the lines to ascertain how valid the negative comments are. The next time we have a stopover in London, I would certainly stay at the St. James Court! Highly recommend!!",5,2016,08,08
121,Nice relaxing and in the city center,Was a very nice stay in that hotel. A brilliant indian restaurant nearby. Room was quite and we slept very good. The position is perfect to explore the city and come back for a little break. Will come back.,5,2016,08,07
121,Excellent Hotel,We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel. Everything was amazing from the moment we stepped in. The hotel staff was very pleasant and very helpful. Check in was very easy and the rooms were very clean and accomadating. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgable. They helped us plan our day and best way to get around in London. The location was also ideal as all the major sites were walking distance.,5,2016,08,06
121,Excellent hotel with high standards ,"This is an excellent quality hotel with a really professional and service oriented team. The rooms are of a very high standard indeed and the food in the Bank restaurant was very good. I made the mistake of leaving my iPhone charger in the room and within hours of checking out, I had an email saying it would be sent on to me at no charge. It's the little details that always make the difference. Thoroughly recommend. ",5,2016,08,05
121,"Very good hotel, beyond expectation","IThe two night stay was a birthday present to my husband. We Had a very good experience staying in this Taj Hotel. The service is super. All staff appear to be very enthusiastic. The around the world meal gave a delightful experience, the champagne flight was particularly enjyable. We'll definite return and recommend the hotel to others.",4,2016,08,04
121,Amazing Alice in Wonderland Afternoon Tea,The table was set to match the theme and the staff provided a warm welcome. There was a good choice of teas as well as a drinks menu. The food was all really good. The scones were excellent and a perfect size. The sweets/treats were in a variety of interesting flavours with some superb chocolatier skills. ,5,2016,08,04
121,Poor stay,"When we arrived to the hotel the front desk told us they would be giving us an upgrade.  When we arrived in our room it was very poorly laid out making it difficult to move around and store your luggage.  Our room and the room across the hall were oddly separated from the other rooms by a locked door.  As if they used our room as a small add on for a large family.  The shower went outside the curtain one morning, when I wiped the floor using a clean towel, the towel was completely black.  The power outlet made a weird buzzing noise causing the hairdryer to function improperly.  When I expressed my concerns to the front desk, the employee told me that we were never upgraded and ""you were already pre-paid."" AKA, there was nothing he could do...   After reading the reviews of the hotel I was very much looking forward to our stay, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the hotel.",2,2016,08,03
121,Good Location & Friendly Hotel,"This is a god standard hotel well situated a stones throw from Buckingham Palace, Westminster and a mile form the West End. The rooms are generally on the London small side, however they are normally well appointed. The staff are very professional and the service is of a high standard.",4,2016,08,03
121,Very impressive ...,"Couldn't do enough for you. Good room, good location, breakfast was good. We had our one year old son with us and they were very accommodating!! Definitely where I will look to stay next time I'm in London.",5,2016,08,02
121,Very very nice hotel,"We had a lovely overnight stay here. 
Staff were very helpful from concierge to cleaners. Hotel is immaculate. Bed linen of excellent quality,lovely starchy heavy Cotton sheets etcn . Big thick lovely towels. Room was modern and classy. We had an executive room overlooking the court yard. 
The hotel was thoroughly clean throughout.
Breakfast was self service and cooked well with  good quality sausages. There was the usual continental,cereals  and fruit  also. The hotel has an indian influence. Nice little bar area and outside court yard to sit.  Appreciated seeing the doorman in top hat and tails. Nice touch.
Hotel close to Buckingham palace, the mall, Victoria , st james park. 10 - 15 walk to Piccadilly.  This hotel is in a quieter area slightly away from the hustle and bustle of the night life but close enough to walk to it all.
Only down side if I had to  make one would be the air con didn't seem to be overly powerful and the breakfast room a bit cramped. But would certainly stay there again.",5,2016,08,02
121,Wow factor and location,"St James Court has an impressive entrance on a quiet road near Buckingham Palace. The foyer area definitely has ""wow"" factor. Check-in and concierge were both extremely professional and welcoming. Our ""classic"" room was very comfortable and well equipped, the bed linen was top quality and the bathroom was light and spacious. The room was at the back of the hotel on the top floor and was very quiet. The passageways to our room were a bit long and tortuous, although, unlike other reviewers, we found the corridors immaculately clean and well maintained. The courtyard garden is a delightful oasis for a drink. We ate at the hotel's Bistro 51 restaurant and found it offered a wide menu, our meals were delicious. All in all a great stay and good value.",5,2016,08,02
121,Good hotel with service to be improved,"Nice room, excellent bed and pillows. The service at the bar can be improved as well as the updating of the fridge. The location was perfect to go anyplace within London Area 1. Unfortunately it has not got many dining facilities around.",4,2016,08,02
121,Long wait for a room,"Our arrival experience marred what was an otherwise nice stay.    Upon arrival at about 4pm there were two clerks working the front desk; both with other guests.  We were next to be served and waited in line for more than 20 minutes before one of them was able to serve us.  By that time, there were 5 other guests queued up to check-in. Once we were being served, 2 more desk clerks showed up for a total of 4--much to relief of the other guests I'm sure.  Because our room was not ready, we were asked to wait for another 20 minutes & offered complimentary coffee.  Total check-in time from arrival to room, 60+ minutes.  Once we finally got to our room we waited nearly another hour for our luggage to be delivered.  I called the front desks to ask what was going on & was told they were very busy & that our luggage would be sent soon.  As I was about to call again, the bell hop delivered our luggage--fortunately because we had a dinner reservation for 6:30pm.   The bell hop gave us a nice orientation to the room which was by that time unnecessary because we had discovered most everything while wait for our luggage.   Finally, I was never able to directly contact the concierge--I had to leave a message with the front desk.  On our check-out day, 1 Aug, I called to get information regarding access to the hotel given all the road closures for the bicycle race.  The concierge was not all that helpful and seemed to be unaware whether our taxi would be able to get there.  Another guest who was waiting in the check-in queue with us, told me that service in British hotels was generally insouciant .  This experience would underscore that opinion.  My observation was that the lobby was understaffed during our check-in time--something that could have been remedied if the manager on duty was paying attention.   I'm certain that the manager was aware of this situation because our desk clerk had to consult with him/her during our check-in process.  This is a nice hotel in a great location that harkens to a time gone by.  Our room was comfortable, spacious, & well appointed.  It is what I'd expect from a fine London hotel.  It would have been nice if the service matched that expectation.",3,2016,08,02
121,"Great London hotel, fine location!","Quiet, comfortable!  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  This was a great location and greater value.  My wife and I are ""walker"" and we were able to get to most places that we wanted to see just by hoofing it.  (Except for the ""West End."")   We recommend this to most travelers.",5,2016,08,02
121,Unmodernised floors to be avoided,"Sixth floor in particular rather poor. The room was old and cramped. Unmodernised in decades. Communal areas also dark, stuffy and not completely clean.  The ground floor and reception areas are nice, clearly this is where the effort has been prioritised.",2,2016,08,02
121,Great location for a special weekend.,"This was a great choice for a 40th birthday weekend away.  Room was decorated with rose petals, cake and chocolates whilst we were out.  Staff were friendly and very helpful.  Plenty of areas to relax, eat and drink.  We particularly enjoyed the intimate courtyard with fountain.",5,2016,08,02
121,Very little to like,"We arrived at this hotel expecting a 5* experience. It started going down hill as soon as we checked in. I had booked through booking.com and booked two rooms,that part was easy. On checking in with a lady called Patricia,  it took a long time. We had booked two rooms and took the receptionist over 10 minutes to look for two rooms together. Surely this should have been sorted before we arrived. Patricia then proceeded to take telephone calls whilst I was stood in front of her. There were two other people free behind that desk that could have took the calls.

After taking full payment and a pre authorisation of £50per room, I double checked I was paying for the room in full there and then. Patricia again explained I was paying the full amount and the pre authorisation for £50 per room for extras. Finally made it to the room and it was lovely. After a long day at the palace we headed back to eat and drink at the hotel as we were so tired.

The staff on the sun terrace were friendly but kept forgetting things we ordered. We had 3 or 4 different members serving us. We were served drink we ordered twice, drinks we ordered never arrived. Food was very nice even though we asked for things plain they did not arrive the way we wanted them. When I asked for the discretionary service charge to be removed as I was not paying 12.5% for service I was unhappy with.(I did leave a tip, just not 12.5% ) the look I got from what looked like a senior member of staff. My children noticed it and told me.

We did have a nice sleep and the beds were very comfortable. On checking out I was told that the hotel had not been paid and had only been pre authorised. My husband was checking our bags in with the  concierge so we could sight see, my husband could see I was not happy at reception. He rushed over to see what was wrong. After several discussions I had no choice but to pay again. I was so angry!!!!!

On returning to the hotel later to collect our bags it seemed to take a very long time to be seen and get our bags. On getting home to Cheshire we realised they had not given us one of our bags. On checking the bags in a carrier bag had been tied to another bag. It must have come off when our bags were deposited by the concierge. So we have a bag in the hotel and we are in Lancashire. 

I would not describe this hotel as 5* at all. For it to be a 5* all aspects need to work together. The staff make the hotel and you failed on all levels this time. I will stay at a Cheval residences next time, you are tested like royalty no matter how much your spending.  Or you could nip round the corner to Rubens.",1,2016,08,02
121,Weekend in Cental London,"This is an excellent hotel and extremely well situated for all central events. 5-10 minute walk from Westminster. Staff very good, food excellent, would definitely recommend. Many bars and restaurants available within walking distance, however if you just want to chill in the hotel there is a Michelin star restaurant here as well as the Bistro which are both excellent. Cocktail for a fiver also in the hotel between 5 and 7. Great value.",4,2016,08,02
121,First Class hotel in a great location. Fabulous customer service,"From the moment Rukmim checked us in the service was superb.
The hotel is in a great location for accessing city sights, shops and restaurants.
The rooms are beautifully appointed with great bathrooms and toiletries.
I would definitely stay their again.",5,2016,08,01
121,Taj levels of service in elegant surroundings.,"There are a few issues. We booked  the same kind of rooms for 2 trips in the same month. The rooms we got on our first trip were probably 30 pct bigger than the rooms we got on the next . However the excellent service, the beautiful St James Courtyard where you can have a drink or a snack and the quality of food make up for any shortcomings . The hotel is located at a 3 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace so is very hand for all the Central London tourist hotspots . ",5,2016,08,01
121,Great Location and Lovely Setting,"We really enjoyed our stay here, The staff were polite, the service was good, and the rooms very comfortable. We were fortunate enough that the weather was good in the evening, so after spending many hours visiting everything London has to offer, it was a real treat to come back and find the small quiet garden/terrace with outside seating, ideal to sit and enjoy a few glasses of wine. The beds were very comfortable and the in room offering's were ample, with dressing gowns and slippers, and a good range in the mini bar. It was a great stay, only one small not of caution, could have just been our room, but there was quite a smell coming from the drains in the bathroom, which was quite off putting. overall very good",4,2016,08,01
121,fabulous,"Very friendly, welcoming, homely, brilliant location and would definitely return. It would be difficult to find another hotel lije this one. Within walking distance to a number sights, transport hubs. Staff were very accommodating and went the extra mile.",5,2016,07,31
121,Pleasant hotel,"Hotel was clean and staff very helpful. Breakfast was very good the lounge area was a nice place to relax in the evening with the piano player. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, War Museum, etc. Several nice pubs in the area. Only drawback was the schoolyard in the back of the hotel made it very noisy in the morning as the windows were all single pane glass.",4,2016,07,31
121,Five star luxury,Fantastic Taj luxury in the central London. Had a great stay and service was outstanding. Enjoyed my stay and i would definitely return here during my next trip to London. Buckingham palace was just 2 minutes walk from this hotel and it was very Convenient to many nearby attraction.,5,2016,07,31
121,FOURTH TIME TO STAY HERE,"The hotel is excellent, staff always smiling and helpful.  The hotel is spotless..  Buffet breakfast excellent everything you want and also you can order if there is anything you want that is not on show eg pancakes,   Even my 10 year old grandaughter loved it there.",5,2016,07,31
121,Excellent location!,"My daughter and I stayed here for 1 night while we were transiting through London. The hotel has a really cute and beautiful courtyard. The best rooms are the ones that face the courtyard. It is a 5 min walk down to the Buckingham Palace front gate and entrance C. We enjoyed the convenient location. Breakfast buffet was quite good. The food quality was much better than the food provided at other Taj properties. We have stayed extensively at various Taj properties around India. We heard rave reviews about Quilon but were a little disappointed that we couldn't squeeze it into our busy schedule. Overall, this is a great property, convenient location - definitely recommend.",5,2016,07,30
121,Rooms now improved,"Very convenient for major attractions,Buckingham Palace etc.Rooms are small but have been updated.Other reviews said about noise from the underground and traffic so we asked for a room as high as possible and had no problems.Staff helpful, I felt breakfast was reasonable but my wife was not impressed.Court yard to rear very pleasant .We would visit again.",4,2016,07,30
121,Amazing hotel,"One night was enough for me to appreciate this hotel. Hospitality, food, ambience, services - everything was just awesome. Located in Central London, this hotel is just 5 mins walk from the Buckingham palace.",4,2016,07,30
121,excellent hotel specially for indians,"we were very happy to be in this hotel for a week- we felt at home - with indian food, indian tv programs etc- this hotel is located smack in the middle of all things very interesting --- most of the hotel guests were europeans and they too seemed very happy with the hotel... a top class hotel ...",4,2016,07,29
121,Amazing hotel! Best location! Exclusive!,I stayed n nights at this magnificent hotel located 3 min. walk from the Buckinngham Palace and 3-4 min. from St. James underground. Location is perfect. Hotel looks luxirious. rooms are spacious and clean. Breakfast buffet is just great. Staff is very friendly and supportive. I highly recommend this hotel! Best value for money!,5,2016,07,29
121,Buckingham palace outside Buckingham palace,"Barring a couple of glitches enjoyable stay with good food, courteous staff & spot on concierge services. IF one wants to enjoy a stay in London the best location to be in. great bars and pubs all around with the Queen residing hardly a mile away. What more can one ask for.",4,2016,07,29
121,4 night stay with family at St. james court Hotel,"Excellent.  We styed for 4 nights and 5 days at the Hotel. We are a family of 5 and had a good experience. The hotel has an excellent location and ambience, very good service and very nice rooms. We had two rooms and all was good. Being close to many attractions and parks made our daily walks good and easy. Weather was also good daily except one day and we had a good time here.",4,2016,07,28
121,a really superb Alice in Wonderland afternoon tea,"I booked this several months ago as a surprise 16th birthday celebration for my daughter, we had previously visited the Alice in wonderland tea at the Sanderson a few years ago but I found the setting and quality far superior and more relaxing than the Sanderson.  We were a little late arriving as the bus we were waiting for did not turn up we in the end got two taxis as there were 11 of us at £7 per taxi from Victoria which was worth it to get there.  The staff were not worried that we were late we had a large rectangular table with lovely comfortable chairs and the very handy toilets just through the doors next to us there was also a lovely lounge adjacent that a few of us also relaxed in.  The table was decorated with Alice in Wonderland props and there was also a themed menu, 3 types of scones with copious amounts of thick cream and jam, 4 types of sandwiches a selection of hot drinks that were re fillable and a special round victoria sponge from the chef we had about 8 to share between us as well as the lovely selection of pastries.  There was a white chocolate cylinder with a watermelon jelly, a white chocolate mousse in a chocolate moulded tea cup, a mini pastry tart with a marzipan crown, a bubble gum macaroon, some drink me smoothies, a raspberry marshmallow toad stool, we were well looked after and not rushed and as a surprise to my daughter at the end of our tea they bought out a chocolate cake with a candle and sung happy birthday which made it really special.",5,2016,07,28
121,"Excellent Hospitality, Courteous approach","Stayed for 2 nights, Check-in took no time, requested for early check-in, done within no time, so delighted at first instance, carried through complete stay. 

Breakfast was awesome, being a Vegetarian, got to eat whatever needed to start a good day. 

Hotel is in Central London next to Bankingham Palace, whether it's a business trip or Leisure, it's located right on spot, St. James Park station is at 5 minute walk. 

the only point of concern is unpleasant kitchen preparation smell at lobby of rooms 301 to 309, guess it may be on all floor for these series of rooms

Overall more than satisfied",5,2016,07,28
121,Great location,"very good hotel for the price,and great location. walking distance to Buckingham , Westminster, and Big Ben.  Plenty of places to eat near by. Staff was very helpfull, check in and out was a breeze.  would stay there again",5,2016,07,27
121,Truly amaxing and worth another stay,"Hi, thank you for a manificent hotel.

The decor is truly breathtaking especially the atrium high ceilings. We had an amazing stay. 

Thank you
Also thank you for returning my iphone charger. :)

The rooms are value for money and the bed is comfortable.

Pillows are also medium soft and the room was stocked well with a full mini fridge.

The bathroom is lovely and has amble space.
We also enjoyed the location as its just walking distance to so many attractions.",5,2016,07,26
121,Another Lovely Stay,I choose to stay at St James Court for the third time on Saturday 23rd July for a theatre break. It is such a lovely hotel I would not bother looking elsewhere when visiting London. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating and the value for money for such a high quality hotel is excellent. The room we had was really comfortable and the room service was excellent.,5,2016,07,25
121,Great Hotel in Great Location!,Experienced a very pleasant stay for a one week leisure trip.  Hotel was extremely clean and quiet. Very modern and excellent service.  Stayed in an executive double which offered plenty of space (by European standards!) and was within close walking distance of many major sights.,5,2016,07,25
121,Great stay,Excellent location and fantastic staff. Will definitely stay again in this hotel and hopefully in others in the group. From check-in to departure the staff were friendly and courteous. The hotel well-appointed and very quiet. One of the best nights of sleep I had in a long time.,5,2016,07,25
121,Best place for Indians,"Iconic Taj group property is most popular among Indians.Food has lot of Indian touch.Ambiance in lobby and coffee shop are excellent.the open space in midst of buildings adds to its excellent ambiance.A well stocked bar with color combination provides a nice place to spend evening with friends.Bombay  velvet is top class Indian restaurants. Staff very cordial and cooperative.Room are small but then ur in Europe. Very conveniently located in central London with Buckingham palace and Hyde Park Lane,",5,2016,07,25
121,Splendid Afternoon tea! Would recommend ,"I went for afternoon tea her for my sisters birthday. It was nice because they gave us a big table with no one else sitting close by so it felt like we could breathe and speak unlike usual afternoon tea places in London. 

Food was all good portions and filling. Good tea selection including Indian, Green tea, black tea and English. The only down side you can only stick to one sort of tea otherwise have to pay extra if you want to change. 

Price wise was very reasonable and would recommend this for anyone in the area, special occasion or just if you want to get away from the busy city life. 

Staff extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel set up is nice because it's away from the main roads and you have to go through their court yard and into another building for the afternoon tea.

Overall I would strongly recommend and I am sure I will be going again in the next couple months.",4,2016,07,24
121,Excellent location,This hotel is in an excellent location. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace and other amenities. The staff is fantastic. A little pricey but it's worth every penny. Walked to everywhere. Room was very comfortable.,5,2016,07,23
121,Ideal location but expensive,You cannot fault the location or your treatment by the staff - you are certainly well-looked after but it is a tad pricey. My room was clean but a bit old-fashioned and the window looked onto a wall which was disappointing. Fortunately you only tend to sleep in your room. Air-con was efficient,4,2016,07,23
121,Memorable Stay,The upgraded and recently completed 6th floor junior suite is very good value . Worth the stay . Excellent concierge/location and very helpful staff. Everything was perfect.Old world charm makes this a perfect summer getaway in London.,4,2016,07,23
121,Special Hotel in the Heart of London,"This property is well managed as evidenced by the outstanding staff and well maintained facility. The staff goes out of their way to satisfy your needs and desires. Even though this hotel is large it feels more like a family run business. The hotel is qwell situated for several parks, Buckingham Palace and even the theaters.",5,2016,07,22
121,Wedding Night,Nothing much I can say but considering it was four Wedding Night we were left wanting and not the welcome we were expecting. Very disappointing ! A a bit of desert left in the room for goodness knows how long didn't cut it for what the room cost totally unimpressed to say the least.,3,2016,07,22
121,Anniversary Stay,"My husband and I stayed here for our one year anniversary trip to London. We loved the hotel, and you could not beat the location. We were within walking distance to many attractions, and others were just a short ride on the tube. It was very quiet, and the staff were all excellent. They also had a wonderful afternoon tea. I would definitely recommend! ",5,2016,07,22
121,5 star luxury!,"I visited this hotel for a bit of luxury and a pamper. It was everything I expected and more.

Enjoyed a lovely stay here. Staff are wonderful, cocktails great and the breakfast tasty. 

Great location and would definitely stay again.

No complaints from me!",4,2016,07,20
121,Taj comes up Trumps,Another comfortable stay at the Taj St James where the comfort of the guest is of the utmost importance.  The staff go oit of their way to ensure that your needs are dealt with.  Very comfortable rooms and excellent beds.,5,2016,07,20
121,A Gem of a Hotel by Buckingham Palace,"From the time we arrived at the hotel we were made feel special every member of staff whom we encountered were friendly and very helpful. The location is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of Westminster/Thames and the Parks.  The hotel has lots of character and our room had lots of windows and interesting features, not your usual square box with a bed. We also had views onto the courtyard garden below. If you are looking for a little haven whilst visiting London we would recommend the St James Court Taj Hotel.",5,2016,07,19
121,London Visit,"This was our third trip to London in the last 2 years. By far this was the best hotel we have stayed in. Very convenient, staff extremely courteous and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely make this our first choice for our next visit.",5,2016,07,19
121,St James' Court deserves its 5 stars,"We booked here for a romantic weekend away from the children for an anniversary. We were late arriving and had to check in quickly so I could get changed to rush out to dinner. Check in was swift and polite and off we went to our room, which was lovely. We'd been kindly upgraded to a junior suite - small sitting room, decent sized bedroom and very well appointed bathroom. 
We rushed back downstairs through the lobby, where all the very well presented staff greeted us. I was stopped from trying to hail a taxi out the front by a little man who leapt into the road to do it for me! 
We had a very good first impression of the hotel, which is pretty ""swanky"".
I won't go on about our whole weekend so will break it down:

Rooms - very well appointed. Everything you could wish for, including a Nespresso type coffee machine which made my husband very happy. Extremely clean. The bathroom was great - I loved the sink and the magnifying light up mirror! But, the towel rail was difficult to use being that it was raised up on the wall and the top of it about 7 ft in the air - I gave up trying to fling my towel up on to it! The bed was huge and very comfortable too.
 
Staff - very smart, and very polite. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them.
 
Courtyard - beautiful. We spent a fair bit of time sat out there in the day and night admiring the buidlings. the outdoor bar was a lovely touch. What was a sign of an excellent hotel as well was the seamless moving from outdoors to indoors and not having to sign anything - they knew who we were. 

Food - we only really had breakfast here, was was good as far as international buffet breakfast go. The variety of food was fantastic - fruit, yoghurts, pastries, cheese, bread, sausages, Indian dish of the day and more. The only comment I have (and I think I upset a waiter) was that I asked for a cheese omelette one morning. I waited a little while to give them a chance to cook it before I went off for my sausage, mushrooms etc. But, I'd eaten all of that before the omelette arrived (so would have liked some kind of idea of timing). It was an interesting omelette, which is how I described it to the waiter when he asked how it was - it tasted like mozzarella, and therefore had the constituency of rubber. I was assured it was cheddar (just not the cheddar I know!). I finally worked out that they'd made the omelette with an emmenthal slice, which was what is on the buffet. Odd. We didn't eat in the bar, apart from a little snack on Saturday afternoon. I had Paneer Tikka with mint sauce. I can actually say i think this is one of the tastiest dishes I have ever eaten! My husband's stuffed jalapenos also excellent. 

Bar - excellent service and great variety of not too ridiculously priced drinks. I was recommended to try ""Half Hitch"" gin by the barman, which I did and was very happy with. 

I loved the express checkout envelope idea - saves actually going to the desk - just check the bill enclosed and if you agree with it, sign it and pop it in a box. 

Well done Taj, I find almost nothing to fault with St James Court. But get some proper cheddar and try and remember us shorties when designing the bathrooms! I do hope we can return - it's perfectly situated for walking into central london through St James' Park.",5,2016,07,19
121,Real quality hotel in great central location,"3 minutes from Buckingham Palace, but pleasantly serene location. Excellent facilities in the room. Everything in the hotel looked exceptionally stylish and fresh. Lovely quality bedding and bathrobes. Very helpful and professional staff. Looking forward to visiting again.",5,2016,07,19
121,Ideal hideaway in central London,"Excellent service in a lovely environment. Good selection of restaurants including a beautiful courtyard. The rooms are spacious, well presented and quiet. Location is perfect, within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster and the theatre district.",5,2016,07,18
121,Great Location and Find,"We recently stayed here for a night in London and was wonderfully centrally located. The concierge and reception staff were polite and helpful. The courtyard is a showpiece of the hotel and the hotel is a vast building. Our room on the 7th floor was adequate with nice facilities but in a slightly more dilapidated area of the hotel which needed more updating. 
The room was as one would expect with a five star hotel, however the shower was a little sub-optimal. 

We can't comment on food as didn't eat within the restaurants but would definitely return and sample this aspect on another occasion.",4,2016,07,18
121,Great location...,"Lovely hotel. Great location. Staff very positive and helpful. Nice room (second attempt). B&B basis. Breakfast generally good but spoiled by inability to cook eggs to order, lukewarm coffee at times, chewy toast, understand coeliac requirements. Would we stay there again...  not sure.",3,2016,07,18
121,Wonderful experience,"This historic hotel is very conveniently located and within walking distance to all the main attractions in London such as Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament,Westminster Abbey, and the London Eye. 
We enjoyed excellent service and hospitality while residing in the Kings Tower. We would like to mention the following people who were most helpful: Benson and Rachel at the front desk, and the concierge team including Jon, Alex, Remon, Kalman and Nelson.

 Other services including bellman, housekeeping, and in room dining were stellar. Our suite was luxurious yet with practical touches such as an in suite washer and dryer.
We also enjoyed excellent food at Quilon, their flagship and Michelin starred restaurant.",5,2016,07,17
121,Would stay again!!!,Just got back from our first trip to London.  This hotel was excellent.  The staff was very attentive and the hotel was very clean and well kept.  The location was ideal.  Buckingham Palace is 3 blocks away and the Westminster tube stop about a 10 minute walk.  We booked the tea and it was amazing.,5,2016,07,17
121,Another fabulous stay,I recommend the Taj for its first class service with a fantastic team. Luxury and location that's value for money too. The restaurants offer a great range and the vibrant atmosphere is a pleasure to experience.,5,2016,07,17
121,Great location,We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. The location is perfect!!! It is less than 5 minute walk from the Buckingham palace and St. James's park. We were able to walk to many of London's landmark locations within 1/2 hr. The rooms were clean and the staff courteous. The concierge was very helpful (both the gentleman who worked during the day and the one who worked at nights). They went out of their way to help us and answer our questions. ,5,2016,07,17
121,Stay at St James Court,Excellent hotel in a very convenient location in Central London and in walking distance from most of the main attractions. The hotel is very clean and the service excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay here.,5,2016,07,15
121,Great location and good amenities,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the end of June 2016, before flying out of Heathrow.

Booked a standard double room, it was a good size but not a lot of space - which is to be expected for this level of room.  But there was enough floor space to open two medium suitcase and walk around them.

Built in wardrobe, with kettle and ironing board with iron - which is very unusual.  Average sized bathroom with good toiletries.  The room was fairly quite but could hear other guests banging about in the corridor at night (some people have no consideration for other guests). 

The room was in the other building across the courtyard where the wellness centre is located, which felt a bit awkward having to walk through the courtyard restaurant where a large screen TV was setup for the sport (Tennis and Football).

The doorman was always helpful and asked if you wanted a taxi (they were parked just up the road), which he signalled for if required.

The best thing about this hotel is the amenities, the bar area was fantastic, we didn't eat in either restaurant but the food smelt good in the evenings, the staff were very helpful.  It also is very close to a tube station and tourist hot-spots.

Would definitely stay here again but for more days so i can have a chance to use the amenities more and try the main restaurant.",4,2016,07,15
121,Hotel Manager invited me back and still a lot to get right!,"This hotel is great location wise and its apartments next door are exceptional...however...the hotel...

Checked in and dumped my bag to head over to meet colleagues at another restaurant.

When I returned later that night I walked into what looked like a spacious sitting room with bedroom off that and then a tiny bathroom.

As it was late I just climbed into bed, only to be woken in 30 mins with the guest next door plugging and unplugging appliances! The wall was wafer thin! 

In the morning I noticed that the sink had what looks like thick mastic applied by an amateur plumber, the sink was dirty and as for the tap...it was once chromed shiny, now it was just covered in water marks and dull!!! The bath had rust marks in it and as for the wardrobe there was live electrical wires hanging down with insulation tape wrapped over them!!! The coffee table had a Hughes sticky stain on the glass!!!Just look at the pics I took in disbelief!

Breakfast...they didn't even know what eggs royalle where! 

When I checked out and mentioned the above all I got was 'house keeping will have a look'!",1,2016,07,14
121,Location!,"It's right in the middle of London, with the tube and bus stops close by. And yes, the Buckingham Palace is just down the road. The WiFi, though was not up to the mark. Maybe it is just me, but the breakfast was average, especially on Day 1 when we tried something from the Indian section. Turned out to be dry and not exactly delicious. I was busy comparing this to the Taj properties in India, so maybe it's me.",4,2016,07,13
121,"Honest prise, good location, nice garden","Its a perfect hotel to stay for few days with determine budget. Very good location, cosy garden and the restaurant. Don't aspect good few, all the passages are very tiny, boring rooms, very old air-conditioners, strange smell in spa. Very dirty and old air conditioner in spa.",3,2016,07,13
121,What you would expect,"Great facelift to the hotel rooms in the last 18 months. Rooms are super modern and have even things like usb plugs in walls. True that for the price this is what one expects... But it is not the rule, more the chance. Here you will be sure. If you are lucky with the weather... The courtyard is a great place to have a drink with freinds and relax. Enjoy!",5,2016,07,12
121,very good hotel,we stayed here for a few days for a birthday we stayed here before lovely hotel staff lovely the staff in the courtyard was lovely.  The only bad bit was the hallways to the rooms needs decorating also new carpets other than that good,5,2016,07,12
121,London Visit for Wimbledon,"My wife and I stayed at the Taj, St. James while we were attending the tennis matches at Wimbledon. I learned about the hotel from Bookings.com, but later booked directly on the hotel's website.  The overall value for the room was very good. Facilities and restaurant choices were excellent as was the location, one short block from the Underground.",4,2016,07,11
121,2 small beds for the price of a king size,"Poor bedding for a couple. We paid extra for a king size bed but got twin beds join by a cover zip instead.  We also paid extra for breakfast included, but  waited 45 mins for poached eggs... better to have breakfast outside the hotel.",3,2016,07,11
121,Overnight Stay,"Made to feel very welcome after a long day traveling. My room was well equipped, with a very comfortable bed enabling me to get a great night's sleep. Hotel provides an extensive menu, much of which may be ordered via room service",5,2016,07,11
121,Good but noisy,"Good hotel but after requesting a quiet room I was given a room over looking a school playground and at 8 am the noise was unbearable. The hotel was not full and I did ask for a quiet room , when the staff take no notice of requests then you do not want to visit again.",3,2016,07,11
121,Wonderful Hotel,"This was our 3rd stay at this Hotel and yet again I couldn't fault it.  The attention to detail is wonderful and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  You really feel like royalty when you stay here. The location of the hotel is also wonderful, right near Buckingham Palace & Big Ben etc...however sitting outside in the Hotel courtyard you feel a million miles away from hustle & bustle.",5,2016,07,10
121,Anniversary treat,"We stopped here for our 12th wedding anniversary. We were going to the theatre. 
We found this hotel fantastic we loved it. 
The staff were very helpful and polite. The bedroom was lovely although the decorating does needs updating. Very spacious. Hampers and drinks in The room although you are charged if you use them. 
The hotel was just around the corner from Buckingham palace. 
When we came back from our night out we had a lovely surprise left for us a chocolate cake with Happy anniversary. 
We would definitely come here again. Thank you for making our anniversary a special one. 
",5,2016,07,10
121,Quite and central ,"We had the pleasure of staying here two nights. The staff can not do enough for you.  The breakfast was great as much as you needed and more.
We were made to feel like royalty and felt relaxed all the time we were there.
Thanks to the breakfast staff who went the extra mile to ensure we left content.

We would seriously look at a revisit in the future for another anniversary.

Thank you",5,2016,07,10
121,Location is good,"i stayed there in 2014. The staff helped me for directions, places to go and how, they were really friendly. The location is really good! Nearby most of the important attractions. The hotel room was clean and nice, it was a good experience after all.",4,2016,07,10
121,Wonderful relaxing stay,"We booked this hotel for our Wedding Anniversary.  The hotel staff are very pleasant, polite & helpful.  The room we had was the classic double very clean ample size,  the bed comfortable.  The hotel was quiet so had a great nights sleep.    Breakfast is amazing.",5,2016,07,10
121,A good base for your stay in London,"I regularly stay at the Taj. The service is very professional, the rooms and hotel generally are clean and well maintaned and the public areas of the hotel have a nice atmosphere. All this in a good location.",4,2016,07,09
121,More like a 3* hotel,"Would not recommend - breakfast was very much below par. Felt as if we were in a school canteen with noise, dirty crockery and poor service. Food was greasy and very average. My husband had to send his beverage back twice due to bits floating in the cup.  Our overall impression was that the accommodation needed a bit of an overall - corridors were dated - dirty carpet and market walls. We had 2 junior suite - one supposedly an executive but the bedroom was so small - hardly enough room to walk either side of the bed. In future will revert to the Savoy or Dorchester as usual.",3,2016,07,09
121,St James' Court: Taj + location,"Very well located hotel, generally helpful staff. Happy to recommend it. Has a number of restaurants, each of which is worth trying, especially Quilon, an Indian restaurant with some twists. Good for a business visitor to the UK, though families do tend to come in the summer months especially.",5,2016,07,08
121,Priceless!,"One of the best hotels that I've ever stayed in. Everything was perfect. The service, location, food...This was not my first visit but I can't wait to go there again.The tube was only a couple of minutes walk away. The restaurants took care of my adult daughter's severe food allergies efficiently and without any fuss.I will surely be back!",5,2016,07,08
121,a perfect stay,"great place with perfect hospitality. Perfectly located, excelletn atmosphere - you make a wish ... it will come true. Checking in means coming home, you fell welcomed every time, and Ihope that there will be many happy returns",5,2016,07,07
121,Very Bad Staff Attitude,"Very poor staff attitude, especially the Indian staff am afraid. Poor communication and unhelpful attitude and no courtsey whatsoever.
Badly maintained plumbing and rooms. Noisy street as windows are not double glazed.
Would not recommend it.",1,2016,07,07
121,"The TAJ, London.....great hotel, fantastic location. very happy with everything about our stay","This hotel is in a great location close to everything you would want in LONDON. Easy walking to all major attractions and only 3 -5minutes from tube station and sightseeing buses. Some great little cafes for breakfast, although we found due to the location,  the few across the road were double that of several 5 minute walk away. The Albert Hotel (Pub) has great beer and fantastic food and is only 3 minutes walk also. The restarauts at the TAJ were nice, food was good, but a little on the rich side for us although our last evening I had Lobster and hubby had Spareribs, which we both thoroughly enjoyed and the service was great. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, and the rooms were clean and roomy, and comfortable.. I would highly recomment the TAJ to anyone going to London..NB I got it on a good deal when I booked, otherwise I probably could not have afforded to stay. But keep an eye on the deals, and if it comes up GRAB IT..",5,2016,07,05
121,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Location","I really enjoyed this hotel.  It is clean, the staff is friendly, and it is within walking distance to many attractions.  I will definitely stay here again! Also, the bed was super comfy.  Though I was there for business purposes, I'd stay for personal travel as well.",5,2016,07,05
121,Great location - not for the budget-conscious!,"The location of this hotel is spectacular - 5 minutes from Victoria Station and even fewer from St. James Park Station. It's also just a short walk from Parliament Square to the east and Sloane Square to the west. Seriously great place. The staff are remarkably helpful, and speedy as hell. Seriously: room service took no longer than 10-15 minutes. Amazing.

On that note, this hotel may have the best room service menu I've ever seen (and enjoyed). It was so good, that we actually opted to use it more than twice during our stay. The quality of food (and beauty of its presentation!) were sufficient to justify the price.

With respect to the price, everything at the SJC is pretty expensive. For example, you're the kind of traveler who doesn't like to pay for high speed internet access, then don't stay here. Normal internet speeds are free to access, but for anything more heavy-duty, a pretty hefty fee is involved.

That said, the location and service were enough to convince the two of us that we'd happily return!",4,2016,07,05
121,A very pleasant stay in a very pleasant hotel,"In very close proximity to St James' park and Buckingham Palace, this hotel is a delight. Very friendly and polite staff, comfortable bedroom, and tasty, although expensive dinner. The only disappointment was the breakfast room which fell short of the standards throughout the rest of the hotel.Not for those wishing to walk to Oxford Street, but a must for those wishing to visit the more cultural areas of London.",4,2016,07,05
121,Majestic,Excellent hotel with all the trimmings of The Raj. Good attentive staff without being intrustive. Good quality and sized rooms overlooking a majestic courtyard. Great location but in a secluded road. An ideal place to stay in London. Highly recommended.,5,2016,07,05
121,"London stay at St. James' Court (June 16-July 2, 2016)","What a fantastic hotel, location, staff. I love the place. Manager Naveen Sikka is outstanding. So are the concierges Justin and Frederic. What I love is that I feel at home here with the food, staff and friendly atomosphere.",5,2016,07,05
121,"Comfort, Peace, Luxury: Excellent","We wanted to stay somewhere lovely AND close to Hyde Park (for the BST Festival). This hotel was excellent. We'd stay again. Staff welcoming throughout. Atmosphere calm and luxurious. Room clean, comfortable and peaceful.",5,2016,07,05
121,Well positioned for the walking tourist,"Arrived Friday, 1st July, at 1 p.m. and room (778) was available.  Long walk along narrow corridors, some with threadbare carpet on stairways, around three sides of the building to small double-bedded room overlooking courtyard.  Very hot in room, 33 degrees, with no simple high/low temperature button on controller!  Man turned up four hours later to explain.  Lavatory cistern with weak flush;  basin tap stiff and leaked at base;  very slow drainage of water from sink;  no rubber mat in bath;  kettle in wardrobe not near power point so had to put on the floor near dressing table;  not many Freeview channels on tv but six or so Hindi language channels understandably;  PICK tv channel had no sound;  workmen making noise outside at 8.15 a.m. on Saturday.  MUST state the room had very good lighting, even in very small, windowless, bathroom and the bed was very comfortable - not soft/not hard.  Service in The Hamptons bar for lunch was excellent, providing non-menu toasted sandwich.",4,2016,07,04
121,Quiet and Comfortable Luxury Hotel,"One night weekend stay - mainly tastefully decorated decorated throughout (although a little blingy in places in the public areas) and well maintained. Room was comfortable with all the usual luxuries but the narrow double bed was a little surprising to see in a hotel of this class. Breakfast was good but the buffet selection rather limited (no fried eggs?) - with the breakfast restaurant itself really too small for a hotel of this size. 

Overall a good place to stay either for business or pleasure.",4,2016,07,04
121,"Great hotel, great location",It was my second stay at this hotel. The experience was great also this time. The hotel's premises are lovely and it is easy to visit different attractions because of the good location. Overall great hotel and good value for the money!,5,2016,07,04
121,Wonderful stay ,"We stayed here in two rooms last November for our daughters graduation which was being held at Church House so this place was really convenient for us being just a short walk away. 
We were very pleasantly surprised with the whole weekend, the friendly courteous staff who even took photographs for us before we left for the ceremony, the rooms were really lovely and traditional and as requested - next to each other overlooking the courtyard - the cocktails and the breakfasts both mornings were all good. Took a cab to Lyceum on the Saturday evening and strolled back. Packed lots in to our two night stay with an easy walk to most places even though it was the coldest week of the year! Would stay here again on our next visit to London. ",5,2016,07,04
121,Location,"Decent hotel. The hotel itself is HUGE and the courtyard is quite nice but a little outdated. 
The best thing about this hotel is the location, being located 5-min away from The Buckingham Palace.
There is a great Indian restaurant right next door called ""Quilon"". 
The staff were very nice and serviceminded. ",3,2016,07,02
121,A great positive surprise!!! ,"The hotel was recommended by my travel agent. He was right!  It's a very nice place, lots of attention to the customer and very well conserved place. Room is very nice with all the amenities needed and breakfasts included. . Flip side? Bed is small, it's a full bed for two adults. Place is just in the middle of everything, you can walk to nearby attractions or to take the train or bus to even take a taxi in front of the door. ",5,2016,07,02
121,A conviniently located hotel,"I have often stayed at this hotel and their sister property. My stay this June was not as satisfying. The hotel cleanliness has gone down a bit. There is a lot of congestion for breakfast and the service is inadequate although the food quality is good. The concierge was somewhat inattentive to our needs for information. It is strange that even a two hour late checkout was not accommodated by a Taj property!
The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the Buckingham Place. There are good eating places close by but Quilon restaurant of the hotel was the next level!",4,2016,07,02
121,Central to everthing,"Stayed here in December.  Staff very friendly and helpful from booking to check out. It felt like a home way from home. Loved the locations of our rooms they view of the courtyard.  The rooms could do with a little facelift, paint, etc.  but with that being said we would 100% stay here again if we come back to London. This hotel is close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby and a great shopping street with Tube stations close as well. 
",4,2016,07,01
121,Lovely hotel.,"We loved the hotel, location fabulous. The bed was so comfortable and room overall very clean. The bar was our favorite, cozy with a piano player. Baileys coffees and fruit platter every night before bed was our ritual. Easy walks to BP, Westminster Abbey, the Underground. Hotel personnel very nice and helpful. Bistro menu good but can't review hotel restaurant since I didn't care for the menu. There's a beautiful courtyard but it was either too cold or rainy to use. Lots of restaurants nearby.",5,2016,07,01
121,1st time in London,"Location was great with easy access to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey & surrounds, but food, drink and mini bar were extremely overpriced.The desk staff and porters were extremely pleasant and efficient.",3,2016,07,01
121,Great Buckingham Palace location,"The St. James hotel has a great location. It's close to most major attractions, 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, but still on a quiet street. The rooms are standard size, with rather small bathrooms, so you probably want to spend your time out and about in London.",4,2016,06,30
121,Expectations surpassed yet again!,"I have now stayed at this hotel several times since making it my ""new home"" in London. It may seem like a minor thing, but I like my bed made a special way and this time when I arrived at the hotel, without even having to mention it, the bed was made up in advance exactly as I liked it. Ron, the housekeeping manager showed up to make sure that everything was perfect in the room. The manager Naveen also did an exceptional job of assisting when I needed rooms for a group of other business associates. ",5,2016,06,30
121,A great hotel made even better by its staff!,"Love staying at the Taj St James' Court. The rooms are great, very modern and spacious for London. The beds are fantastic and the food is really tasty (I can recommend any of the currys). However, the best thing about St James' Court is the staff, always so warm and welcoming. I don't stay there often, but this is now my hotel of choice in London!",5,2016,06,30
121,Ideally Located!,"We were so delighted with our stay at St. James Court. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with the utmost respect and congeniality. Our room was lovely and the staff maintained it beautifully.  We enjoyed a terrific breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant, Bistro 51.  We asked for our eggs to be specially prepared and they accommodated our request happily.  The concierge was quite helpful in securing reservations for us and providing directions. The hotel is in a great location close to St James underground tube station and within easy walking distance of Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. ",5,2016,06,29
121,Not 4 star accomodation,"The location is good for Buckingham Palace and Westminster, the staff are very good but the room we were in had sun faded furniture, very old décor and a small old fashioned bathroom.  We awoke every morning at 6am when deliveries started at the businesses across the road.
Disappointing.",3,2016,06,29
121,Expected better,Superb location. Impressive reception area. Excellent breakfasts. Friendly staff. Very disappointed to be given a double room instead of twin as booked 5 months previously. Lost over two hours waiting for it to be resolved. We were then overcharged by £60 on our final settlement. This was to be special stay for our Ruby Wedding - could have gone better.,3,2016,06,29
121,Mixed experience ,"A big beautiful grand hotel close to Buckingham Palace. All staff were perfect and incredibly helpful. We arrived early before midday and a room was found for us immediately which was lovely. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment about the food. We enjoyed the spa and gym facilities and services.

We chose the hotel partly because of the outdoor courtyard with the option to relax, eat and drink here. To our surprise over the 3 days the courtyard always had smokers bellowing out cigar and cigarette smoke. Truely disgusting and spoiling non-smokers pleasure of being outside. The hotel should have designated smoking areas away from others or ban it totally. This has put me off from ever returning.

121,"Great Location, very helpful staff but doesn't quite do it as a top hotel","Stayed at the St James with my wife on a Sunday evening as it was centrally located and close to where we needed to be - and all the major sites are within easy ealking distance.  We arrived earlier than the standard check-in time but very helpfully we were offered a room which was different to the one we would have had, had we arrived later.  Unfortunately, this room was tiny, not very clean and had a huge stain on the carpet - but as we needed to make an appointment we didn't mention it until our return later in the afternoon.  When we did, the receptionist we spoke to (Isobelle) was wonderful, she found us another room (quite possibly the one we would have had originally) which was much larger, clean(!) and very comfortable with very effective aircon and a well stocked mini-bar.
However, the toiletries provided in the bathroom and tea and coffee making items were all quite poor quality...
In general, the hotel isn't as grand as it would appear on its website - the cocktail bar isn't very inviting - it is very small and full of people working at laptops.  The outside courtyard was unfortunately full of people smoking, if you are not a smoker you will find it uncomfortable to sit there - not something you would expect today..
The corridors in the hotel are tired and in need of refurbishment and you get the sense that this hotel is resting on its laurels somewhat and reliant on the trade it generates through its Indian heritage.  Whilst overall the hotel was adequate, for the money, there are better hotels in the Westminster area..",3,2016,06,28
121,Evening meal,"We went to Bistro One at the taj hotel what a find one of the best meal I've had for a long time we had booked a table for 6pm the restaurant was empty which makes you think but we had no worries as the restaurant soon filled up.
The service was excellent the waiters were very attentive and the food was also excellent I would describe the food as Indian fuzon 
I would recommend this restaurant & the bonus is they take the taste card even on a Saturday night",5,2016,06,27
121,Turn of the century elegance with all the modern conveniences,"This is a luxury hotel situated minutes away from Buckingham Palace and St; James Park and Green Park, and in close vicinity to Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament and the Mayfair area. My room - not one of the most expensive - was large with king size bed, had all the amenities one would normally want including spacious closets and lots of dresser space. Bath was large and modern with telephone and a shower with safety features. I was assured the room was checked twice a day for cleanliness.  Every member of staff encountered was very friendly and helpful. I appreciated a business room with computers enabling me to keep in touch with family, etc., by email. There are restaurant facilities for a good breakfast and one that overlooks an attractive courtyard. There is a close tube stop.",5,2016,06,27
121,Very disappointed ,"We have just returned from a two night stay at the Taj hotel St James court and we are very disappointed with the whole stay. We checked in early so left our luggage and hit the sights. We returned late evening and went to our room. There was no air conditioning on in the room and there was a slight smell but we put this down to the day being so warm. We got into bed but the smell was unbearable. We soon realised that the previous visitor had been ill down the side of the bed and on the floor. The carpet was still damp from being cleaned but the smell still lingered. We rang reception and the night manager was very apologetic and said he would move us straight away. We packed up and after a very long wait he finally arrived and helped us to move. The next evening when returning to our room to find housekeeping had not been. I don't mind the bed not being made but we did not have any clean towels or milk, another call to reception. The next morning we received a fast check out slip with a £25.00 charge? We had paid for the room in full when booking our stay and had not used anything (no one had been in the room so the fridge had not been checked) so we were a little confused. We asked the receptionist what the charge was for and she said it was a service charge ? Even more confused as to why we had a service charge we asked her to double check. She rang bookings and they said that the room was a different price for each nights stay (remember we had already paid for our stay) we showed her our payment receipt and after another call we were told that it was ok we did not owe anything. This was not the service we expected, we have used this hotel on several occasions and have always been happy with the rooms and the service. It is sad but unfortunately we will not be using this hotel again.",2,2016,06,27
121,Great location / beautiful hotel ,"According to staff, this used to be part of Buckingham Palace which is cool. Very nice/ modern rooms. Beds were a little hard, but very pleased with beautiful view of court yard from window. Close to Westminster Abby and other attractions. 
Pictures below are of our room and view. ",5,2016,06,27
121,A step above,"Classic London hotel where the Gentry would stay, just down the block from Buckingham Palace. Great location, very comfortable bed and room, high end linens, competent staff, all the amenities you would expect",5,2016,06,27
121,Not as good as hoped,"Although the staff were excellent the hotel does not live up to the photos on their website.
We normally stay at St Ermins but was advised that this was better - sadly not the case.

The room we got given originally was very small and had no view - for the money we paid we had expected better, we were moved to a better room though although my sisters change of room went even smaller.

Unfortunately this won't be our preferred choice of hotel next year.",3,2016,06,27
121,St.James Hotel,"The hotel was very well located for visits to the Embankment, Westminster Abbey and the houses of Parliament. it was within walking distance of Trafalgar Square and  the theatre area. The hotel was very classical, very clean and the service was very good The bathrooms were very small and old fashioned but the room very pleasant.",4,2016,06,26
121,Outstanding staff and a wonderful place to stay but fading a little on maintanance,"I hate to criticize a hotel where the staff is so cooperative and the entire ambiance outstanding but being a Taj, on expects that - the Taj hotels are a home away from home for many of us.. 

In the showers, the Gym taps need to be replaced/ repaired. The Bathrooms need to be upgraded with a hygine faucet. ",4,2016,06,26
121,Excellent hotel great location,"Fantastic hotel in central London , not far from the business district & attractions such as Buckingham palace, lovely place and also tranquil considering it's location can't wait to return, went on business due back again next month, also considering taking the family for a mini break *****.",5,2016,06,25
121,Mediocre,"Seems to have a high opinion of itself but once you get beyond the fancy reception it really is nothing special. Average rooms, 1990s decor and a small bathroom with an excuse for a shower. Breakfast buffet was excellent but that aside I can't say I was impressed.",3,2016,06,24
121,Wonderful hotel in Central London,"St Janes Court, Taj is a very nice hotel- centrally located, with good service and nice rooms. The central courtyard is the best place- so beautiful. Has lovely restaurants- Quilon especially- which is an Indian and a Michelin Star restaurant!
To stay in such a wonderful hotel owned by Taj in London makes every Indian so proud!! 
It's a very high end hotel but has great affordable deals also!!!",5,2016,06,22
121,Serene oasis in the centre  of London,"I really love staying at St. James' Court in London. It has a beautiful outdoor courtyard restaurant. The Hamptons bar has great atmosphere, and the guestrooms are very luxurious. It is in walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Mayfair, Oxford Street, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. There are several restaurants within the hotel to choose from. The staff is very attentive to any needs.",5,2016,06,21
121,Better the pictures than reality,"The standard rooms are very old, specilly the toilets. Not really in a four-strs hotel. We told this on the reception desk and the offer an upgrade but paying a supplement and we did it. The breakfast hasn't a good quality and variety.",3,2016,06,21
121,**Top sleep suite**,Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend the buffet breakfast and evening cocktails with the pianist. Very well equipped room with excellent room service. The location is also excellent being very close to Buckingham Palace and tube station.,5,2016,06,20
121,Lovely Hotel with service to match.,Although we only stayed one night we were impressed by the fantastic level of customer service.  We dined at two parts of the hotel and the food was excellent. This is a super hotel and it's clear the staff are trained to go that bit extra in terms of customer service.   I've stayed in many London hotels over the years and this one is up with the best.,5,2016,06,20
121,"Location, Location, Location!","Our visit was for the Queens trooping of the colour & the patrons party on the mall, so this location was perfect. The staff were very friendly and always happy to help. The hotel has old world class and charm. The room was not as big as we expected and slightly below the 4star rating but that small issue wouldn't stop us returning. as for sight seeing we really enjoyed the Tower Bridge tour,, good value and fab views.",4,2016,06,19
121,awesome hotel,"We had a great time-  I highly recommend this hotel.  Location is perfect, one block from Buckingham palace and Westminster.  The rooms were very spacious, and the bathrooms luxurious. The concierge was so helpful, he got theatre tickets for us, and recommended some great restaurants-  I would go back again!",5,2016,06,19
121,Excellent Location and Service,A friendly and nice hotel in the center of everything you need to go in London.  I come here for business for this time but I'll definitely stay again even I'm here for leisure trip. 3 min walk to Buckingham Place 2 min walk to St Jame's park underground Ard 10 min walk to the Big Ben 20 min nice walk to the Covent Garden Highly Recommended!,5,2016,06,19
121,"Beautiful hotel, Location perfect, Staff are the best","Stayed 8 nights at St James Court, which was an absolute pleasure.
The staff were so attentive to every need, always offering a helping hand and always very approachable. I loved the doormen and concierge staff, they were lovely!

The room was impeccable, could fault nothing. The location was incredibe, very short walk to both St James and Victoria tube stations. Also a very easy walk to Big Ben and Westminster. 

A very magical first ever stay in London. Great memories.",5,2016,06,19
121,Pleasantly surprised,"Needed to find a hotel as we were attending an event in the Westminster area, my partner came across this hotel. This hotel is stunning , very pleasant and helpful staff. It was a wonderful experience from the minute we arrived here until we left. We will certainly make this hotel our first choice whenever we come to Lomdon. We dined in 2 of the restaurants and the Courtyard , the food was excellent and very reasonably priced . Ladies if you stay here go to Dar Blow Bar attached to the hotel, this man is a magician, I went for a blow dry for our evening event , the whole experience was fantastic , I looked and felt like a million dollars when I left his beautiful salon. I will come back to this hotel just for this experience alone. ",5,2016,06,18
121,Queens Birthday trip,"My mother and I checked in at the hotel which is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and The Mall and we had a wonderful stay, using many of the hotel facilities and entertaining friends and family there.  We also visited the Westminster Chapel during our stay and were warmly welcomed.",4,2016,06,18
121,Best hotel in London,"This hotel is beautiful with an excellent location to major sites in London (Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square, etc).  I will stay here every chance I get.  The staff is friendly, the service is excellent, and the rooms are quiet.",5,2016,06,16
121,The Taj St. James is the best,"Stayed one night as I have accidentally booked our stay in London a day short.  Wonderful experience for that single night.  We had the Tea Time and Vintage car experience, Steve, our chauffeur was great, knew the city and had a great experience.  Well, we left the next day to go to the hotel we booked for the week and was disappointed.  It was more of a business hotel, nice, but not the St. James.  We stayed one night there and returned to the St. James.  Great people, wonderful location, fab hotel.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,06,16
121,Very nice hotel with a great service...,"Located very good in the heart of London between Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. But this hotel provides you more than her location. The service in the hotel is great. People of this hotel are smiling all the hotel, ready to help to you and the way they talk is really well-educated. You feel like you are in the right place in this hotel. Although I stayed only one night in this hotel I can tell you that I really enjoyed this place a lot. From now on this hotel will be my staying place whenever I visit London again. Thanks",5,2016,06,16
121,Heart of London,Located just next to Buckingham Palace !! A very convenient spot for both business and leisure.  Well equipped hotel and the vintage TAJ experience that we always expect. It was a great stay and work well for the discreet as well as location bound London traveller,5,2016,06,15
121,Excellent service in London,"A very good hotel which is ideally placed to enjoy many of the key visitor attractions in London, especially Buckingham Palace. The hotel is spotless throughout and whilst one has come to expect cleanliness this was exceptional! The staff are extremely helpful and, in particular, the concierge staff. I have rarely seen so many happy faces on hotel staff - they all seemed genuinely to value our custom.",4,2016,06,15
121,Kind Staff Extra Small Rooms and Hallways,"Every encounter I had with the hotel staff was cheerful, kind and helpful. 
Great Breakfast and a nice setting.
Fabulous walking or underground location!!!!!! Best area to stay in!! 
Washrooms and bath need renovation--felt like an old Holiday Inn and the hallways and nearly claustrophobic. The room I had was unfortunately right next to (I think) a service door, but, was still mostly quiet but small compared to any other Taj property. ",3,2016,06,10
121,Mr Chintan,"Good hotel for Indians to stay!!!!

Centrally located and near to Buckingham palace & other attractions!!

Easy access to tube station 

Breakfast also has Indian food options 

Staff was courteous and helpful

Helped me for early checkin

Easy check out process",4,2016,06,09
121,Great Location,"The hotel is located 1/4 mile from Buckingham Palace and 1 mile from Westminster Abbey.  It is a quiet hotel, away from traffic.  The staff is professional.  My room was spacious and very clean.  The only reason this hotel didn't get an excellent is my room was  looking a little tired.  The lobby is beautiful.",4,2016,06,08
121,Quality hotel close to the sites,"The hotel is walking distance to Winchester Abby, Buckingham Place and Parliament. The service was good and the hotel was nicely maintained but still had old world charm. The price was good and the room was upgraded and adequate.",5,2016,06,08
121,Handy location ,"Near tube. Clean and staff very pleasant and helpful.  My room was ok bit small and felt it could have been updated. The restaurants were good, except people had to queue for breakfast, even so I would stay again if I needed to be that area. I'd just get a superior room",4,2016,06,08
121,Excellent Hotel,Beautiful hotel with great location. I was very impressed with the staff and the hotel throughout. Good location close to Buckingham Palace. Tube station at St James park within easy walking distance. Excellent restaurants although the Breakfast was the standard buffet that is found in many hotels and could be improved buy cooking breakfast when required so the food is freshly prepared.,5,2016,06,07
121,EXCELLENT LOCATION SERVICED BY DEDICATED PEOPLE,"This property of Taj Group is very well located and works like clock, under able leadership of Mr Digvijay Singh. He has dedicated team which is not only well motivated but also ever willing to assist you. Making you comfortable AND AT HOME is the key point. Prompt and superior quality of assistance by people like Mr Binoy Nair makes your trip memorable.",5,2016,06,07
121,luxury,"This hotel is very well located, has excellent staff and facilities and is a luxurious oasis near Buckingham Palace. There are 4 restaurants and a courtyard away from the noise. The staff were unfailingly courteous and brought me a piece of birthday cake.",5,2016,06,07
121,Great stay,My fiancee and I had a lovely time. The service was wonderful and we had no complaints. It was an easy walk to all the sites and the room was a good deal for the price. We would recommend this hotel to our friends.,4,2016,06,06
121,Oasis at a few minutes walk to Buckingham Gate,"historic structure well remodeled to modern comfort. best in class style and richly furnished. excellent service, helpful and informed staff. beautiful internal courtyard. comfortable and spacious rooms. modern and clean gym and spa.",5,2016,06,06
121,Beautiful exterior,"This is quite close to Victoria Station, which is why I booked this hotel.  It has a lovely exterior, courtyard, main reception area and main restaurant (Bank?).  

The hallway to my room and the room itself are adequate, and standard.  They are nicely appointed, but don't have that 'grand' feel of the main areas.  I decided to take my own bags to my room from the lobby, which is a mistake.  I got off of the elevator and I think I walked a mile (which ended up being all the way around the court) to get to my room.  The bonus was that after I got settled in, I found that I was quite close to a back end set of stairs and elevator which made coming and going quite easy.

On my last morning, I encountered a couple in the elevator and they made the comment 'this is the first time we've seen anyone'.  It was for me too - I felt like I had a whole wing to myself which was a bit odd.

This is in an area that is mainly surrounded by offices - so it doesn't have a great nightlife nearby.  However - there is a lovely cafe immediately across the street which is great for breakfast.  If you go to the main entrance, walk right and then turn right again (onto Victoria Street) there are a few places to eat, including the Albert pub, All Bar One, etc. 

It's also very close to the palace and is a pleasant walk from Green Park, Piccadilly, the Mall, etc.

All in all, I would recommend it.  Just don't let the exteriors and main areas fool you into thinking that you're getting that same level of grandeur in your room.",4,2016,06,05
121,Very crowded hotel,"First, I wish Tripadvisor had a 'good' rating between average and very good. That's what I would have rated this hotel. Very busy lobby, looked more like a train station at rush hour. My room was large and nice although very very far from the elevators and needs better sound proof windows. Otherwise comfortable bed and good wifi. ",4,2016,06,05
121,First Stay at a Taj,The hotel is lovely with a wonderful courtyard which I took advantage of given good weather.  The employees of the hotel were delightful.  My room was clean and all was in working order.  It overlooked a schoolyard which was quiet at night. The location is very close to Victoria Station (gateway to Gatwick and points north) and around the corner from Buckingham Palace.,5,2016,06,05
121,"Elegant, but thin walls","This sophisticated, high class hotel in London is close to Buckingham Palace and well located for other tourists. Every amenity is laudable.  Staff is extremely accommodating.
Unfortunately, walls are very thin and sound equates to sharing rooms.",4,2016,06,04
121,Family Holiday,"The Hotel is very well located, between 2 major Underground stations and walking distance to the Buckingham Palace. The hotel has many restaurants with a variety of cuisine to choose from. Very satisfied with my stay.",4,2016,06,04
121,Overnight visit,"Had a Perfect mid week, one night stay at st James court. 

Perfect central location near Buckingham palace.
Lots of top shopping locations and restaurants near by.

Great service, excellent breakfast and first class advice from the concierge.

Will definitely return. ",5,2016,06,04
121,Could not ask for more!!,"Excellent location (walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey and just a block away from the nearest Tube station), great F&B choices (especially Indian food) and very helpful staff. Highly recommended for tourists wanting to stay in a central location, yet in a peaceful area..",5,2016,06,04
121,Keep It Up Taj!,"Great Hotel! Large rooms, convenient location, excellent service and delicious food. The courtyard was lovely for drinks in the evening. The afternoon tea was very English indeed. the spacious lobby was a great place to meet friends with tasty/spicy  snacks to go with the cocktails.",5,2016,06,03
121,Let down from Taj,"Rooms are very compact.

Breakfast section is awfully crowded and not much room to sit  comfortably, let alone spaciously.

House keeping is not at all in sync with the traditional TAJ hospitality and falls very short of expectation, leaving customers unhappy on the the value for money and brand image.

My room air-conditioner was making a terrible loud noise and despite multiple assurances from house keeping, no one took the trouble to rectify it. I had to actually switch off the a/c in the night. The most irritating part was that the maintenance guy turns up during my check out after 2 nights of terrible sleep - this was a shocking experience from such a premier hotel - and that too after paying 258 pounds per night",4,2016,06,03
121,Right in the Center ,"Nice hotel very central just 5 min from some of the important tourists attraction in London like Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews, St. James Park. Victoria Station is only 10min away. To Heathrow airport it's a bit far if you want to use the express. The rooms are big and traditional and the bathrooms have been updated. The courtyard is beautiful in itself. ",4,2016,06,02
121,Simply Superb just like any other Taj,Superb location with excellent service friendly and forthcoming staff and very warm hospitality.  All in all a great property and we were a family of 6 including 2 children and none of us had any kind of complaint or service issue during our entire 5 night stay.,5,2016,06,02
121,Nice stay,Hotel was in a great location and staff was very helpful.  Be careful not to get a room facing the boys school since it was very noisy but staff did change our room to a very nice and quite one. The price for eating there was pretty pricey so we did not eat there.,4,2016,06,02
121,Long weekend in London,"Location is perfect. Walking distance to Vitoria station, Westminster Abbey, NE Scotland Yard. Tube station is 5 in walk. Hotel is clean. Food is good and affordable in the restaurants. Buffet breakfast should gave more options for breakfast. The egg ommlett was little bit too soft on my taste. I liked fresh squeezed orange juice for breakfast. Consider the price we payed, amenities and location, you can't get better. Thank you.",5,2016,06,02
121,Tries hard but somehow misses,"This hotel is brilliantly located for access to Buckingham Palace,Westminster, etc. The hotel tries really hard to be 5 star. You will be greeted very nicely by the door staff who are lovely. 

But ...

Constant queues to get access to the breakfast area - even early

Lousy coffee (make sure you ask for a particular coffee such as a cafe latte or you will get dishwater)

Nothing particularly special about the breakfast buffet - a couple of Indian dishes but nothing amazing

Even the king rooms are small - really small and you'll have to step into the bath tub to have a shower

You will have $150 taken as a credit on your credit card per three days of stay or so. We were told that $150 would be taken only to find that $300 was deducted. Got a very ""don't care"" attitude from the front desk when we asked for clarification

The adjacent apartment hotel rooms are quite spectacular and have spectacular prices to match.

The Indian restaurant attached to the hotel is Michelin starred - and is great.

The evening chocolate is nice and the beds are comfortable.

The St James tube station is very very near by which is really convenient.

If you time your walk, you might see the soldiers practicing their marching drill at the nearby barracks.

The hotel feels like it's trying but it's just missing",3,2016,06,02
121,ST JAMES TAJ,The stay was great. However being a inner circle member as promised by them they would provide upgrade of room. The upgrade of room was done after 2 days of our stay. Also airport transfers werent provided. Normally every taj hotel in the world provides Airport Transfers especially for the inner circle members. In total the hotel was good but our stay at taj exotica was the best.,4,2016,06,01
121,Initially blown away but gradually let down,"First impressions of this hotel are that it is a higher-end luxury location. The welcome was good and the lobby is opulent. 
Service though was a let down both in Hamptons bar and the breakfast venue (which by the way was more ""greasy spoon"" than top hotel).
Waiting 25 minutes in an almost empty bar to be asked what I want to drink was poor. Getting my breakfast order wrong then not appearing to care was worse. 
When I raised my concerns on checkout they were brushed aside (admittedly the staff member was new and seemed to be only just getting their head around their new job). 
I had an email from the hotel asking for feedback. I didn't reply immediately and they sent another one. Which, I thought, was a bit pushy. But I replied. And then heard nothing. If you're going to pester someone into giving feedback, at least have the common courtesy to reply to it!
Next to a school, too, so noisy even for a city centre location. 
Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely hotel in a great location. But for the money I spent, I'll probably look elsewhere now for my next trip up to London. ",3,2016,06,01
121,"Great location and hotel, the rooms need a bit of TLC","This is my fourth time to this hotel. It is in a great location and reasonably priced for central London. The staff are very helpful and friendly, they always greet you in the corridors and make sure you are ok. The only slight negative is that the rooms are looking a little outdated and in need of some attention, Having said this the rooms are very clean and this does not affect the stay at the hotel.",4,2016,06,01
121,A Class apart hotel,"You can expect nothing but the best in-house experience from the Taj fraternity. The hotel is conveniently located. The hotel offers spectacular cuisines to suit your taste buds. I visited the hotel during my 2-day conference. Overall, it was a pleasurable trip.",5,2016,06,01
121,"Great Location but ""Tired"" Rooms","First impressions were great, the lobby is really lovely and location is fantastic. 
My husband was on crutches when we arrived yet the room we were checked into initially was probably the furthest away from the lift! (Room and furnishings was very ""tired""). We had to ring to change which was dealt with. There was a terrible smell in the corridor by the lift (sewarage like smell) for our entire stay. Wifi was a bit hit and miss. I would rate the rooms as a 3* standard which is disappointing considering the price and how impressive the lobby is.",3,2016,05,31
121,Little bit of luxury,"Stayed at St. James' court for weekend . Efficient check in by Isabelle  . Luxurious foyer . Exec room refurbished , very modern . High thread count bedding , crisp and clean . Lovely soft towels . Nice selection of toiletries ,  paraben and sulphate free. Free newspaper each morning . Breakfast expensive so we ate at Royal qtr across the road. Also the drinks in the bar were a tad expensive I thought £28 for a pimms  and a mojito ! We stayed on 7 th floor lovely and  quiet . Bathroom good size with mixed shower over bath .  Check out was painless using express checkout. ",5,2016,05,30
121,"Bland and old inside, fancy outside","Exteriors and location may be posh but interiors are bland and badly needing an update. Amenities are out-of-date. Being right next to Buckingham Palace is the only plus point, but even for tourists there are many other areas to stay for less. High hopes, but give it a pass.",3,2016,05,30
121,Lunch in a beautiful hotel,"I took my elderly mum for lunch at the St James Court. It was unexpected as we were just driving by. My father used to work here for many years and I remember spending my summer holidays visiting here. So it was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Whilst very nostalgic it exceeded all expectations. From the doorman to the staff in the restaurant, all were so welcoming and polite. The food was excellent, reasonably priced and it was served with big smiles and utter politeness. Beautifully presented and tasted great. Compliments to the Chef!!!  It was a late lunch and arrived at 2.30. I didn't realise that the restaurant closed at 3. Mum and I ate leisurely talking about the good old days and by the time we finished it was 3.45. We did not feel under any pressure  from the staff to rush our lunch or any indication that they needed us out. It was only when I asked what time they close for lunch did I realise that it was quite a time after 3. Its been a long time since mum has been out for lunch and her first experience in a while was a great one. I didn't take the names of the waiting staff but I would like to say a HUGE thank you for making us feel welcome and for looking after us so well. Definitely worth a visit just for lunch ...",5,2016,05,30
121,Always a pleasure to come back to the Taj.,We have stayed at the Taj on numerous occasions and always enjoy coming back as we feel the hotel offers a welcoming and comfortable environment. The staff are without exception friendly and want to do everything they can to make your stay a pleasant experience. The situation is excellent being close to St James tube station and within walking distance of so many of London's main attractions.hotel offers excellent value for a hotel of this class in such a good location. We look forward to our next visit. Breakfast is really good with a wide range of options and the,5,2016,05,30
121,Great Location !,Great hotel. Clean. Located just a 10 minute walk from both Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. Tube station just 5 minute walk away. Nice restaurant and a nice bar where there is live piano music. Staff is friendly and professional.,5,2016,05,29
121,"Nice Rooms, Great Location","The room was nice, comfortable bed and pillows, nice fluffy robe and big bath towels.  The bathroom had a shower and no tub.  My issue was with the service, or I should say lack of service, in the restaurant/bar in the lobby.  My husband and I visited there three times and each time we were ignored for quite a long time.  At one point I went up and asked for service and we still waited for several minutes for someone to come to our table.  There were several servers standing around and the place was only about a quarter filled.  Once we managed to get some food it was subpar.  I would not recommend eating there.",4,2016,05,29
121,"Superb level of service, from the moment of our arrival. At every level, we experienced friendly, most gracious staff.","Fantastic, central location; we took a 40 minute train ride from Gatwick and a 10 minute stroll from Victoria station took us there. Terrific location for all we wished to do.  Close to Tube stops, round the corner from Buckingham Palace, a pleasant stroll away from Hyde Park.  The Hotel's public spaces are lovely, many options for sitting around, taking tea, having a drink. We loved the gorgeous courtyard. What a beautiful place right in the heart of London. Our room was lovely; a special comment. On arrival, my daughter and I felt tired from the early start so decided to take a nap. Unfortunately, in the next room some refurbishment was taking place.  Following a phone-call, Reception and Housekeeping arranged to have us moved to a room farther away within 30 minutes. No fuss. The room was even nicer and overlooked the Courtyard :) . It is 25 years since my husband and I stayed here, that was a business trip but we recalled how lovely it was and thought this would be a treat for our daughter and me.  It did not disappoint.",5,2016,05,29
121,Beautiful Hotel Right Near Buckingham Palace,"The St. James' Court is a beautiful hotel and great value. Flying into London later at night, we had trouble finding anywhere to eat outside the hotel after 10:00. The staff's room service was a perfect start to our stay in London. 

The hotel is in a great location, no more than 5 minute walk from the hotel to Buckingham Palace. 

The room itself was very nice, extremely comfortable bed, very clean room; spacious and nice shower/bathroom. 

Would definitely stay here again!  Very friendly staff willing to make your stay perfect. ",5,2016,05,29
121,Not to be missed,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel, mid week.  Fantastic experience.  Welcoming and attentive staff.  Room very well appointed, clean and stylish.  Good location for travelling around the city.  Loved the cocktails in the bar.  Plenty of restaurants and bars in the vicinity.",5,2016,05,29
121,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at St. James Court last week and found it to be a wonderful hotel. Very professional and helpful staff, clean rooms and good location  a couple of blocks from a tube stop. Could easily walk to many sights. We did not pay for the breakfast but tried it one day and decided we had many other options that were as good. Would stay there again without question.",5,2016,05,28
121,Great Hotel,"I was very impressed with St James' Court. The room was good, the staff were friendly and professional and the bed was very comfy. Although the room cost quite a bit more than I'm usually willing to pay, the location more than made up for this as it was literally 10 minutes walk away from a handful of the main tourist attractions and we really felt right in the heart of everything. As we're used to the peaceful tranquility that accompanies rural living, the never ending thrum of London (traffic, rubbish trucks etc) made it a little difficult to sleep at night. The cost of food from the various shops and eateries around about the hotel was also pretty expensive, although that was to be expected given the location. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend it to any couples that want to explore London's main tourist attractions on foot.",5,2016,05,28
121,Great London Location,"We stayed at the St. James Court in May 2016.  The location, staff, service, and rooms are all great.  Only a few minutes walk to two tub stops, Buckingham Palace, several pubs, and restaurants.  Would definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends and for anyone looking for a reasonably priced great London location.",5,2016,05,28
121,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel","Great hotel and location.  Rooms are very clean and the bed was super comfortable, especially the pillows.  The staff are excellent, friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was very good too, can't fault it.  Their was a singer playing the keyboard in the bar in the evening, lovely ambience.",5,2016,05,27
121,Day in London,Excellent central London Hotel with superbly spacious room. My only slight criticism would be that the public corridors on the way to our room are now overdue for some refurbishment.. Very attentive staff and there were lots of them. Good breakfast. All in all a good overnight stay.,5,2016,05,27
121,Great value in London,"The hotel had good sized rooms for London and the price was reasonable.  It's close to the tube (St. James Park), and the fitness room was excellent.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and I would stay here again.",5,2016,05,26
121,Buiness Trip,Excellent hotel in the most central location. Attended a 2 day business meeting and thoroughly enjoyed the catering and rooms. I would strongly recommend this hotel and if you can get away from business then go site-seeing; is on your doorstep!,4,2016,05,26
121,Lovely nights sleep,I thought this to be a lovely hotel with great service and a REALLY comfy bed! The staff are very helpful and friendly; the presentation of the rooms is lovely. I would highly recommend this accommodation and will be staying here again myself in the near future..,5,2016,05,26
121,"Taj Hotel, St James Court, London","Recently attended The Queens Garden Party booked into the Taj Hotel, staff very friendly and helpful was upgraded to a suite at no extra cost. Hotel clean, staff have excellent customer service skills.  Would stay in this hotel again when staying in London.",5,2016,05,26
121,St. James Court Taj Hotel- London,"Great stay. Quiet room. Excellent service. Great for families. Hot breakfast on site was very helpful.  Many people spent their evenings sitting around the lobby having a drink/beverage, chatting with travel mates, while listening to the enjoyable music from the piano player.  It is a great way to end a busy day.    I stayed at the hotel from May 18 to May 23, 2016 and traveled with my 13 year old son. The food portions  in the  restaurants were very generous and tasted good. We did not have a meal we did not enjoy.",5,2016,05,25
121,St James Hotel in London,Place overated ! Very good location and very clean but price too high for what it is .Rooms are small and very old looking .  The people working there are very friendly and nice though except for the french concierge ..,3,2016,05,25
121,Fine hotel,"Fine and professional service ervice and clean facilities, but very small room with a bit of a claustrofobic touch. Very tidy and Clean though and a comfortable bed. We did not use the restaurant and no breakfast due to the price of 24 punds.",4,2016,05,25
121,"Good Location, Average Hotel","I've stayed in many Taj hotels and this one is disappointing. The hotel lobby, first floor bar and courtyard are well maintained but move beyond and you quickly experience the true age of the hotel. The rooms are dingy, dated and very average. The hallways are scuffed and in need of paint and the overall decor is basic.

The breakfast is an uninspired joke with little variety or quality.

The service is fine but nothing special and not what I've come to expect from Taj. 

Overall, this hotel has lowered my perception of the Taj brand.",3,2016,05,25
121,Good Service,"It's a good hotel with a good location. Near to Buckingham Palace's, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square and most of monuments. It's near to St James Park and to underground. The employees are very kindly. The rooms are very clean and big.",4,2016,05,24
121,My favourite Hotel in London,It is the place I want to be booked into whenever I travel to London. I book it well in advance to be sure to have a room . The location is perfect for my business travels and meetings. Close to the Tube and easy to reach with Public Transportation.,4,2016,05,24
121,Very good but expensive,"Used for its location central to where I was having a number of business meetings.  The room was paid for by my employer but I noticed how expensive things like a small bottle of water were (£3.50 in this case).  I'd hate to be paying my own bills!
The hotel itself was very pleasant and the room was quiet and comfortable, if somewhat on the small size (as can be the case in London).  It was good to see a hotel that offered a full in-room sports channel service.
Staff at breakfast were very attentive and the food of good quality. The restaurant looked quite small so I don't know how they'd cope at times of peak demand.",4,2016,05,24
121,Always a pleasure.,"The St. James Court is a lovely hotel with a first class staff.  The rooms are very clean, quiet and well appointed; the beds are extremely comfortable. Piano players in the lounge area were fantastic. We especially enjoyed talking with bartender Umberto. His cocktails were right on point, and the quiet courtyard is the perfect spot for drinks with friends. There are three fine restaurants adjacent. The Bistro off the lobby has a very nice breakfast and Quilon next door was epic. It is well located, just a couple of blocks from Buckingham Palace but on a nice quiet street. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2016,05,24
121,Five star hotel with best amenities,a wonderful hotel to make your stay memorable with excellent and efficient staff all around who are always ready to cooperate.  situated at the heart of the city with a great accessibility towards Victoria station and the central London.  excellent amenities with an elaborate buffet breakfast.,4,2016,05,23
121,Very good,Very comfortable bed. Spacious rooms. Historical place. Very good service. Places to visit are very close. Breakfast buffet with large choice. Lobby and restaurants with very pleasant decoration. Really enjoyed the stay.,5,2016,05,22
121,Business Travel Perfection,"Booked a Classic King room, Room 675, and was delighted by its size, decor, amenities, bath, etc. Could not have asked for more. Very roomy for a London hotel and I should know - I've been bringing tour groups from the US to the UK for twenty years and have stayed in a heck of alot of UK and London hotels. This is one of the best. Check-in was a breeze and everyone was thoroughly professional while at the same time welcoming. The concierge mailed a package home for me and nothing is too much for any of the staff. Excellent restaurants, bar and spa on premises, outdoor seating areas, afternoon tea. For location, price, service and ambiance, the St. James's Court can't be beat, in my humble opinion. Don't hesitate, just book. This will be my new London base hotel for future tours.",5,2016,05,22
121,"Excellent hotel, wonderful staff","This hotel is perfect, the staff are marvellous - nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are very nicely appointed and very clean. 

I stay very regularly and it's truly like a home from home. 

It's also a fantastic location, very close to St James' tube station and the many restaurants of Victoria. 

",5,2016,05,22
121,2 star hotel at best!,"Please don't be fooled by the professional photography on the website. It appears that all the rooms are gorgeous and newly refurbished, but this isn't true. We were given a room to start with that was so dated and unkempt we had to ask to be moved. They then moved us 5 doors down the hall to an equally dated but smaller room. This hotel is not a 4star hotel. The outside appearances are great and the courtyard is lovely, but everything else is just standard. Hefty pricing, as well, does not reflect the standard you would expect. Situated ideally for the main visiting points of London, with Buckingham Palace only a few hundred yards down the road. Having said that with the efficiency and pricing of the tube then it takes no time at all to get anywhere you want! I would look at other hotels before this one if you are looking for high standard and luxury.. definitely a 2star hotel at best... ",3,2016,05,22
121,Lovely area of town,"Have stayed here two or three times now and find it great value for money. It's in a relatively smart area of town, close to Buckingham Palace and the parks. The service is impeccable, the rooms smart and clean and the reception/piano bar has a nice feel about it. Bar prices slightly pricey, but no more than you'd expect in central London. Top drawer.",4,2016,05,22
121,Wonderful hotel with amazing staff,Stayed here for one night as it was close to Victoria Station.  Super location with very nice staff.  The room we had was perfect and sizeable by London standards.  There are lots of London attractions within easy walking distance.,5,2016,05,22
121,Anniversary visit ,"Good location . Nice place ... Bigger that it looks . Good services, nice rooms but the bathroom size and decor was a let down . The staff are great and the bar in the evening was great. They knew it was our anniversary but no upgrade , flowers , free drinks etc not even a congratulations . However maybe I expected too much . Like I said overall a great stay . ",5,2016,05,21
121,Amazing Five Star Experience!,"We stayed at St. James Court Hotel in April for the London Marathon. The hotel itself is spectacular. Our experience was amazing! The hotel amenities & restaurants were pleasurable comforts we utilized throughout our stay. 

Our room was clean and comfortable, but was a bit snug when adding 2 adults and luggage to top. The towel warming rack did not work in our room (or we just didn't know how to use it). This would have been a nice touch when drying off after showering in London this time of year. Although the room had heat, there was a chill in the room at times. When we adjusted the heat (which required a learning curve), we would find the room too warm and had to open the windows to cool the room off. This wasn't an issue for us, but kind of funny looking back on it now. My husband slept well, but I found the bed to be a bit firm for my liking. All in all, we had a pleasant and comfortable stay.

The room was stocked with fairly priced snacks, bottled water, wine and candies that were billed to the hotel stay upon checkout. This was a nice comfort, as we didn't have to leave the hotel to find something to snack on at midnight. We tried to order room service one time and could not order what we wanted because of the cut off times for ordering certain foods. I was a little let down because I really wanted tea & sandwiches post marathon, but it was past the ordering time for this type of food item. Just make sure you note which foods are 24-hour service and which require ordering before a certain hour to keep from being disappointed. 

One great thing about this hotel is that it is right around the corner from the finish line of the London Marathon, which is at Buckingham Palace. So, if you are looking for a hotel in close proximity to the London Marathon finish & Buckingham Palace, this is the place for you. All in all this was an awesome experience and we would stay here again.",5,2016,05,21
121,2 Night Stay In London,"We booked 2 rooms at St James Court for my parents, my wife & myself.  Location was perfect for us. Less than 10 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace & St James Park.  The service & staff were excellent. Always friendly, efficient, & professional.  The food in Bristro 51 was excellent. Staff there were very accomodating when we were 30 minutes later than planned for our booked table at lunch (due a previous engagement running later than planned).  My parents are both in their 80s. Everyone at the hotel showed them every patience & courtesy.  A brilliant stay, & a big thank you to everyone at St James' Court.",5,2016,05,21
121,A good official stay,We a business team resided at Taj hotel for 04 days. Liked the services and amenities. Rooms are smaller than usual. It is good for family visitors. No attached bathrooms... where my room was... breakfasts selections were limited in comparison to other same standard hotels.,4,2016,05,21
121,"Lovely Hotel, Terrible Breakfast","Following an invite to the Queens Garden Party on 17/05/16 we decided to stay at the St James Court for a treat and due to its close proximity to Buckingham Palace. I had previously checked to ensure that our room would've ready at 2pm, as we needed to get changed into our posh gear and head to the palace for 3pm. However, on arrival we were informed that our room was not ready, and would not likely be until 2:30 or later. We were invited to sit in reception area until the room was ready, but we're not even offered a cup of coffee for our inconvenience. Finally at approx 2:40pm we were given the key to our room and to be fair the room was lovely. After very hurried preparations we made it to the palace at about 3:30pm. Following a good nights sleep we descended to the breakfast room, where we had to wait for a table for 10mins, and were served by a young lady whose attitutude left a lot to be desired, especially when she had 'words' with another waitress in front of all the guests! The breakfast consisted of a very mediocre buffet selection, with an average quality of ingredients. It should be noted that St James Courts offers one of the most expensive breakfasts in central London at approximately £25 each, and I had expected it to be freshly cooked to order for this price, what a disappointment. 
In summary, would I stay here again? Well yes I would. The late room availability was an inconvenience, but the breakfast was inexcusable, so I would stay again but would not include breakfast in my room rate, instead I would go out to one of the local cafes where you get much better quality and much better service.",3,2016,05,21
121,Stephanie Barker,Stunning hotel! The staff were so helpful and lovely. They made an extra fuss of me and upgraded us because it was my birthday which made it really special. Would highly recommend this hotel we loved our stay here.,5,2016,05,21
121,Sta James Taj,"Great Hotel near everything. Staff were all very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was very good and the bar area verympleasant..Close to good restaurants,Underground and Buckingham Palace. I would recommend this hotel to those visiting London.",5,2016,05,21
121,Very average particularly for the price,"I stayed here as part of a business trip.  

Pros: The hotel is nicely located near Buckingham palace, close to the tube stations and in what seemed to be a very safe area.  The rooms were a good size and the beds, pillows and linens were extremely comfortable.

Cons: it was quite dishevelled in places, scuff marks on walls etc.  The shower was over the bath and I nearly fell at least twice trying to get in and out of the shower.  Staff service levels were inconsistent, with some staff (particularly at breakfast) seemingly oblivious to the guests.  After having to queue for a table at breakfast there was no explanation of what could be ordered versus what was included in the room rate, and it was only through seeing colleagues order other food than the positively revolting scrambled eggs from the breakfast buffet that we realised that we could order other options.

For this price bracket, I have stayed in a lot better.  The hotel lacked the level of polish I would expect for what I paid.",3,2016,05,20
121,Lovely break,Beautiful hotel and front of house staff all really friendly and helpful. Room was a bit dated so considering the stars was a bit disappointing to be honest. Booked the Alice and wonderland afternoon tea and because of my allergies I had a 20 min conversation with phone staff about sandwiches only to find it hadn't been passed on and tried explaining again. However they come out totally wrong so I couldn't eat any of them I am not sure how hard no butter or mayonnaise really is. It's the little details that make a break and feeling like you wasted your time doesn't help,4,2016,05,20
121,Wonderful,"Wonderful hotel.  Nice older style rooms.  Great service. Staff is quite good.  The beds were very comfortable. Close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Parliament.  You can walk to all these places and a number of very good pubs.  Tube within easy walk.  We stayed last year and decided this was the place to go to again.",5,2016,05,20
121,"Very smart public areas, great location","We stayed as we were attending a garden party at Buckingham Palace so the location was perfect.  The public areas are opulent and the service is very good overall (the doormen are excellent).  Our room was well appointed but tired. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a four-piece suite and red marble floor and surfaces. The safe was too small for a laptop.  Our top floor room had a dual aspect and a window in the bathroom - which was nice, being unusual in hotels. From one window we had a glimpse of Big Ben. From the other side, it overlooked a school which was (understandably) noisy during the day and earl evening - so not good for long distance travellers but ok for us.",4,2016,05,20
121,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is situated very close to Buckingham palace and easy walking distance to Victoria and Green Park. Staff very pleasant and helpful.Stayed for 4 nights.  Could not have been bettered. It is simply the best hotel I have stayed in, when in London.",5,2016,05,20
121,Taj St. James Court,Beautiful Hotel in an Excellent location! Room was very spacious by European Standards. The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating! I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London!,5,2016,05,19
121,Long & Lovely Stay at St james - Taj,"We had traveled to London for leisure and stayed in St James for 7 days. Excellent location and walking distance from many attractions including Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey etc. We had a lovely stay. The staff is very friendly and attend to your needs immediately.",4,2016,05,18
121,Beautiful Historic Hotel. Great Location.,"We stayed at the St. James Court for four nights. It was the perfect location for our first trip to London as it is within easy walking distance of all of the standard ""first-timer"" attractions - Buckingham, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, the London Eye. Every staff person we encountered was very helpful, friendly, accommodating and patient with our tourist questions. :-) The staff that works in the bar were particularly kind and helpful. This is an absolutely beautiful hotel and sitting in the courtyard in the evenings is so nice. We even had dinner out there one night. 

We were in Europe celebrating our wedding anniversary and since the hotel knew this, they sent a beautiful anniversary dessert to our room. 

A few negatives, but nothing to go crazy about: The hotel wifi did not work at all on my iphone 6s (AT&T is my carrier) so I had to use my very expensive data to access any of my apps. The water pot in the room intended to heat water to make the instant coffee or tea didn't seem to work. It's on me that I didn't call down and ask for a new one, but honestly, I didn't feel like dealing with a hotel employee in our room first thing in the morning and by the time we were back from our outings each day, I'd forgotten. I did discover that it is virtually impossible to find a cup of coffee in the neighborhood any time before 7 am. The hotel did provide us with power adapters, although there aren't outlets in the bathrooms and only two in the room, but we worked it out.

This truly was the perfect hotel for our first days in London. I will certainly recommend it as an option for anyone I know who is travelling to London.",5,2016,05,18
121,"Friendly staff, clean hotel.",This hotel is lovely.  It is so clean and nothing was a problem to the staff. They were so attentive and courteous whether it was bar staff or restaurant staff or desk staff.  We made an advance booking and got a good price.  It is so near Buckingham palace and St James Park.  Also tubes are within a few minutes walk.  We decided to walk most places but we got a lovely river cruise from Tower of London back to Westminster.,5,2016,05,18
121,Night stop London,This is a home from home and a favoured place to stay when we are in London. The rooms are very comfortable and service levels are what you would expect from the Taj group - It is the attention to detail that makes this hotel the place to stay for us. ,5,2016,05,18
121,Taj understands the service differentiator!,"Some hotel chains claiming to be luxury brands are often let down by the service levels offered. By that I mean that the staff haven't had it instilled into them that EVERY guest deserves the very best, most friendly experience. Some hotels consider professionalism to equal a cold and precise form of communication. My experience of service of the very highest levels has been with Four Seasons hotels, it's a high standard for any other hotel chain to meet. To this end I'm often disappointed with Hilton, Marriott and other brands whose staff don't seem to get it, that being a little 'human' can make all the difference, remembering from the rich and famous, to the person who frankly is lucky to be there (me) the experience should be unforgettable, after all who ever they are they're paying to have a fabulous time. I'm really pleased to say that I've found a hotel in the Taj that understands the latter and thanks to them my wife's 50th birthday experience was a truly memorable occasion! I'll not hesitate to recommend this hotel or indeed revisit. Highly recommended!",5,2016,05,17
121,Excellent Location,There is not a location more centrally located in all of London.  Service is amazing and the courtyard is an excellent place to enjoy a glass of wine and a snack after site seeing in London.  The beds were very comfortable and made for a very relaxing and enjoyable holiday in London,5,2016,05,17
121,great location,"Very close to the tube station and the historic area 
The room was small but clean and the staff were friendly 
Also , room service was good and you can enjoy a really good breakfast 
i am not sure about the wifi. I was in the go so i just came to sleep",4,2016,05,17
121,Short trip,"Fell short of what other Taj properties offered.  Old property, slow service, lack of communication.  Common Taj you could do better.  Housekeeping, room service and in restaurant service took long to arrive.  Cleanliness not up to the mark.",3,2016,05,17
121,A few hiccups but a good stay.,"A good hotel close to most amenities, shops and tourist spots.
Check in was prompt.  Our room was a considerable walk from the lifts.  We had to ask for a few things to be fixed in the room such as the light over the luggage area,  one of the curtains didn't open or close properly, one of the phones in the room didn't work and the faucet in the bathroom was loose.  All were fix except for the curtain on the second or third day of our stay.  The bathroom was a good size. The room as clean and functional but a little tired.  Still it was a good size and better than some we have stayed in, in London. 
We did notice that the carpets in the area around the lifts on the guest room floors wasn't vacuumed often if at all. Some one had dropped a capsule tablet which has been stepped on and it was there from the start of our  stay till the end of our stay (4days).  Also noticed that the walls around the same area could do with a bit of a good clean as there was dirty run marks.  We did mention this to staff but were met with a dull stare.",4,2016,05,16
121,Excellent as ever,Another relaxing and pleasant stay during a business trip. Would personally prefer a room higher and away from Air con in the centre but still not a great issue.(Take ear plugs in case) Breakfast was excellent with a wide range of European and Indian cuisine.,5,2016,05,16
121,Lovely classy hotel,"A classy hotel in a great location, just down the block from Buckingham Palace, and within walking distance of many important London museums and the wonderful St. James Park.  Deluxe service, bathrooms, rooms, and a beautiful inner courtyard for cocktails and meals.  All in an historic building. Highly recommended",5,2016,05,16
121,Good stay in the heart of London.,"Excellent location near Parliament and Westminster Abbey, great historical  building, helpfully staff. Only that was to wait in the queue for the breakfast and the breakfast could have more choice. Some rooms quite distant from the lift.",4,2016,05,16
121,Good location; horrible hotel,"I have been traveling for many years and have stayed in many star hotels including the ones owned by Taj group. This is by far the worst business hotel I have stayed in. Period. The hotel is located in central London next to palace and the sad part is that this hotel resembles a haunted house not a palace . The hotel is Old . The common area carpets are so old that they look miserable.  I got a room that was one of the smallest room I have stayed in a star hotel. The room had a vies of water pipes and cable lines. The door paintings were aging and the whole room took me to 1970s. The flies in the room made my stay even pleasant. I gave a call to front-desk and the team never showed-up. I chased flies and finally killed them myself :(  . Pictures attached . The room service food was very very ordinary.  The brand Taj means hospitality and luxury in India. I stayed in Taj in India several times and was a inner circle member before I moved to US. I booked this hotel just because of the brand Taj and the perception I had  about them. St james Court is good enough to erode the brand equity that Taj has built over decades. Hotel management  - Please pull-up your socks, drive renovations and stop putting customers in such horrible rooms. Breakfast was ordinary and the Wi-Fi speed was below standard.",1,2016,05,15
121,Outstanding!,Outstanding service from staff from the moment we arrived . Our suite was spacious and pristine and had everything you could imagine for your trip . Peaceful sitting outside with a drink in the sun in the courtyard.,5,2016,05,15
121,Very nice location,"We stayed at week at the Taj. The concierge staff are great and very helpful with tickets and dinner reservations. The location is excellent. The rooms are great and comfortable. We had a small kitchen that had some issues but we resolved most of them. The inner courtyard is beautiful  and very comfortable. 
Would recommend ",4,2016,05,15
121,Horrible Experience,"This was the worst experience we have had. To start off we had requested a quiet room. We where placed in a room that had a school yard of about 150 kids playing soccer and screaming while playing. We immediately went down to change rooms. Took them about 20 minutes to find us another room. We moved to the new room. It was 2 rooms down from the first room so you simply had to look left out the window to see the kids playing soccer. Was just as loud. We again went down to change our room. Took 30 minutes and they moved us to a room that was further away and we gave up as we could hear the kids but was not as bad as being directly on top of them. The first room we didn't realize the noise until after we had completely unpacked so we had to pack our stuff up and move to 2nd room. The next time we checked it out and didn't have to repack. This was only the beginning of our extravaganza. No hot water. Barely got warm enough to take a shower, concierge had no clue as everything we asked them they simply looked up on google. This includes restaurants, shops, land tours, boat tours etc. My wife asked them where we could get a nice wool scarf and they sent us on a very long journey to a location to buy the the actual material so we could then make the scarf.... Hmmmmm.  Room was very dusty. Not good cleaners. They had no info on other restaurants but there own. Everything in the room was dirty and not fixed. Everything including outlets, doors, sink, bed, carpet, all old and dirty. There was only one outlet that actually worked. The rest of them where broken. DON'T SAY HERE!",1,2016,05,13
121,An experience to remember and come back for more.,Perfect location for business or leisure with exceptional qualities in all areas of hotel management and housekeeping. You receive what you pay for - quality of the highest standard. If there are any complaints with this hotel then you would have to look first at the type who are complaining.,5,2016,05,13
121,Excellent Hotel Close to the Mall & Buckingham Palace,"Having stayed at this hotel on Business in London during a major sporting event which we were working on. I found the hotel of an exceptional high standard, the resturant offered an excellent selection & the suites were superb. The staff were very helpful, the hotel is very clean & the suroundings outstanding. Just trying to save enough money for a return stay with my family as I hope one day I will achieve my dream, bring my wife & children to stay at this hotel. Hopefully I will achieve the dream one day & be lucky for a return visit.",5,2016,05,12
121,Small noisy room .,"On the whole The Taj was a wonderful experience .The staff were friendly and helpful .The room my daughter and I had a very small bed .It was very clean and tidy but there was noise from deliveries through the night and from a nearby school .The breakfast was adequate but hash browns out of a packet ,tinned mushrooms ,no tomatoes ,no poached eggs.Breakfasts in this establishment should be as first class as everything else",4,2016,05,11
121,Solo Traveler,"My room was the last one at the end of the hallway.  There was a set of short stairs leading to the hallway toward my room.  I have some mobility and balance issues.  There was no railing on either side of those stairs.  I had to hold onto each side of the walls so I would not fall.  For safety's sake, I would recommend that there be rails -they could be decorative, made of wood - placed at that location.",5,2016,05,11
121,Amaze balls,"This hotel I highly recommend- attentive staff, great service, great room....can't fault it at all! Cocktails at the bar were amazing!
The location was great also for site seeing, right near Buckingham palace..",5,2016,05,11
121,"St James Court, London",Excellent location right in the centre of all major attractions Great Service Very helpful staff Walking distance to tube and bus stops Can take steps to educate the guest of all facilities available on site specially the outdoor restaraunt and spa at the back in the Taj Residencec and Suites,4,2016,05,11
121,Great comfoatable hotel,"I stayed here with my wife for our first stay in London. We were surprised at the high-class and at the same time relaxing atmosphere. The room (we stayed at a classic double-bed room) was large and clean, and had a comfortable bed. The only, little concern was a unique scent in the closet (perhaps because of the glue?). The location seemed between Victoria and St. James Park tube station of District/Circle line, but I felt it's much easier to walk to St. James Park station especially when we have a suitcase considering the road condition. We haven't tried the famous restaurants of this hotel, so we'd like to use them at the next stay.",5,2016,05,10
121,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for 2 Nights. Got a small room, almost overlooking the courtyard. The room was clean and silent. But very small bed. Very good location for walking around the parks in London. And only a few minutes walk from Victoria Station.  Nice staff and very good breakfast.",4,2016,05,09
121,A HOTEL WITH GREAT LOCATION AND COMFORT,"Having been impressed with the hotel on a business trip to the Capital I brought the grand children for a treat. I was not disappointed. The location, the service, the ambience, the quality of the food is excellent. Afternoon tea is especially recommended.",5,2016,05,09
121,Business traveller,Good value for money and good location. Helpful personnel on front deck as well in breakfast room. Room was clean with full equipment's. Good restaurants near by and quiet location. Park was nearby also only 25 minutes walk to centrum of London.,4,2016,05,09
121,Taj Hotels,Not to be missed- this hotel offers superb service and high quality food and accommodation. Easy to reach location (near Buckingham Palace!) From the impressive lobby and great check in staff to the stylish bedrooms (and suites in Taj 51) and varied bar and restaurant locations they offer something for all tastes and budgets. A hidden secret in South West London.,5,2016,05,09
121,Great hotel property and excellent staff,"Excellent property and a very courteous staff. Fantastic location, close to everything in Central London.  The hotel upgraded us to a largest category in our booked category and it was a huge room with all amenities and very comfortable, apart from noise in the morning from a school at the back. But despite of that, a great stay!",5,2016,05,09
121,Junior Suite,Stayed at the Junior Suite for 6 gorgeous nights and it was fabulous.  Every detail attended to.  Even sent us breakfast when we missed our first morning due to time change.  The British certainly know the meaning of service.,5,2016,05,08
121,Recent 5 day stay in London,"Never knowing what a new Hotel will be like, We were quite surprised at the great service and accommodations we received at the St James Court in London. From the first person we met when arriving at the check in desk (Arianna) to the Concierge (Gergo), I wonder how I have been missing this hotel for year on my visits to London. I know we will never stay anywhere else. It was like being home with the great attitudes and personal service that we received. Also credit to the room housekeeper who kept everything in PERFECT condition. If you travel to London and don't stay at the St James Court, I feel you missed out on something special.",5,2016,05,08
121,Excellent,"We spent a week here. A faulty fire alarm caused us to change rooms part way through. Although inconvenient, the staff handled the change with the minimum of fuss. And our new room was even better than the last.
The bedding was changed every day and all the staff very helpful.
We like to walk so the location was ideal: a block from Buckingham Palace, a 30 min walk to the TKTS office and most theaters, 2 minutes to shopping and eating.
Our rooms overlooked the lovely interior courtyard, a great place to sit, and made for a very quiet night.",5,2016,05,07
121,Superb service,"Had an afternoon meeting in their Executive Board Room.  We had superbly attentive yet discrete service, and the venue worked perfectly. The lunch was great, and the snacks throughout the day were tasty. A great venue. ",5,2016,05,06
121,Taij Hotel Group Experience,Convenient for Mayfair and surrounds Decour and ambience is stylish. Very friendly and attentive service Met all of our expectations. Afternoon tea is a delight with so many interesting teas to choose from Would certainly visit again,5,2016,05,06
121,Too expensive - tricky ways to get customers money,"We paid a lot for a classic room but expected something very special. At booking we asked for a quite room. When we arrived the receptionist told us she wanted to show us three different rooms. Nice. The first room was a Suite which would cost us 50 GBP per night in addition to our already expensive paid room. The 2nd room would cost us 25 GBP in addition and finally she showed us the classic room we booked and told us that there where from 8.30 to 18.00 screaming teenager outside and all classic rooms where like that. We considered that as a rip-off because we had asked for a QUITE room and finally took the Executive with 25 GBP per night in addition.
When checking-in I told we have our aniversary here in this hotel but we did not get ANYTHING extra. Somebody wrote here in the board what they got and it might be a friend of the GM.
The bed in the executive room was as historical as the hotel itsself : broken bed matrasses. The receptionist tried to help us as much they could.
The staff was very nice and the breakfast was also good.
Outside in the garden there is a nice smoking area with even heaters for the cold time.
Back to the room : The TV is a little bit to small, the shaving mirror looked expensive but where no help for shaving. the windows did not keep any sound away from the street, they were just in a bad old and cheap condition. The Wifi is fine. A toilet brush is missing (who can save here ???). On the floor you have all day the smell of the kitchen which is connected by steps to the ground floor.
Some restaurants in the hotel show their prices but some do not show any price as if they are ashamed. The Bistro 51 showed the prices and so we ate their once and it was good.
I think the problem of the hotel is the managment :
- High prices but they try to get more money because your classic rooms are unacceptable - maybe only for deaf guests. 
Matrasses in a bad condition and for the money you charge you should invest something too.
The called king size bed wasn´t one because it were two beds pushed together.
PROMISES PROMISES BUT YOU DID NOT KEEP.

For that price you get better hotel rooms in London.",3,2016,05,06
121,JUST PERFECT,"St. James Court is a haven in the middle of London.  I had the pleasure of staying for 4 nights in March.  My room was so comfortable, the service from Front Office staff was excellent and the Concierge Staff helped with all my questions.   I would recommended this hotel for anyone who wants a little piece of heaven in the middle of busy London.  Buckingham Palace is a short walk as is Victoria Station and St James Park Tube is close by too.",5,2016,05,05
121,Very good hotel incentral London,This is a superb hotel in great a position just near Buckingham Palace. Very large but quite opulent in style taking Indian design cues from it chain owner Taj hotels. The staff were exemplary in their manner and we could not have been better attended too.,5,2016,05,05
121,Awesome hotel,Hi my name is harsh.

121,English Beauty,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Taj- we had a beautiful room with plenty of space and a lovely outlook over the courtyard which was amassed with mauve flowers - very beautiful. The restaurant served excellent high quality food that was beautifully presented. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly, helpful staff.",5,2016,05,05
121,Lovely Hotel. Caring Staff,"My wife and I arrived for the May bank holiday weekend as a treat for her birthday.
We were shown to our room and were disappointed as it was quite dark and dingy, overlooking the main road, where roadworks and scaffolding was the vista.
Upon complaining to reception, we were offered to upgrade to a suite for an extra £25 per night, which we accepted.  

The suite was delightful, overlooking the beautiful courtyard.  Most important was the willingness of staff to accommodate our desires, and as a result, we had a most memorable weekend.

There was a Jazz Band in the evening, adding to the magic of our stay, and we found all of the staff to be polite and helpful.

Thank you all.",4,2016,05,04
121,Taj Hotel Buckingham Gate,"Meets expectations & exceeds them.  This hotel is so good the wife insists on staying in the Taj - in Mumabi for a week.  Lets hope we have the same experience - exemplary service, great location and food.",5,2016,05,04
121,A brilliant find at reasonable prices,We stayed for 4 nights.  The hotel is fabulous with a boutique atmosphere.  The reception and bar areas are great.  We had a great room which was large and well maintained although we had to ask for a change as our initial room overlooked a school playground which was very noisy.  The location is less than 500 yards from Buckingham Palace and a 5 minute walk to the nearest tube station.  The service was attentive and welcoming.  Highly recommended.,5,2016,05,04
121,Best Place to Stay in London,"Wonderful experience with Buckingham Palace, the Tube and all the wonderful sites of London easily accessible.  Top notch hotel with Old World charm but all the modern ammenities.  One in a million experience!!",5,2016,05,03
121,hotel taj  london,"quite unassuming as you approach,,once inside ,just quality,very experienced staff.very nice touch is wall garden through gateway on side,and courtyard beyond.So peaceful,especially early morning,Yeh!",5,2016,05,02
121,Nice hotel in London,"I stayed here for the London Marathon.  Great location.  Very close to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Street.  Plenty of restaurants nearby.  I mostly ate at the hotel and the food there was very good.  The bar is not particularly comfortable to sit at, but the bartenders (Adrian in particular) were fun to chat with.  I found all of the staff to be friendly and accommodating, which made it an easy place to stay.  The concierge helped me out a few times too.  My room was great.  The hallways were a bit convoluted to get through but my room was very private and quiet.  I enjoyed my stay here.  I would go back.",4,2016,05,01
121,Short Businesstrip to London,"this hotel ist verry god sutuated i the centre of London, only few minutes to the underground; verry kindly staff,; I really can recommed this hotel; wellness is not so god, but was enough for me, breakfast was  really god,",5,2016,05,01
121,okay but not worth the price,"the st james is okay but overpriced. i have stayed there 3 times.(not by choice) each time my room got worst. this last time it was rather small,as was the bathroom, which looked like it needed some TLC had a well used look to it.(which isn't good) breakfast was good, service was okay. overall for the rating and price i expected something special,got an average hotel (again not good)",3,2016,05,01
121,"Bad room, good hotel",Bad room - plumbing was not working - badly placed switches and general look and feel of the room not upto the mark. The hotel exterior and inner surroundings were pretty good and classy. They serve Indian breakfast - so if you get tired of the english stuff this is the place to be.,4,2016,04,30
121,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location.","The loveliest London hotel I have stayed in, the staff are warm and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble plus the restaurant is excellent, the lobster sharing platter a must!
Location wise this hotel is perfect for Buckingham Palace amongst other sites.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend a visit, such a beautiful building too, architecturally stunning.",5,2016,04,29
121,Very nice Taj,"Nice Indian hotel in London - with cool painted elephants.
I was confused and dazed as I left due to a heavy night of drinking. So much so that I found the corridors hard to navigate but luckily there was a sofa which I rested on.
Great location and keep an eye out for mega deals!",4,2016,04,29
121,excellent option to be in london,this hotel offers you both aspects location and magnificent price/value ratio besides all other important characteristics that a traveler is looking for.  I really recommend it to all that need to get London and be in the middle of everything.,4,2016,04,28
121,Old not well maintained hotel,"Old furniture, not well maintained hotel.  Terrible reception staff. The room curtains were dirty and ripped out, they did not close well.  The bed was terrible old and full of bumps.  The wood decorations inside the bathroom were broken.  It is not worth the money.",1,2016,04,27
121,Disappointed,"My family booked a stay at the St. James Court, A Taj Hotel in hopes of having a nice stay in a good location in London. Unfortunately, the hotel was the one negative part of our trip. Upon arrival, we were given our room, a classic double. Once leaving the lobby, the standards drop dramatically with old wood hallways with chipped paint everywhere and stained carpets and walls. Once we got to our room we were greeted by another guest who was already in our room, an embarrassing moment for both of us. We returned to the lobby to get our correct room and had to wait 15-20 minutes just to get a new room (with no apology issued by the manager). The bed in our room was very small and the lights in the room would not work until after trying for 15 minutes every time as well as the plugs not providing sufficient electricity (my mother could not blow dry her hair). All of these issues are not terrible things but added together made for a difficult stay that a world brand like Taj Hotels should be very disappointed in.",2,2016,04,27
121,Wonderful Stay,"A rare experience to find such perfect combination of attentive, friendly and knowledgeable service.  The staff from every aspect of the hotel seemed to be everywhere, but never intruding - like they read you mind about when to step forward to offer service. The location is on a quiet street but in a great location for walking to the major tourist and monument areas. I have stayed in several of the big-name properties in London, but none better than St. James Court.",5,2016,04,27
121,"St. James Court, a Taj Hotel is THE place to stay in London","The location, accommodation, amenities, are fantastic.  The location is especially good for access to the London Underground, walking to Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, Westminster Abbey.  The staff are all very customer oriented, professional.  I return every year when I come to London for the London Marathon",5,2016,04,27
121,Excelent value,"Most courtiouss and effcient hotel I have stayed at in all my travels.  Very well situated with respect to the tourist center, subways and Victoria Station.  The rooms are clean, quiet and large enough given the typical size of rooms in London.  The building is a gourgious landmark structure with a very nice and peaceful interior patio.",5,2016,04,27
121,Not as expected ,Booked a very special weekend. Booked a 'classic' room. Standards in the room were poor for what you would expect with paint chipping off the door frames and the frame needing repair. For £250 a night could've got better from a holiday inn. Not what we expected. Staff were great and sorted a replacement room. But the 'classic' rooms need a lot of work. ,3,2016,04,26
121,Fantastic stay,"Our second visit to this hotel. Staff were excellent and really made our stay. Breakfast plentiful, with a good choice. Bed and pillows really comfortable. Afternoon tea at Kona restaurant was fantastic. So much more than we expected. This will be our hotel of choice for our next trip to London.",5,2016,04,26
121,excellent hotel,"lovely location, great rooms, good food, great experience, would recommend this hotel to any one visiting London both for business or holiday. the staff is always smiling and willing to help, the service at the cafe n restaurants are outstanding.",4,2016,04,26
121,"Faultless, again.","We have stayed here 3 times this year and the standard is excellent, in every department. The reception staff are genuinely friendly as well as efficient and our room was a real treat after a long, tiring day. The cleanliness and service are notably high for such a large hotel. We will be back.",5,2016,04,26
121,"High quality, friendly hotel in central London","I have stayed at the Taj's St Jame's Court Hotel, near Buckingham Palace, on numerous occasions.  It has bags of character, is of high quality and is ideally located, all good features.  However, what really makes it, for me, is the warm, sincere and friendly approach of all of the staff - they genuinely cannot do enough to make your stay enjoyable.  Very highly recommended!",5,2016,04,26
121,Wonderful!,"Stayed 1 night on an Alice in Wonderland Afternoon Tea package with my 2 daughters.
Arrived at hotel and were promptly checked in with a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful apartment.Lovely room with everything you'd expect at a 5* hotel. Staff all extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Afternoon tea was the prettiest, most delicious treat with plenty of everything, and as many fresh pots of tea as we could manage. Surroundings were beautiful; the decor here is stunning. Cocktails in the Hamptons Bar later were very good, with a decent bar menu if you only wanted something light after such a generous afternoon tea. Hotel location very central, but quiet at night if you rely on a good night's sleep.
Breakfast menu had a very good range of choice, but service was a very slow. We mentioned this at checking out and the manager kindly adjusted our bill.
Overall, this is a beautiful place to stay in London, we will definitely return!",5,2016,04,24
121,Lovely hotel !,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights for a combination of business and pleasure. We booked the master suite and were not disappointed with the space and comfort. The reservation dept were wonderful in booking this for us and check in was a breeze. Most of the staff were very friendly and attentive apart from some of the doormen and concierges!. Being the first point of contact when arriving and last point when going out, one would have expected at least a smile rather than a scowl ! ... Infact this rather put me off staying again ! . However, maybe it was a bad week and everyone has off days !!! ... Breakfasts good and restaurants offer a wide selection of food . If you ignore the a couple of the doormen and one of the concierges then you will be more than pleased with this lovely hotel",4,2016,04,22
121,"excellent, as always","I've stayed several times at the Taj and always enjoyed the experience. Very friendly, helpful staff; comfortable rooms with all the amenities you need, wi-fi that works!; good food, good location, and a pianist in the lobby - what more could you ask for?",5,2016,04,21
121,Just Perfect,"I have stayed at the Taj St James a few times now and it is always perfect.  The staff are so welcoming, friendly and efficient and the hotel and grounds are beautiful.  This is always my first choice of hotel when staying in London.",5,2016,04,21
121,Great hotel!,"Great hotel with excellent amenities. Love the location! so convenient!

All staff that we came in contact with were very professional and friendly. 

The rooms - could not fault them.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2016,04,21
121,Excellent hotel close to Buckingham palace,"This is an old property renovated and made to Taj standards. May be due to this some aspects does not equal new hotels of Taj. Long corridors, old noisy lift etc are some of the problems noticed. However it was a great experience to stay in this magnificent ancient property",4,2016,04,20
121,Excellent hotel and location,"Excellent hotel in great central location.  Very good facilities in hotel itself (bar area etc) and very close to St James's and Victoria tube stations, close to great restaurants and bars.  Friendly staff",5,2016,04,20
121,Royal treatment near Buckingham Palace,"Beautiful hotel with matching service, this hotel is located in a central place with easy access to buses, underground and of course taxis. Victoria Street is a 3-minute walk away, with many local pubs just around the corner. Very classy place and very comfortable well-spaced rooms.",5,2016,04,19
121,SO disappointed in customer service,"I used to absolutely adore this hotel. But imagine my disappointment when I visited my bank earlier today to discover the hotel had pre-authorised full cost of my stay and not released it! This despite my paying in full on checkout! So invariably they have charged me twice. Despite a number of communications from me not a response from the Taj. I shall never return, even when my monies are returned. :-( Very disappointed. You must must mange your financial matters swiftly.",1,2016,04,19
121,I will return,"Excellent service, staff and amenities.  Great location and easy access to all the sites that London has to offer.  Restaurant variety added to the quality of the stay.  If I return again, I would choose this hotel first if available.   A classic hotel with all the upgrades you would need.",5,2016,04,19
121,"Great service, amenities & location","Stayed at the St James of a couple of days at the end of a travelling holiday, very good service & reasonable size modern rooms. Whilst the location suited our purpose it is very well located to access London central and various other worthwhile locations by foot, St James & Victoria station a few hundred meters away. would recommend this hotel to freinds",5,2016,04,19
121,Birthday trip ,"I've given this review 3 stars, this is mostly based on the service we received from Rukmini on reception, who saved what was looking like a disappointing stay. Having stayed in several luxury hotels in London, this hotel has been on my list for a while. We booked an executive double and on entering our room I can only say we were extremely disappointed. Our 'courtyard or Westminster view' was of a brick wall and on looking at the gallery I'm sure we were placed in a classic double and not the executive we had booked. The bathroom was so small and the room was dated and tired looking. My partner went down to reception and we can only describe Rukmini's service as excellent. We looked at 3 more rooms and settled on one we felt definitely reflected the price we paid and the 'executive' feel. We were much happier with this room, it was spacious and brighter with a great view. 

The location is great, not far from Westminster Abbey and Big Ben so was good for sightseeing. Unfortunately we won't be returning to stay again. ",3,2016,04,18
121,Amazing Hotel in a lovely central location,Arrived on Friday afternoon to be greeted straight from the taxi.  A lovely welcome from the concierge and the check-in staff.  The room was lovely and very spacious with everything we needed.  We spent most of the time sightseeing and popping back to the hotel.  Breakfast lovely with a great selection of continental and full English.  Afternoon tea well recommended but don't eat a thing before you go!  Lovely attentive staff who couldn't do enough for us during our stay.,5,2016,04,18
121,Classy,I would not describe this hotel as average. We had a huge room with a bath - yes it was traditionally furnished not contemporary but was still smart. Super king bed which was so comfortable with lovely duvet. Huge fluffy towels. Great view over courtyard. Very quiet room just a few footsteps above. Had a drink in The Hamptons where staff were very attentive - we had to decline third bowl of nuts! And then amazing meal at The Bank. Location very handy - a few mins to tube. There was a knack to wifi - you had to get to a page where you choose which sort you wanted rather than just connect in settings. I enjoyed my stay immensely but did not try breakfast on this occasion.,5,2016,04,18
121,Excellent location,"A very well placed hotel in Westminster. Staff are excellent and can't do enough for you. Some of the rooms whilst comfortable, required some TLC. The elevator was very slow and small, which is not good when you are on the 8th floor. Gym was very good, and food excellent. On the whole I would recommend if this ticks your location box.",4,2016,04,18
121,Normal and average hotel,"Staff are friendly but not helpful if you have  any problem! 
The rooms are big and ordinary, but need to be renovated, furniture too old but at least clean .
Internet connection you can forget it ! Most of the guests have a problem with wifi connection. 
Breakfast no variety , and if you get late at 9:30 maybe you will miss the breakfast:) 

Over all the prose for 8 night including breakfast was reasonable 

",3,2016,04,17
121,Would come back here again,"Stayed here on a weekend. The check-in was quick and as we came early and the room was not ready, we went to the bar for some drinks and snacks. The cocktail i ordered was alright- I've had better but the Indian platter was lovely
The room- we had a king room- was big and the bed was nice and comfortable. The tv was in a weird place. It was on the side next to the wall and a bit small and far from our view. 
Toiletries were available but for some of it you have to ask housekeeping if you need it i.e toothbrush, sanitary towels, etc. That was a first for me as they would normally be available for use. It was alright as we also borrowed an iphone charger as we left ours. 
Staff was accomodating and helpful. 
I would not mind coming back here.",4,2016,04,17
121,Stay at the Taj in London,This was our first trip to London and we loved the location of the Taj. It was easy to get to from the St James tube station. Near to Buckingham Palace and other attractions. Concierge staff were very helpful and informative. The morning breakfast was of great value.,5,2016,04,16
121,A well run gem,"Experienced a wonderful overnight stay - with afternoon tea.
The staff were friendly, courteous, efficient and well organised.The room was very large, with a separate work area, two flat screen TV`s and a lovely bathroom. The hotel`s location was ideal for walking, sightseeing or access to public transport.
The afternon tea was a delight - but tooooooo much food!!!!
A ""hidden"" gem.",5,2016,04,15
121,Special Magical Stay,"This hotel was perfect for our stay in London! Check in was very smooth and my daughters loved their Taj backpacks filled with goodies! They were spoiled further when we arrived back to the room after going to Wicked at the Victoria Apollo ( a short 10 minute walk) There was a knock at the door and a very friendly lady served the girls personalised cookies and smoothies! Such a lovely touch! 
We then got ready for dinner with friends at Kona and ate from the Taster Menu! Each of the 8 courses were meticulously presented and insanely delicious. The service from Yaan was very professional. Every plate served was articulately explained in detail. This helped as the lovely Mount Vernon Sauvignon Blanc was flowing.
The hotel has an excellent location on a quiet road in central Victoria. The family room we had 620, was immaculate and spacious which helps when there are 4 in a room. All staff were very friendly and couldn't help or assist you enough. Having a pre dinner drink in the magical grand courtyard is a must! Fantastic hotel and we can't wait to visit again.",5,2016,04,15
121,Most attentive staff in UK,From the moment we were greeted by the doorman and the helpfulness of Valerie we knew we were in a first rate establishment! On departure the staff was just as helpful as when we arrived. We would have liked to stayed a few more day in this lovely hotel.,5,2016,04,15
121,"Nice hotel, good location","A very nice hotel with friendly staff.
Tucked away in a side street close to Victoria Station this hotel is in a good central location. The rooms are very nice and clean but a little on the small side for the price you pay. Our room only had a shower which was not great due to poor water pressure. 
The breakfast was very nice and the restaurant staff where polite and fast to respond to requests.",4,2016,04,15
121,Had to upgrade!,"When arriving, we were greeted in a polite manner and the staff were extranet helpful!
We were given the keys to our room and first impressions were ok! 
Then we looked at the bathroom which for me is one of the most important things about a hotel. It was awful! I wouldn't of stepped foot into the bath, it was like a cell with horrible Windows and a grubby bath mat and horrible tiles!
We then made our way down to reception and explained what we thought and was told to upgrade to a suite for £35. I got told that some of the rooms still have a classic style where others have been refurbished! (I wouldn't of called this classic)
The new room was lovely and the bathroom was clean, spacious and modern! Just what it shows on the photos!
Location is good and the breakfast was enjoyable!

121,Mad Hatter Afternoon Tea - Perfection,"Booked the mad hatter afternoon tea as a surprise for my Mum and Nan. 
The Afternoon Tea was perfection. A great choice of sandwiches and cakes, scones were perfect. 
It was the best afternoon tea I've had. Everything was perfect and service was exceptional. 
Highly recommend.",5,2016,04,14
121,Stay at St.James Court London,"Clean, luxurious with professional, friendly, and very helpful staffs.  Location is excellent very close to Victoria Street with good access to various bus stops and underground stations.  Some improvements should be made though, quality of the tap water and the pressure of hot water and how to operate the shower which we found little confuding.",4,2016,04,14
121,Superb Property,Spended time with my husband and 2 kids here. clean luxurious spacious rooms. Its the best value for money. we enjoyed here lot. will love to come back and i will definately recommend everyone to visit this property.,5,2016,04,13
121,A Complete Let Down- esp on Taj brand name,It was the worst value for money and worst service. Power outage in central london with the back up failure (??) in the hotel and not an iota of concern or apology or redressal? I have n idea why Tata's bought this and called it Taj. Good property but exteremely poorly managed.,2,2016,04,12
121,Beautiful Hotel with excellent service.,Managed to get a room at a very reasonable price via a hotel website. Then on arrival was upgraded free of charge when I mentioned it was my partner's birthday. Room was lovely with lots of extras. You can not fault the service in all areas of this hotel. Only gripe is the cost of the items you could buy in the room but then it was a treat.,5,2016,04,12
121,Perfect Stay,"Clean, luxurious and quiet place in Westminster. Excellent staff and truly customer-oriented service. Spacious room with wonderful bedding guaranteeing a restful sleep. Very attentive business center. Prompt reaction to all our requests. Perfect stay!",5,2016,04,12
121,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable stay, staff excellent, hotel and Zander bar lovely.  Quilon Restaurant a MUST.  Excellent food and service and great value for money.  A few small issues - most resolved.  Just a little attention to detail needed.",4,2016,04,12
121,A very pleasant stay in a lovely hotel.,"We enjoyed an overnight city break at St James and would definitely return, beautifully decorated, friendly staff, comfortable room and a lovely bar lounge area all added to a very pleasant stay. The Hotel is well placed and very close to Buckingham Palace and other famous landmarks easily accessible on foot.",5,2016,04,12
121,Return,"This was my 6th (I think) visit to the Taj , perfect location for me & staff (mostly) are welcoming.. Was offered availability to upgrade which I did .. The room was ready , which was most welcoming as l had a meeting arranged and needed to freshen up after traveling.. 
Great selection for breakfast although scrambled eggs and beans were 'Luke' warm .. Had dinner on 2nd night and again food not very hot .. Didn't send it back as I'm always nervous as to what they do with it .. 
The housekeeping was excellent and the concierge great as always , receptionist very friendly , waiting staff not so impressive. 
Will definitely return but may try somewhere else for next  months visit .
Very good value for money and would certainly recommend. ",4,2016,04,11
121,"Comfortable, relaxing stay","We made a late decision to book a Sunday night as attending social functions on Sunday and Monday night, combined with Business in London Monday. Very happy with location and checking in - did this early as needed to leave bags before lunch. Room upgrade offered for only £25 so excellent value. Delightful front desk staff. Only small criticism was the firmness of the pillows.",4,2016,04,11
121,Nice Hotel,"In city centre close to Buckingham Palace, good location if you want to explore this are of London on foot. Hotel staff is very friendly bed was comfortable. I stand for one night only this time, but it was great value for money.",4,2016,04,10
121,BE AWARE OF THIS STRUCTURE,"Made reservation by Booking.com and all was fine with reservation.
Our Room was at 6th floor as we requested, and we found also pillows as ordered.
There was a sponge in the bathroom since we arrived (dirty amd with hairs on it) we ask to be removed, they came to do it next day.... this tome they came twice, and forgotten a mobile.... and the sponge.......
today morning, we had a very bad experience, we wake up becuse room was very cold, we realize at 630 am that was NO ELECTRICITY in the room, so we contact  front desk to understand why, they answer that was a failure in all Westminster area, that we understand. We ask for a torch because no light in the bathroom, to get shower and prepair to going to work, never arrived to us, then before exit room light was back, around 830 am but we ask to main desk about if there was an Electricity Generator in the hotel (we are travel agents, and we deal with disable people and with all kind of people, like no speaking english people, or not so young to make 6 floors without elevator) and the answer was HOTEL HAS NO PRIVATE ELECTRICITY GENERATOR, so, in case of no light....... (or any other situation) as happened to us, could be DANGEROUS place if you have in your family a disable, or an old people, please before booking here think about your security!!!!
Electricity went off since 1050 pm day before because an electricity problem in the subway in this area, so i supposed we pass all night without electricity, no emergency light are in the rooms!!!",1,2016,04,08
121,Beautiful Hotel in great location,"We stayed at the St James Taj for one night and secured a very good rate for a standard room.  The room was very clean and quiet, overlooking the courtyard, however, it could have done with a little tlc. The staff were very obliging, nothing was too much trouble.  We dined in Bistro 51 and had an excellent meal.",4,2016,04,08
121,Nice hotel,"I was in this hotel for a week end. It is well located, the staff is nice, the rooms are good, I think the executive ones are far better than the regular ones. It was a good choice for a touristic week end.Only good points.",4,2016,04,08
121,Comfortable and convenient but?.....,Nice comfortable hotel near the Mall and St James park surprisingly large room and a view over a very attractive court yard. Staff very friendly and attentive hotel clean and well decorated. Good breakfast and a nice (if a bit small) bar. I do object though to getting a bill fora very thing like a beer with 12.5% service charge added. Ok you can get it removed but it is a form of blackmail and some people would be inhibited. Do the staff see all of that charge ? Well I would stay again I am sure.,4,2016,04,08
121,Fantastic,"We enjoyed the hotel. Rooms are very spacious and clean, as well as the bathrooms. The location of the hotel is excellent. The personnel was extremely kind. We payed a reasonable price thanks to internet offers. The only problem was that the windows did not close tightly, then there was some noise early in the morning. But I would repeat the experience.",5,2016,04,07
121,Great London Hotel,"A lovely hotel with an excellent courtyard in Westminster just a short walk from St James Park and Victoria stations. It is a beautiful turn of the century mansion building with great facilities and excellent restaurants. We had a wine and dine special dinner in Kona and the food was excellent, served by attentive staff. The very reasonable price included a free bottle of Fleurie.

Our standard room was well equipped, comfortable with everything you need for a really comfortable stay. We will stay again.",5,2016,04,07
121,Wouldn't stay again!!,"I stayed here for one night in room 220 whilst on a training course at the hotel! The room was not cheap on a prepaid rate.  The room was a good size but looked out on the air conditioning unit and brick wall.... Very dark... The whole room was very tired, furniture ancient and beaten up,  generally in very sad condition and I'm afraid not clean.

The bathroom was in much better condition, nice shower etc,.. But  unfortunately the tiled floor was also dirty and I picked up the rubbish left from the last guest.  Not pleasant...... The plus side was the very clean bedding and towels!!!

It's such a shame the rooms let the hotel down because the main areas and the gardens are beautiful...

Going on the follow-up course in July but won't be staying at the hotel.",2,2016,04,06
121,Great experience,"Everything about our stay was good - the location, the people, the food and the room. We enjoyed the quality of the hotel and its relaxed, no fuss atmosphere. We travel regularly to London and will return.",5,2016,04,06
121,The Perfect Hotel,"The hotel is in a perfect location, 2 minutes from Buckingham Palace and 2 minutes from the nearest tube station.  It is easy to get around by taxi as it is so central.  The staff make this hotel special, the level of service is excellent and they cannot do enough to make your stay memorable.  We were in a executive family room which offered great space and accommodation when travelling with a young child.  The hotel is slightly expensive but worth it for a special occasion.",5,2016,04,05
121,good hotel great location,"Got this hotel last minute. Lovely room overlooking courtyard. The room was clean and comfortable with tea and coffee in the room. The location was great, very close to Buckingham palace and all bus routes and walking distance from Victoria station.would definitely recommend.",4,2016,04,04
121,Wonderful!,"Positioned in an excellent location - close to Victoria Station, close to tourist attractions and perfect for an evening stroll to theatres. We stayed one night and had a very pleasant stay after walking to and from The Playhouse Theatre. Our room was excellent - clean, well appointed and very quiet on the whole. All the staff we came into contact with were excellent. The cocktail bar is very relaxing and comfortable. We will definitely stay again when in London. ",5,2016,04,04
121,Weekend stay,"This is a great hotel to stay staff very helpful and friendly.our room was a standard double a good size .Bath room ok did not like shower curtain a lot ,apart from that it was quit room very good nights sleep .Easy walking distance of a lot of attractions ,breakfast not cheap , but nice restaurant just across the road . would definitely stay again .",4,2016,04,04
121,Very good service,Very nice staff . .Not so nice windows in the bathroom. The wind came in so it was cold to take shower.  very nice funitures and nice clean room. Not the last time I have stayed  at this hotel. The location was absolutely perfect.,4,2016,04,04
121,Had a good stay ,Firstly the staff at this hotel are all really wonderful. It was a pleasure staying here. We opted for an executive room and were quite happy with our room. Cannot fault anything with our stay. Thanks for a lovely stay. Great location for walking and getting around London.,4,2016,04,04
121,great hotel,"Just perfect. great location and atmosphere, very clean, High class. worth the price (140 pound per night). But we skip the breakfast as it was too expensive and that was the only disadvantage. enjoy!",5,2016,04,04
121,Great Place to stay in Westminster. ,"This is a great hotel just off Victoria Street. The rooms are excellent, staff very helpful and the dining experience is also really good. 

When in London, as I often am, I chose to stay there. 

Try the various restaurants. They're all great. All have an Indian signature dish available. 

",5,2016,04,03
121,Beautiful place to stay with a great service,"Beautiful place to stay with a great service Warning with the spa - not compatible with the quality of this hotel. The room was OK, but could have been better. Otherwise, the service and the food were excellent ! Good location : between Westminster and Buckhingam",4,2016,04,03
121,Great Location,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone  .The  location is perfect just walk outside the front door and you are a 4 minute walk from Buckingham  Palace,10 minutes Westminister Abby. The Lobby in the evening is welcoming for evening drinks or a bite to eat. The hotel feels very comfortable .",5,2016,04,03
121,Supreme hotel with wonderful courtyard in which to eat outside,"Our room was superior so cost more.  Sometimes you get upgraded when they have apartments free, cool.
All the beds are top quality.  The en suite high quality.
There is a good restaurant on site, world famous plus a small one for breakfast.
We prefer this hotel during wimbledon tennis week as we can access a bus to the ground from nearby Victoria station",5,2016,04,03
121,"A Taj Hotel, Londo",Hotel very well located Excellent value customer service oriented. Spanish-speaking staff that made our stay more enjoyable. Service should review its cleaning rooms since this wing not match the rest of the hotel,4,2016,04,03
121,Just as I imagined,"The hotel succeeded in making a strong impression from the entrance due to both the massive old-style building and the warm welcome of all the staff I met. I had a classic room (not too big) with a double bed. Furniture and bathroom earthenware resembles old style but manages to bring together the modern with a good taste. I had complimentary water, chocolate, tea, coffee, socket adaptor, wifi and so on. For breakfast it's the same warm welcome atmosphere with an accent on english type breakfast with poached eggs, some coconut dishes or spicy jam. I think I've seen only 1 or 2 types of cheese and there are some minor imperfections in the finishing of bathroom ceiling or tiles.",4,2016,04,03
121,The Taj says it all!,"Superb attention to detail,polite & cooperative staff & nice touch remembering my birthday with complimentary cake with candle. Room comfortable with ensuite bath & shower which was modern & clean. Only comment was breakfast was not included & perhaps a little expensive compared to where we live in the South East coast at nearly £24/head!",4,2016,04,02
121,Lovely London hotel,"It is not always easy to find hotels of a very high standard at an acceptable price in London but through an offer with TravelRepublic I found this lovely hotel.  It is impressively decorated and maintained, the staff are very helpful and the room though not huge was very comfortable with all that you could want.  The bathroom was particularly good, being warm and comfortable with a good selection of toiletries, none of your mean tiny bars of soap and little shower gels and shampoos here.  The location is very good being a short walk from St James's Park, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament but being away from main streets the location is quiet.  I ate in one of the restaurants and the food was very good and it was served quickly.",5,2016,04,02
121,"Great location, not the best sleep quality","We stayed for 2 nights after finding a great deal through booking.com. The hotel is in a great location, only 2 minutes walk from St. James's Park station and less than 5 minutes from Buckingham palace. On arrival we were very impressed by the friendly and attentive staff and by the hotel lobby which was very grand. The room itself was a great size and very clean. Downsides were the bed and pillows which we found very hard and left us with sore backs during our stay, the windows also weren't great so there was a lot of noise in the early hours of the morning. The shower was also poor- the water was either scalding hot or freezing cold there was no happy medium.
On the whole we would definitely recommend the hotel in terms of location. Maybe a room towards the back of the hotel would be less noisy. ",4,2016,04,01
121,Worth Stay,"Overall experience is very good and for Indian customer Breakfast is a treat as it contains item of Indian choice so you save almost 50 pound for breakfast when you choose this Hotel.

Staff is helpful and rooms are good and clean one.",4,2016,03,31
121,business trip,we stayed at the taj st.james court for five days in one of the master suites on the 6th floor.we enjoyed our visit very much.the location is excellent and easy to get to all the major areas of london.we could not fault the service. we found the breakfast a little uninspired however.my blow dry at the DAR salon was amazing! dinner at both of the restaurants were excellent.,5,2016,03,31
121,Classy and friendly,"I would recommend this hotel. It is beautiful and classy All the members of the staff are friendly and service minded. The location was also good - right Next to Buckingham Palace. Can't really think of anything to complain about. Must be the price of a cup of coffe: £4,50 - beats even Norwegian prices. Apart from that the hotel is EXCELLENT in every way.",5,2016,03,30
121,TAJ Hospitality in London,"A very central but quite location in London. Near to city as well as West End. Perfect whether you are there for a quite holiday or on work.  Efficient, Polite and Helpful Staff.  The check in as well as the check-out experience was very quick.  Wifi was great. The Free Wifi was good enough for mails, Whatsapp and Facetime.  The concierge was very helpful and gave us useful suggestions as was the reception staff.  I would definitely love to come back and stay again",5,2016,03,30
121,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel very attentive staff Big Ben London eye st Paul's Cathedral Buckingham Palace all in walking distance.If your going to Victoria for the theatre this is also in walking distance....breakfast had a good selection of cereals pastries and cooked breakfast. Only negative was the bathroom was small and a bit dated.,4,2016,03,29
121,Wonderful stay,"Really enjoy the hotel and our stay. The beds were comfortable, the service was top notch and the location is fabulous! I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a 4 star hotel in a great area of London near the train and tourist bus stops. Just up the street from Buckingham Palace. The breakfast buffet was very nice with lots of choices.",5,2016,03,29
121,Great Location,The hotel was in a great location and central to many sights. The staff was very professional and friendly. The breakfast was awesome as well. The room was clean and had great ambience. The cabs were conveniently parked very close to the hotel so very convenient and fast to have a cab if needed especially for last minute.,5,2016,03,29
121,stop over for thearte trip,"Had tickets for the Motown Musical, so decided to stay over instead of taking a late train home. Went on Compare the Market and found a great price for this hotel. On arrival we where met by some great staff. They upgraded our room which was very kind. When we entered the room it was a nice surprise, as it was very spacious, and homely. Only problem was the windows. They vibrated in the wind and the sound was like a machine gun. On speaking to reception they straight away offered us another room. I replied that the room was perfect just the noise. Within 5 mins, engineering where there fixing the problem. Great service. On a negative side, breakfast at £24.50p per person was a little steep, even for the location. Good quality hotel for all the London attractions, and would recommend.",4,2016,03,29
121,"It's nice, but spend the extra on the big sister! ","This is the first time I've stayed at this hotel as a last minute booking but I have previously stayed in the Taj 51 Buckingham Gate Suites and Residences which is the sister hotel next door and the best hotel I've ever stayed in. 
This hotel is nice enough, the staff are not as attentive as I'd have expected, reception were efficient but lacked any real customer service niceties and it took two attempts to get the concierge to take our bags, they were a little ignorant but I think the guy was a trainee so it can be overlooked. We arranged concierge parking with them but they called up to our room shortly after and said they had found a space right outside the hotel (yellow lines are free parking all weekend) which was a nice touch as valet service plus parking is £49.
The communal areas are beautiful and there were some lovely Easter displays in the lobby area.
The rooms are nice and very clean and we were upgraded on arrival to a studio suite. The bathroom was exceptionally clean although small. Wifi worked well.
It is an all round good hotel for the money, but if you can afford the extra I would definitely recommend the suites.",4,2016,03,29
121,Visit to London,"Excellent hotel, centrally located for our first visit to London. Walking distance to London Eye, Buckingham palace, Westminster Abby, etc. Nice rooms Excellent value and service. The staff was very accommodating and helpful.",5,2016,03,28
121,Fantastic Location...great hotel!,"Would highly recommend hotel.  Great atmosphere and exceptional service. Rooms are a little out dated but lobby is exceptional. Walking distance to everything which is extremely beneficial.  Minutes to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey.",5,2016,03,27
121,Tah near Buckingham Palace,"If you are going to meet people this is not the Hotel for you, if you need a private cup of coffee go across the street!You need to know that you will need a compass to find your room in the various buildings which make up this Hotel. There are a number of entries and exits and it somewhat confusing at first. Surely not a place for elderly people. The spa is limited and sitting rooms non existent.",3,2016,03,27
121,a great experience,"Great location, great service, beautiful rooms, nice fitness center and spa.  Please treat yourself to afternoon tea at Kona restaurant or courtyard.  Will stay at this hotel from now on.   Just great - nothing more to say!",5,2016,03,27
121,Nice pleasant hotel,"A nice spot in London. Price reasonable (but when in usd it's a bit more pricy). Very nice big room (for disabled). Big bed and wood floor. Cosy and relaxing. Indian restaurant just outside very good. Piano bar at the entrance. Easy access to metro on foot, close to Buckingham palace. I recommend.",5,2016,03,27
121,Great old school hotel,"This is one of my favorite hotels to stay at when in london.  A number of sightseeing locations are within easy walking distance.
The staff is always friendly and helpful  This is an old school English hotel with some business upgrades.  The room sizes are typical of London but each has a classic feel.  I recommend upgrading to the suites if possible as they are exceptional and provide room to stretch out.  
I have traveled the world and find that this hotel is an exceptional value given the location, the friendly and helpful staff and the suite sizes.",5,2016,03,26
121,Superb location for tourists,"I was here for a week on business. The location is excellent is you are visiting London as a tourist. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Regent Street and Oxford Street. Really brilliant in my opinion.

The rooms are generous for London - I have had much smaller rooms at similar price levels. The decor is a little dated, but not a major issue for me.

The food in the restaurant was excellent all week. Breakfast buffet was a little disappointing. Would be happy to stay again.",4,2016,03,26
121,Poor value for money,"We stayed at this hotel as it was my wifes birthday and was primarily to have the themed afternoon tea. The afternoon tea itself was quite disappointing as the quality of cakes and sandwiches was not that great, the service we received however was good. The breakfast was ok, even though all of the breakfast items were not immediatley available. The service was poor as we were not asked what beverage we would like or if we wanted any toast it was left to me to approach a member of staff to order these.",3,2016,03,24
121,Very Good,"An enjoyable week in St. James Court hotel.  There are some lovely welcoming people in the Reception Desk who often greet you as you walk past. Our room was very nice, modern and spacious and by far the best we have experienced in London.  For this reason, we will be back. We just hope they fix the water pressure in the shower before then! We often stay at The Rubens, just around the corner, where the rooms are smaller and more stuffy. However, the bar area and breakfast room are much more attractive and inviting than at St. James Court.",4,2016,03,23
121,Comfy beds and amazingly quiet,"Bit of a wait for check in but lovely room, amazing bed and so quiet yet so central to theatre , shops , pubs , restaurants ... service in bar very good didn't have breakfast /dinner so didn't experience food quality",4,2016,03,23
121,As Hotel's Should Be,"Yet another excellent stay at the Taj St James  Room was very comfortable.  Breakfast plentiful.    Dinner in the Korna Restaurant was very good both in quality of food, menu and service.  Sevice in the hotel overall was very attentive.",5,2016,03,22
121,"High Quality, OK location","This hotel is very beautiful, with lots of elegant touches. The rooms are exceptionally large for a London hotel. The restaurant had a great atmosphere, but has a severe mosquito problem, with some of the bugs falling in my girlfriend's glass of wine. Needs more control of this issue. Food at the inside restaurant for breakfast was pretty standard fare. Location is in a nice part of London with a short walk to Buckingham, but it is far away from Borough Market, Soho, or any of other areas of London.",4,2016,03,22
121,Very welcoming just for afternoon tea,"Finding this hotel was so refreshing. We only had tea and cakes, but the atmosphere was from another time and the staff were charming. Don't be put off by the grandeur (enjoy it) this is the perfect place to unwind for an hour in a civilised environment, with a lovely assortment of cakes and pastries and great coffee. Very fairly priced for the location, two mins from Buckingham Palace, and probably a good place to stay. I will return. ",5,2016,03,22
121,Stay in London,The hotel made the experience more beautiful. Would recommend travellers to check this hotel. Great value for money. Great experience. Great Location. Great Hospitality. Great Food. The indian food is the best.,5,2016,03,21
121,Great stay,The hotel is in a great location whether business or leisure.  Staff are always professional and friendly and rooms are a great size and very comfortable.  Still my favourite hotel in London and a highly recommended choice,5,2016,03,21
121,Perfect location,"Very nice hotel nearby Victoria Station in the center of London City. Comfortable rooms, free wifi, very good breakfast (add 20£ in the room price) and very professional service. I recommand this hotel",5,2016,03,21
121,"Great location, great service","Conveniently located to get out and about in London. Staff warm and welcoming and extremely attentive throughout my short stay. Stayed just one night, staff couldn't do enough to assist. Very good value for money.",5,2016,03,21
121,Giant bed!!,"After reading a few bad reviews after booking, I thought uh oh we will get a bad room... But when we walked in we were pleasantly surprised it wasn't miles away and it was huge and the bed was enormous and so comfy... The hotel was Really close to all the sights and we also had drinks in the bar which were reasonably priced very happy customer and would definitely stay again 😀",5,2016,03,21
121,!!Fantabulous!!,"Location - 5 stars (right next to Buckingham palace/green park/Trafalgar square and the works)
Service - 5 stars (everyone was very polite and courteous)
Rooms - 5 stars (tastefully done up and cozy. They are standard london sized rooms, so you might be disappointed if you book expecting USA/Asian sized rooms)
Hampton Bar - 5 stars (fabulous service, we spent 3 out of 4 evenings there, its just so cozy and quaint) 
For indulgence try Quillon - mouth watering delicacies from southern India! Their lunch set menu is a pretty good deal!! 
Would be back :)",5,2016,03,21
121,Lucky me - Excellent stay,"On a whim, merely hours before I'd be landing in London, I booked at the St. James' Court. Upon an early arrival I was greeted by Valerie who was polite, warm and welcoming. My room was ready and my bags were brought up, which was a delight once I discovered that the hallways were a bit of a maze... I actually laughed out loud. My room was a grand surprise! I did not anticipate how large it would be, and despite a relatively boring view (who cares) it was light and airy. And clean which was beyond appreciated!

In addition to the wonderful accommodation I was delighted with the hotels proximity to all things touristy in London. Steps from Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, parks, shopping and pubs, it was perfect for my quick stay in the city. 

I've already recommended this to friends in the UK and know where I'll be staying when I'm lucky enough to return to London. Thank you for a relaxing stay. ",5,2016,03,19
121,Beautiful hotel room a bit tired,It is a beautiful hotel with excellent staff. Breakfast is excellent. But the rooms are small and could do with some renovation. Location is excellent . Bar nice. The place is very clean. I thoroughly enjoed the stay.,4,2016,03,19
121,Excellent hotel in central London,"The rooms were excellent - comfortable, clean, and charming.  I would highly recommend to the weary and regular business traveler and I would be very happy to stay here again.  Fresh and new with old world charm.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  The location was perfect for our meetings.  ",4,2016,03,19
121,"Very nice, luxurious",I was lucky enough to stay here because of a meeting close by. On my own I probably would not have been able to afford it.  I felt pampered.  The Michelin one-star restaurant Quilon was next door and it WAS worthy of that star. And conveniently when our meeting ended early we easily walked to Buckingham Palace for photos and to Trafalgar Square to enjoy a bit of pub atmosphere.,5,2016,03,19
121,Excellent hotel,"I stayed here recently for business travel. Rooms are comfortable and well proportioned without being overly spacious. Location is excellent, within a short walk of Buckingham Palace and the Park, and service was friendly and very efficient. ",4,2016,03,18
121,Wouldn't stay again and wouldn't recommend,"I stayed here with two other memebers of my family. For the first two days we were pleased with the service, but on the third night we returned to our room to find an untouched room, but new towels were left (not enough for the three of us, only two towels were left). Other than inconsistencies, the staff weren't friendly and seemed annoyed or almost standoffish.",2,2016,03,18
121,Great Stay in London,"I have stayed at this hotel 4 times now over the past few years and every time I have been really happy with both the room and the service.  The rooms are nice and clean, the breakfast is great and all there staff are really friendly and helpful.  I find the location fantastic as St James tube station is only a couple of minutes walk away and there are shops and restaurants close by.  Many tourist attractions such as Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and St James Park are an easy walk away.  Will definitely stay again on my next trip to London.",5,2016,03,18
121,A kind of palace near  B palace,"The place is nicely located 15' walk to Piccadilly ,just a step from the palace and ST James park! Warm textures, fine hotel aura,big rooms perfect beds.The Bank restaurant in the inyard area is fantastic good pelation on price and facilities",4,2016,03,17
121,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for one night while passing through on business in March.

Pros:
- The hotel is in a great location and is a beautiful place to stay. 
- The rooms were a good size and very clean.
- My room had a beautiful view of an inner courtyard. 
- Friendly staff
- Comfortable bed

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,03,17
121,Classic and lovely,"This lovely, classic hotel deserves its great reviews, but my stay was clouded by the fact that my room was on a lower floor and situated over the underground. Hence, every few minutes during underground hours I could hear the trains rattling by underneath. The hotel offered to move me, but my stay was very short and did not want to bother to move. I do think that such a grand hotel should remodel or remove rooms that are affected by the sound.",4,2016,03,16

121,The Most Beautiful Hotel,"I have stayed for four days at the Taj Hotel and I must say it was the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed with. The staff are well trained, very clean, the rooms are well maintained, the food is tasty although only managed to eat breakfast. I would recommend it to anyone. Not forgetting that its located very close to restaurants and underground stations, Victoria and St James's Park. Ohh...and Buckingham palace :)",5,2016,03,15
121,Relaxing Luxury Stay,"Me and my partner stayed two nights in the Classic Studio Suite, a huge room with everything well spaced out and kept very clean.  We also opted for a massage which was very relaxing after a long day of shopping.  It was the second time we have stayed there because of it's great location. The hotel is located only a short walk away from Buckingham Palace and St. James' Park which is lovely to have a morning stroll around.  The bus and underground links being only round the corner is perfect to take you anywhere in London.",5,2016,03,15
121,Well done,"As a 4* yes it is great to stay! 
On arrival the concierge was more then welcome to help with the bags! For reception can say much because my husband was dealing, but was nice from there side giving a small tedy bear to my little girl. On the way to the rooms we had good greeting from the supervisor in the floor! Really nice and polite (Indian) gentlemen asking if we need anything extra to don't hesitate to call him. Really good attitude! Right next the rooms - big, spacious,  comfortable beds, clean, but I think they need to start paint the walls. Forget about housekeeping scrubbing the black marks on the wall. They really crying for good touch up as well the lift area specially the 4 floor.
Housekeeping lady- Sussana was nice and done her job properly. Also want to thank Zana from Bistro 51 for the good service both days and playing with my girl for a bit till I had my food! I can say she was amazing and helpful! Well done! ",5,2016,03,15
121,First Class!,"Always a pleasure to stay here - tends to be on business, but have used their facilities on a personal level too.  The staff are attentive and helpful, without being OTT.  They always try to ensure everything is just right.  Rooms are extremely comfortable, although Standard ones are a little on the small side, but that's London!  Location-wise it's perfect. Great service, excellent food - the steaks in the Conservatory are fantastic!! Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,15
121,Fabulous,"Fabulous overnight stay. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Our room was great, overlooking the courtyard and very quiet. We had the themed Alice in Wondeland afternoon tea which was delicious. Can't wait to come back",5,2016,03,15
121,Friendly luxury,"We were greeted very politely and we were charmed to be welcomed back - we had stayed before - by Arianna I think.  The staff in the bar were very personable and we enjoyed our aperitif before going to dinner.  A request to have a razor brought to us was promptly fulfilled and we had a very good stay.  We would recommend the hotel for its atmosphere and friendly, but never overly attentive,  service.  We love the St John's Court.",5,2016,03,14
121,"Very good stay, as usual","I usually stay at the hotel during the second week of March every year, for the last 5 years. I enjoy very much my stay here each time.

121,Amazing value luxury hotel ,"My partner and I stayed one night over the weekend to celebrate my partners birthday. The hotel and service was amazing! Couldn't fault anything. We stayed in an executive double, the room was very spacious and clean! The hotel is located about a five minute walk from st James station and is in the perfect location if you want to do a bit of sightseeing in London. A luxury hotel at a very affordable price! Would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of staying here and would certainly stay here again! ",5,2016,03,14

Very good accommodation for short trips either on business (my case) or holidays.",4,2016,03,14
121,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at the St. James' Court for 6 nights in the classic studio suite. The hotel was built in the early 20th century and has some wonderful architectural features including a beautiful lobby and courtyard. Although our room was a bit dated (think 1980s) and needed some updating (i.e. the drains needed attention), we were overall pleased with our stay. On the positive side, the hotel is convenient to public transit and many of London's famous attractions. You can't beat the location. The staff were professional and attentive, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the breakfast was very good. On the negative side, there was noise and vibrations from nearby construction activity during the night and early morning hours that was annoying. Nevertheless, we would stay again.",4,2016,03,13

121,Lovely stay,"Doorman and all staff very professional, friendly and helpful. Made you feel special. Excellent location and fabulous value for money. Would love to return. Room was lovely.  Breakfast was too expensive for us so we ate out, lovely cafe directly opposite. Would recommend the small Italian restaurant just around the corner.",5,2016,03,13
121,Worth,"The location is excellence. Wondering around one can see moust of atractions like London Eye, Westminser, Big Ben, Backingam Palace.

121,Comfortable room and extremely friendly service,"We made a mistake in our booking and Booked for 2016 when are stay was for 2015. The hotel staff were friendly and arranged a room for us. However I had to pay the difference of the room rate which as quite expensive as this was during the Rugby world cup. The room was very spacious and modern. We had gifts from our family that was posted to us and left in the room when we came. The staff was friendly. I did pay for rose flowers on the bed but that did not happen, maybe it was because of the mistake in the booking. If  you are looking for a place that is quite and still in the city this is the hotel to go to.",4,2016,03,07
121,Superb hotel,"The hotel is located near to a large number of sites and we actually walked every day instead of taking the tube, which also is good to do as the st James park stop is very close by. The hotel staff is super friendly, rooms are very nicely decorated with a decent size bathroom and a comfortable bed. Being in such a central location and still so quiet at night is the best thing.",5,2016,03,06
121,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London.","This place is Awesome! Great rooms, great service and good location close to most tourist attractions. Walking distance to most. We would highly recommend this hotel and we will stay there on our next visit to London.",5,2016,03,06

121,OMG!!!,"I stayed here for one night with my partner and we were impressed. I should mention that we usually stay else where when we are in London but this hotel just caught our eye as it was discounted from their usual rate....I could never afford to go otherwise, we even had a beer in the bar! (must mention we did ask for the service charge to be taken off as we got it ourselves!!)!

We were in an exec room and I can't fault it the bed was comfortable and the bathroom had everything you could need for a nights stay. My only downside is the mini-bar/wine crisps in a basket...couldn't afford to touch them...maybe next time!",5,2016,03,05

121,Great location and a little bit of luxury,"Stayed here for the first time on a business trip back to the UK. Normally go for the normal large corporate hotel that have no personality. This hotel was great and very affordable on this occasion coming in just under the London ceiling for my organisation. Beautiful hotel, great atmosphere and a little bit of class in the Victoria area.",5,2016,03,05

121,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel was in an excellent location 2 mins walk from Buckingham Palace. Service from staff excellent, overall everything about the hotel was excellent.

121,Good comfortable stay,"While I was disappointed with my first room the hotel staff moved me very quickly to a much nicer and newer room. The hotel is very nice on the outside but the hallways are a little scruffed up (especially on the first level where my first room was located) but on the 5th level this was less the case.   The hotel staff are exceptionally friendly and they go above and beyond to make your hotel stay pleasant. The beds are very comfortable and there was absolutely no noise in the hallways.   The hotel location is centrally located a few steps from Buckingham Palace and was a nice walk even though it was  a particularly cold February day when I wondered out. But overall - nice hotel, comfy beds, great staff!",4,2016,03,04
121,"Five star experience, differentiating service, well prepared and presented food, good attention to detail","Stayed here for business this week. This was my third visit to the St James Court. Couldn't ask for better service. The hotel is well staffed with well trained professionals. Pianist in the lobby in the evening adds something to the experience, very nice.  Had a very nice evening meal with a group of associates. The quality and taste of food, presentation, and service combined for a first class experience. Breakfast was also a good experience great service and nice selection of fresh high quality food.  When I didn't respond to the wake up call that I requested (because I was already up) a member of the staff came up to my room to make sure everything was OK. Everything in my room was well maintained and up to date. Hotel is located right in the heart of the city which was great for my business needs but would also work for seeing the sights.",5,2016,03,03
121,Superb experience,"We stayed at this fabulous hotel overnight as part of a birthday celebration.

121,Step into another world,"The St James Court Hotel on Buckingham Gate is a traditional quality hotel in one of the more classical buildings close to Buckingham Palace.  Now part of the Taj group the standards are still high and the attitude of the staff exemplary. Nice little features are a note offering to supply any missing items such as shaving cream, razors, combs etc free of charge.  For the quality of the hotel the prices are modest and the service standards excellent.  It is also located in a very quiet backwater of an otherwise busy area only a few hundred yards from Victoria station, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace.",5,2016,03,01
121,Very nice quiet and central hotel,"This hotel is a gem in the center of Westminster. 5 - 10 to the attractions like Buckingham Palace or westminster Abbey. The rooms vary. Some are a little old but the executive rooms are all refurbished and rather nice. The staff is very polite, friendly and professional. Room service 24/7 has a nice quality. Complementary water, still and bubbles. Complementary newspaper, turn down service with chocolates. Complementary coffee and tea at the room. I'd highly recommend a stay at this wonderful place, even if it may be a little expensive.",5,2016,03,01
121,Great stay,"I have stayed in this hotel for one night and was very impressed with their decoration and service. Staff was excellent and the breakfast and afternoon tea was amazing! The only reason I haven't given this 5 starts was because I had booked a bigger room but ended up in a smaller one. When I arrived the room was freezing and the there was no extra duvet.
Other then that everything else was great and I am thinking of maybe going back. The courtyard looks stunning too.",4,2016,02,29

The choice of restuarants and food selection was good and surrounding especially eating at the Bank.",4,2016,02,27
121,Good hotel in great location near Victoria and Westminster,"I stayed for 2 nights and asked for a high room. I was given 862 in one of the ""annexes"" - good size, double bed, large bathroom, good toiletries. The life is old and small but perfectly functional. The hotel is set round a lovely courtyard. 

The location is perfect for a walk to Victoria in one direction and Westminster in the other. I was working at Westminster and the weather was good so a lovely walk along Victoria Street to Parliament Square was enjoyable. ",4,2016,02,27

121,Great stay,"The stuff is very nice, hotel is a little old but clean. Room service ok. Breakfast was good but the place is not very inviting. In my opinion it is too small. But you get everything you want for breakfast. I liked the vegetarian Indian stuff.",5,2016,02,26

121,excellent hotel for romantic gateway,"Good location; nice, clean and spacious room; very well decorated; pleasant staff. Hotel has 3 restaurants on the grounds, but we chose Indian cuisine restaurant - Quilon and definitely made a right choice!  Very good food and service! Will definitely come back!",5,2016,02,23
121,Not what you expect for the money!,Paying 200 pounds per night to stay in this hotel really is not worth it! On arrival to our room there was a musty smell which remained for our three night stay despite opening the window and spraying air freshner! On the window ledge/balcony we found rubbish that looked to have been there for a while! The room was outdated and the bathroom was considerably worse! The staff on the other hand are extremely helpful & the location is wonderful as it is close to the sightseeing things of London! The hotel looks so amazing from the outside but the rooms don't show that inside!,3,2016,02,23
121,Wonderful stay as always,"I have stayed at this hotel many times now when visiting London with my husband and each time we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We find the staff very helpful and many now recognise us and greet us with a warm smile.  The rooms are extremely comfortable and lovely and quiet.   Location is great very close to St James Park and so easy to get to Central London on the tube, the station being only 5 mins walk away.  A safe place to walk back from too.    A lovely ambience in the lobby, where at night in the Hamptons it is a relaxing piano bar with top professional Ed Bentley entertaining on the piano.  Ed has played at many top spots around the world including Ronnie Scott's.   Am looking forward to staying again.",5,2016,02,22

121,Great Business Experience,"I stayed in this hotel for one night on business.  With our business rate it was very reasonable and a really nice touch to get a free drink and discounted meal, although I was going out so didn't use the restaurant except for breakfast.  Breakfast was good, but not great (more fresh fruit would have been welcome). The staff were all excellent, very friendly and efficient.",4,2016,02,22
121,Do not book standart room,"I was not expecting anything amazing, but the standart room was not appropriate to the level of a five star hotel. The room was generally clean, but some parts were dirty.  In Taj suites everything is fine.  Great location and staff. Breakfast is good.",4,2016,02,22
121,Friendly & personal service,Hotel has an excellent and quiet location for central london. Enjoyed walking through St James park to reach some tourist attractions.

Taj needs more people like you around the space .
Small advice ritesh ,  breakfast staff needs more training.",5,2016,02,22
121,"Beautiful Hotel, a must","Myself and my wife booked this last minute and got super good rate, for a night out in London.
Check was simple straight forward with minimal hassle.
Our room was a deluxe double, again very very nice, (wife recommends the bath, she's a bath lover and been in baths all round the world)
We didn't eat in the hotel, so cannot comment on food.

All round a very nice hotel and would gladly return",5,2016,02,22
121,Not massively impressed,"We were given quite a basic room considering the price paid, sink was cracked, a socket broken, dirty shower head and as small television tucked away in the alcove, I saw rubbish on the stairs for the 3 days we were there, 
The Service however is second to none at a price, if your not used to London service charges, 12.5% per round of drinks, as this was my first time in London I was a novice , I was advised by a local of how this works, only pay what you feel the service is worth.
Not sure if we will recommend or return.",3,2016,02,21
121,Amazing Gem of a Hotel ,"Cannot fault this hotel... Even though our room wasn't ready on arrival....we had complimentary drinks until it was..

An upgrade from executive double to executive suite which was not even prompted.... Made the delay worth it...

Nothing was too much trouble from reception, concierge to the bar staff... Never eaten so many nuts and olives whilst having a quiet drink...  

Was raining and had no umbrella for our night out seeing a play close to our heart...

Not a problem... Take a hotel umbrella....

Will definitely stay at a Taj hotel again.... Top drawer service and stunning quality to the hotel...",5,2016,02,21
121,Mr Ritesh exceptional service,"I have stayed with  many hotels around the globe. I have  never reviewed any hotel, Having exceptional service from Mr Ritesh the duty manager has bought me here.
Mr ritesh Thank you very v v much for taking care of my family , a true TAJ ICON

My son is a  professional yoga healer . When he returned back from his stay he said ""Mom ,  Mr Ritesh   holds a aura of positive energy for the service  they received during the stay.

Thank you once again",5,2016,02,21
121,Good Business Hotel,"The Taj is a good business hotel in a great location.  The rooms are small but functional, however, they (and the hallways to them) look run-down and need to be renovated.

The breakfasts are not great, but palatable.  However, I will admit that on our last morning, we requested the chef to make us a South Indian breakfast, and we were served some excellent masala dosas.  And the restaurant Quilon (in the hotel) is superb.

The coffee shop in the lobby is a good place to have a quick, quality coffee and provides some respite from the typically busy lobby.

My gripes with the hotel are mainly related to service.  We checked into the hotel early, and the front desk staff did everything to accommodate us, however, the actual check-in process took far too long (25-30 min).  This may be more of a systems issue and not related to the staff, who were all courteous but the result is that there was always a group of people waiting to be assisted by the front desk.  

Another issue is that one of the rooms was not serviced for 2 days despite the request being placed on the doorknob.  Another one of the rooms was not serviced for one of the days.  When we spoke to a member of the housekeeping team, we were told rather curtly that ""rooms can be cleaned anywhere between noon and 3 pm,"" not understanding that ours were not being serviced at all.  

There are only a few aspects that are stopping this from being a solid business hotel, but they need to be addressed urgently in order for guests to return.",3,2016,02,21
121,Pleasant Stay,"My experience of checking in was very poor compared to the chap who checked in alongside me. I wasn't advised half of the information he was, so glad I overheard! There was confusion over my room booking which was no hassle but could have been handled a bit more professionally. Upon finding my room (422) it was an adequate size for me travelling alone and for one night. Clean, bright with excellent amenities. This was a first time stay for me at this hotel and it was central to all the typical London sights, so location is good. I had a late night drink in the bar where the staff were very pleasant. on retiring to bed there seemed to be some kind of generator outside that went on and on till the wee small hours so if I stayed again I would ask for a room situated away from this.Breakfast was plentiful and again the staff were pleasant and helpful.",4,2016,02,21
121,great hotel,"loved the Taj in London - quiet location short underground or taxi to west end restaurants and theater, good food, excellent service, clean rooms - only complaint, non working tv in room that was never repaired during my stay.",4,2016,02,21
121,Vp software,"Staid there quite often, tried yo cancel the first night out of a reservation of 2 nights 
One hour after the normal time for cancellation ;they refused. Either i kept and paid both or cancelled both alltogether .... Called their bluff 
cancelled both nights and went elsewhere Very Poor business sense , 
They are far too greedy;",1,2016,02,20
121,Birthday treat whilst visiting Quilon,"The main reason for our visit was to dine at Quilon, which is literally next door.

Fantastic hotel with an equally good location. a few minutes walk to Buckingham palace. Luxury from top to bottom, the room we stayed in was a free upgrade and was lovely. Plenty of space and all the amenities you'd expect from a great hotel. Would highly recommend if you don't mind paying a little extra! The quality worth it!",5,2016,02,20
121,Ok but nothing special ,"Had a standard room overlooking courtyard. The room was very small with the bathroom and wardrobe cut-out into the room. It had a 4ft6 bed which for a hotel is small! The room did have all amenities though: trouser press, iron, minibar, tea making facilities 2 free bottles mineral water. It did look a bit tired especially the bathroom but for the price paid (£108) was ok, won't stay again though.",3,2016,02,20
121,OUTSTANDING,"Cant say enough about this hotel.  It is in a perfect location for visiting Buckingham Palace and all the beautiful sites in London.  The hotel room was just amazing; the bed was extremely comfortable, the room and bathroom were both very clean and just exquisite.   There was a lovely tray with tea and coffee and tradition biscuits.   The bathroom had the best soaker bath and lovely fluffy towels.   The hotel service was outstanding and the staff are wonderful - very knowledgeable about the area.   There are restaurants in the area that are all of a reasonable price and have a wide selection on the menus.  We were able to walk everywhere from the hotel and there is also lots of public transportation.   We  came in from Victoria station and walked to the hotel.  Highly recommend this hotel and definitely will return!",5,2016,02,20
121,Good hotel. Reception a shambles.,"This is a nice hotel and well situated for business or leisure in Westminster. Unfortunately my experience of checking in was poor. I had booked one night then had to book and additional night.

On check-in, The reception lady (Chiarna, who was very pleasant) told me I was only booked for one night but eventually agreed that I was booked for two nights.

The next morning I had a check-out bill posted under my room door. Reception could not be contacted by the phone in my room so had to queue at the desk to be told by Chiarna that I was due to check out. Again pointed out that I'd booked two nights and thought the matter had been resolved.

On return to my room later, key did not work, another trip and queue to speak to reception(Chiarna) who reactivated my key.

3pm on day two. Knock on door from staff asking if I was checking out, that I had only been booked for one day. Another explanation but was told I had only booked for one night. Another explanation and apology from lady.

Poor performance by either staff or the hotel's computer system which is a pity because it's a nice hotel. Estimated 40 minutes queueing and four repeats of the same conversation to staff.",3,2016,02,20
121,A safe and comfortable stay in a five star ambience,A very clean safe place in the heart of London.  An old world charm with five star ambience was heart warming. Cheerful and friendly staff who were helpful at all times and very courteous. I would definitely visit once again.,5,2016,02,19
121,It's worth !!,"Reception and rest of the staff well trained , professional and very friendly.
Lounge clean, good-looking. Rooms spacious, comfortable, fully-equipped. Breakfast tasty,fresh, wide variety of food. Perfect localisation to monuments, bus stops, underground, coffees and restaurants. Price of the night very reasonable. I really enjoyed , highly recommend ! ",5,2016,02,18
121,Excellent hotel,Cannot praise this hotel enough the staff are amazing we arrived early morning but check in was not until 12 but we were told our room was already available which was great. Every member of staff were always very helpful and pleasant and nothing was too much trouble they are all a credit to the hotel. It's in an excellent location within walking distance of many attractions and so close to Buckingham palace. We will always be staying here from now on when we are in London.,5,2016,02,18
121,Great place to stay,"Great place to stay. Close to Victoria and many attractions.  Walking distance to the Palace, Piccadilly etc. Staff excellent, rooms extremely clean, great bathrooms. Huge breakfast in the room and excellent afternoon tea.  Concierge especially helpful and stored our baggage.",4,2016,02,17
121,weekend stay,"Excellent stay, lovely friendly staff always willing to help, clean quiet room. Included breakfast which was good selection for all tastes. Stayed as part of a weekend theatre break, good location for shopping and site seeing. Would definently recommend this hotel.",5,2016,02,17
121,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights in February. The hotel was easy to access via metro from Heathrow. It was conveniently located within walking distance to Buckingham Palace and other attractions. The room was small, but not any smaller than any other hotels we've stayed at in Europe. The lobby bar was good for a drink and the Indian restaurant connected to the hotel was great as well. ",5,2016,02,16
121,Fantastic Hotel with a fantastic team,"This hotel definitely deserves more than its 4 stars.  The amenities are fantastic and the team are friendly and professional.  My room was amazing and if you get a chance, eat in the hotels' Indian restaurant - out-standing.  Location is perfect and I look forward to returning",5,2016,02,16
121,Had a Fantastic stay!,"Visited for the Valentine's weekend, stayed for a night. The staff at reception was welcoming and friendly. The Classic King room is of a comfortable size for two people with a great view of the iconic building of the hotel.",5,2016,02,16
121,Not Bad!,"We stayed here on the Saturday of Valentines weekend and I had high hopes considering the stellar reputation of the Taj Group. 

Overall, we were slightly disappointed. There was nothing hugely wrong but the room was very tired in places and the bathroom rather dated and basic. 

Staff are very good here and the location is excellent but we usually look for a little bit of a WOW factor and sadly the Taj St James' Court didn't have that.",3,2016,02,16
121,Generally Very Good,"My wife and I have stayed here many times before in a variety of rooms. On this occasion, the only real problem was that the bathroom was far too cold with no means of heating it. The service and food were as good as ever though. Definitely recommended.",4,2016,02,16
121,A beautiful hotel in a quiet location,"Have been to St James Court before and really enjoy the experience.  Service is very good with staff who appear to like what they do.
Some other reviews highlight tired rooms that need up dating. This is a fair comment but the balance is that the room we had was clean, big, quite and had all we needed.
The Bistro at the hotel is excellent as well as Quillion restaurant  next to St James'
",4,2016,02,16
121,Break away,"We came for a break away in London last weekend. Really nice hotel, staff are very pleasant. We didn't eat or drink at the hotel so can't comment on that. It was raining the whole time we were in London and were offered an umbrella to take with us which was really nice. The room was okay, we only paid £108.00 which I thought was a really good deal ! The only down fall is that we didn't get much sleep as guests returning from their nights out were shouting through the corridor and slamming doors at 3 in the morning ): but none of this is the hotels fault. I would stay again (:",4,2016,02,16
121,OK - but in need of a facelift!,"We don't usually stay near Victoria but this hotel popped up and was available over the weekend so we took a punt! Located about a 4 mins walk from St James tube it is well located. The foyer is large and impressive.

Checked in easily around 1130am and had been given a classic double on the top floor (7th) as we had pre-requested a quiet room. The room itself was a decent size with a corner window. The room was clean, though you could tell the furnishings had been in use for quite a long time. No extra plug socket besides the bed - on my side I actually had to unplug the lamp to put my phone in to charge and the plug socket itself was coming away from the wall slightly!

Bathroom - clean but dated! Rather late 80s/90s style, dark marble with an old style 'hoover' hairdryer attached to the wall (though there is a proper hairdryer in the bedroom), I also cannot fathom why a 4 star hotel is still using shower curtains instead of screens? Curtains are quite annoying! The shower is also dated with a rather cumbersome knob to use in the middle of the wall, which seems to turn the tap and shower on at the same time. Good temp and pressure though.

Had a decent sleep, the bed is comfy and it was a quiet floor. On our way back from a night out we shared a lift up with a young couple and the guy was quite agitated that he was told it would be a 15min wait to be served a drink. Can't really blame him to be honest! The bar isn't huge.

Would I stay here again? Hmmm probably not. I would expect a bit more from a 4 star hotel, and I know the Taj group has a great reputation. They could certainly do with investing a bit more time and money in their rooms at their London location.",3,2016,02,15
121,Weekend stay in London,"An excellent location just a 10 minute walk or 5 min cab ride from Victoria station, within 30 mins walk from Covent Garden and Soho etc. and just 15 mins from the South Bank.  The hotel is always clean and well presented and the staff are both knowledgeable and courteous. The rooms are clean and well presented with good quality toiletries etc.  Beds are comfortable, modern and clean and I would have no hesitation in recomending the hotel to anyone who is unsure. It may be a little more expensive than others but I really cannot fault anything - and I am really fussy! Excellent with a slightly upmarket feel and really worth a visit.",5,2016,02,15
121,London trip February,"Great visit to London and stayed at the St James court hotel.  As I had stayed there over 15 years ago, I was not sure if they had refurbished the hotel.  I was not disappointed.  They have maintained the hotel well.  Rooms were new and the staff were excellent and attentive.  Great experience",5,2016,02,14
121,Beautiful Downstairs Areas But Very Tired Bedrooms,"My husband & I and my daughter & son-in-law booked a night at The St James' Court hotel through Expedia. The room rate was on offer at £180 a night (not including breakfast or any extras), from the original advertised rate of £430.... The downstairs lobby area, the reception area & the bar were stylish, beautiful, classy & clean... We were impressed... However once we were on route to our rooms (ours on the 6th floor, my daughters' on the 1st floor), it quickly became apparent that the same level of attention & detail was not being given to the corridors & hallways which were quite dusty & dull... Our room was even more tired looking which was a huge disappointment. The bed & bedding were lovely, fresh & comfortable but the walls were grubby, the telephones were so old that they had yellowed, the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned, the basin tap was badly stained, the toilet roll holder loose, the flush on the toilet didn't work very well, a mirror had been removed from a wall & the brackets left behind. On looking out of the window the ledges were covered in bird poo.... And the layout of the room was odd... Above the dressing table were a number of pictures... The mirror was behind the TV, nowhere near the dressing table & hair dryer socket... The hair dryer lead was short & did not reach anywhere near the mirror & every time we tried to stretch the coiled hair dryer lead, the plug ""pinged"" out of the socket, making the experience of hair drying exceptionally difficult & hugely inconvenient.. Additionally the smallish TV was so far away from the bed it was difficult to watch. The tea & coffee making tray was nowhere near a socket & we had to move everything across the room to make a morning cuppa... We raised these issues with the reception staff, who were very courteous & polite & said they would pass our feedback on... I'm not sure who exactly to... On the whole the staff were polite, except the barman who appeared moody & quite cross... Drinks are very expensive in the bar as are the snacks that are for sale in the rooms... £2.50 for a small bag of crisps... Consierge & door staff were all helpful & friendly... Come on St James' Court, you need to sharpen things up & pay some attention to your hallways & bedrooms to bring it up to standard. You need to up your game... ",3,2016,02,14
121,"Wonderful, once again.","Another wonderful stay at this hotel. Staff are friendly , hotel is very comfortable with modern amenities . Great location , 2 min walk to Buckingham palace bad underground station. Only 15 min walk through the park and the mall  to Trafalgar Square .
Would always recommend this hotel.",4,2016,02,14
121,Charming centrally located hotel close to tourist sites!,"The Taj is a charming courtyard hotel located between St James, Victoria and Green Park. We had stayed there for one night on the 1st of January for my Fiancé’s 40th birthday. There are a few shops and cafes nearby including a Starbucks near St James station. There is also an all day cafe opposite the hotel. Victoria station is a 5 minute walk away where are many shops and restaurants and Victoria coach station is also nearby- very useful for those travelling to Heathrow and Gatwick.

The rooms are quite small but comfortable and the bathroom size is adequate. We had a spa session booked in the afternoon. The Therapists are extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome in the spa. They use fabulous products from the Le Sultanate De Saba range but the spa facilities itself are very average. The steam room is extremely small (only fits one person) and is not always operational. On the two occasions I went down, the first time it was switched off for the day and the second time a user had left the door open so it wasn’t fully useable. 

We were offered half price afternoon tea which we utilised the next day. The quality of the scones and sandwiches was very good but the pastries were average and service a little slow.
The Waitress wasn’t overly familiar with the vegetarian option and asked if chicken was ok as a sandwich filling?! Baring in mind we had informed them the previous day of our dietary requirements this was a little odd. 

Overall, a lovely hotel in a central location, however nowhere close to the standards that you experience in Taj Hotels across India.",4,2016,02,12
121,Sliding standards,"I used to stay at this hotel as a first choice, but the standards of both the rooms and the room service food has become very hit and miss. After staying there on and off for 4 years they even lost my address on the system. The Gold membership, which I have, is pointless (excuse the pun) as I never receive anything from them, no upgrades, nothing.  If the staff spent less time trying to be overly polite and more time listening and observing they might get it right.",3,2016,02,12
121,Lovely stay,"Amazing experience, great location, great staff!  I recommend this hotel for the location and for the price/quality ratio. The staff is always available and the main attractions of London are easily reachable.",5,2016,02,11
121,Fabulous stay,"Loved St James' Court Taj Hotel,  good proximity from St James Park tube, lovely looking hotel, room was large and very clean, comfy bed. Staff are very friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,02,11
121,EXCELLENT SERVICE,Room was extremely comfortable and spacious. The staff were outstanding - nothing was too much trouble. 2 minutes' walk to St James tube station. Nicely situated between Buckingham Palace and Westminster. Taxi rank 20 metres from hotel.,5,2016,02,10
121,I wouldn't stay here again,"Of the many places to stay in London, I regret choosing this hotel.  Although my preference, when visiting another city, is to wander - stay out-and-about and walk around all day, in the case of my most recent visit to London I was almost forced to because the hotel wasn't nice enough for me to want to spend time relaxing in.  While the room was big - more spacious than most hotels in the UK/Europe, it was old.  The hallways were old - old carpeting, old wallpaper, the bathroom fixtures needed updating and so did all of the furniture in the room and on the whole property.

Location-wise, it was fine.  

The gym was fine.

The food was fine (I only ate breakfast in the hotel, no other meals).",3,2016,02,10
121,"Tradition, history and modernity mixed",This is an iconic hotel where you will feel the comfort and serenity in the heart of London and in an environment of past and history. Close to main sites of interest (Buckingham) and beautiful parks. A must stay in London,5,2016,02,09
121,"Good hotel, good location, excellent service. Pity about the water pressure!","Located 2 mins from St James Park tube / 10 mins walk from Victoria station, this Taj Hotel is a good base for a weekend in London and reasonably priced for the Capitol. Excellent service throughout the hotel (reception, bar staff, concierge). 
Our 7th floor room was fairly small, but the bed was very comfortable and the room had been recently re-furbished and was well equipped. Very nice modern bathroom with a good supply of luxury toiletries. 
Only real issue was the shower.....absolutely no water power! An evening and morning trickle from the shower head was poor. They clearly haven't sorted out a decent the water pressure for higher floor rooms.",4,2016,02,08
121,fantastic hotel      staff amazing,"my friends and i stayed here for one night,     the staff couldnt do enough for us, even left a little cake in our room for our friends 50th birthday.     its perfectly located for buckingham palace , westminster abbey and many more famous sites.    rooms are lovely, we stayed in king room with a balcony looking over the courtyard, and the courtyard is beautiful.
the concierge went above and beyond to help us book a taxi for 6.    breakfasts are superb........... will be back soon thankyou.       carol from hull",5,2016,02,08
121,Wonderful location and excellent service,"Room little smaller than I expected from the 'King Size' room I booked - but overall, great location and wonderful service in the heart of London. Also free wifi throughout - including in the rooms. Wonderful ambiance in the reception area and attentive, helpful and friendly staff. Housekeeping were very quick to return and item to me that I left in the room. Recommended.",5,2016,02,08
121,Comfort and Class,"Quiet, classy and comfortable, this hotel is within walking distance of the Buckingham Palace, the St.James Park and Victoria station, and pretty much in the middle of all things interesting. The rooms are extremely neat, with contemporary furnishings, and extremely efficient housekeeping service. The hotel has a Michelin Star restaurant Quilon which offers Indian and exotic menu. Its Business Centre is useful for emergencies. The concierge service is outstanding. If you are a frequent traveller, it offers  to even store your baggage without cost. Overall, a delightful place to stay in.",5,2016,02,08
121,Great value for money,"I can only really rate this on the bedroom and check in service as we only really stopped here as it was close to where we was going out that night. So we checked in at 4pm which was very speedy. The lady receptionist was so sweet and helpful. She wasn't just a boring receptionist, she had a great personality. We were given room 418 (classic double) which to get to was a mission. The hall way to the room felt never ending however due to the size of the hotel, it's understandable. The rooms was gorgeous! Very good size and had everything needed. Toiletries, iron and board, safe, hair dryer, tea and coffee, a good amount of hangers, mini bar and free view. The balcony looked into the courtyard/gardens which was a very pretty sight and it was all very grand. Bed comfy however I was drunk when I eventually went to sleep so comfortably passed out ha. The bathroom could be bigger. Was clean and beautiful but just small which meant it got hot and wet pretty quick when showering. We paid £108 for this room which I think is a bargain. I would have been happy to pay £150. I will certainly be back in the near future. ",5,2016,02,07
121,Very nice,"Price point is reasonable for central London.  Rooms are fantastically well appointed and staff are attentative and we'll mannered.
Food and drink are of a great standard.

All in all highly recommended ",4,2016,02,07
121,Great hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for a business trip - service generally excellent with very attentive staff. Room on small side- but well appointed  / expected for central London.

Breakfast the normal help yourself model - but of good quality and reasonable selection.

Free wifi for emails / simple browsing only.

Location good - a few minutes walk from St James tube station. Buckingham Palace and Green Park just round the corner",4,2016,02,07
121,Best Hotel in London,"I'm a regular traveler to London and this has been the best hotel experience by far. The location, the comfort, the food, and most of all the warm hospitality of the staff (front office, concierge, room service, restaurants) was incredible. For my future trips to London (work or pleasure), I will look no further for hotel options.",5,2016,02,07
121,Another great stay,"Appreciate the update rooms at the hotel, love the options available for dining, no need to go elsewhere, and that the staff recognises you from previous stays. thank you for the staff for accommodating all our business meetings in the business centre and the quite rooms off the cafe area.",5,2016,02,07
121,Needs updating,"Stayed one night after watching a show. The section we stayed in desperately requires updating. the first room was unacceptable, flaking paint, chipped bath, strange smell, very small and dated bathroom.
could not allocate us another room for a couple of hours, on our return we had a new room that was still in the same section but much improved. In general I would not stay here again, the common areas need a good clean, very grubby.",3,2016,02,07
121,Review of Service of Taj hotel of Saint Jame's Park,"I am satisfied with the overall service quality of Taj Hotel. I enjoyed the staying, training venue arrangement in the hotel, the launch that was served by the Hotel . However, in breakast I missed the bread toast and boiled eggs which may be added in the Menu. The reception and departure from the hotel was also satisfactory.",5,2016,02,06
121,Good value for money,"You are in central town very close to Buckingham Palace
Warm and professional check -in compliant with our request ""quite room far from the lift"".
The room was ok well fitted, bathroom very clean.
English breakfast ok too.
The staff is taking care of you with the right balance....
As a conclusion a good choice for the two-night and much more than this the weather was shiny!!! but the hotel was not committed in that component.
We ll go back!!!!",5,2016,02,04
121,"Lovely stay - great service, hotel a little worn","Stayed in a twin room. Found the service in the hotel to be excellent - staff all very friendly and professional, willing to help. The hotel is a little worn, it shows that it is some time since it was last renovated. But we were very happy with what we got for the price we paid. We booked a deal directly on the hotel's website.",4,2016,02,04
121,great location and good value,"Spent a night here, rooms were a little small but the hotel is excellently located and was good value too. The staff are very professional and friendly - no problems with check in and check out, all very seamless. Would stay here again.",4,2016,02,04
121,perfect stay!,"Great hotel...our second visit to date and have booked again. Friendly, professional staff. Our room was generous in size and very clean. Food was exceptional. The hotel is about a 20min walk to theatre land but we love walking and booked with this in mind. Great experience overall.",5,2016,02,03
121,Top notch,"I stay in the suites and they are very nice. Quiet. Cozy. Like a little apartment. You could live in some of them. The breakfast is very nice. And the staff is attentive and remembers me each time I return. 

I come back often and have always appreciated staying here. 
",5,2016,02,02
121,Excellent Location,"I booked this hotel for my partner as a little surprise before Christmas, I booked a standard room which from the pictures looked to a good standard, the room we were given was in the corner with a view of a wall and was dated and tiny.
We complained to reception and showed the picture of the room we thought we were booking. This was quickly resolved by a duty manager (after a trainee tried to charge us for an upgrade). The new room was fantastic, a huge improvement and to the standard we initially expected. We had a nice meal at the restaurant which was good not outstanding.
The service was to a good standard and reception were amenable when we requested a late checkout (twice) at a charge.",4,2016,02,01
121,Great location,"Less than five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace, this is a very pleasant looking hotel with plush public areas and lounges, although we only stayed for one night, so we didn't get the chance to sample many of the amenities.   The bedroom was really nice with a view over the central square, but the bathroom was tiny, possibly the smallest we have had in any hotel anywhere.  At £24 for a full english breakfast, we decided to take a short walk to one of the local cafes instead.  Every member of staff we met was helpful and made us feel welcome.",3,2016,02,01
121,Needs a facelift!,"Service was OK
The furniture was ancient, rather beat up!
The room was a good size.
Every lamp shade did not match the lamp and in very sad condition!
The bathroom was really bad
Stains underneath the wax
And the tile and tub were horrible
Called housekeeping and was told it was clean
Would not use the tub! shower inside of it
Only stayed 2 nights
Great location
",2,2016,02,01
121,Can really recommend this hotel,A group of us had a fantastic stay at this hotel on Saturday.  The staff are incredibly helpful and eager to please.   We had junior suites and executive doubles which were all freshly decorated and a good size with all the required amenities. Breakfast was lovely with a well stocked buffet.  Fantastic location with so many London landmarks within easy walking distance.   We all agreed we would use the hotel again for future business and leisure trips to London.,5,2016,02,01
121,Wonderful hotel,"A busy but classy hotel in heart of London. Good facilities recently overhauled and wonderful beds and quiet restful sleep. Choice of restaurants and good food throughout.

It's not cheap but this is central London and compared to many others is that step ahead - highly recommended
",5,2016,01,31
121,Review,Good location and a very good hotel and the service in all respects appreciable would recommend to others. The architecture of the hotel building is also to be appreciated. Its near to the Bukingham Palace and St. James Park,4,2016,01,30
121,"Great Hotel, great location, excellent service","Have stayed here since 1986, and the people are great, and kind and helpful, and the food is excellent. Being near Buckingham Palace, and St. James Park, makes it an excellent neighborhood to walk and enjoy the weekend, if one is a resident there.  The public transportation (tube - underground train) is exceptionally good, and is just a quick 200 m walk away, so that all options to enjoy London without the bustle and traffic, yet right in the best part of the City.",5,2016,01,30
121,Great Location,"This is a hotel in a wonderful location and in a wonderful building.  In need of a refurbishment to match the overall image you might expect of the Taj group of hotels, great deals are currently available - take advantage while you can.  The guest room I had was dated and facilities tired and it had a stake smell - but was clean.  Common areas are rather dingy. The restaurant looks very interesting with an unusual Indian-focussed menu which attracts a star.",3,2016,01,30
121,Fantastic Stay!!!,"We stayed here on 23rd Jan, we had booked a theatre break and chose to stay at the Taj, we weren't disappointed!! 
Check in was brilliant, Muhammed was lovely and we upgraded our room to an executive for the night. Our room was lovely, up on the 4th floor, huge bed with gorgeously soft bedding and pillows so comfortable I slept amazingly well! 
The location of this hotel is excellent, it took us around 20 minutes to get here from Euston on the tubes and you're really close to Buckingham Palace and Westminster, it is just everything you need in a hotel. 
Breakfast was one of the best I've had, everything was piping hot and you can order your eggs if the scrambled option on the buffet isn't to your liking.
Staff were all really attentive here from check in, to the bar and breakfast, we had really great service from everyone and staff all said hello as you walked round the hotel. 
We were thrilled we stayed here and will definately stay again next time we visit London.",5,2016,01,29
121,St James court,"excellent staff and location. really well looked after. very knowledgeable and attention to detail with  customer care was really good. Beautiful hotel entrance, felt very spoilt. Would visit again for a weekend break",4,2016,01,27
121,Excellent Stay,Excellent hotel. Great location and a good range of restaurant choices. The staff are efficient and friendly. The hotel has a good character - but be prepared for some long corridor walks to get to your room,5,2016,01,26
121,"Excellent, but with a little noise","Our room was very large and very clean.  The bed was comfortable.  The employees were extremely friendly.  We ate at the hotel restaurant for dinner and breakfast, and both were terrific. We also had snacks and drinks at two of the hotel bars and found the staff to be attentive. The only thing I recommend is for late risers to ask for a room away from the playground.  Our room overlooked a school playground, and was very quiet on the weekend.  However, on the weekdays, the children were loudly playing between 0800-0900.  If you expect to be out of your room by then, no problem. However, if you sleep late, you may want to ask for a room in a different part of the hotel. At all other times, the room was very quiet.",5,2016,01,26
121,Very dissapointing. NOT recommended !,"I stayed for one night in room 875 at a cost of £155 room only for one person. The reception staff were excellent but that is where the enjoyment stopped. The room was classed a ""grand double"" at reception but was very unpleasant with the wall paper on every wall either marked or peeling off and stains on the seating. In the toilet some tiles were cracked with sharp edges which I actually cut myself on.  I ordered room service at a cost if £67 for soup, curry, rice, chapatti, cheese selection and 2 drinks. Again the staff member who delivered the food was excellent but the food with the exception of the soup was very poor quality and not enjoyable. There must be a school or child activities nearby as there were kids shouting with referees whistles blowing until approx 10pm. I was also woken early in the morning by the noise of kids shouting. Before leaving I visited the Bistro for breakfast and again I was very dissapointed on the quality of food on offer. I normally enjoy a full English but on this occasion left over half of it uneaten on my plate. I asked for two boiled eggs, as these are by ""special request"". After waiting 15mins I reminded the waiting staff who 4 min later arrived with the eggs. I think they had forgotten. I had to laugh as the eggs were dwarfed by the egg cups with me being unable to cut open the eggs without first removing the egg from the egg cup. I know it sounds a small issue but on top of a poor experience this just summed up my visit...eggs too small to eat in the egg cup. When leaving the restaurant and checking out I was asked how my stay had been. On both occasions I said ""very poor"" and the member of staff smiled and carried on with their business. I would have expected them to ask why but clearly this time they were just going through the motions. To be fair on the hotel the reception area, bar and restaurant look nice. The building is also impressive from the outside and has a pretty internal courtyard. That said I would not recommend this hotel to anyone given my experience and lack of interest from the staff when issues were highlighted. Not what I would expect from spending approx £250 for a one night stay plus food. NOT RECOMMENDED !. ",1,2016,01,26
121,Everything we needed.,"My boyfriend and I visited this hotel overnight from the 23rd of Jan to the 24th of Jan. We were greeted by the bell boy as soon as we arrived and our luggage was loaded out of the car almost immediately and taken to our room. My boyfriend was given some very good parking tips whilst I checked in with a very friendly member of staff. Although we didn't spend much time in the room, the room had everything we needed. A fantastic bathroom, comfortable bed and 3 mirrors! There was a TV volume switch in the bathroom but ours didn't seem to work but this didn't bother us too much. The hotel is fantastic for location. Very close to the tube and within walking distance of Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and the London Eye. Check out was seamless also.  Would definitely return. ",4,2016,01,26
121,Very pleasant relaxing hotel,"Hotel was beautiful, in a quiet and peaceful part of London, a short walk from Buckingham Palace.

Staff were really helpful and approachable.

Breakfast breakfast was amazing, especially with the Asian twists in the cooked breakfast.  The melon and clementines were lovely and sweet.

A minor negative - the room was a bit small and faded.  Little things not quite to standard.  The view wasn't the best, had to struggle to get see the courtyard.",5,2016,01,26
121,Excellent Hotel in a very good position,"This is a luxury hotel which is close to St. James Park & Buckingham palace, it is therefore south west of the centre of London. It is about a 7 minute walk from St. James' Park underground station. The bedroom was spacious & comfortable. Very good breakfast. Helpful & friendly staff.",4,2016,01,25
121,Suite ,Stayed in the family suite at this hotel. Checking was prompt and the staff were very friendly. Rooms were very comfortable and had complimentary toiletries.  The morning breakfast was very good. The lobby was inviting and the hotel had a very good feel to it. ,5,2016,01,25
121,Well proced and convenient,"We used the Taj for a long weekend in London. On arrival we decided to upgrade to a suite from a normal room for an extra £75 a night. This was well worth the price just for the extra bit of room as we had some specific activities planned. 

The rooms are well appointed, the location great for St James tube station and also walking distnace of Wesiminster, Buckingham Palace and Kensington. The hotel bar is standard London prices and my only disappointment is that i didnt get a chance to try the Michelin star restaurant on site (as i hadnt realised it was there when booking). There's always next time.",4,2016,01,25
121,St James Hotel - Taj London,Hotel service was pretty ok but furniture (eg chair) are old and 1 was broken. I have to keep fixing the chair and have fear of falling when sitting on the chair. Pillows were average. Would prefer shower gel and shampoo with more bubbles :),2,2016,01,24
121,Lovely time in St James,"it has very spacious rooms , very pleasant staff , location is good , very close to buckingham palace . i think its very safe area i enjoyed the afternoon tea & the spa close the hotel very important places 7 very pleasnt",4,2016,01,24
121,Fantastic hotel in a great London location,Luxury hotel with great service throughout. Wonderful location with St James' tube just around the corner making exploring London very easy via the District and Circle lines. Made our two night stay in London a joy.,5,2016,01,24
121,"Very, very good","Stayed one night in a junior suite a visiting a local theatre with my wife.  I'd not previously heard of this hotel so booked a junior suite, which was a similar price to a standard London king size room just to play on the safe side.  Amazing room, amazing service and amazing prices.  You get a lot for our money and the staff couldn't be more helpful close to the 2 mins from the St. James Park Station, 5 mins to Victoria and Buck Palace and walkable (about 30 mins) to both the embankment and Piccadilly Circus.  I'll definitely stay again.",5,2016,01,24
121,A bit of Indian hospitality,During the years we lived in India Taj hotels were the benchmark.  It is good to have a touch of Indian hospitality in Central London.  The Quilon restaurant is outstanding and serves the same wonderful South Indian food that was served in the Karavali in Bangalore.  For some years my favourite dinner spot.,4,2016,01,23
121,Fabulous hotel and location ,I have just returned from a night at this splendid hotel that is nothing short of perfect. Very magical with its Indian influence.  Charming staff from the door man and concierge to reception and the staff in the  hotel bar. My husband dropped his wallet and Was very quickly followed out by a member of the bar staff with his wallet in hand. Very impressive.  Superb location for lots of sightseeing as well.,5,2016,01,22
121,Relaxing stay,"Great location in this quiet but central part of London. Will definitely stay again, staff were friendly and well mannered, cocktails were yummy we had a busy schedule so did not try the restaurant  but we will next time",5,2016,01,21
121,Husbands 40th Birthday ,"I booked a one night visit to St James Court on the 12th of January to celebrate my husbands 40th Birthday,what a beautiful hotel this is
The staff are wonderful,the only slight niggle I have is I paid for an upgrade & was told we would have a courtyard view room,alas it wasn't a courtyard view,but nevertheless this didn't really spoil our time here,the room was large,immaculately clean,as is the whole hotel,probably now,our favourite UK hotel,hopefully we will be back soon ",5,2016,01,20
121,"Excellent hotel, so well situated for sightseeing","We booked this hotel when it was on offer in early January. We arrived about 11.30am and our room was ready. Joel on reception was very friendly and efficient. Our case was taken to the room, the porter asked if we wanted any help and explained a few things to us, again he was very helpful and friendly. The room was large, comfortable, good wardrobe space, kettle etc. Good quality toiletries in the bathroom ( yes a bath as well as a shower , unusual in hotels today, very nice! We found the location to be even more suitable than we had expected, just a couple of bus stops from Westminster Abbey and a short walk from Buckingham Palace (both of which we visited). As the hotel is part of the Tag group there was a strong Indian influence in the reception area which was very colourful and interesting to look at. We really enjoyed our short stay here and hope to make a return visit.",5,2016,01,20
121,Taj Buckhamgate,"Have stayed at the hotel over 70 times, great location, food is okay, for a hotel of this type needs improvement.  The hotel is a bit tired. The internet is not great, and the fitness center is in the basement. Not a lot of incentive for working out. Staff is friendly.",3,2016,01,20
121,Great Service from all,"Stayed here on 2 separate nights.   Both bookings were for Classic Double rooms, I was given a deluxe room on the first occasion and a Classic on the second but paid the same price.  The Deluxe room was very spacious with great bathroom and a turn down service.  The first Classic room I was given on the second visit was small and you could hear the underground and drilling from a nearby building site.  I asked to be moved which was dealt with swiftly to another Classic room which was much better overlooking the courtyard and bigger.  The only difference between this Classic room and the Deluxe was no turndown service was provided and the toiletries were not so plush looking.  Some of the corridors look a bit worn and the rooms are of different shapes and sizes so the comfort of your stay will depend on where your room is.  The service was excellent from the front door to the room.  We took lunch in the restaurant which was also very good.",4,2016,01,19
121,"Great hotel, excellent location!!",Stayed there for 8 nights....friendly staff...clean rooms..breakfast was served in room with no extra charge (much appreciated)..excellent location..must stay for everyone looking to stay in Central London with intentions to visit all tourist attractions.,4,2016,01,19
121,Taj - London,"Excellent hotel and stay, but lower floor room a little noisy - take a higher floor room if possible, but all in all a great place to stay. Location was perfect and within walking distance to all places of interest.",5,2016,01,18
121,Fantastic 1 night stay!!!,"Just come back from our weekend away,.  Stayed at this fantastic hotel,.  Easy check in,.  And as it was my husbands birthday they gave us an upgrade!,. Was a beautiful room (161) overlooking courtyard,.  Will b visiting again,.. Thank you for your service!!!",4,2016,01,17
121,Lovely in so many ways,"We arrived at this hotel unsure of what to expect (other than the highest standards of course!) and it truly lived up to every expectation that we had. In terms of location the St. James Court is perfectly placed for sightseeing (Buckingham palace) and also walkable to Leicester Square and Piccadilly if you're after a night out.
The hotel has a lovely sense to it upon entering through to the lobby where there is a lovely grand piano and of course a pianist providing the ambiance which we all desire. 
The walkways leading to the room have very interesting decor and lovely artefacts for your perusal whilst heading to your room.
Our room was perfect. We had an executive suite which was spacious and provided more amenities than we could have asked for. The king sized bed was located around a wall (making it almost like a separated bedroom) with a decent sized lounge in the centre and a large bathroom to the other side. All in all it would've been great if we had more time to actually spend time and enjoy the room, but being so central there was just too much exploration in the surroundings. A couple of things that I thought were fab was that there was more than the usual toiletries in the bathroom which is something I always struggle with (having long hair and never having enough conditioner). And the toiletries were actually high quality as opposed to the provisions of some of the 5 star properties in which I have visited. The other positive thing was being able to listen to the remainder of the news when you're having your morning shower.. the bathroom had a separated speaker synchronised to play what is on your television - this is always a perk to find.
With regards to the food aspect although we didn't try the signature rosette restaurant we did enjoy a 3 course dinner and for the price it was substantial. I would definitely recommend getting into the rosette restaurant if you're after an evening meal as the meal that we had was definitely substantial as previously mentioned, however it did not have the wow factor that some may crave.
The breakfast in the morning was lovely and fresh poached eggs which don't take the entire morning to cook... Who could complain. 
The next best thing would have to be the staff. The staff are very lovely from the check in, to dinner, to breakfast which shows the overall standard that the hotel provides.
Would I recommend this to others...? Most definitely. You will not be disappointed... Or at least I was most certainly not disappointed from my time at St. James.",5,2016,01,17
121,great value,"stayed for 4 nights mid week, this hotel has everything you need. the staff were very helpful and friendly and the location for what we needed was brilliant. We would defiantly look to book this hotel again.",5,2016,01,17
121,Best Service- As expected from a Taj Property,"Amazing staff, real good quality of customer service- Amazing food! Very helpful staff. I enjoyed every minute in this hotel, to rooms have all the modern amenities, very comfortable and cozy. The location is so perfect!",5,2016,01,17
121,"Dreadful Room, nothing like the website",Tiny tired horrible room overlooking a school playground. Nothing like the website. Telephone didn't work. Long walk from guest lift to bedroom.  Only positive was it's in a good central location close to Buckingham Palace and Mayfair etc.........,1,2016,01,14
121,Need of an update,This isn't a cheap hotel we stayed for 2 nights the first night was horrid the hotel put us in room 370 do not stay in that room if your a light sleeper because u here the air con outside your window all night also the room hadn't been updated in about 15 years the bathroom stank of urine we complained in the morning about the smell and noise and we're given an upgrade that room had been refurbished recently if all rooms were to that standard I'd stay again but it's not that great a value,3,2016,01,14
121,"Excellent hotel, staff and location.","I stayed here at the end of December. We enjoyed every day we stayed at this hotel. The rooms were comfortable, quite, big and we could control our own heat temp.  The beds were comfortable.  Every person who works here were extremely helpful, nice and happy you were staying there. I will definitely stay here and recommend this hotel to my family and friends. This hotel is a 4 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and 10 minute walk to Big Ben. Very convenient location.",5,2016,01,12
121,Weekend Break,"Used this hotel only because close to Theatre we were going to, but turned out to a great experience. The St James Court is a great hotel with great helpful staff. Visited in January but already have to decided to go back in spring.",5,2016,01,12
121,Amazing Hotel and Service,"One of the best hotels in London with an amazing staff.
The food is excellent in all their restaurants.
Standard room needs some updation and relatively small, had to take an upgrade.
Over all experience very good",4,2016,01,12
121,Great Hotel/Great Location!,"I stayed here for Christmas 2015 and loved it! This hotel is conveniently located near Buckingham Palace and is walking distance to all of the major sites. The staff is very friendly, welcoming and helpful. I actually forgot my USB drive for work in the room and did not realize until I returned to NY. I contacted the hotel the day after checkout and they were able to find it, and ship it out to me. I received it within a week. I am grateful for the attention to detail and prompt service. I would most definitely stay here again when in London.",5,2016,01,12
121,taj as always the very finest,"If you want luxury and personal service this is the hotel for you. The rooms are excellent ,spacious and with the most comfortable beds, The staff from reception onwards are amazing. and make you so welcome.   .All of the restaurants have fantastic quality dining  and a great variety. Cant recommend it more highly.",5,2016,01,12
121,"Wonderful staff, great hotel! ***** stars! ","I was on holiday in London two weeks. I really happy  for my this experience and as well big thank you for the staff, they was amazing,great and really friendly. Big thanks to support me, help me, and fell like at home at Chiara Marfia  to be patiently with me. Thank you again, and se you soon!  ",5,2016,01,12
121,Last Weekend,We enjoyed our latest visit as much as previous stays. Every detail was covered and the standard of accommodation and service is first rate. The staff are efficient and charming.  The bottom line is that we have already booked for our next visit to London.,5,2016,01,12
121,"Excellent hotel, very well located","We stayed 3 nights in this hotel, Friday to Sunday, and were very pleased with everything. The staff were excellent, especially Debora on reception. We had asked for a garden view room, and this was made available by 12.00 even though check-in was not officially until 2pm. Very comfy bed. My wife appreciated the socked under the mirror for the hair dryer. Small bathroom, but all worked - the only possible criticism would be the lack of an extractor fan.

Breakfast was the usual buffet style, with plenty of choice, both normal and Gluten Free. We did not take any other meals in the hotel. 

Perfect location for Buckingham Palace, Queens Gallery, Westminster, etc, all within 10 minutes walk. Would we stay here again? Yes, definitely.",5,2016,01,11
121,Taj London,"I liked my stay in the hotel - situation is excellent (central part of London), staff is very helpful and friendly (except in the breakfast room, where they were lurking over my head with a bill and clearly indicated that they were waiting for me to leave), rooms are clean and have all the necessary itens for a convenient stay. Restaurants (Bank and others) are exceptional.",4,2016,01,11
121,Superb All Round Hotel,"Just spent a night in this wonderful place. Like many others have written, the staff here are just terrific....it's difficult to describe how efficient and friendly they are until you experience it. A small problem problem with our shower was dealt with by the manager in a prompt and courteous manner. Every single thing has been thought of in the room (we had a classic king), from the bed linen to the night light in the bathroom. The cocktail bar is a little expensive but it's hard not to enjoy it with a piano and double bass playing in the background!

If you need a place to stay in central London then this is definitely the place to be. It's probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2016,01,11
121,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed for two nights in a king room and was delighted with every aspect of the hotel. Everyone is exceptionally friendly, the room was elegantly decorated, bed comfortable and quiet so we had a great nights sleep on both nights. Breakfast was good and had lots of choice. I ordered a birthday cake for my husband and it was waiting for us in our room on arrival and it was really well decorated and tasted great. We ate in one of their resturants Kona, and was delighted by both the food (especially the desserts) and the service. The hotel is in a great location which was easy to walk to Covent Garden to see a show and is near to Victoria station. Overall we were extremely pleased with our stay and will definitely return.",5,2016,01,10
121,London Stay at the St James Court,"Just be aware that not all the rooms and suites are upgraded and the one we got had no resemblance to the website photos, it was old and tired. The service was excellent and we were soon given another suite at a small charge. The hotel common areas are old and in need of attention(Corridors and stairs), the breakfast(cooked) was not good and looked like it had been on a hot plate for some time prior to being served. The hotel is in a great location and the service from reception and the door was great but the hotel is let down by the overall state of repair and lack of any attention to detail.",2,2016,01,08
121,Value for Money,"Very High Standard of Hygiene, Hospitality and sevice with smile. Make you feel at home. Quality of food and the Spread is excellent. Difficult to say what more is needed to make it better. Highly recommendable to friends who are looking for a good address and value for money.",5,2016,01,08
121,Wonderful stay,"You can't beat the location.  The price was reasonable for the quality and amount of amenities.  There are several restaurants and a lounge. The staff are very professional.  The room service food was stellar and quick.   When I arrived from a stay in Rome I had a bit of a cold so I ordered some tea and an appetizer and relaxed.  The food was wonderful.  When I woke up the next morning I was refreshed and felt so much better.  The room and the bed were so comfortable; a perfect temperature.  I was able to tour non-stop for my next 3 days.  The concierge were very helpful in recommending a restaurant and helping me get tickets to a play and of course also with directions.  I felt like a queen staying here.  I'm definitely staying here again when I return to London.  For a single girl, I felt safe and well taken care of.  Easy trip.",5,2016,01,07
121,Lovely hotel.,"We stayed one night in this hotel just after Christmas. It was a gift from our son-in-law and he and our daughter also stayed there. It is a lovely hotel with plenty of space- we had a suite with a sitting room, bedroom, dressing room and shower room. I appreciated the fact that we had two televisions, one in the sitting room and one in the bedroom. We also had a kettle and a bowl of fruit when we arrived. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening, so I can't comment on the food,but breakfast was self-service and there was everything you could possibly want! Service was & attentive and charming and we thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay, before moving next door to 51 Buckingham Gate, which was the second part of our present and which I shall also review! Both hotels were extremely centrally situated and there was an underground station within a short walk.",5,2016,01,06
121,Perfect Christmas Week!,"I had the most memorable stay possible at your hotel over Christmas! I was traveling solo for the holiday. I found your hotel randomly on the internet and later discovered a friend had stayed there solo a year or so ago and said it was a welcoming and safe place for a woman traveling alone.

When I arrived Christmas Eve morning both of my requests for an early checkin and specific room had been met. From the first young man I met up with when I accidently wandered in the back door through the bar to the woman who checked me in to the doormen to the concierge to the bartenders and waitstaff, everyone was helpful, positive and friendly.

When I arrived on Christmas Eve, I’d made no plans for Christmas day dinner and a gentleman in the restaurant found me a single table booking early afternoon on Christmas which worked perfectly. Sometimes when I eat alone in a high end restaurant, I feel rushed by the wait staff. That was definitely not the case on Christmas Day. I savored my meal, enjoyed a book and next thing I knew I’d been there almost three hours – what a luxury!

My room was much larger than I expected, pristinely clean and quiet. I felt completely safe in the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. I was especially grateful for the time a couple of the concierge staff took to help me find tube and walking routes throughout my visit. The bar staff, also, were so welcoming. After the first night, the bartender remembered my nightcap wine, and all were so friendly!

All in all – the hotel staff gave me a Christmas gift I never expected. In a job where I imagine you frequently get more complaints than complements, you need to know you have a very satisfied customer in me. I will certainly return!",5,2016,01,05
121,Excellent location could do better on breakfast,"Excellent location, staff are very helpful. Room amenities ok, they do need to update their televisions, many are extremely small and the software system very slow. The breakfast is pretty basic for a hotel of this standard and often extremely busy, not somewhere to have a leisurely time. Gym is small but has a good selection of equipment. ",3,2016,01,05
121,Very good service,Our experience at the Taj has been excellent and very good service from everyone incl front desk and housekeeping etc. Chiara at front desk was extremely helpful. Food is also very good especially if u like Indian. And good location nearby to Westminster and also St James tube station and easy access to cabs.,5,2016,01,04
121,Good location. Dated rooms,Myself and my family booked a couple of rooms in December. The rooms were relatively spacious but dated. The bathrooms looked worse for wear and could do with modernising. The location itself is 5 min walk from Buckingham palace which is amazing and the breakfast and service was very good. ,4,2016,01,04
121,Good looking property - but avoid if you're after a good suite or good service.,"Called in to book a suite here and specifically asked for one on a higher floor with a good view. 

After checking in, found that neither requests had been fulfilled. Upon calling the front desk, was basically told that none of the suites had good views as they were located at the rear of the hotels (where there is reason to keep the blinds closed). Was also told that while there were rooms available on lower floors, none were available on higher floors. 

A few hours before check out, I tried repeatedly to call to ask for late check-out or possibly for another night due to some unexpected circumstances. The call was diverted and the person told me that i'd receive a call back from the front desk. Over an hour later, I did not receive any call back and decided to immediately check out from the hotel and headed straight to an airport lounge. 

Having stayed in Taj properties in Sri Lanka and India I went here with high expectations and was utterly disappointed. 

Despite the lovely lounge which has a very good pianist in the evenings, I would not recommend this place to anyone.

ps I did submit feedback about my concerns to the hotel and there was absolutely no attempt to make amends.",2,2016,01,03
121,High quality stay in London,"If you have business in Central London, this is the place to be. I have been staying in this hotel for several years and I am yet to experience anything short of top notch service.  From the check in till check out you will witness a consistently good team of dedicated professionals who keep the hotel and the guest rooms spotlessly clean. The breakfast at the St James is awesome and having a Michelin starred Indian eatery - The Quilon - next door  is another reason why I am regular here.",5,2016,01,03
121,Very good business hotel in Westminster,"I have used this hotel about 10 times when attending a Conference in Westminster. Short walking distance to the conference. The hotel has good facilities, among others a good fitness room. Very kind personell and good service in general.",4,2016,01,03
121,Great Hotel for a Holiday Getaway!,"My family enjoyed a delightful stay at the St. James Court over the Christmas holiday. We requested adjoining or adjacent rooms since we were traveling with our two teenage daughters who are long past the age that they can share a room with us. The hotel gave us rooms across the hall from one another and at the end of a long corridor, with a door available to close us off from the rest of the corridor. Very convenient and it gave the feeling of a family suite. We found the rooms to be of a very generous size, having stayed in places in London and elsewhere in Europe that were incredibly cramped. The bathroom had been updated. It was a trifle small, but very nicely outfitted. The rooms were clean as a whistle, the furniture was comfortable and accommodating. I can't say much about the view, since our room opened on to a very narrow space between two wings of the building - all we saw was a few pigeons that had gotten past the preventive netting! The staff were all extremely professional and cordial, particularly at the front of the house (reception, door, concierge). As many others have pointed out, the location is ideal - walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, several parks, etc. We only ate at one of the restaurants (there are several), and we found the food at Bistro 51 to be very good. Our only complaint - and it is slight - would be that the service in the food and drink establishments was a little stiff. Everyone was very welcoming, but the restaurant seemed determined to push their prix fixe menu and appeared a little flummoxed when we ordered a la carte. The servers in the bar area fared a bit better, but could have been a bit more sensitive in noticing when we were ready for our check. These are minor quibbles, though. We recommend this establishment very highly, and we will certainly do our best to return to this hotel when we make it back to London.",5,2016,01,02
121,My first choice hotel in London. ,"Outstanding hotel in a perfect location to explore Our Capital City. 
We decided to make our visits to London more enjoyable and found St James Court hotel fits perfectly our requirements. It is a very comfortable with Great facilities. 
Be prepared to pay a little more for comfort and exceptional service delivered by the friendly Staff. ",5,2016,01,02
121,NYE stay,"I stayed here with my Fiance for New Years Eve. We loved it, the location was perfect, the staff  couldn't do enough and we're so hardworking. We had a room overlooking the courtyard, was lovely. We had a 3 course meal at the Bank restaurant which was fantastic.
We liked it that much we have booked to go for a Valentines break.",5,2016,01,01
121,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel very clean and the hotel staff were very polite and  friendly.  The location was  good walking distance from Victoria  station. It was my mum's 75th Birthday and the hotel arranged a cake to the room, which was a nice surprise for her.",5,2016,01,01
121,Sadly pretty poor for a 4 star hotel...,"Stayed here over NYE to be centrally located and were quite excited for it. The rooms were clean (but tiny) and staff friendly, however, given the price one is expected to pay and my personal experience with Taj hotels elsewhere in the world St James' court fell short of expectations.

Firstly and worst of the concierge forgot our wake up call. We had trains and flights to catch and had luckily set a later alarm and just about made it.

Secondly, the rooms are tiny, bathrooms a bit old and the room had an odd smell, we couldnt quite place it but would tip that someone had smoked something in there.

Thirdly the hotel has a fair bit of wear and tear. The corridor walls (we stayed on the second floor) had stains, doors and walls had scratch marks in the paint. Anywhere else I would say fine the hotel needs renovation but with a 4 star hotel thats also part of the Taj group I am not willing to accept such a physical state as fine. 

Fourthly, the wifi signal in our room was weak to non-existant.

The hotel has lovely staff, a great location and good architecture going for it but it could be so much more... There are cheaper hotels in a better state around London. ",2,2016,01,01
121,Weekend break,Hotel was of a good quality with lavish entrance and reception. We had a standard double and this was also very well presented - good location for the Victoria Palace theatre also very close to Buckingham Palace. Staff were very welcoming - we had a breakfast included which was buffet style English breakfast and was set in pleasant surroundings - enjoyed our stay,5,2015,12,29
121,Delightful,"The building complex of the hotel is a delight and seemingly has been restored to the ""old"" state. The staff throughout were very helpful and friendly. I didn't use any of the restaurants, just room service once. The kadai paneer was for me as a non-Indian very tasty and a joy to eat. On the whole a very positive experience, certainly to be repeated.
Two niggles: while as a smoker I appreciate the smokers' location with its heaters, it would have been nice if the ashtrays would have been emptied more often, they were full to overflowing on several occasions. It seems that the staff in several areas (the breakfast room and the bar) are rather badly organised. On more than one occasion I was asked for my order by 3-4 people.",5,2015,12,29
121,Excellent Hotel and Location,"The TAj St. James s a wonderful hotel. The location is perfect:  a short walk to Westminster in one direction, Victoria Station in another, and Buckingham Palace in another. The St. James tube station is a two-minute walk. The hotel staff was always pleasant and helpful. The breakfast buffet was delicious and plentiful.The room was comfortable and clean. Our room was overlooking the back courtyard and was very quiet. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,12,29
121,Elegant and Convenient,Very comfortable hotel recently complete refurbished and it shows. Helpful and friendly staff. Didn't eat there this time so cannot comment on this. London is a very expensive city but we think this reasonable value for money and was in the perfect location for what we had to do.,5,2015,12,29
121,London Break,"Comfortable and friendly hotel, well situated for the best of London. Pity that the rooms are on the small side of cosy.... Breakfast was good. Could not fault the service, concierge, reception. UK hotels have come a long way in the customer care stakes over the last 20 years.....",4,2015,12,28
121,Hotel with Charm,"This is a beautiful, comfortable, and friendly hotel that is close to everything.  The staff is helpful and dedicated to your being satisfied.  Its history adds to its charm.  I will recommend this place to my friends and colleagues as its location to sights, the tube, and good restaurants is so close.  No complaints.",5,2015,12,28
121,A lovely hotel with charming staff,"We had a very comfortable room here. All the staff are friendly and very helpful. The cocktails are great! Breakfast was good too. Very convenient and quiet position, right by the Tube and St James' Park. We will definitely return.",5,2015,12,24
121,St James great venue,"Nice and classic spot in the middle of London. Good value for the bucks. Rooms will vary in size, but all are mostly comfortable enough for a good stay. Breakfast is enjoyable, all the basics are there plus some more. The bar and cocktails deserve a visit.",5,2015,12,23
121,St James Court,"5* service, helpful staff, generous breakfast, convenient location, lovely interiors, quiet room (even with air conditioning), attention to every detail just brilliant. Will go again without hesitation, if we can get a similar room and rate!",5,2015,12,23
121,Save your money.,"Stayed here for week in June. Considering what we paid, not nearly worth it (and I know London hotels are expensive). 
Lobby is very elegant - that's the only good thing I have to say about the place.
First mistake - we booked a ""Classic"" room. Didn't realize that ""classic"" meant I'd be taken back to Victorian accommodation (and not in a good way....). Oddly shaped room, well past its prime, with aged, stained carpets, peeling wallpaper, etc. But topper was toilet - I've been to Europe many times - never have I seen such a thing. It was only after having housekeeping come and show us how to operate the pumping mechanism that we were able to actually flush it. And that wasn't the last housekeeping visit - they were back less than an hour later when my wife wasn't able to drain the tub. Housekeeping's solution - to remove the plug mechanism altogether and leave it on the side of the tub! Needless to say, we soon after demanded a new room and after first saying there weren't any, they relented and upgraded us to an ""Executive"" room - on the condition that we paid the upgraded price of course. Shall I go on? Even in ""Executive"" room, was driven crazy by bathtub drain mechanism not at far end of tub where one would expect it to be but closer to the centre - in fact exactly where one would normally stand for a shower. Overall new room was fine, but not nearly worth the small fortune we paid for it.
A few months prior I stayed at a much less expensive ""chain"" hotel (see my earlier London hotel review) and it was a million times better than this place. Would gladly spend a little longer on the tube to avoid paying for this entirely unremarkable place.",2,2015,12,22
121,A home away from home,"The Taj establishment is my preferred place to stay whenever I am in London. Familiarity plays its role, but the staff's welcoming attitude and the hotel's location are even bigger draws.   Location. A short walk away from Victoria station, St. James Court is well-connected by the District and Circle Lines, as well as by bus. You can walk up to the St James park when you fancy nature and equally you can just jump on to a bus and be off to the West End.   Service and staff. The Taj service ensures you feel at home as soon as you walk in. On this trip I landed early in the morning after a long overnight flight, and the last thing I wanted was to be told that 'check in starts only at 2'. I walked up to the reception, steeling myself for the argument, but nothing happened. Alex at the reception simply asked me to confirm the details and then handed me the keys. Wow.   Will definitely be back.",5,2015,12,22
121,The Best Hotel in London,Beautiful hotel with a wonderfull Staff. The rooms are very comfortable and nice decoration. The breakfast with quality and many choice. The best Hotel in London near the Buckingham Palace and Victoria Street.,5,2015,12,22
121,Great Stay,"We stayed here for our anniversary and from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we were treated so well. The room was fantastic... not overly spacious but so clean and well laid out. The staff were great. And iur breakfast was great too.

Overall i would recommend this hotel. It is a stones throw from buckingham palace and victoria.",5,2015,12,21
121,"Beautiful, elegant and great service","Since you arrive at the hotel, you realize you have arrived to a place where you will be pampered and taken well care of. The lobby is really pretty and elegant, the garden is so nice!! you can have dinner and drinks there. Everybody is very nice to you regardless of your age. The location is good, since you are just behind Buckingham Palace, the only problem you have to walk a lot, but there is a subway station nearby.",5,2015,12,21
121,Perfect,"Great location, beautifully presented hotel, the staff were all friendly, the room was warm, comfortable and for us it was a perfect weekend break.  The location is very close to Buckingham Palace and plenty of green space to access too. Will definitely go back one day.",5,2015,12,21
121,Super convenient location,"I stayed in December for 3 days. It's 5 minutes walk to the Buckingham palace and St. James park. In 20 min, you can get to big Ben and other attractions.

The breakfast was good with a different Indian item each day. The masala chai was great.",4,2015,12,20
121,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed for the weekend for my 40th birthday and found the hotel fantastic. Lovely courtyard view room which was lovely and had a very comfortable bed and great facilities. There was a wonderful birthday desert waiting in the room on my arrival which was wonderful. The staff were fantastic, polite and very helpful. Will definitely return. ",5,2015,12,20
121,A “Moderately Good” Five-Star Hotel,"My partner and I checked into the St. James’ Court earlier this year. The lobby is a little crowded, but beautiful all the same (8/10). The staff are excellent, apart from one (10/10). The restaurants and food truly scrumptious (10/10). The rooms are slightly cramped and feel condensed, BUT be warned, because we had reserved a Queen’s Size Bedroom and upon admission, the check-in staff member persuaded us to upgrade to a King Size Bedroom which she alleged had a courtyard view. The room itself wasn’t too bad, but the view of the courtyard was no real view or even a “half-view.” The en-suite bathroom was so tiny you could literally brush your teeth and lean over the basin whilst sitting on the lavatory at the same time! The bed and mattress, however, were to die for. Overall room score (6/10). What RUINED the end of the stay was a rude waitress in the hotel dining room who visibly showed how annoyed she was at having to serve us and another couple dinner at after 9:00p.m. This horrible experience was enough to make me think about never coming back to the hotel, but I still can’t dismiss all of the positives from my mind about the rest of the staff, the food and restaurants, the bed and the hotel’s perfect central location…",5,2015,12,20
121,extreme kindness,"nothing seems impossible within this place where the whole staff iss dedicated to make one's stay as enjoyable as possible. We recommend in particular the arrached Indian restaurant The Quinon, in our opinion the best of its category anywhere. Also the lounge bar with its exquisite furnishing is an oasis of relaxed and joyful spirit",5,2015,12,19
121,What an AMAZING place to stay,"We spent a long weekend here last weekend.  The hotel, staff and service was amazing.  Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated.  The staff were so helpful and courteous.
The location of the hotel is fabulous.  So many well know landmarks within walking distance.. Buckingham Palace, Westminster.. etc

We used the hotel's spa.  It was wonderful, strongly recommend you visit.

We had a fabulous time and would definitely book to stay here again.",5,2015,12,19
121,Weekend Away,I have to say i have stayed at some wonderful and some terrible hotels but this hotel is a must if your in London and want to be near too Buckingham Palace this hotel is the very best the service was 1st class the staff are so helpful and very curious there is nothing they will not do to help you i will defiantly stay here again and very local to st James tube stop,5,2015,12,18
121,nice but noisy,"goog hotel with nice room but no vieuw and a lot of noise besides that it is a nice hotel with a beautiful look and kind people in the lobby When the noise problem is solved(also air co machines outside our room, then we come backi",3,2015,12,17
121,Luxury in Central but Quiet Location,"We had a three night stay in a classic King room overlooking the late Victorian courtyard.  The room had a small but adequate bathroom but the bedroom was a very good size, with all the usual requirements and a very comfy bed.  I especially liked the fact that I could actually open the window. Wherever we encountered staff, they were friendly and courteous, and our Receptionist even arranged for a small birthday treat (lovely choc cake) for my husband.  We took the buffet breakfast at the hotel which was very tasty, and again, nothing too much trouble - my husband fancied grilled tomatoes which were not on display so the kitchen quickly provided them.   After our evenings out, we came back to have cocktails in the bar which had a jazz pianist and double bassist.   If you preferred something a little louder, there is a further larger cocktail bar.
The hotel has easy access to Victoria Street, so one way for the station and the other for Big Ben, Westminster Abbey.  It is in within easy reach of Buckingham Palace, and reasonable walking distance of most of the attractions of central London.   

The only suggestions I would make to the hotel, is to think about having a plug in the mini bar area - we had to carry the kettle across the room to use it.  And as I think about a lot of hotels, it would be nice to have a hook on the door or near the door, for outdoor coats which can take up a lot of room in the wardrobe.  All in all, though, having discovered this hotel, I would certainly be happy to stay again.",5,2015,12,16
121,Brilliant hotel,Excellent stylish hotel with spacious rooms and brilliant service nothing was too much trouble and they really went the extra mile to enjoy our stay! The breakfast was also spot on and there were plenty of options to choose from.,5,2015,12,16
121,Beautiful Comfortable Stay,"I have spent about a 20 days at this hotel over the last two months. It's very well maintained and the furnishings are first rate. I have stayed in two different types of rooms: an executive King and a Jr Suite. Both rooms were comfortable and spacious. The basic wifi is free, but if you are planning to do anything other than check email you might want to upgrade. The free service definitely slows down to an almost unusable speed during the evening and night. The rooms do have one American style electrical plug at the desk, but be sure to bring your adapters. The closet space is also a little small. I had three suits and dress shirts and there was just enough room to squeeze them in.
My package included breakfast and there are American items on the buffet such as scrambled eggs, but by and large it's mostly a European breakfast. I had no complaints. 
The gym is good and the equipment is fairly new. There are separate rooms for weights and cardio. There is also another room reserved for classes. It looks like they have equipment for a spin class, but nothing was ever going on when I was using the gym.
The lounge is nice and crowded around 7pm, but wait an hour and it clears out fairly quick. Service is good and you get olives and bar mix with your drink order. I ate at the lounge a couple times and the food was good - pricey, but it is London.
There is a nice courtyard off the lounge that has tables, chairs and heaters (I was there in November and December). If you are cigar smoker, this was a nice plus.
You can't beat the location. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Cathedral and if your ambitious you can walk along the Thames or into central London. Saint James Tube station is a short walk away and Victoria Station can be walked to in about 10 minutes. One other plus: there is a dry cleaners just a few blocks down on Buckingham Gate.",5,2015,12,16
121,Perfect ,The perfect stay so far for me. Amazing location and great service. It has a good touch of class. Everything is nice. Plan your breakfast time well. The restaurant is always busy. The place is well maintained and legendary service of Taj makes it special. 👍👍👍 cheers!!! ,5,2015,12,15
121,"Gorgeous Hotel, Superb Location","We booked this hotel for a night out in London for my husband's birthday and chose it as it was reasonably priced and in a great location. We arrived early, but were able to check in straight away, which was great. The staff were exceptionally helpful and super efficient, and the foyer and entrance to the hotel were very clean & quite impressive with a lovely bar (with piano) and comfy but classy seating area. Our room was tucked away towards the back of the hotel on the 5th floor, which was great for us as it was very quiet although quite a walk to get to the lifts and back out of the hotel, which wasn't a problem for us, but something to bear in mind if you have mobility issues. The room was very clean and comfortable with all the amenities we were expecting. We did have an issue with the television not working which, unfortunately, wasn't resolved until the following morning, however, that was only a minor blip. It is a very big hotel, but I must say we were made to feel special as they left some birthday cake in our room, which was a lovely personal touch. The location of the hotel is superb for people wanting to wander into the various tourist spots without using the tube. Buckingham Palace is a short walk from the hotel, and from there you can wander down The Mall and on towards Trafalgar Square. We walked from Waterloo Station to the hotel when we first arrived in London, which is a great walk along the south bank and across Westminster Bridge. We didn't eat at the hotel at all, we decided not to pay for breakfast as it was £24 each and we are not huge breakfast eaters. There is a really nice, smart little cafe just across the road, so we nipped in there for a bite to eat before we checked out. Well worth a stay if you want a great location and a comfy night's sleep.",4,2015,12,15
121,London stay,"Great choice for hotel stay in London with great value, great service & a great location. A very friendly & professional staff with easy check in process. The concierge desk is extremely helpful. Steps away from the beautiful St, James Park & the Buckingham Palace & the tube station.",4,2015,12,15
121,Fantastic hotel,My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The staf were very helpful and welcoming. The bed was incredibly comfy and the room was cosy and quiet. There was even a piano and double bassist playing in the lobby on Saturday night. This is our new favourite hotel in London.,5,2015,12,15
121,Excellent Hotel - My favourite in London!,"Lovely again, as usual. The Taj St James has one of the nicest lobby experiences ever! The lounge and lobby bar are comfortable, cozy. Christmas Tree beautifully decorated. Every room is different so it's always an adventure. Really look forward to my stays at this hotel.",5,2015,12,15
121,Another Amazing Stay,"I stayed at St. James Court for the 2nd time in six months time, and it was even better from the last time. I was given a Junior Suite as I mentioned in my booking that I need a big room and even my check-out was extended till 6pm upon my request. I was provided with everything I as the staff and the concierge is really helpful and made booking at Quilon (a must try restaurant if you staying at the hotel or anywhere in London). It all went smooth and I will surely be coming back here for another wonderful experience.",5,2015,12,14
121,Beautiful historic hotel with impeccable service.,"As a frequent traveler to London, I have found that this hotel is my favorite in Westminster.  It is conveniently located to the Victoria tube station but well away from noise and crowds. The rooms are beautiful, very comfortable and the service is excellent.",5,2015,12,14
121,Just right for us,"Minor critisisms - Signage on the bedroom floor could be improved; back lift ( elevator) poorly identified and encourages walking through court yard raising issues related to weather and security. 
Restaurant for breakfast and evening meal before travelling surprisingly good",4,2015,12,13
121,Awesome location - Taj Hotel in London,"Very convenient location near buckingham palace and walking distance from London Eye, Big ben and Thames river. Good buffet breakfast in morning and courteous staff. Rooms were very comfortable. Great many options within the hotel for dining and good connectivity with the local train station and bus stops. Room sizes are relatively small but cant complain on this in London!",4,2015,12,13
121,Another great experience!,"We came here in the summer of this year and and loved it so much that as birthday treat we would return in December. We booked on line and got a good room rate  from ""Late Rooms .Com"".  Then we received an email from St James' Court thanking us for our feedback from our previous stay offering an upgrade to one of the Executive room for a small charge, which we of course took.
On arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile and a "" good morning"" as every one is from the doorman, reciptionests and housekeepers. You are treated like Royalty and made very welcome.
I had forgotten I mentioned that we staying in London as a Birthday treat, but later that day room service knocked on the door and presented a little cake, what a lovely and thoughtful touch.
The reception is decked out for Christmas very tastefully as is the courtyard area. Again can not praise this hotel too highly, I'm sure we will be back again soon.
Thank you to all staff that made our stay special, and not to forget the hundreds of roller skating Father Christmas's that passed the front of the hotel Saturday night!! Fabulous!!",5,2015,12,13
121,Very good,"The hotel is very clean and all the staff are so friendly and helpful. All the restaurants are great as well. The service in generell is great. The place, where the hotel is located in fantastic. 5 minutes to Buckingham Palace, 15 minutes to Westminster and 30 minutes to Harrods by feet. I recommand this hotel very much.",4,2015,12,13
121,Disappointing stay,"Of all my Taj hotel stays, this was probably the worst. Let me highlight good and not so good aspects of my experience.

Negatives:
View from the room: let me tell you, courtyard view is over-hyped. I requested for courtyard view and at the time of check-in I was told that my room has courtyard view, but it didn't. After 3 room changes (which I will mention subsequently), my 4th room had courtyard view but it was just ok. None of the rooms of the hotel have spectacular views, so don't bother paying additional for it.

Bed type: I booked king size room and what I was offered was twin beds joined together, which is marketed as king size by the hotel. Most of the rooms are like that, and the bed quality was sub-par. I couldn't sleep properly. I went through many problems and eventually my room was changed after 1-2 days to my original booking of king-size. If you are particular about bed-type, ensure that at the time of check-in.

Room: Classic rooms are very dull and need serious refurbishment. My room smelt bed, door handles were broken (photo attached), paint chipping off. Really no decor whatsoever.

Hotel staff: This is the most important attribute for any hotel, and this is where St James hotel failed in my opinion. Few of the front desk associates, duty manager, concierge folks were not helpful, super-boasting, and arrogant at times. They do not make any exceptions (e.g. room upgrade etc.), still they say that they did and will you make you realize multiple times. No trace of humility, or true hospitality whatsoever.

Loyalty (Taj innercircle): Taj loyalty is useless, you get no benefits at the hotel. Even worse, hotel sends wrong billing info to the innercircle team, and you don't get points that you deserve

Internet: Free internet is very slow (256 kbps), feels like you are in early 2000s

Billing: My final bill had many transactions which should not have been there, e.g. paid internet, food bills (which should have been adjusted for credit as part of my room rate). They removed it only after highlighting, and then said they are doing it as an exception (even though it was their mistake). I was flabbergasted by their response.

Well inspite of all these, I gave 3 star to the hotel due to some positive aspects...

Location: It couldn't be better. Next to Buckingham palace, St. James park, Hyde park etc.. I went for morning runs to nearby parks which were so close, and it was heavenly.

Dining: I must say, restaurants of the hotel are top class, and probably the best in London! I tried breakfast and dinner at Bistro and and it was wonderful. Dining at Kona was superb, food was delicious and service was warm and friendly. Experience was so good that I wanted to spend more and more time there :) I really wanted to try at Quilon, and gold afternoon tea but didn't get enough time in this trip.

Post stay interaction: I highlighted my concerns after my stay in a survey form that was sent, and I received a prompt email from Mr. Riches. He was genuinely concerned about my experience, offered a credit of first night stay, and promised to take corrective action. I very well appreciate his gesture and intent to make improvement to ensure true Taj hospitality.",3,2015,12,12
121,Great stay,"Partners birthday experience. Hotel was out absolutely brilliant, couldn't fault it. Ideal location for us. Food was wonderful, reasonably priced and staff were very friendly. I would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2015,12,11
121,Excellent hotel,A 2 minute walk from St. James's Park station (circle and district lines). Really comfortable beds and quiet room. All type of amenities in room. Excellent breakfast (until 11 am). Staff really friendly.  5 minutes walking distance to Buckingham Palace and 10 minutes to Westminster.We will come back.,5,2015,12,10
121,Wonderful Experience,"Fantastic hotel, staff are great and the food and drinks excellent.  Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the capitol, it is close enough to get around by taxi for £10 Soho/West end or a short walk to Buckingham Palace.",5,2015,12,09
121,At the center of a circle,"If you want to stay at the center of a circle of London, then you might choose this hotel. Perfect thing is the location. You can find the Queen's accommodation, Just few steps, actually more than few steps, after cames out of your hotel. I beleive it is very important for someone to see queen's guard and their traditional changing, but not for me. However I recommend that you should check the room you want to stay carefully on arrival.",3,2015,12,09
121,St James court experience,"My wife and I stayed overnight on the 5th December, we had the menu degustation (eating a course in different restaurants) it was a truly memorable dinner, the service was excellent,the room was spacious and clean, all the staff were very engaging and professional, we would definately recomend this hotel to our friends.",5,2015,12,09
121,Wedding Reception,"We celebrated our daughter’s wedding with a London Reception for our family and friends who could not be with us in Kenmare, Ireland  three weeks earlier. The venue was exactly what we were looking for in terms of luxury, ambience, food, and location. We had sole use of the Edwardian and Buckingham Rooms for the day and the exclusive entrance to the venue was a huge plus. 
Carolina, Abdul, Fabrice and all the staff, were thoroughly professional in the run up to and amazing during the course of the evening - we cannot praise them enough. The food was just superb and beautifully plated. Chef Yogesh's pride in the quality and presentation of the meal is to be commended. 
A huge thank you to Lorraine Saldanha for creating that magical WOW factor!!!  She is an extremely talented interior designer who with her brilliant vision and attention to detail, transformed the Edwardian Room way beyond recognition!  That our guests are still talking about the celebration is a testament to how special you made the celebration !",5,2015,12,09
121,Convenient location for Victoria and Buckingham Palace,We stayed at this hotel for one night on Saturday. Initial impression of the hotel lobby and Christmas decorations was inviting. Courtyard area at rear of hotel was very pretty and inviting. Downside was the room we were allocated which although offering plenty of space was dated and in need of refurbishment. Bed was comfy though.,4,2015,12,09
121,Excellent 3 day Stay,"We selected the Junior Executive Suite as we were staying for 3 nights & loved it. Nicely laid out room With everything we required. Big comfy bed, mostly quiet at night, but nothing that affected our stay. Breakfast was very good, set us up for the days exploring London. Really helpful staff with any queries (concierge was prob sick of us asking directions to places of interest), discount from the hotels adjoining restaurants & another Banks Restaurant also attached to the Hotel was very nice but no discount offered there.",5,2015,12,08
121,"Quiet location, but still near attracions","This is a very nice 4 star hotel that feels more upscale because it is on a quiet side street even though it is just off Victoria street (5-10 minute walk from Victoria Station - not bad with rolling luggage).

 Had been thinking of staying at another 4 star - the Grovsenor but glad we chose this one as the other is right smack in the middle of traffic and a very busy and rather unattractive commercial stretch. Turning off onto the quiet side street and arriving at the hotel was wonderful. 

Location  is on periphery of the West End attractions and shopping...go left out of the hotel and a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Queen Victoria monument...walk through Green park to get to the main drag of Piccadilly  where all the shopping is and you can walk right to Piccadilly Circus or go on parallel Jermyn Street...all the side streets full of shopping, charming shopping arcades etc. If you would rather take the tube, the St. James Park station is a very short walk. 

Hotel is well kept, rooms are modern, Lobby is well done elegant though not grand, and the famed courtyard is very charming and historic...sitting outside would have been great if it hadn't been November. 

Personnel at the front desk was very personable...we got Mohammed...young man very accommodating and native of London who also gave us some tips on local favorites. Overall staff very attentive and helpful...definitely  5 star.

This hotel, though a 4 star, benefits from the fact that its common areas are shared with the other much higher end of the hotel around the other side of the courtyard which is suites and larger apartments and definitely 5 star. In contrast, in Europe we have found that star categories are very broad so a 4 star could be pretty much anything. 

The room was lovely though small (even with a nice complimentary upgrade) but that is London. Modern rather than historic, and nice bathroom. Very quiet, no traffic noise which was nice. Free wifi in the room.

I would give the hotel an excellent rating except for 2 areas...1) the breakfast area was more like a 3 star, unappealing and sort of like a cafeteria bar presentation of buffet breakfast. Good selection but the whole thing looked not tasty because of the institutional dining atmosphere so we opted to go out.  2) The spa was in an out of the way location and was very small...couple of treatment rooms, looked more like a space they had put in just to say they have a spa rather than a full service spa. 

Overall, however, go out for breakfast and you probably have plenty to do in London without even looking around the hotel for the spa...as a 4 star it is definitely on the higher end of the broad European 4 star range.",4,2015,12,07
121,Not happy,"I booked and believed it was on a bed and breakfast basis.
After breakfast I was informed breakfast was not included. 
I was then charged £44 for a cup of coffee and (powdered) eggs on toast. 

I asked to speak to the manager who completely dismissed my point and was extremely rude just walking off. 

Shocking behaviour from a supposedly 5 star group. 
I will not be returning. 

The rooms and hallways are also tired looking. 

",1,2015,12,07
121,Nagging but enjoyable Stay,"I along with my wife and 2 children aged 14 and 8 years booked 2 inter-connecting Classic Rooms. On check-in we found that the 2 rooms given were not inter-connected and after long arguments, finally we were accommodated in a single regular site with  2 extra beds. We stayed for 4 nights and had space constraints in living in a single room but since there wasn't any inter-connected rooms available we had to accept whatever was provided. 
Now, some positives. Breakfast was almost same everyday but it was a delight to taste Indian breakfast in London.House-keeping and room service was good. The suite was near to elevator and would suggest all to find a room nearer to elevator otherwise you have to walk a lot if you get a corner room.
I had my birthday on one of the stay days but wasn't even greeted by any of the Staff. Felt disappointed because normally 4-star or 5-star do greet their guest and shows their graciousness by at least sending a small cake.
Well even after all of this I enjoyed the stay!  ",3,2015,12,07
121,Special touches,"I had organised an overnight stay here for my husband's birthday. When we arrived we were greeted at the reception desk in a polite and friendly manner in an exceptionally busy period. I had booked a junior executive suite for the stay as it was a special occasion and was extremely pleased with the size and cleanliness of the suite. After returning from our evening out, our room had been prepared for the evening and a chocolate dessert had been left in the room with birthday wishes written on the plate. This was a really thoughtful touch and finished our first day off brilliantly. Breakfast was pleasant and tasty with a good selection and the staff was very polite throughout. I would like to say that the staff are a credit to the hotel and we would be happy to stay here again on another visit. Thank you for all the special touches that made this weekend memorable.",5,2015,12,06
121,Very pleasant stay in a cozy quiet room,"Excellent room, and very pleasant stay. The only somewhat disappointment is breakfast who didn't rise to the overall level of hotel. Limited choice of cold-cuts and cheese and not the best of quality. Other than that, very recommended!",4,2015,12,06
121,A calm and caring oasis in a convenient location,"I spent hours trying to track down a hotel somewhere quiet in central London with a twin room which included breakfast. We were planning a hangover for the Sunday morning, so wandering the streets searching for a fry-up was definitely not going to be an option! St James' is only a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station. From arrival onwards, the service was excellent. Debora at the front desk couldn't have been more welcoming. We were there 15 minutes before the official 2pm check-in time, but our room was ready.

We'd been upgraded to Room 213, an executive level. It was on the front of the hotel which a little annoying as I'd asked for a quiet room overlooking the courtyard. However it wasn't actually that noisy. There were huge wardrobes, more than enough room on either sides of the beds, a hairdryer, ironing board and iron, TV, coffee and tea, a desk and two comfortable chairs. The bathroom was spacious too with a light-up make-up mirror. Everything was spotlessly clean. I liked the decor which avoided that bland hotel look by including pictures of London.

The doorman flagged us down a taxi and it was only £15 to get to The Strand. I should also mention the bar area. It's really luxurious with large purple velvet seats and lovely staff. 

Breakfast the next day was spot-on. It's served until 11.30am, giving sore heads some time to come around. It's a buffet English fry-up but with fruit salad, cold meats, cheese and some rice dishes. What I was impressed about was the service. The waitress had noticed I didn't have a coffee cup, so returned with coffee and the cup without my needing to ask. When I asked for gluten-free options there was no fuss. She even brought two portions of gluten-free cornflakes. Soya milk was also available. I was one very happy (awkward-eating) bunny!

Next time I'll try to remember a swimsuit as there's a spa area we didn't even get a chance to look at. And given it's only 5 minutes walk to Westminster Abbey, that will be on the list too. Thank you St James' for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,12,05
121,Elegance and Class,A couple of years ago my wife and I stayed at the Taj Bengal Hotel in Kolkata and was truly impressed by the excellent service and accommodations.  The other day on our last visit to London we learned about and stayed at your St. James Court hotel which was not only excellent in all regards but the elegance and class shown to us by your Assistant Front Office Manager Ms. Sunaina Soares will result in always staying at a Taj hotel during our frequent travels whenever there is a Taj hotel available - we are forever grateful and impressed.  Very briefly my 94 year-old dad and patriarch of our large family (all in successful businesses including a lawyer Ricardo Corona that has a popular Spanish language TV show in Miami) had a heart attack which caused me and my wife to have to rush back to Miami ... I asked Sunaina if we could get credit for a future stay but Sunaina insisted in graciously returning full credit of our unused pre-payment.  It was not only the gracious gesture but the elegance in which it was conducted by Sunaina ... thanks to Sunaina and your excellent facilities of course the Corona family will be loyal life-long customers.  Congratulations and thank you Sunaina!,5,2015,12,05
121,Winter London Visit,The Taj demonstrated a welcoming yet professional approach to its clients. The foyer has an excellent ambience and a hum of human interaction. Rooms and food of an excellent standard. The hotel is convenient to Westminster and Victoria - for onward access to Gatwick,5,2015,12,05
121,St. James' Court stay - November 2015,Loved the hotel. Location. Staff. Great room. Bar. Food at restaurants. Prices. Will stay here for sure again. I was booked in here by a colleague. And was very pleasantly surprised by the high quality.,5,2015,12,04
121,Fine and traditional hotel,"In short: the hotel is fine but the rooms are somewhat short of the standard that you would expect. An upgrade or a renovation of the standard rooms would not be unwelcome. The free wi-fi is not that fast so expect to pay for an upgrade.

The lobby, the concierge and the restaurants are all up to the standard that you would expect. And a very convenient address!

I hope I'll be back soon.",4,2015,12,04
121,"Gorgeous lobby, dreary rooms","Unpleasant front desk staff.  The ""deluxe"" room has dated furniture, worn carpets, and a 24 inch television.  If you want a reasonably modern room, it's a 25 UKP upgrade.  I have seen much nicer furnishings in most Holiday Inns and Marriott Courtyards.  A five star hotel should be ashamed of itself for this behavior",3,2015,12,02
121,St. James' Court Hotel,"A great find,a most imposing building, this tastefully renovated hotel has a superb location ,in central London, has a very high standard and superb restaurant.Staff very friendly and helpful. Superb breakfast.",5,2015,12,02
121,Brilliant Hotel,Stayed here for a family weekend. The hotel is luxury and the staff are so attentive and friendly. The concierge at the font of the hotel are happy to help with any request. The rooms are so comfy and very spacious. The food served in the 5 restaurants all serve the highest quality. This a great quality hotel and I will be staying here again in the future. ,5,2015,12,01
121,Good stay; could use some updating,"The hotel location is perfect and the staff and service are incredible.  The lobby and other common spaces are also very nice.  We stayed in a Classic King room, and while the room was large and clean, it could have used some updating in two areas: the shower and the bed.  The shower was not very hot, had low water pressure, and was old (although was clean and usable).  The ""king"" bed was really two twins connected together.  Besides the natural ridge in the middle, the bed also wasn't as comfortable as expected for a nicer hotel and the mattress seemed worn.  With a little updating to the shower and a new, king mattress, this hotel could be great.",4,2015,12,01
121,Quite a disappointment,The only thing good about this hotel is its location. Attitude and service orientation of staff needs an overhaul. The first room that we were offered had a cracked basin and a coffee kettle that kept throwing up dirty water. It then took us 2 hours to get another room! If you are planning to travel by Tube while sightseeing in London then would recommend you stay closer to Westminister station as St James Park station has only one line. If you are looking for a good pub close to the hotel the Buckingham Arms is well recommended just 3 mins walk from hotel.,3,2015,12,01
121,Great Stay at the Taj,"We were not familiar with the Taj family of hotels until we came upon the Taj in Boston, MA.  After our great stay, in Boston, we looked into the Taj hotels in London for our November trip.  We chose the Taj @ Buckingham Gate due to its close proximity to the St James's tube station and somewhat ""out of the way"" location.  This is not a remote hotel by any means.....you are a maximum 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace or Westminster Abby/House of Parliment.  We stayed in room 382 which was at the very end of a long & winding hall but extremely quiet.  Eduardo, at the front desk, accomodated our early check in and provided us with this great room. The hotel has many modern accomodations while still retaining the historic charm of the area.  I would definitely return to The Taj Buckingham Gate.",5,2015,12,01
121,Very good business hotel a few blocks from Victoria Station,"Good location just a few blocks away from Victoria Station and a block away from Buckingham Palace.  Elegant setting, friendly staff.  Clean rooms and bathrooms.  Good food.  Overall a very nice hotel.  The court in the middle was beautiful.",4,2015,12,01
121,St. James Court is okay.,"Original room was not the larger room reserved for the trip.  Had to confront management to get the room that was reserved.  Problems with fridge, lighting, and towel changes.  Great location and restaurants.  Fairly expensive.  Can hear the subway day and night.",3,2015,11,30
121,Lovely Hotel,"First time in this hotel and was pleasantly surprised, the location was perfect for us and the room was great and had a lovely view of the courtyard, the staff were very helpful and very pleasant, we had a meal in the Bistro which was really nice and again the staff were very pleasant and the food was great will be back again in March 2016",4,2015,11,30
121,"Lovely hotel, very well located","I stay at the Saint james Court, a Taj hotel very often. It is a lovely hotel, within walking distance of the West End, Buckingham palace, Westminster Abbey and Saint James Park. You can also walk to Victoria Station, and underground stops are four minutes away.  Everyone is always very courteous and the rooms are nice, clean and big for London standards. I highly recommend it.",5,2015,11,29
121,"Lovely,comfortable hotel.","Another stay at the Taj St James Court - comfortable and very friendly as always. We stayed for three nights to celebrate a birthday and enjoyed every minute. Staff members Florentina and receptionists Eduardo and Isabella were so helpful and deserve a special mention.
We ate at the Bistro and also Kona (as well as breakfast) and all food was excellent and very good value. If you're looking for somewhere comfortable,convenient and welcoming then look no further. Relax in the comfy bar - just perfect for a chilly winter evening (whilst the Courtyard is perfect in the summer.)Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,29
121,"Don't Rely On Hotel's Pictures, Check The Most Updated Guest Ones","Before I start, I just want to say that the management was aware of this issue and resolved it as specified in this review. I am not writing this to talk bad about the hotel but just give readers my experience and to ensure that visitors know what they’re getting themselves into. 

Normally, I am the one who books hotels on family trips and like to make sure that I read up on all the reviews (good and bad) before I stay at a place. This time, my aunt was the one who chose this place so I had no input on the quality of the hotel. Upon arrival, I checked into my room and my mom and aunt checked into theirs. I had booked a standard two bed room and briefly saw those pictures online. Despite looking a little run down in the professional pictures, I told myself to suck it up and just bear it. However, after receiving my room and being told that it was an upgraded, renovated room on the second floor, I was in a for a shock when I walked and walked down 5 hallways, only to find that it was old and dirty. The closet door paint was chipping, there were dark marks all over the walls as if someone had moved furniture after years, and there was so much noise in the room that I felt very disturbed. As we were short on time for the day, I quickly pushed all this to the back of my mind and went to the bathroom to get freshened up after a long flight only to find rust and dirt and little hairs everywhere. As I washed my hands, the sink wouldn’t drain properly, increasing my disgust with every moment. I quickly took my items to get ready with and just left the room to go up to my mom and aunts, hoping that theirs was any better.

My mom and aunt had a renovated room on the third floor, but only slightly as their heater did not work (it was about 5 degrees outside and I am convinced that it was colder in the room than when we were outside). They were sitting in despair as they had been waiting about 35 minutes at this point for their bags (I had no trouble receiving mine) and could not do anything until they arrived. After watching them call down for almost 2 hours, the baggage assistant finally arrived to their room with a manager, claiming that the bags he had right now were already delivered and that my mom had returned them earlier. He claimed my mom was lying and that it was all her fault. I had been in the room when this gentleman had come by earlier with a set of purple bags and at that time my mom had refused them as hers were big, rectangular and red. He was clearly lying to save face in front of the lady manager and this made me quite upset as I could not watch my mom being blamed for something that she had no contribution to. 

Disappointed with the lack of employee etiquette and the massive disappointment of my room, I spoke to the hotel manager Edward Riches (I had seen him reply to reviews on Trip Advisor when I was awaiting the bags) and was offered a different room at the same rate. I saw the room and despite it being a little better, I insisted on a refund, wanting to move out to another hotel as soon as possible. We had arrived at the hotel by almost 2 and it was 5-6 pm by now and as no hotel had availability for the night, I agreed to pay one night’s rate and stay in a room that they offered me. My mother and aunt just had to try to keep themselves warm with sweaters and socks. While on my way down to go out for the night, I spotted a baby cockroach in the corner of a staircase and this just solidified my decision to leave for the next morning. 

Overall, unless you are okay with just staying at a hotel for the night and don’t mind dirt or dark atmospheres, this is not the place for you. When I stay at a hotel, I expect every aspect of it to be clean, positive and the employees to be welcoming. Despite the average service I received from most staff, the interaction between us and the baggage assistant was so appalling and really turned me off to the entire experience. Although most hotels would have waved the night rate entirely (as it was the hotel’s fault that things took so long that no rooms were available for the night), I still had to pay the 180 pounds or so for my own room, another aspect of customer service that I wish the hotel would improve on but its not the money that I feel is the issue but the principle of it. 

I must say that Edward Riches, the manager, was quite accommodating and understanding of the matter and dealt with our refund for the rest of the booking efficiently and I do have to give him credit for this but in my opinion, there are much better hotels in London and this specific neighbourhood for the same rates. We ended up moving to the Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel the next morning(Carlton Tower was sold out for the week) and despite the fact that I got the cheapest, smallest room, it was still bigger, cleaner, and much more atmospheric than my previous room. For the same value, I managed to get prime location, room, and service in Knightsbridge.

I urge everyone to please check the travellers pictures of the room you have specifically booked because the professional or hotel provided images do not portray the most accurate depiction. Furthermore, if you suffer from any sort of OCD or claustrophobia, this is not the place for you.",1,2015,11,28
121,Wonderful nights stay after long day ,Traditional English hotel with all the characteristics you would expect. Rooms are well decorated and plenty big enough. Highly recommend a stay here... Middle of Westminster 5 mins from St James Park tube station. The on site restaurant and bar are fantastic and breakfast was a delight ,5,2015,11,27
121,Great Hotel,Great hotel with a good central location. Welcoming reception with all requirements handled very quickly. checking out was also as swift. whilst awaiting friends great to listen to the piano player. Room was greatnice ad tidy. Freindly staff at breakfast.,4,2015,11,27
121,Being frogmarched around the lobbies like a criminal,"I had booked the taj hotel for a business visit in London. Whilst I was there, an important person was staying in one of the ancillary buildings around the large courtyard at the back of the main hotel complex.  After breakfast in the main hotel building I was walking back to my room no 870 which is on the 8 th floor of one of the three hotel building entrances. The important person who was staying was in the adjacent building around 20 meters away from the entrance which I was heading to. Whilst I was waiting for the lift I bumped into someone I knew and whilst exchanging pleasantaries I was invited to a room to discuss some matters. After the discussion was completed I headed back to the corridor to wait for the lift to the eighth floor. I was approached by the hotel staff and frogmarched through a labyrinth of walkways for around 15 minutes.  I was then escorted by a security gaurd who practically tailed me into the main reception areas where I just had my breakfast.  When I tried to protest at this humiliating treatment the lady staff member accused me of lying saying I don't stay in the hotel. Obviously I was upset. I complained to the duty manager whose response was "" everyone know someone somewhere "".  I could not understand what he was trying to imply and did not sound anything close to an apology.  I was told I should wait in the reception area but no real reason was given. All I wanted to do was go back to my room, pack my bags and checkout. I noticed no other people being frogmarched about and were all casually going about their business. Eventually after half an hour I decided to return back the embarrassing route and wait for the lift to my room. I complained about my treatment to the deputy manager Mr Edward Riches.  Other than acknowledging the fact that accusing a guest of not being a guest and frogmarched them around the premises and causing untold distress he had no other words of sympathy to offer. In the end not planning to stay in this over priced  £200 a night hotel with  almost nil choice of Indian vegetarian food for breakfast some terrible stale vegetable and chapati ,  with outdated rooms of the 1960's and not enough room to swing a cat in the allocated double which turned out to be two single beds and with the unasthetic  decor which looks like hideous huge ornaments sprawled all over the floor and tabletops.. This hotel has definitely seen better days.. And the lack of a formal complaint procedure makes me wonder how they got a licence to operate!! Very disappointed! ",1,2015,11,26
121,Great stay during the RWC2015,"Me and my team were staying at the hotel for 6 weeks during the Rugby World cup and had very comfortable stay.
Breakfast was relaxing, great service and good selection of food. I also had chance to have a dinner in the restaurant and food was absolutely delicious. I can only recommend this place for you stay",5,2015,11,25
121,An agreeable stay,"This is a large hotel set round a courtyard which would be pleasant in summer. I stayed for two nights in a classic room; the room was fine, but it would have been a bit awkward for two.  A design fault - only a 6 footer could have reached the curtain pulls.  It was some walk from the reception; the route using the back lift was less tortuous.
Breakfast until 11 very welcome, but the scrambled egg was disappointing.
The lounge is rather and unrelaxed.  The Bank restaurant, was noisy, but the food very acceptable: simple ingredients well presented. 
A useful hotel at a reasonable price for the location.",4,2015,11,25
121,great london business hotel,"A fantastic property, great service, great location and great value. Would highly reccomend it.  The business room was more like a suite but still great value when compared to other hotels, the location is fantastic, very safe and near some nice bars and resteraunts, the staff are attentive and very friendly.",5,2015,11,25
121,Good hotel,"I've stayed at the Taj 3 times in 2015 and on each occasion I've been pleased with the stay. In one of the more expensive areas of London the Taj offers good value. The rooms are well equipped and furnished. Staff are friendly- sometimes chatting too long when waiting to check in. 

I was on the 4th floor and could sometimes hear trains in the early morning from the underground. 

Overall a good hotel with a nice Indian theme. ",4,2015,11,25
121,Excellent locaiton and hotel but horrible breakfast,"The location is very central. The hotel also looks good. for most parts the rooms are nice and large (if you get lucky and opt for a room on the 6th floor). But, the breakfast is something that you will do better missing on :)",4,2015,11,24
121,Weekend break,"My  husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the St. James Court hotel.   We were very impressed with the hotel, and with the accessible double room which we had booked which was very spacious (this was the cheapest double room available when we booked).

We paid slightly more than we normally do when visiting London, but felt that the weekend deal (which included breakfast) was good value considering the high standard of the hotel.

We would definitely stay here again when visiting London, and would recommend it to anyone.",4,2015,11,23
121,Better than most in London,"St. James' has to be amongst the better 5 Star Hotels in London. Be it service, size of rooms, food quality, location, staff courtesy, for me this hotel scores really high on every front as compared to any other hotel in London. 

Though it must be added that when it comes to comparing it with the Taj Hotels in India, it does fall short of Taj's standards. ",4,2015,11,23
121,"Excellent location, service, rooms","Great service, and the bed is incredible!! The location is perfect, really near to historic and business buildings.  Plenty of restaurants in the area.  Every request was perfectly solved by the staff members.  Recommended totally.",5,2015,11,23
121,Everything you expect from a Taj Hotel,"We've stayed with the Taj group before, so were happy to find this hotel in the area we wanted to stay.  London's a big place, so it depends where you want to be, but if you want to be handy to the Westminster end of town, then I'd definitely recommend the Taj.  It's a short walk from Victoria station with the direct train to Gatwick.  It's a short walk to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, the London Eye, etc, but if you don't fancy walking, there's a tube stop just around the corner.

All the hotel staff were really pleasant and helpful and we had no problems at all during our stay.  The room was very comfortable, but to be honest, we were that exhausted from packing in the sightseeing that we just conked out when our heads hit the pillow!

I'd definitely use the hotel again next time I'm back in London.",5,2015,11,22
121,First Time Stay - Birthday Visit,"Took my boyfriend here for a Birthday treat. Super close to Victoria Station, around a five min walk. So close to all the typical sight seeing London attractions. Walking distance to everywhere you need to go. Perfect hotel, couldn't fault a thing. Staff were lovely, rooms were beautiful and the hotel grounds were amazing. Didn't use the eating facilities at the hotel but they look great also! Would stay again! Looks like it should cost so much more, such an impressive hotel!",5,2015,11,22
121,Oh dear - don't believe the website,"What an awful night at this dump. In a room on the 6th floor that was totally un-renovated and dirty. The window (see photo) had rotted away so wouldn't close properly, so I spent the whole night with the wind blowing through the room (as there was a one inch gap under the door) and rattling the window frame and door. The bathroom was revolting and covered in mould (photo attached) and the miss-matching furniture, solid as bricks bed, stains on the carpet and dirty and broken curtains means I will never ever return - so please don't believe the photos on the website of the rooms!",1,2015,11,22
121,Super place to stay.,We stayed at the hotel on the recommendation of my daughter and her husband.  It was my birthday and many thanks for the upgraded courtyard view room and the small birthday cake which was delicious. The staff were all charming. We did feel that the breakfast in the Edwardian room was not as good as it might have been but adequate none the less.  Drinks were alittle prices but you expect that in London not sure about the 12.5 added as a service charge. The hotel is very central and well situated. Would visit again.,5,2015,11,22
121,Very good service,"Stayed one night as a Birthday treat , we were made very welcome and the hotel provided some cake with a Happy Birthday Message, much appreciated. The room was excellent, good breakfast with very attentive staff.",5,2015,11,22
121,Really nice hotel,"Just stayed 2nights at this hotel.
Found it to be really nice, very friendly, lovely breakfast, good service.
Room a little small but comparatively good for what I paid, which was really reasonable.
The shame of it for me is that this is the most beautiful building I have stayed in. The courtyard must be absolutely gorgeous to sit out in in summer. But it's a little careworn when you take a look up.
I hope taj invest a few quid to bring it fully back to what it should be as will stay here again in summer. And for longer.",4,2015,11,22
121,A great place to stay,"This was my first time at this hotel.  I was impressed with the room size, the bed and the amenities.  Great location in central London, close to Buckingham palace and Big Ben.  The price was very attractive given the quality.",5,2015,11,20
121,An Oasis in London,"My wife and I just completed our second stay at the St. James Court Taj Hotel.  It was, once again, outstanding.  The hotel is beautiful, well maintained, and well managed.  Service was excellent.  For example, we requested that our feather pillows be replaced with hypoallergenic pillows due to allergies: housekeeping not only replaced them, but revacuumed the room to ensure that they picked up any residual dander.  That is the kind of attention to detail that makes this place special.  Thanks to more time on this stay, we found out just how wonderfully located the Taj is.  For it, it is walking distance to most of what we want to see.  When too rushed to walk, it's convenient to both the tube and a taxi stand.    This is quite simply a wonderful hotel.",5,2015,11,20
121,"A very good room, on the small side.","We were booked for one night attending a dinner in London.  The room had all the luxurious things you expect in that kind of hotel. It was a little bit of a labyrinth to find (on the 7th floor). But though the bizarre shape of the room, the bathroom was spacious enough. The room was quiet and comfortable, which is what we asked. Staff at reception was really helpful and kind. felt welcome.",5,2015,11,20
121,great hotel,"just stayed here and it was a lovely hotel, very nice rooms, and all the staff were excellent . will deffinatly stay here again we are going again in febuary and this is where we will be staying. Buckingham palace a two miniute walk from the front door",5,2015,11,20
121,"very old rooms, nice place",The hotel in itself is very nice and in a very nice location. but pay attention to rooms. they are very small and very old and cost a lot. I bought a classic and was impossible for two people. I upgraded to a king but had to pay more money. next time I will consider other options. not Taj level. Sorry,3,2015,11,20
121,Excellent hotel ! ,"We stayed here for two days, they upgraded our room, wifi was fast and the breakfast was brilliant. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Close to underground station. We like the contemporary look of the hotel. Its one of the best Hotel in London.

121,St James TAJ,the hotel was very nice staff were great food was lovely the position of the hotel was great. My room was at the back of the hotel the view was amazing of the rest of the hotel. Only  one pub nearby. I would love to stay again but too expensive for a personal trip.,4,2015,11,19
121,Excellent hotel in central London,"This was my first staying in this hotel, Excellent position, within a walking distance of major attractions and near the QEII Conference Centre where I was attending a conference. I stayed in the room 658 that was very quiet, looking at the garden. The stay was very pleasant, excellent hotel and staff of the whole hotel, especially the reception. The only problem in my room was a bad TV signal, and a rather complicated way to turn on the lights in the bathroom. My compliments for the service and I  would certainly try to come back to the hotel and I recommend this hotel to anybody searching for a luxury hotel with reasonable price in Central London.",5,2015,11,18
121,Friendly and professional staff,"We requested early access to our room as we were going to a matinee show and the hotel were very accommodating. Standard of room was excellent and ideal location for our needs, would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,11,17
121,Exceptional Service & Stay,"This hotel was extraordinary in itself, but the staff really made the experience a memorable one. From the moment I arrived, they were extremely welcoming and helpful. My room wasn't ready when I arrived, as I arrived first thing in the morning, so I was kindly led to the spa to refresh after my long journey. Everyone was so friendly and kind - it made me feel like I was home away from home (which really helps when traveling solo).",5,2015,11,17
121,Taj tastic,"We spent a single Saturday night here to attend a function nr StJames palace and found this on the Internet. Whilst London Hotels are nuts expensive, the St James Court was at the lower end of the price madness  so after reading the reviews we plumped for it. It turned out to be a great decision. On first impressions this place ticks all the boxes- lovely old red brick facade with big revolving doors and a concierge outside with a big hat- impresses me every time a big hat!
Reception checked us in early with lots of fantastic customer service and the room was big enough, clean and quite freshly decorated.
We didn't eat but had a couple of late night drinks at the bar which were stupidly priced but at past midnight we didn't care.
Didn't have breakfast as I thought it was too pricey and instead had it 
at the nice cafe across the road. A couple of pubs just round the corner and St James Park tube 5 mins away.
So all in all we thought this was a great venue for our trip and would happily use it again.",5,2015,11,17
121,Brilliant stay,"We stayed on Saturday night, the room was really lovely, staff very friendly and the breakfast was brilliant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The conference facilities are also fantastic. Thank  you to everyone who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2015,11,17
121,"Modern, elegant and fantastic location.","Stayed here for 4 nights on business. Elegant property in an amazing location 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, 3 minutes to a tube station. Contemporary modern public spaces with great bar and lounge area, great restaurant and fantastic service. Rooms have free Wi-Fi, are very well decorated with all modern amenities. Only issue is my room was quite small, even with a queen bed. Tight for 2 people. Would definitely recommend as a good solid 4 star hotel.",4,2015,11,16
121,"Excellent stay, highly recomend","Beautiful hotel, great food, good location, pleasant and efficient staff.  Very clean.  A most delightful stay.  Close to tube station and a bike station just opposite the hotel to cycle around London. Close to lots of attractions.  Highly recommend a stay here.",5,2015,11,16
121,Best hotel in London. I don't know why it's not 5stars until now.,"I always stay in this fantastic hotel when I am staying in London. about 5-8 minutes from buckingham palace by step, a plenty of cabs are always in front of hotel so we can easily access to cab. Nice luxury lobby has royal charm, and Hamptons bar and also room condition is very British. The staff, especially the gentlemen with glass at Concierge is very gentle. Breakfast is very spectacular and I will give a Gold-Star. I will re-visit this hotel in February and I am very looking forward to. I absolutely recommend you to stay in this hotel.",5,2015,11,16
121,Perfect stay,Once again an absolutely exceptional stay at St James Court. All the staff are amazing and go beyond their duty to ensure our stay was perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a lavish stay at a reasonable price in London.,5,2015,11,16
121,Loved this hotel!,"Loved everything about this hotel, including the restaurants which just added to the overall experience. Good size rooms, helpful, friendly staff, excellent location, easy check in and check out. Finally, a hotel in London I look forward to staying in again!",5,2015,11,15
121,Great price and location,"Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament, the London Eye. A great location and the price was one of the best for the area. The rooms are adequate, a bit small, but totally fine. It is an older building, so you might set off the fire alarm with a hot shower. No biggie, just open the window! Friendly and warm staff. Would stay again!",4,2015,11,15
121,Perfect hotel.,"We stayed on the 14th Nov. we had lovely rooms on the top floor.
The beds were very comfortable , pillows & bedding perfect.
The bathroom was spotless & attractive.
We didn't eat here as we were going to a birthday party.
The staff & service were first class, so polite it was most refreshing.
We would highly recommend you choose this hotel, we have stayed in many , but this had the edge due to the amazing polite staff. 
We will most definitely be returning.
Thank you.",5,2015,11,15
121,Concierge ( Mr Nair )  went the extra mile to make our stay memorable !!!,"We stayed at this Fabulous Hotel for 3 weeks during the World Cup Rugby.  The overall service is outstanding BUT a special mention has to go to this fine Gentleman... Mr Nair.  Nothing ever seemed to be a problem for him, however much strain he was taking answering 2 phones and dealing with the clients ongoing enquiries and questions. He advised us of fabulous shows to see and made sure the seats booked were excellent. Even having the tickets delivered to our hotel.  Mr NAIR,  you are worth your weight in gold to this establishment.  You made our stay in London so memorable. Thank You Aubrey and Virginia SACKS",5,2015,11,14
121,Amazing - and I wasn't even a staying guest!,"I attended this hotel for a business course and I have to say its arguably one of the best I've been to.  The hotel itself is lovely, the food amazing and every single one of the staff that I encountered were absolutely lovely - very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  Myself and my friend were so impressed that for our next course module being held there in December, we have cancelled our reservation at another hotel and have booked the St James Court. We can't wait to stay!",5,2015,11,14
121,Great staff and a wonderful location,"We enjoyed being close to the underground and bus system, and generally near to everywhere we wanted to go.  The staff took great care of us throughout our stay.  Celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary was most special with the attention received from desk and concierge staff.",5,2015,11,13
121,"Elegant, traditional, great location","My room was a bit small but expected in London.  The amenities were good and the service was excellent.  Finding the room at first was a bit of a challenge, much like finding your way through a maze but once I found it, there was a closer lift that took me directly to the courtyard.",5,2015,11,12
121,Review about stay at UK Taj,Excellent location Most comfortable and safe stay at highest levels of hospitality.  Excellent front office staff and concierge. Superb restaurants particularly Quilon. Time till 11 am to have breakfast. A good spread even for the morning buffet!!,5,2015,11,12
121,Wonderful Experience | Can't Recommend This Hotel Enough,"We were tired when we arrived, but when we opened the door to our room, we were so pleasantly surprised. The furnishings are modern chic and everything you could want. We had a small kitchen equipped with a Nespresso machine (and they supplied us with milk!!). The bathroom was huge. Large enough for two people to get ready easily. We did buy a junior suite to be fair. But the service was extraordinary too. They go out of their way to make sure you know directions and the morning breakfast was also delightful. This hotel is within walking distance of many sights, so we highly recommend. The tube is close by too...and we found that their restaurant at night was also quite good. I have stayed in much more luxurious places, but this one is really great. The bed was super comfortable - and they gave you a variety of pillows for degrees of softness. Extra blankets...all the extra amenities. We will definitely be back.",5,2015,11,12
121,"Simply, the best hotel in London","My title says it all. Took my wife here as a birthday treat for her weekend & I'm so glad that we choose this hotel. It is exceptional. We've stayed in many hotels in London but none come even close to this one. The service is first class, restaurants amazing & a great ambience. The hotel also delivered chocolates to our room for my wife. Even if I was being picky, I simply can't find fault with this hotel & from now on, when staying in London, this will be our hotel of choice.",5,2015,11,12
121,"Absolutely tremendous stay, well impressed",Booked this hotel for my Wife and myself as well as for 6 other couples to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we were not dissapointed. Check in was quick and easy enough and we given a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the Courtyard which is stunning. Bed was very comfortable and shower in bath was good and simple to work with no shortage of shampoos/shower gel etc. Room a little warm but not a problem just open the window. Never had breakfast in the hotel as it was going to be qiuite expensive but had breakfast on both mornings in the lovely cafe across from the hotel which was excellenty priced and delicious. Bonus for this hotel is it is only a 2 or 3 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. Would certainly visit this hotel again.,5,2015,11,12
121,Fancy! Exciting hotel,"Location is very good, I walked to Victoria Station and to most places. I loved the comfort of the rooms and space to chill at the lobby. I cannot forget how friendly and very helpful all the staff is.",5,2015,11,11
121,Sadly it's been a total let down,"Having looked forward to are stay in a new area we picked this hotel for its style but from stepping in it's been a let down 
Firstly we are given 2 single beds after we booked a classic double, this was corrected after we had to show are conformation letter 
We where then moved to a double room but this looks over a school and we had the pleasure of being woken up to children screaming at 7.15am  and the trains running from 5.30am and due to lack of proper isolation we could hear the lady next to us being sick during the night and not forgetting the do not disturb sign being on are door a member of staff kindly ignored this and at 10.30 last night started knocking at our door to wake us up 
Now let's get down to the breakfast (lack of) never in my life have i been subjected to rubbish food by a 4star hotel,  I was looking forward to having a choice of freshly cooked breakfast foods that where shown on the menu in the room, but when I arrived down stairs to be greeted by a help yourself stuck in a small corner of a small room with very little choice other then a full English breakfast or a cold continental breakfast and for this pleasure I have paid £25 per head 
Needless to say tomorrow's breakfast will be taken else where 
The only good points for the hotel was the bar/restaurant BANK  which we had amazing meal and was served by very nice and helpful staff  this is would say is a must to visit if in the area but as for staying KEEP away",1,2015,11,11
121,Small room,"There is no doubt that this is a beautiful hotel , however we were disappointed with the size of our room which was very small in comparison to other hotels we have stayed in.
The staff in the hotel were very attentive and we could not fault the service we received.",3,2015,11,10
121,Nice Stay,"We stayed here for two nights during a visit to London. The hotel is very well located, a few minutes walk from St James' tube station, and in the other direction Buckingham Palace, other attraction were also within walking distance. The foyer was quite impressive on entering, door staff on hand to help with baggage, receptionist we dealt with was also very helpful, explaining the different restaurants available to us during or stay. 
Once we left the foyer and went to our room it was noticeable that other areas were a bit tatty and tired and could do with some TLC. Our room was comfortable but updating would be beneficial, marks on the walls, chipped paint work, marks on the mirror from a previous occupant. The room had a mini bar, also a little hamper that you could have nuts and crisps from, both were over priced.
We had breakfast both  mornings and service was inconsistent both days, offered toast one day but not the other. The breakfast on offer was tasty, from a continental selection to a cooked selection. We did notice however that the serving staff did not smile, not a big thing but when interacting with someone your serving it presents a good image for the staff and hotel. After this we notice other staff did not smile either, except for those we met when room service was ordered. We used this on to occasions and can not complain with this service, food arrived quickly and was still hot, always a bonus.
Despite it short comings we would not rule out staying here again as the location was excellent, but might shop around first.",4,2015,11,10
121,Wonderful place,"A wonderful stay a few meters from Buckingham Palace, clean, friendly, smart, wide... It would be perfect if they had engilsh beers at its bar1 This si my 9th visit to London, I have never repeated hotel, and since now I'm sure thad my 10th time I will. In hour hotel, of course.",5,2015,11,10
121,Wonderful Hotel stay,"My Mum and I stayed here on a recent trip to London as part of her Birthday celebrations. We stayed in an accessible room and from start to finish we were thoroughly impressed. the room had everything my mum needed in terms of her reduced mobility.
The staff were always helpful and friendly and anytime I needed help or had a query they sorted it out for us quickly. we had a speedy check in and out with Reception the doorman always took care of any luggage and opened the doors for us as well as organising any taxis we needed. Nothing was too much trouble. 
The Breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the staff were again always helpful and made sure everything was perfect. 
we also ate in the Hamptons bar and the atmosphere was fantastic, the food was delicious and not overly expensive and the cocktails were fantastic!
I can't thank the team at the Hotel enough for making our stay so wonderful and truly special. I have never stayed in a Hotel with such great service and quality of room and food. 
The location was fantastic, we could see everything we wanted to on foot!
I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely stay here again next time I'm in London and I can't thank all the staff for everything they did during our stay - especially the special Birthday Dessert that was brought to our room and made my mum's day!",5,2015,11,10
121,Great Staff,"We stayed during Remembrance Sunday and found a great deal. The front office staff were superb. The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel has all the amenities that one could need, from restaurants to drinking areas. The location is extremely good both for leisure and business. If anything needs improving I would say its the cleanliness around the lift  and hall  carpet areas on the bedroom floors.",4,2015,11,10
121,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here a few times and it is first class. Well equipped, lovely rooms, polite staff and excellent breakfast. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable, and the staff are extremely polite and friendly. The location is ideal for most of the central London sightseeing locations, and it's close to St. James's underground station. The bars, grounds and all facilities are excellent, so it's a fantastic hotel. Always a pleasant stay and highly recommended!!",5,2015,11,10
121,Beautiful hotel close to Buckingham Palace,Stayed here for 3 nights on w/e break. Excellent quiet location. Hotel is immaculate and all the staff very pleasant and attentive. Room was very clean - sheets/towles changed daily. Bathroom a bit small but still fine and clean.  As you can expect with a hotel of this quality eating in the in house restaurants is a bit pricey. Our breakfast was included - exceptional - buffet style - with a selection of Indian dishes which was a pleasant experience. Added bonus - we simply popped round the corner to Buckingham Palace to see the Royal Family leaving for Remembrance Sunday! Would definitely stay here again,4,2015,11,10
121,GREAT HOTEL IN PRIME LOCATION,A great hotel just around the corner form Westminster Abbey and right in the heart of things.  We booked a double room and had a free upgrade and the room was superb.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Bar prices are very high but to be expected in a central London hotel.  The hotel has a fabulous decor and is really comfortable.,5,2015,11,10
121,Faded Grandure,"This is a well located and architecturally grand hotel situated within walking distance of key Westminster venues, alongside the palace and parks.  However it appears trade on its location and once grand features rather than on quality of service.

Rooms are a little tired, battered and damaged, administration is poor and food and drink is overpriced.  Overall the hotel does not represent good value for money as others in the area do.  If you are going to charge central Westminster prices then you expect central Westminster service and this fall short in many areas.

Don't get me wrong, this place is OK, it's just not at the same stand as competition in the same location and price band.",2,2015,11,09
121,our stay at this hotel,"good rooms, but disabled access to rooms not good. breakfast was dreadful, disgusting coffee, watery powdered eggs and under cooked sausages. excellent staff very helpful and keen to please. Sad that breakfast let everyone else at the hotel down.",3,2015,11,08
121,Great Location and Attentive Staff,"We were in London for a wedding and this location was very convenient. It is very close to the Palace and Big Ben etc and was about three minutes or so walk from the tube. The hotel has a fairly modern foyer and bar area but the rooms are more traditional and frankly need a little care and attention. Examples would be chips in the wash basin and the magnifying mirror hanging at an unusable angle. The room we had was a classic double and for one or two nights it was fine if a little tight. The free wifi and tea and coffee making facilities were a nice touch and a free English breakfast buffet was included. So on balance a combination of location, price, facilities and staff earned it a four blob rating despite some of the disadvantages I have mentioned.",4,2015,11,08
121,Personal rude and room not adequate to booking,"Booked an executive room to learn on arrival that the hotel would recommend another standard since the executive level is not really executive.
Personal is rude and of course upon request to talk to the manager of the hotel, you are referred to a colleague standing next to the person you are talking to.
Worse experience in London I have had.
Normally stay at Radisson Blu which I will visit again in the future.",1,2015,11,07
121,The perfect way to take care of the clients,"Go there and see with your eyes what I have experienced. Rooms, attention to any client' need. Elegant building and efficent room especially for business man. Located near beetween Vicotoria Station and central London. Convinient to reach by tube or walk.",5,2015,11,07
121,A Home in London,every time I return to this hotel is like coming back to a second home. It is a comfortable residence in the heart of London and carries a balance of history and modernity for those who value such things.,5,2015,11,07
121,Fabulous as always,Our favourite London Hotel By far. Everyone remembers you and all your personal likes .We are often greeted by Mt Edward Riches and his wonderful team. we have eaten in all the restaurants and they are perfection equally they make a mean cocktail in the bar and lounge area . Nothing is ever a problem or to much trouble Thank you Taj,5,2015,11,06
121,Nice hotel,Very clean and upmarket hotel - friendly staff - nice food in the restaurant.  I would recommend this.  It was a business trip and I stayed for two nights.  On the first night we ate elsewhere but came back for drinks but in the second night we had dinner at the restaurant which was 1st class.  Rooms were clean and large and catered for all needs.  Very quiet - you couldn't hear anything or anyone else.,5,2015,11,06
121,Business Hotel,"The room was extremely tidy, and all facilities , restaturants, S. /james park etc is just within a few meters.One cannot think of a better place than this hotel for the upwardly mobile  business person.adjacent  to the hotel is the michelin star resturanat, and one among the many in London.",4,2015,11,05
121,Overnight stay to attend a St James Palace reception. ,"Very opulent hotel. Fabulous room. Friendly, attentive staff. Very clean and comfortable. Handy location, near to Victoria station. We didn't use the restaurant as we had other arrangements. The free wifi was very handy.  ",5,2015,11,05
121,"A Warm, Welcoming Home in Central London","This is a must-stay hotel if you have a trip for pleasure or business in Central London.  The Taj Hotel, St James Court is an ideally situated hotel right in the heart of London.  It provides real elegance in its public spaces, and comfortable, well appointed rooms with really comfortable beds.  I stay in many hotels each year from many different groups, and this is one I am always happy to come back to.  The food is excellent, and the staff are lovely.  This is a highly recommended venue.  For the business visitor, there is an excellent business suite and many well-equipped meeting rooms that are competitively priced.",4,2015,11,04
121,Great hotel in great location,"Stayed one night. We had free upgrade to a King bedroom - which is quite a bit bigger than the basic room - but you probably wouldn't want to stay in one of the smaller room.
Apparently the hotel was refurbished about two years ago and the decor is still in very good order. The hotel decor oozes grandness of a bygone era.
All staff we encountered were very polite, helpful and welcoming. We didn't have dinner at the hotel but had the buffet breakfast which was very good. 
Location is very good if you are a tourist - couple of minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of many other attractions. It is also convenient for Whitehall.
Thoroughly recommended.",4,2015,11,04
121,Excellent hotel,"We had a fab overnight stay at this hotel. Very clean, lovely check in service. We were able to walk to Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and along to Leicester Square and everywhere we wanted from there.",5,2015,11,04
121,Good Hotel,Very good hotel; Don't have a bed king size; Location excellent; Good Food; sleep quality good; good rooms; internet good; concierge service average; breakfast good; next Buckingham palace; next big ben;,4,2015,11,03
121,London flavour,"It is the entry port to a UK learning experince. Location, accomodation, kindness, ambient, unbeatable. Next trip to London it will certainly be my choice for stay! Close to the Buckingham Palace, and the pulsating London downtown and its attractions. Access is very easy taking the underground and Saint James station is close by.",5,2015,11,03
121,Very nice,"Reception staff helpful , room very clean , food  tasty and hot .  I use this hotel frequently as it is perfect location to visit my family . Reasonable price for location and comparison with surrounding hotels .

121,superb Hotel!,"This is a truly elegant hotel with wonderful service. This has been my second stay there and hope there will  be many more to follow. Excellent location and easy to  get anywhere from. Wonderful club style decor with a new touch... a most memorable ambience with popular pianist to capture the style.. Superb cuisine, and room service to match. Could not find any faults. Most helpful staff and very welcoming indeed.
I can recommend this hotel highly. Most stylish, elegant and chic. Probably one of the best in London without a  doubt. Run by Taj Hotels, a wonderful Indian owned chain of superb Hotels, look them up on the Internet, this ranks as being truly outstanding,  representing their first in Europe so its their flagship of style and charm.. a perfectly delightful stay in a city that has some pretty dreadful hotels at alarming prices, this is a welcome change. I can recommend this so very highly indeed!! Situated in a lovely period building, breathtaking  courtyard with a gorgeous Victorian fountain, renovated to the highest standard, an idyllic stay in lovely London!",5,2015,11,03
121,Superb Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel. We enjoyed our 3rd stay at the Taj last weekend. The hotel and it's staff have provided us with an exceptional experience on each occasion. The hotel is ideally situated in a central London location and is only a short walk from many London attractions. The rooms are spotlessly clean and  the service and housekeeping is excellent throughout. There is plenty of choice for breakfast and the food is delicious. I would also highly recommend Bistro 51 for a beautiful evening meal.   This year we were celebrating special birthdays for 2 of the ladies in our party and with the help of the Manager and staff at the Taj, who organised little Birthday surprises  for them, we were able to give the ladies 2 days to remember, so thank you to all involved. Needless to say, we are all looking forward to our next stay.",5,2015,11,02
121,Service above and beyond.,"This hotel has a lot going for it; location, 5 minutes walk from St James Park, value, when all other hotels were charging an arm and a leg to stay during the RWC, it held it's prices, a great bar AND a great residents bar, and it has a beautiful building. Upstairs the rooms are a bit old hotel like, long corridors but a good size. Where this hotel gets it's 5th gong is for its service. My wife and I were staying here for 3 days, my daughter stayed in Bayswater. She became ill and we had to bring her to our hotel, get a doctor, get a bed and take care of her. In all aspects the hotel responded without question brilliantly. My favourite moment was trying to get a dry white rolls for her as it was the only thing she could eat, there was nothing in the nearby stores. In desperation I called into 51, one of the Taj restaurants and asked for a white roll, they had olive rolls, seed rolls, but no plain white. The young lady came back with 3 slices of white bread on a plate, again, no questions.",5,2015,11,02
121,Ideal London Hotel!,The ideal hotel to stay at in London as it is so close to most of the major attractions and also near to most theatres. Rooms all clean and tidy. Restaurant for breakfast buffet style is ideal but even better for evening meal - fantastic!,5,2015,11,02
121,Quick autumn getaway to London,"We stayed in St James Court A Taj Hotel on the night of the Rugby World Cup final - well done the All Blacks! My wife and I had stayed before and this time her sister and husband accompanied us. We arrived early and were greeted by the very professional and helpful Debora on reception. The rooms were not ready, no problem we did not expect them to be. When we arrived back at the hotel Debora served us again and remembered us from the morning and had good news, we had both been upgraded to Junior Executive suites. Lovely. The rooms were lovely and both had a lounge area. Very comfortable. We could not fault the rooms at all and the service thus far had been excellent. We ate in the Bistro taking advantage of the Chef's set menu - excellent value at £30/head for starter main and dessert - food was really excellent. We then retired to the Hamptons Bar which was alive with those returning from the rugby and enjoyed a lovely evening listening to the live entertainment and enjoying some cocktails. Excellent. The breakfast next morning was very good - buffet style but nice selection and very hot and tasty. Only grip was a little over-engineered in terms of service which didn't quite work. I ordered toast which someone was making for you and a fried egg - neither ever appeared - never mind. Overall good service, excellent hotel in a fantastic location just around the corner from Buckingham Palace. Would recommend a stay here.",4,2015,11,02
121,Try the sparkling wines sampler in the beautiful lounge and courtyard,"We stopped in for a drink in the lounge and courtyard and came across a sweet little sparkling wines taster - complete with full description.  It was fun, different, and quite the experience!  What a creative item to offer on the bar menu!",5,2015,11,01
121,Fabulous,"Lovely hotel, excellent friendly staff. Nice little touches in the room I.e little chocolates, complimentary water. Ideal location for Buckingham palace, Big Ben, London eye. We were lucky enough to park outside hotel saving us £34 for a nights parking. Activity bag for the children including a taj bear. Lovely breakfast, loads of choice. Recommend.
      ",5,2015,11,01
121,Rooms are large for London!,"Highly recommend this hotel.  Location is excellent.  Close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station, House of Parliament, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.  Close to Tate Britain.  Service is excellent and staff very attentive.",4,2015,11,01
121,A Memorable Stay - The Royal Taj !,"I stayed at St James' Court for just over a week for a business trip during the British summer. So being prejudiced with positivity that was injected because of the unbroken stint of brilliant weather that accompanied my stay is inevitable.  Location of this hotel is unbeatable, for it's proximity to Buckingham Palace, and some of the must-see places in London, all within reasonable walking distance right upto Trafalgar Square, as well as Tower of London, Westminister Abbey etc.  And for the longer travels / commute for business or leisure purposes, the transport hub of Victoria is also within reasonable walking distance. The rooms are compact, and layout is somewhat different for each room, though amenities are identical. The corridors leading to the rooms are a bit confusing at first, with dead ends popping up unexpectedly, but the routes are well marked and one gets used to getting around pretty easily. The restaurant is a wee bit small, and there's a bit of waiting to be done if one arrives at ""peak"" hours.  The breakfast spread is good, and includes authentic tasting Indian fare too. Then there's the Quilon restaurant for a classier experience. Staff is courteous and efficient to the required standard, though a few really make an effort to go out of the way to help you out. The concierge is as expected of a London hotel of this class. Free Wi-fi is a great plus, and meets the needs of routine business work.  There's the business centre in case one has heavier business traffic to deal with. TV has some Indian channels too, in case one wants a non-online medium to get updated on the goings-on back home.  All said, a very comfortable hotel in the heart of London, distinct Indian touch with the Taj imprint, and a memorable stay.  Certainly look forward to return.",4,2015,10,31
121,Lovely hotel with a very central location,"I was travelling with my daughter of 4 years and on arrival was sat down with a warm drink for me and juice for her whilst we waited for a spare check in desk. Check I was easy and was surprised to receive a back pack for my daughter with a colouring set and a teddy. She was made up. Room was a bit tight in size es specially when ordering room service. Room service was as expected, nice level of choice and great quality  but London prices. As said the room was a bit small bit had all you needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was comfortable and had no trouble sleeping. Hotel in a few minutes walk from Buckingham palace. Would stay again",4,2015,10,31
121,Overall great experience,"It's a great hotel - run by the unparalleled Taj group of hotels in lndia, this is certainly one of the best 5 star options for you to stay in the heart of London. Great location (central London) - for both business and leisure travellers - and excellent service [the hotel staff are very warm and helpful. If you happen to be from India, then you can get some of the best Indian food here. 'Quilon', the restaurant here, is one of the best indian restaurants in London.",5,2015,10,29
121,Home from home on a business trip,"No rooms the same - lovely that each room is a bit different so it's not like staying in a neutral, same old, same old ""hotel"" - thank you Taj St James! Location is great for underground, parks, shopping and theatre and the choice of bars and restaurants are excellent. My number one choice when in London.",5,2015,10,28
121,Great Rugby Weekend,Stayed at the Taj St James for the semi-final weekend of the rugby.  The hotel is well located for all amenities near tube station St James to Richmond very easy.   Amenities in hotel excellent.  Food excellent good choice.  Would certainly go again.,5,2015,10,28
121,Great place to stay for business or pleasure,"Really nice hotel - mostly caters to business people, but there's a fair amount of nice tourist trade as well.  Clean, quiet, classy, and with some of the best Indian cuisine I've ever tasted.  Even the room service food is amazing.",4,2015,10,28
121,good location,"in a good spot for us. we were upgraded massively. this was good as the original online booking for three would have given us one bed to share, according to the hotel. when we asked for a room that could hold an extra put you up they had none so we were offered an upgrade. that was lovely. breakfast was included which is unusual and given that, it was pretty good.
it was quiet and worked well.
      ",3,2015,10,28
121,Great location,"Stayed here this weekend , great location for all the main sites of London City. Lovely feel to the hotel and the bar offers some great drinks. Breakfast was great with a good choice of both continental and cooked breakfast. Only fault was the quality of our shower which can only be described as a trickle not sufficient to adequately wash your hair. The view from our room was poor , but took it with a pinch of salt as the time we spent in our room was minimal .",4,2015,10,26
121,26 October 2015,"It is an absolutely magnificent hotel!  Friendly staff who truly make you feel at home and excellent service.  The best address in London, right next to Buckingham Palace.  I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to London!",5,2015,10,26
121,Comfortable and very well-situated,"Very comfortable room in a very well-positioned hotel, just a block from Buckingham palace. Very polite and friendly staff, and lovely reception area and courtyard. many dining options, although service at the restaurants is somewhat slow and wait staff poor.",4,2015,10,26
121,Comfortable and close to key government office,"Hotel is in an older building but has been remodeled and is well maintained, staff are polite and helpful, buffet full service breakfast; dinner food in restaurant food is good; I have returned several times.",5,2015,10,25
121,Show and Stay Hotel Break..Brilliant Location,"Having read a few less than complimentary reviews on the site we arrived at room 771 with trepidation.  Inside all was far better than we expected a large room with wardrobe space ,mini bar and tv. Very clean room and bathroom ,like a grade higher than travel inn or travel  lodges. Our check in had been effortless and we wondered why some travellers had complained.

The hotel had been booked as part of a trip which had afternoon tea at the Ritz , a short tube to the hotel and  seeing ""Billy Elliot"" at the Victoria Palace theatre .
It took ten minutes to walk to the theatre from the hotel.

A complimentary newspaper was at our door as we surfaced for a late breakfast.
This had been cause for complaint by some . Perhaps they felt it should be silver service rather than the buffet.. Everything was of a good standard with loads of cold and hot choices. The scrambled eggs were the best ever .. Staff were on hand for coffee , tea and toast orders. All non scrambled eggs could be ordered and prepared for you.

We are well travelled and feel all was of a good standard , my only gripe was our shower was not very powerful.  So we will return when a stage show is on the cards.

Well done to all the staff that made our stay a pleasant experience.",4,2015,10,25
121,Excellence in hospitality,"This hotel is outstanding.  The location, between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abby, cannot be topped! Everyone, from reception to concierge, bellman to doorman, waiters and maintenance, works to insure your comfort.  I left items in a drawer--Housekeeping found them and sent me a message before I work up the next morning.  The items then arrived in record time.  Superb service!",5,2015,10,25
121,Overall a good experience,"Overall good location. Nice old hotel, large rooms and full bath. However, no electrical outlets (except for shaver) in bathroom .  We used the hotel adapter for outlet in the bedroom but was too hot and burned up my curling iron. A converter is necessary.  Daily breakfast buffet included.  Close to Underground and tour buses.  A 5 min walk to Buckingham Gate.",4,2015,10,25
121,Centrally Located For London Sight Seeing,"The St James Court Hotel was our home for 4 nights during the recent Rugby World Cup held in the UK.  The accommodation was part of a package tour including flights and rugby tickets so not sure about the exact cost of the accommodation portion only, but no doubt it was at a premium!

The outstanding feature of this hotel is it’s location.  “Boris Bikes” are available in the same street and the St James Gate tube station is a short walk away.   Victoria Street is right there with many of London’s key attractions within walking distance.

There are pubs and restaurants aplenty in the near vicinity if you are looking for alternatives to the hotels significant offerings. We frequented The Albert on numerous occasions!

The standard free wifi offering which was adequate for our purposes, but if a higher speed was required this is at an additional charge.

We did not utilise all the amenities such as the business or wellness centre but no doubt these are of the standard expected.

A colleague and I shared a twin room (room 667) which is the more basic offering. It was adequate but compact and slightly on the tired side. A pet hate is a shower over the bath, which was the case here but notwithstanding my dislike of this type of facility it served the purpose intended. There was a view over an internal courtyard.

Breakfast was typical hotel fare and covered all requirements.

The hotel staff were all friendly, helpful and accommodating.

As South Africans spending rands, London is very, very expensive and especially in a location as central as this, but a strong mitigating factor is its convenience.",4,2015,10,25
121,Poor room location,Currently staying in the hotel and am extremely disappointed with having to look out my window directly into a wall !  For a hotel that clearly advertises a beautiful central courtyard to then have a dark wall for a view is false advertising. Doesn't warrant the rate being charged.,3,2015,10,25
121,Love this hotel--great location and great service,"This is the second time I have stayed at St. James Court.  Not only is it in a great part of London, but it also provides the little touches that makes a week-long business trip enjoyable.  When I arrived on a Sunday afternoon after an overseas flight, I was starving for breakfast.  The people in the bar told me that sadly breakfast had ended, but decided to call the restaurant anyway to see what could be done. 15 minutes later, I was served a lovely omelette.  Needless to say, this started my visit off with a smile. ",5,2015,10,23
121,A PERFECT STAY,The hotel is very close to the Commercial city center and in one of the best and most luxurious areas in London. The stuff is very polite and willing to make your stay comfortable. The rooms are spacious and chic. We would definately visit this hotel again!!,5,2015,10,22
121,Fantastic location!,"Fantastic location, 8 mins walk to Buckingham Palace & 3 mins to St James's Park tube station to take you wherever you like.  Not cheap, but worth it for the location and a bit of luxury.  Our room was huge!",5,2015,10,22
121,Business trip,"Tired hotel, not everything worked eg hot taps. Confusing layout. Long wait for hotel lifts. Great location for tourists and business. Hotel well staffed and very smart. Food is average - note the downstairs restaurant is very busy at breakfast so you can be reallocated to an upstairs ""overflow"" room (if you can afford the time waiting at the lifts)",3,2015,10,22
121,Meeting with international colleagues,Very attentive service but hotel rather tired. My room was smelly from arrival to departure. Colleagues had niggles e.g.  shower head they couldn't adjust etc. We used a meeting room with a screen. Attaching our laptop proved a lengthy technical challenge but staff always very willing.,3,2015,10,22
121,ELEGANT OLD WORLD CHARM,"Having booked an excellent deal with Hotel Exclusives I was not expecting the best of rooms in the hotel but was very surprised to find we were allocated a very spacious room on a high floor as requested and although the bathroom was tiny and we had no view the plan was not to spend hours in the room so this did not matter!  On arrival the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and even though we arrived before 11.00 we only had to wait a few minutes for the room to be ready.  We returned to the lobby bar on the evening and found the service to be excellent (Ashley a credit to any establishment) the cocktails to die for and the price not over the top for London!  Breakfast the next morning was organized chaos!  A long line waiting to get in  and lack of explanation meant that we helped our self to the buffet and then discovered you had to order eggs separately, resulting in two fried eggs arriving after we had finished most of the other food!  This was a pity as there was a very good choice of nicely prepared hot and cold food but we will know next time!  We then visited the Concierge desk to find out how to get some where and found them very helpful but I must point out that they MUST tell people that you cannot get on a bus in London and pay and that you have to obtain an Oyster Card from the bus or tube station first as this resulted in us wasting a lot of time and I am sure we cannot be the only visitors to London who are not aware of this.  The hotel is in an excellent location to visit most of the attractions in London with several only a short walk away and the staff so friendly and attentive that I would certainly return and recommend it!",4,2015,10,22
121,Top Class Stay !,This is simply a great hotel. From the friendliness of the staff and their very genuine willingness to help to the comfort of the bedrooms and the wonderful beds ! Breakfast to the room is particularly well executed and a great treat. The location is really good too ! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly return.,5,2015,10,22
121,Beautiful public rooms let down by shabby bedrooms,The public rooms of this hotel are beautiful and the staff are very attentive.  However they are let down by the quality of the food at breakfast and the rooms.  I have certainly stayed in better for less money.  My bedroom was very shabby and also smelt musty.  The toilet in the bathroom didn't flush properly either.  Very disappointing.,2,2015,10,22
121,"Wonderful reception staff, unsatisfactory breakfast, ageing furniture. ","Our welcome was warm, informative, friendly. That receptionist remembered our names every day thereafter and greeted us warmly each time we passed by. Sadly it was less good after that. Breakfast was busy, crowded, rushed and the food was simply not good enough: we chose to miss it on subsequent days even though it was included in our rate. 
Our room was bright and a reasonable size but there were too many faults and frankly the furniture was showing its age. Plenty hangers and space in the wardrobe yet a tiny bathroom. I cannot see us returning. ",3,2015,10,21
121,"Wonderful Oasis, with only a few rumbles...","Having stayed at the St. Regis last year, I was eager to see how the Taj, which has a phenomenal reputation elsewhere, stacked up during a short two night stay heading through London on the way back to the States.   The hotel in just about every way met my expectations, it was elegant, welcoming, but not over the top in its style- the staff are extraordinary- have a cocktail in the lobby lounge and the staff (including Ashley who was an absolute delight) will treat you like royalty, even in the middle of the Rugby Quarter Finals when rowdier crowds tended to flock in).   My only complaint was having a lovely room on the first floor- one does not expect a view at the standard rate, but the daytime experience of every Underground train seeming to pass directly under the bed was the only downside to my particular location. Thankfully, it abated at night, the room was a joy to sleep in, and it was a small and amusing detail of what was otherwise an thoroughly enjoyable stay.",5,2015,10,21
121,Great Location!,This hotel is amazing. Its a three minute walk to Buckingham Palace. It's an older property and very traditional. We had Room 875 which was more spacious that I thought we would have in London. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom was roomy with marble floors. Also everyhting was very clean.  There was a school close by so weekday mornings were a little noisy and in the evening we could hear basketball games when the window was open. This didn't bother us since we were out enjoying the city.,5,2015,10,20
121,After the front hall staff it was all down hill.,"The front hall staff were very helpful, our Italian check in lady so friendly she always remembered us by name as we passed, that could be a first!
The hotel in general was very poor.
The breakfast room a disgrace and worse than most Bed & Breakfast establishments.
Our room was not over priced by London standards but was very poor.
The bed was small, decoration poor. My side of the bed had no bed light!!
The bath was very slow to fill and had various chips and scars.
There were few cloths hangers.
This two night stay has put me off Taj hotels for life probably!",2,2015,10,19
121,Luxury lobby but room not worth the price,"The lobby makes this look like the stunning luxury hotel that this is advertised as being. I was greeted by polite, well turned out staff and it was very pleasant to have the soothing piano playing after the stress of fighting my way across London to get there. The location of the hotel is good for business and seems to be pretty central for tourists. The included breakfast was excellent - a nice surprise having different options to the standard British fare in there.

There were a few little niggles that I wasn't expecting given the price that I paid. I had an Executive king-size room which felt a lot smaller than the 35m2 which the website claims; there certainly didn't seem to be as much floor space around the bed as the marketing photos show. It seems I was lucky that my room was ready when I arrived. A colleague had to wait for his, even though he arrived at 19:30 (though he was given a free drink at the bar whilst he waited). Away from the public areas, the décor is starting to look a bit tired (e.g. torn carpet in the corridor to my room) and my bathroom would certainly have benefitted from an occasional thorough clean in addition to the daily routine. I was surprised to find that the curtains didn't close properly in my room. Fortunately it didn't affect my sleep as I arrived and departed in the dark, but I would have been unhappy if I'd stayed there during the summer. The shower made a very loud and unpleasant noise when I used it early in the morning, and the bath drain was partially blocked meaning I ended up ankle-deep in water due to the slow draining. I reported this when I left so hopefully the issues have now been fixed. None of these are major issues that seriously detracted from my one night stay there, but they're the sort of things that I wouldn't expect given the high cost of this hotel. I've stayed in better places that cost less than half the amount I paid here.",4,2015,10,18
121,"Great location, excellent service.","Can't beat this hotel for location, service and price. Make sure to eat at Bank restaurant. We re-visted London after many years; walked a lot, used the tube and the double deckers. Very good central location. The staff really made our stay superb.",5,2015,10,17
121,Short break ,"My wife and I had a 4 night stay in the Taj. Great location near Buckingham Palace and short walk to Westminster and the Thames. We had executive room which was smaller than it looked on the website but it was modern and clean. Hotel was busy, breakfast area relatively small and on a couple of mornings seemed quite chaotic. Staff were very good and attentive. Thanks for a great stay. ",4,2015,10,16
121,Excellent place for a vacation stay.,"The St. James Court Hotel was centrally located for our purposes of visiting one of the truly fascinating cities in the world.  In the Westminster district there is plenty nearby to see and do.
And staying at the St. James made it all the more enjoyable.  The staff were most gracious and generous with their time. The concierge, the desk staff, the waitstaff in the restaurant and bar and the room staff.
Virtually no troubles with checking in or out.  The doorman was most helpful with taking care of our luggage and us on arrival and departure.
We only ate once in a St. James restaurant but it was a wonderful experience.
Overall impression: no problem with staying there again.",5,2015,10,16
121,Close to Buckingham Palace! Impressive Hotel,"Great location for a weekend in London. Just a short walk to Buckingham Palace. Hotel was very impressive. Our room was nice, clean, quiet and had very comfortable bed/bedding. We ordered room service one night and the food was great! Breakfast was very good too and the waitress's very friendly. The hotel has a beautiful court yard around back, it was too bad the fountain was not functioning during our stay but none the less a wonderful space to enjoy. We had a wonderful stay here but it was quite expensive. We would recommend this hotel with a 4 star rating/prices",4,2015,10,16
121,"Lovely, central Hotel","We stayed 6 nights at St. James's Court.  It is very close to the tube station and very close to Buckingham Palace.  The staff were very welcoming and professional.  The rooms are very clean.  A breakfast buffet is included, an while the choices did not vary day to day, they were quite accommodating with requests for omelettes.",4,2015,10,15
121,Good experience,"This hotel is centrally located and one can see nearby touristy places such as London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace by foot. Plus, they provided Indian breakfast everyday :) The staff was polite and courteous and services were prompt. Strongly recommended!",4,2015,10,15
121,Staying next to Royalty,"A great location. We walked everywhere and were blessed by fantastic weather. Enjoyed the walks in the parks nearby; Hyde , St James, Green etc. Shopping theatre areas in close proximity.  The Parliament Tour is a must do.",5,2015,10,15
121,Excellent Stay,"We stayed in a Junior Executive Suite which was good value, providing a true suite with a separate lounge area as well as a desk in the bedroom.  There was plenty of storage (drawers and shelves) to unpack into for an extended stay.

The bathroom was well equiped though the shower over bath did allow some water to spray through a gap onto the floor.  No problem as the bath mat coped with this minor issue.  

The common areas of the hotel are beautiful as is the courtyard.  

A minor inconvenience was the fire alarm had a few false triggers which closed off the lifts for awhile.  

Unfortunately, breakfast was only average.  Staff were friendly, but the hot buffet items were usually only warm.  Getting something cooked especially didn't actually get a better result.   

Overall, however, we had an excellent stay and would stay again.",5,2015,10,15
121,Adequate but not Excellent,"The St James Court is an adequate but not excellent hotel, especially when compared to other options in the immediate vicinity.
It's main advantages are in its location and in the size of the rooms, which are larger than the nearby St Ermin's. The hotel is right down the road from Buckingham Palace and a short walk from Picadilly so the location cannot be beaten.
However in comparison with other local hotels in which we've stayed , the fittings are not as well maintained and several things rankle.
The first impressions are that the common areas such as corridors look their age.  The overall decor away from the main lobby needs a refurb. 
Inside the room, we found a number of issues; including a Toilet that would not flush properly and bathroom fittings that were broken, such as a towel ring that was half out of the wall. The hairdryer cord was broken and while it was replaced after we complained, a safety hazard like this should be avoided. The heated towel rail would not heat at all
We were given a ""quiet room"" facing the courtyard, however this was rather noisy at night when people stood outside smoking and talking loudly
On check out, a charge for valet and parking was charged to our room - despite not  having a car. 
The staff were friendly and professional and quickly reversed the charge as well as complementing our internet charges to make up for the room issues. 
While all these things are minor on their own, together they add up to a less than optimal experience. The Taj group needs to invest more in the hotel; travellers would pay more for facilities that are refreshed and it would be fairer on their own staff who seemed to do their best.",3,2015,10,14
121,Hotel,The staff were friendly and helped me with some questions about the city. It was my first trip to London. The concierge very friendly and gave me a lot tips about London city. Wonderfull location close every where and easy to get transportation and walk around.,5,2015,10,14
121,Great common areas - rooms not so great,"We stayed here a couple of Saturday's ago and the hotel has a wonderfully impressive foyer and bar area.  Very comfortable, beautifully designed and the staff are very attentive.  It was only a brief stay so we didn't eat at the hotel and I would only say that the rooms rather let the hotel down.  Very basic and not that comfortable.",4,2015,10,14
121,A very pleasant stay,"We had caught an overnight flight from New York and when we arrived at the hotel around 10am, as expected we were told the room wasn’t available.  We completed the check-in procedure and then went for a very pleasant walk through the parks to the West End.  On our return to the hotel our room was ready so we made our way to our room.  After a very convoluted walk with many twists and turns we arrived at our room to find it was on a corner and had French doors opening onto a little Juliet balcony.  It was a very nice room and had a well equipped bathroom. There was free wi-fi.
We were always greeted when arriving or departing the hotel and this made us feel as part of the ‘family’.
We did find a much shorter way to the street that avoided the lobby.
We didn’t eat at the hotel so I can’t comment on that. 
Several times we walked into or back from the West End but it was only a 500 metre walk to the tube and once we caught a bus so public transport was easy.
It was a very nice stay at the St James’ Court. My litmus test is would we stay there again when next in London? Certainly.",4,2015,10,14
121,Great Experience,"Great hotel, great location, great staff, especially Mohammed at the front desk. Restaurants were wonderful. Highly recommend this hotel. It is equal to 5 star rating. Very accommodating and professional staff.",5,2015,10,13
121,Want a good night's sleep?  Don't go here.,"Excellent hotel in all ways except.....the bed.   a king sized bed with a big gap between the two double mattresses.  Kept waking up thinking I'd fallen off the bed.   5 nights, not a good night's sleep.  Otherwise fine - clean, excellent breakfast (but way too expensive), terrific service.",3,2015,10,13
121,Excellent Experience,"I was booked at this hotel through corporate travel.  It exceeded my expectations. The grounds are spectacular and this hotel has every amenity you can imagine! The spa and fitness facilities were wonderful, the food was exceptional and the service was exemplary. I would recommend this to anyone traveling to London.  the location was very close to transportation and hop-on bus stop.",5,2015,10,13
121,I've already planned my next visit! ,"We stayed here for my boyfriend's birthday and had an absolutely perfect time away. The hotel staff were brilliant and the hotel is beautiful. The location is great - perfect for a pumpkin spice latte and a walk though Hyde park. The dinner at Kona was incredible and the chef even came out to speak to us about our food. 

We have already decided to stay here again in December for a weekend of Christmas shopping, and can't wait to come back! ",5,2015,10,12
121,A WISE CHOICE by ASHCAT,"Fantastic service from arrival to departure. Had requested and was given early check-in after long flight. Lovely clean room (classic) -small but comfortable . Cleaning staff  excellent ,unobtrusive and alert to our movements. Friendly reception staff to be complimented. Hotel has the feel of a very posh abode. Brilliant location - next door to the Queen and close to major attractions.We walked everywhere and hardly used the tube although the nearest station is a stones throw away. At night a taxi from central London reasonably priced at around 15 pounds and goes past Buckingham Palace for another view. We took endless runs/walks along the Thames and in the nearby parks and if you want LOCATION then this is it ! Overall a wise choice in comfort ,style and value. We had a great 4 night stay during the Rugby World Cup.",5,2015,10,12
121,Always Dependable & Convenient ,We have consistently stayed at this Hotel whenever we are in London. We love the central location and proximity to the sites. The service is always first rate and the rooms are comfortable. The staff at the concierge is very helpful and patient. ,4,2015,10,12
121,ENJOYABLE STAY,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sr. James Court.  The facilities were lovely and the location was very convenient.  The staff was very helpful and congenial. We did not try any of the restaurants due to our tight morning schedule and late return to the hotel each day.,5,2015,10,12
121,Lovely & Comfortable Stay,"The first night the room was noisy due the passing by vehicle, but after telling the hotel they arranged a new quite room for me immediately. Besides the shower which the water is too weak of my new room, everything is great, clean, comfortable, all the staff is very nice and kind, lovely stay. Will come again!!!",4,2015,10,12
121,Afternoon tea in the Kona restaurant ,"Marvelous, fabulous, sumptuous. Discreet yet attentive service from the restaurant supervisor, Cassy, made this experience all the more special. Delicate sandwiches and indulgent pastries came with a choice of unusual, exotic teas and, of course, champagne. A secret paradise hidden away near Buckingham Palace. What a treasure. ",5,2015,10,11
121,terrible master suite,slept in room 263 and was like sleeping in train waiting room and paid gbp 350 for the same .never been so disappointed with a taj propery . master suite felt so terrible . would not recommend the same to anyone else .,3,2015,10,11
121,perfect stay,"Nice room, quiet, modern. Very comfortable room and agreable stay. Perfect location in Westminster area. St James station extremely close. Hotel staff was extremely welcoming. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,10,11
121,Average at best,"Did not meet our expectations.   Although a good hotel and a very accommodating staff, for the money we were expecting a little more.   The hotel needs some convenience upgrades; i.e. electrical outlets in the bathroom (other than for a razor), in room brewed coffee, not instant.",4,2015,10,10
121,AN ENGLISH CLASSIC,"TAJ ST JAMES COURT AND 51-BUCKINGHAM GATE LONDON.

 A Taj hotel and Taj  51 Buckingham gate, suites and Residence. 

I had a wonderful stay at St James court in August- September/October 2014. Smiling faces of hotel staff  not only makes you feel at home also makes your stay pleasurable, memorable,  and their  hospitality exceeding the expectation of today’s travelers. The chic and contemporary Executive suits are very comfortable and specious.  The hotel creates an individual atmosphere that offers comfort as good as home and a perfect place for business, conventions and for the leisure travelers to London. 

St James court is an English classic and one of the Britain’s finest hotels.  Beauty of this 19th century building is very hard to describe. Origins of St James court can be traced to Elizabethan aristocracy and another period of hospitality. Once home to the Lords, Ladies and gentlemen of the Royal court, the classic ambience resonate with echoes of history as the original eight Victorian town houses that comprise St James court and Taj 51 Buckingham gate. Originally it was designed by architect major Charles James Pawley (1854-1922).  The Taj group has owned and run the whole property since 1982.  And offer an incredible fusion of warm Indian hospitality with world class service and modern luxury. St. James’ Court also boasts London’s only public Telepresence facility.

I like the Miniature Victoria Sponge Sandwiches, White Chocolate Crowns and Coronation Chicken with Golden Sultanas, Smoked Salmon with Rocket, and lots more.

121,guest review,Hotel room small dark and very dated. Miles away from the lift and directions to the room were wrong.I was directed to the employees area which was an eye opener. Food in the restaurant was excellent. Service in the bar OK,3,2015,10,09
121,First stop on our European Holiday - St.James Court,"A stay at this gorgeous hotel is worth every penny.  I felt like ""royal"" from the moment I was greeted at my cab by the doormen. The towel warmers, slippers and robes, although a tad bit small for Americans, were great perks.  Afternoon tea on gold plates and great ""live"" music in the lounge made this stay so special.  And did I say, the location is superb - within walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey!  Thanks to everyone on the staff who were so kind and accommodating.  ",5,2015,10,09
121,Waah Taj !! ... Indeed...,"I did not have much time to spend here but still enjoyed the warmth Taj had to offer. Nothing seems to have been missed while making St. James' Court. The 1800s styled hotel looks nothing less than a palace. Rooms although very neat, are styled as any other executive room. The outdoors have much more to offer. Hotel grounds also are architecturally sound. The hotel is centrally located and at walking distance from attractions- Covent Garden and Musical Theaters of London.",5,2015,10,09
121,Good mid luxury hotel,"Excellent location! 4 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, Queens Gallery & Royals Mews and St.James Underground station. 10 minutes to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Cabinet War Rooms. Comfortable rooms. Good attentive service.",4,2015,10,08
121,Amazing,"Thank you to all the wonderful and helpful staff. The hotel was very well located in the queens back garden almost. I room and whole hotel was very very clean. The on site resturants offered a wonderful range.
Best still the gym had all you need and opened 24hourly 
Would go back in a heart beat",5,2015,10,08
121,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here as it was close to The Apollo Theatre. Staff were all lovely, couldn't have had a better stay. Room size was great, plenty of space for me and two children. Breakfast was great too. Wonderful!",5,2015,10,08
121,Three night in three rooms,"During a short trip to London I booked three nights at which I have to change my room twice, the first room the air conditioning wasn't working so I was moved to another room. In the morning the flush handle broke and flooded the room then I was moved to my third and final room. Mini bar wasn't replenished and no compensation or discount was offered.",2,2015,10,06
121,A Taj Hotel - excellent choice,"A beautiful hotel, excellent service, nice food, pleasant and helpful staff, good location, quiet and pleasant rooms and perfect location, just a few minutes walk to Westminster Abbey or Buckingham palace",5,2015,10,05
121,Excellent location,"A lovely hotel with an old world charm in an excellent location in London. It is walking distance to Buckingham Palace and shops and restaurants. It is expensive but maybe for such a prime location it is priced right. If I could afford to do so, I would certainly return.",5,2015,10,04
121,St James Court Hotel,"Outstanding in every way. Every member of staff is accomplished, attentive and always ready to help. The Kona restaurant was a particular highlight of our stay - offering a superb range of very fine food.",5,2015,10,04
121,Somewhat Disappointed,"Having stayed in Taj and other great hotels in India such as the Oberoi, I was looking forward to the three day stay in the London Taj. There is no doubt that the hotel is housed in a magnificent building in a good location but I still left feeling somewhat disappointed.  There were a number of reasons.  

The executive double we booked was too small, the safe wasn’t working (flat battery) and it was stiflingly hot.  Gratefully the hotel moved us the following day into an executive king room which was much better although the water pressure in the shower was pathetic. When we returned from a full day out in Kew, we had to wait for 15 minutes at reception before collecting our new key basically because the two staff on duty were dealing with other customers and despite a manger (I assume) walking past the queue which developed. The following day, we had a drink and a snack at the bar but my order was wrong so my partner and I ate in sequence rather than together.  Finally the way in which anything other than scrambled eggs is served at breakfast e.g. omelette, is bizarre

Although these might seem like small things, my expectation based on experience in India was one of excellent customer service and an attention to detail which just isn’t there at the St James’s Court hotel.  It seems that you can transfer the brand name from India around the world but transferring the brand values is somewhat more difficult.",3,2015,10,03
121,Superior Service makes a difference,"Our room was ready early for us, and international flyers will be glad of that.  Our room was large.  The furnishings seemed a bit dated, but the excellent service of the staff more than made up for it.  The restaurants and room service was quite good, and my wife and I are foodies.  An excellent location near the Underground, meant travel was easy, and a Taxi was always ready for a nice Dinner or a show.",5,2015,10,02
121,Next to the palace!,"5 minutes walk to the Buckingham palace, the property is a great palace in the central london area. few minutes to get to St James part tube station. excellent location for morning walk from this hotel, close to the park and loads of greenery. the rates are obviously high compared to the others, but i had to pay out an even more higher rate due to the ongoing rugby world cup in london due to which the rates of all hotels in london were crazy.  didn't have the opportunity to visit the restaurants but the check in and check out were pretty quick. wifi speeds were pretty okay, not the best though.",5,2015,10,02
121,Excellent Experience at Saint James Court Hotel,"I absolutely loved my time at the Saint James Court Hotel! My travel agent booked the hotel for me.  I warned the agency in advance that if the hotel was not truly 5 stars in every way--not to waste my time.  The hotel does not disappoint.  From the moment my driver pulled up to the entrance to the time I departed for Heathrow Airport, the entire staff demonstrated professional courtesy and caring all the way! This is not a huge --corporate like hotel--and I think this is one reason it makes for such a great vacation getaway--you are not competing with hundreds and hundreds of other customers.  The hotel certainly has a large feel when it comes to the number and variety of restaurants--this was very important to me.  The courtyard  fountain and decor is fantastic and the KONA restaurant is second to none! I enjoyed eating at the other restaurants on the property as well mainly because the   restaurants offered a variety of cuisine from specialty ethnic to international fare.  I absolutely loved the 24 Karat Gold Tea at the Kona and I really enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland Tea as well.  I did not come to London to do a lot of shopping, I came to relax and to have some downtime for me--and that is exactly what I got.  I did enjoy the fact that it is so close to Buckingham Palace and I even treated myself to a personal private car guided tour of London.  Yes, 5 star hotels are going to cost more and one should expect excellent service...however this hotel provided excellent service with staff who had GREAT attitudes--to me--the staff are the people who really add the value to the hotel experience. Yes, it is time to pay off the credit card for my trip however this is one time that paying on the credit card actually conjures up a hotel stay that was well worth the price and carries a lifetime of wonderful memories for me!",5,2015,10,02
121,MUST stay while in London,"Just visited in 09/2015...Can't wait to return... Staff wonderful,  hotel is CLEAN. LOVE the towels which are bath sheet size and the towel WARMER... Strategically located and a walk to Buckingham Palace, West Minster, Big BEN..  Worth the price!!",5,2015,10,02
121,excellent service,"the reception staff were very helpful and there is a separate designated person who can guide if you are new to the place which was very helpful to us.  all in all we enjoyed our stay in St. James Court, Taj.",5,2015,10,02
121,Wonderful experience,"I stayed as a business traveller just for one night (sadly) at the end of September 2015.  The overall experience was marvellous from the staff, to the rooms, to the food and ambiance.  Perfect for business or leisure and conveniently close to the tube.  The courtyard is a wonderful find - a real oasis. Enjoy if you are due to stay!",5,2015,10,02
121,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, will be our first choice for the next trip to London,  great location close to Buckingham Palace and Victoria station, nice service and staff, clean and comfy rooms with all amenities you need",5,2015,10,01
121,Everything ok,"I visited the St James Court for just one night, I didn't have the opportunity to visit all of the hotel's facilities, but the double room was perfect for my needs. Clean, plenty of space (even in the bathroom), nice furniture. Only complaint about the window facing a side wall and what looked like a service ladder.
Nice location. Prices pretty high, as always in London.",4,2015,10,01
121,Quick stay in London,Hotel easy reach to parks and the river. We walked to and from the Old Vic. Plenty of places to eat near by and the hotel facilities are very good. Nice to sit outside in the courtyard. Gave us an ideal opportunity to visit part of the city centre we had not visited before.,4,2015,10,01
121,Amazing Hotel,"The service from the moment you walk through the doors, until the moment you leave is extraordinary.  The rooms are very cozy and clean.  Every staff person we talked to was very helpful.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2015,10,01
121,London Visit,"Close to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Churches, the Eye and the River.. Was close enough to local restaurants that were not so busy.  Cabs were quickly available and knew where to go. The subway was near by if you choose to use it.",5,2015,10,01
121,charming Old world style in Renovated building,"The Taj Hotels are obviously trying to make this a flag ship destination as this is the only one located in Europe. Its a grand old world feeling in new and contemporary setting.A good location to see London from, near one of the busiest tube stations in London and with walking distance of many interesting things to see.The food was excellent as was the service. Highly recommended for going that extra mile.",5,2015,10,01
121,"Great location, great hotel and great service!","This beautifully appointed hotel is only surpassed by the friendliness and great customer service provided by the excellent staff that work there.  It is ideally located in the heart of London, but secluded from the throngs of tourists in the area. I highly recommended it to anyone wanting exceptional value and service while staying in London.",5,2015,10,01
121,Class Service and Nice location,"Well behaved staff, excellent location, rooms are clean, Walking to underground station, Enjoyed Indian foods at Quilon. Very close to Victoria and Buckingham Gates. walking distance at St James Gardens, Trafalgar Square,",4,2015,10,01
121,Watch out for the noisy school downstairs!,"Our room was directly over a school yard.  Every week-day morning, the loud noise from the boys in the yard woke us up.  The noise subsided somewhat when lessons started but then we had to deal with whistles blowing during PE.  Late one night there were netball games (which went until at least 10PM) so we heard their whistles too!    Additionally, the Internet coverage stinks.  The free service constantly caused disconnections all day every day.  For an additional GBP 10 you can buy an upgraded Internet service, but at the rates they charge, this should be included for everyone!  The staff were nice, housekeeping was great, the room itself and amenities were fine.  But the noise and poor internet cannot be overlooked.",2,2015,09,30
121,Good Location but . . .,"It started when we arrived at 1:30 and were told our room (which was to be 754) would be ready in 10 minutes if we wanted to wait. We waited 15 minutes, then went back to the desk and were told to wait another 5. Then they put us in room 260 instead, saying it was a better room because it had a courtyard view. Not having seen 754, I have no idea if 260 was better, but the courtyard ended up being a problem later.

The room itself showed signs of wear (peeling paint and questionable grout in the bathroom). The bed was not very comfortable--it was firm enough but dipped in the middle so that we had to sleep on the edges so as not to roll inward. And the pillows did not support my neck. In short, my sleep quality was not good.

And then some time after midnight a party started in the courtyard, complete with blaring music and much talking and laughing. It went on for at least two hours. The hotel does not provide white noise machines, so we had to rig up our own using our mobile phones.

I travel to London semi-regularly, and I've stayed a lot of places. Many I would stay at again, but this hotel is not one of them.",2,2015,09,28
121,Weekend Break,Fantastic hotel with excellent staff. The suite we stayed in was very clean and well kept. great choice of restaurants and bars within the hotel. The whole experience was brilliant. I would recommend this to anybody and will defiantly be returning when I go back to London.,5,2015,09,28
121,some rooms are simply not at the standard,"My room was located under the roof, only accessible by a very slow lift, the water tap made a trrible noise (electric pump ?) and I was awaken by noise coming from the roof. I suppose I just got the wrong room, not in the standards of this hotel.",2,2015,09,28
121,Great hotel with a great location,"The location of the hotel is excelent. Close to a lot of tourist attractions. With good weather it is possible to walk to most of the attractions.
The room was very nice, very clean, the bed very confortable.
Quiet location, and the staff was very kind and helpful. 
Will definetely stay there again next time in London.",5,2015,09,28
121,"Great Location, Great Service","Six of us visited London for a few days (much too short of course!) and the Taj, Saint James Court, was recommended to us by a friend who is a frequent visitor. The location could not have been better.  Just around the corner from Buckingham Palace, near the hop on hop off stops, lots of restaurants and Bars nearby.  Lots to see and do without having to take a taxi or even use the hop on hop off.  Service was excellent!!  Concierge was great and booked us tickets for whatever we needed with no hesitation....great seats at the Theatre!!  He was very helpful in offering dining options.  We did eat one evening at Bistro 51, one of the hotel restaurants, and the food as well as the service was superb!!  The rooms were small, as can be expected in central London, but very well appointed and very comfortable. It is a five star property so not really inexpensive but for the location and the uniqueness and the service and the grandeur I think we made a great decision in choosing the Taj Saint James Court. The next time I go to London that is where I will be staying!!",5,2015,09,28
121,"Nice hotel, rooms a little compact","The St. James' Court is in a great location - 5 minutes walk from St. James tube, and a 5 minute taxi ride from the west end. It's impressively decorated, and most of the staff were very helpful. However, there didn't seem to be enough of them on the front desk for the number of rooms in the hotel - I had to wait 10 minutes to check in, and a similar time to check out. This is not a cheap hotel, and I would have expected more staff for the number of guests. The hotel bar is also far too small for the size of hotel. We wanted a drink one evening, but were unable to find a table, so went without.

Our room was was pleasant enough, although the single glazed windows didn't fully close, letting in a lot of street noise, like the bins being emptied at 6:30am. It was also pretty small - never more than 3 feet from the bed to the wall or the furniture. No space for anything but a single arm chair and a desk chair, so it wasn't somewhere you wanted to stay for any period of time. The bed was comfortable though.

Breakfast was very nice. It's a buffet, but the food is all very fresh - the scrambled eggs are soft and moist for example. The breakfast room does not have enough space for everyone, and you will be encouraged to go to the 1st floor conference room instead. Don't - despite what they claim, it doesn't have as good a selection of food. In particular, not as much of the Indian breakfast food. Better to wait for a table at the ground floor restaurant.

Overall it was a pleasant stay, but didn't reach the levels of service or facilities that the price should have commanded.",3,2015,09,28
121,Great location and great style,"We have used this hotel twice for visits to london, its in a great position, but still quiet, and has great individuality and style. Both times we have been allocated small rooms with no view but overall its a nice place to be.",4,2015,09,28
121,DO YOU LIKE TO BE EMBARRASSED,"On Arrival---No Welcome, No Courtesy, Do not come until your Check In time  On Departure--- Do Not Settle Your Final Bill until your luggage are brought down by the bell boy, or you will not receive any service once your bill is settled   Confirm thrice at the front desk if this is the Final Bill or will that keep charging your Card even after you leave and will not inform you by an email later.  ""It is better you ask them to give in writing that you have settled that bill Completely.",1,2015,09,28
121,"agreeable hotel, great location but overpriced considering the room we were allocated.""","Positive stay with a but......
1. Close to touristic attractions/tube = all in a walking distance ;
2. Breakfast was complete and very good ;
3. In general, friendly staff, client focussed and so
but
1. Room 164 had the underground noise and sensation/vibrations: 3 to 4 trains/ minute on peak moments (early morning and evening) (I should have read the comments on Tripadvisor.......)
2. the basket content of chocolate, crisps, sweets, ... should have been included in the 316 euros we paid for one night;
3. the light switch did not work, so at night one needed to walk to the bathroom in the dark or wake up your partner by switching on the main lights;
4. not a great view from this room.
Because of this, the room was overpriced !",3,2015,09,27
121,perfect hotel in London,"I stayed in this hotel for 6 days, which is good. The location is very good, service is satisfied. especially the food, I enjoyed food in various restuarants. I recommend your hotel to my friends and certainly I will book your hotel again when I come to London next time.  Charlie Dai",5,2015,09,27
121,Pleasant staff,Family reunion of my husband's side was held here. The location is near to the  Underground Station and other landmarks esp. Big Ben. We had a great time as we were able to go anywhere without spending too much time commuting. The hotel staff were so kind that they even grant  our breakfast request...fried rice & sunny side up eggs. This hotel is highly recommended to anyone who wants to explore the City of London.,5,2015,09,27
121,Stunnning hotel in a great location,"I stayed for one night in a double room whilst attending meetings in St James Court.

PROs
Near the tube station
Fabulous rooms
Comfy bed
Good breakfast
Restaurants and bars near by

CONs
Expensive as you would expect from a hotel in this location",5,2015,09,26
121,Superb location,"The area is good, very close to Buckingham Palace, St James Station is 5 minutes from hotel. Our room and bathroom were small but comfortable and clean.Hotel filled with friendly staff, a very warm welcome.",4,2015,09,25
121,A good stay in London,"We enjoyed our stay at The St James Court.  The location was great for our plans, just a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and two tube stations a short walk away also.  The staff was extremely accommodating and although we arrived mid-morning, had a room ready for us within 30 minutes after we checked in. Our room was a classic king, which was larger than I expected, based on what I'd heard about European hotels.  It was comparable to hotel rooms here in the USA.  There was a good-sized closet with shelves to keep us organized, and even a pant-press at the ready (although we wore jeans for much of this trip!). Coffee/tea makings were available in the room, with an electric water kettle, although I must admit we prefer fresh-brewed coffee, so did not use it. Each day, we were provided two bottles of still and sparkling water free of charge.  
The bathroom was very clean, although not recently updated (we were aware of this when booking from previous reviews)and consisted of a pedestal sink, toilet and bathtub with shower.  Our only complaints would be that the pedestal sink did not allow adequate space for keeping our supplies at hand and the fabric shower curtain was short and had that annoying habit of blowing inwards while showering. While we had no problem, guests with mobility issues might have trouble with the height of the tub side, as it is higher than most.
Our rate included the breakfast and we enjoyed the buffet each morning.  There was a good variety offered, but it didn't vary much from day to day.  
We had drinks in the very pleasant lobby bar on a couple of evenings and enjoyed the live piano music. Very relaxing. The courtyard area in back was beautiful and we would have spent more time there had the weather been more cooperative.  We had dinner one night in the new restaurant, Kona, next door, and enjoyed it very much.  Food was delicious, service top-notch, quiet, elegant setting.
Our room was on the 4th floor, on the side facing the courtyard, and was very quiet, with only mild rumblings from the tube which runs under the hotel (my husband didn't even notice it until I mentioned it). It was actually rather a soothing noise in my mind.
We would recommend this hotel to friends staying in London, if they found a good rate, as it is not inexpensive.  Great location, excellent service, clean, comfortable rooms, good breakfast to start the day, several excellent restaurants within the complex (Taj 51 Suites is right next door).",4,2015,09,25
121,HHDL tour,"four star hotel,over five building,one with executive suites and apartmentsi would say we were in the basic rooms, not much space and the beds so close might as well be a double lol ,and to be honest for the money i have stayed in better hotels with better rooms,",4,2015,09,25
121,"Wonderful hotel, great location!","Stayed in this lovely hotel for 4 nights mid-September for a girls trip to London. My friend and I shared a classic king room which was surprisingly large and airy. Our room was on the third floor in the back with a view of the school behind the hotel. Which meant at night it was really quiet. The boys show up at 8, but it's not terribly loud and we were up then anyhow.The hotel is in a prime location, we walked to various sights and hopped on the tube (down the street just a bit) for others. The staff were all gracious and helpful. Our room package included the buffet breakfast which was pretty good considering ""buffet"". Special order your eggs instead of the bin of scrambled and even better. I saw some mention that the noise from the tube could be heard, but we really had no issues with that. I'd definitely book a room there again - great value for the price!",4,2015,09,24
121,Birthday treat,"A new concept for Taj hotels and I must say they are certainly putting a lot of London hotels to shame. The first thing you notice is the friendliness and commitment of the staff members and this extends from the front desk through to the catering departments. This trip was made for a colleagues 40th birthday celebrations and after an initial miscommunication the hotel certainly then upped their game in customer satisfaction and total commitment to providing a memorable experience. Particular mention should go to Naveen Sikka, front of house manager, who is a true hotelier. His careful handling of our booking and warm, caring nature certainly made this trip a huge success. As somebody who has stayed in the majority of high class hotels in London, this hotel will certainly be our hotel of choice.",5,2015,09,24
121,Location,"We had chosen The Taj for its location and value. Yes, the property is on the luxury side and we felt for the money we got as much as we had expected from the brand. Honestly, we shop for properties by looking for the cheapest room with the very best location. We only sleep in our rooms when we vacation so the bed needs to be comfortable and the amenities need to be thoughtful and they were. And, as I had said, the location was perfect. You can walk to almost anything you could want to do in London and for those places a little further out, we used the hop on and off bus which stopped right around the corner.",5,2015,09,23
121,Lovely hotel with a beautiful location,"Me and my husband were at St. James court ,London from 8th to 14th  Sept. The location of this
 hotel is remarkable. 
Because of efficient, active and helpful front office managers like Mr.Ritesh Chauhan and energetic , warm,and knowledgeable  concierge like Mr. Binoy Nair our stay at this TAJ property was very comfortable
They are  real assets for St James Court
We really enjoyed our stay and will look forward to visit the property soon.

121,Location and Service,"This hotel is wonderfully located.  Near Buckingham Palace, the theaters, tube stations and numerous restaurants, let alone superb shopping, we could not have been more pleased with the efficiency of travel, etc.  We made an expensive mistake by taking the Heathrow Express to downtown London.  With great help from the tube personnel, we made it to Heathrow for just over 5 Pounds on our way back.  We'll stay here again for all the right reasons...location, food, exercise facilities, service!",5,2015,09,21
121,Good location for touring,A very good location if you like to walk a bit. A bit noisy at times in the room as I believe the underground passes just under the property (or very close by). Ask for a room higher then the 3rd floor.,4,2015,09,21
121,Best hotel at great location,"Best location for touring the key sites.  Needed a button sewed on my suit jacket and they took care of it for free.  Breakfast in hotel is pricey, but there are other very good options nearby.  Excellent friendly professional staff throughout hotel.",5,2015,09,20
121,Beautiful building with friendly staff,"Just a one night stay for us. Room was clean and roomy. Bed was huge. Ensuite was a delightful size. All staff encountered were helpful and friendly. Loved the courtyard.

Location was excellent. st james wood tube was 5 min walk and Buckingham palace, Victoria, Westminster cathedral all close too.

Would happily stay again.",5,2015,09,20
121,An Expensive Treat,"Had a couple of nights here, quite expensive put a very nice hotel all the staff very helpful and the amenities in the hotel seemed very good. Several restaurant's within the hotel all very expensive only had the one meal  there ( due to the weather) it was expensive but very nice breakfast seemed over priced put there are plenty of places you can get the same meal for a 5th of the price within 5 minutes",4,2015,09,20
121,A beautiful courtyard!,"The courtyard is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for an afternoon snack or evening cocktail.  The service was excellent.  The price that we booked was very fair for London.  The area is good, very close to Buckingham Palace, but we prefer to stay in Mayfair.",5,2015,09,20
121,Wonderful stay,"We stayed for two nights Sep. 10-12, 2015 and had a wonderful stay.  Our room was very large for London standards, the service was excellent.

Indeed next to Buckingham Palace and The Parliament, you can also easily walk to Trafalgar Square, Piccadily, The Strand, Regent Street, Oxford Street, Hyde Park aso aso. Covent garden and The Strand are nearby with many opportunities for good theater and musicals",4,2015,09,18
121,home away from home!,"My husband & I stayed in this hotel for a few days last summer.
It's a very well located hotel in the heart of london next to the buckingham palace.
Since we were visiting all the tourist places within london the central location was very helpful. The staff was friendly and warm. It seemed like a home away from home. But since the hotel is in a heritage building the room we stayed in on he 7th floor needs some renovation.The lounge bar served some excellent wine and starters. Overall a fine experience.",4,2015,09,18
121,Birthday Treat!,"We stayed here on 10th September and what a fabulous hotel! I took my Mum to London for her 80th birthday treat and had informed the hotel ahead of us arriving. When we checked in we were given a free upgrade to an executive king room and they left a lovely little cake in the room for Mum, which was a very nice gesture. All the staff were very helpful, especially as my Mum had a bad back. The doorman especially asked after her the next day and was very kind 😀 a big thank you to all of the staff! The bar area was also lovely with a piano player, and the barman made me a cocktail that wasn't on the menu, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was a comprehensive choice of cooked, fruit, yoghurts, juice, cereals, pastries, all very fresh and plentiful. Would certainly stay here again, been hinting heavily for a return for my birthday in January 😀",5,2015,09,17
121,Excellent Location,"Our room and bathroom were small but comfortable, clean and had everything we would need.  We stayed one night on a special deal and it was good value.  Great location for a tourist; good helpful service.  Everything you want from a hotel.",4,2015,09,17
121,Not bad - rooms are nice,"The hotel is very nice and full of character. I stayed for 3 nights and it was ok. The staff are very friendly, good breakfast and general service was excellent. 

The main issues for me are the bedroom windows are very thin and have gaps around the frame so there is a constant draft in the room - also you can hear every single noise from outside even on the 7th floor. I'm my view the Windows need to be resolved or better fitting. The other issue I have which is a common fault of hotels is the really poor water pressure in the rooms leaving the shower to be less than desirable. ",4,2015,09,17
121,Numero UNo,"I cannot think of any other place in London to stay. They really make you feel like Royal. After Buckingham Palace this is the Royal residence. They rate 10/10 in all parameters. The food, the rooms and the staff is beyond any words. KEEP IT GUYS!!",5,2015,09,16

121,"Great hotel, great location","This is my second stay at the St James Court. The rooms are huge, clean, comfortable and well decorated.  Staff cannot do enough for you and are really friendly.  We only ate in the bar, but the food was excellent.  The room i was given was a room kitted out for disabled persons - I have never seen so many pull cords for assistance!  The room I was given previously was nicer in my opinion the main difference being carpeting - it had a more luxurious feel.  The hotel is close to Buckingham Palace and is in easy walking distance of all main central London attractions.   A great place to stay.",5,2015,09,16
121,"Good hotel, very good location","The hotel is really well located. Just a 2 minutes walk from Buckingham palace, 5 minutes to Big Ben, etc.
The hotel itself is a good hotel, with very friendly staff, good breakfast and un general with good facilities.

121,Lovely night at the Taj,"This hotel is lovely and the customer service is great.  Whilst the rooms are a little dated, the Indian themed decor is so pretty.

You will never feel home sick when you stay there. People from all part of the world like us Australia Russia Asia and what not. stay here.

121,Overall good stay even with the dull rumbling of the trains every minute or so.,"I would have rated this hotel with 5 stars were it not for the constant noise and rumbling of the trains below or near the property.  We were on the 3rd floor and it is very noticeable and a bit of an irritant.  Back to the actual hotel, the room was very nice and the staff was courteous and helpful.  The location was excellent for exploring London, which we did most of on foot. ",3,2015,09,12

so be care full",4,2015,09,11
121,A luxury hotel should have rooms that are private,"What is it about hotel companies? People book hotel rooms for a number of nights. The implication is that they want somewhere they can sleep.  Luxury hotels can throw anything that they want at you, but frankly, if you don't sleep, you are not going to be able to enjoy your stay. So, to pay top-whack for a room (executive, not standard) that has walls that are paper thin, and where you hear everything going on around you, all the phone calls, all the toilet ablutions,  is just not acceptable. I don't care what facilities the hotel has if the rooms fail to give me a good chance of getting a decent sleep.  So, oin that basis, this hotel has to rank as the worst value I have ever stayed in. I don't pay to go to a luxury hotel only to find that I can't sleep and I feel utterly shattered the following day. I'd be better of on a bench in St James' Park.",2,2015,09,11
121,Perfect for Business,"Lovely hotel filled with friendly staff, a very warm welcome. Very clean and luxurious feeling. Perfect for a business meeting or overnight business accommodation, or a bit of luxury. Food was excellent and a really good selection for breakfast.   A little pricy for some things - i.e the mini bar - £3.50 for a bottle of water or can of coke - but I'd expect costs to be elevated in the centre of London.",4,2015,09,11
121,Awesome location and usual Taj service,"You can trust a Taj Property in most locations and this one is no different. 

Positives
- Located next to Buckingham Palace, so Hyde Park, St James Park, the palace and south bank are close by.
- Rooms are not the biggest, but comfortable
- Enough food options in the hotel. The Indian restaurant is a half decent place to grab vegetarian grub as well. 
- excellent service

Negatives
- very ordinary health club area
- breakfast spread very thin, but maybe its just London standards (I was told other hotels are similar too).

All in all, an expensive but dependable stay in the heart of London",4,2015,09,10
121,A gem in central London,Stayed here a few times and have always had a great time.  Rooms are very well pointed and some of the corner rooms have a great layout with loads of space so you can relax in the room without feeling cramped.  The court yard area is beautiful and peaceful which is great as you are only a short stroll from Parliament and Buckingham palace.  The choice of restaurant choices are excellent and the service level is brilliant.,5,2015,09,10
121,Informal Business Meeting,"I arranged to meet some international business people here and wanted it to be right!  The staff were very helpful and even managed to arrange a 'hard wired' internet connection for me so that I could show some advanced equipment to them. We had a reserved area in a quite part of the downstairs bar facilities and were able to conduct our business while enjoying canapés and wine.  Absolutely perfect!
I didn't stay overnight so have not been able to comment on the bedrooms etc.",5,2015,09,09
121,Nice clean convenient hotel,"This is my third time at this hotel. My first experince was at their nearby aprtment complex and it was excellent. Large room with well appointed  kitchen and hige bedroom
As for the hotel itself i really have NO complaints. Room is clean, the service is excellent and the bed is comfortable.  
I ordered breakfast for 8:15 and it came right on time. The bathroom amenities were of good quality as were the robes. I guess a five star hotel should have shoehorns but that's not really a serious complaint now is it?  I would happily return",4,2015,09,09
121,Very good location,"Located near Buckingham Palace, easy walking distance the London Eye, Westmister Cathedral. Our room was toward the backyard. All the staff were very pleasant and offer very good service. Room very clean.",5,2015,09,09
121,This hotel typifies all that's best!,Our seven night extended stay at St. James Court was perfect in every sense of the word.  The hotel was recommended by British family members who live in London but travel to India for business quite frequently. The Taj is a luxurious hotel with good value for all the conveniences offered.  Starting with an incredibly attractive and delicious all inclusive breakfast to lovely rooms to courteous service  and spotless cleanliness we can only congratulate the superb staff.  Thank you for making our stay perfect.,5,2015,09,09
121,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location for exploring London and with its proximity to Victoria Station, is very accessible from Gatwick Airport.   Service is great and very good buffet breakfast - try and get a table by the windows. Wonderful outdoor Bar/Lounge area. Classic room may be a bit small but is fine",4,2015,09,09
121,London,"The St. James Court hotel was very clean, my room was spacious including the bathroom. It had a mini bar with complimentary coffee/tea and all the other little amenities needed. The staff provided excellent service and the concierge was right on top of things. Loved the location, close to everything.",4,2015,09,09
121,Very good hotel,"We stayed over the August bank holiday weekend.  This hotel is very good for visiting the main tourist attractions London has to offer, especially if you prefer to go by foot.  Buckingham Palace and Westminster are within a 10 minute walk as is the Mall.   Theatre Land is 15 mins on foot (5 mins in a cab).",4,2015,09,09
121,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for one night on a business trip and was very impressed. Surprisingly reasonable valet parking, excellent service from the concierge to the reception to the Bistro restaurant. Lovely food and attentive service.",5,2015,09,09
121,Old world charm with all the modern conveniences.,"Old world charm with all the modern conveniences.  Rooms were comfortable, clean, and very attractive.  It was also very quiet.  One did not hear other guests coming and going or noise from other rooms.  Within an easy five minute walk to Buckingham Palace and a ten minute walk to Victoria station.  Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.",5,2015,09,09
121,Another excellent stay,"I have just been fortunate to vistit this nice Taj hotel again, this time for a long weekend with my daugther. I am still impressed with the attentive staff, the very nice and quiet location. We enjoyed the spacious room and the free coffee and tea. On the day of departure we were happy to store our luggage safely, so we could enjoy the last hours in the city before flying home again.",5,2015,09,09
121,Brilliant Location,"This hotel is situated within 300 metres of Buckingham Palace and an excellent location for all the main sight seeing in London.  Our room was spacious and well appointed.  The staff are helpful and friendly.  We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we felt is was a little expensive.  We stayed 3 nights and it is a great base.  We were able to walk where ever we wanted to go - Covent Gardens, Hyde Park, West-End etc.  Also easy walk to Victoria Station.  Good shops and restaurants in the area.",5,2015,09,08
121,Pleasant Outcome of An Unexpected Stay,"I was in London for 2 night unexpectedly in the midst of two trips. I chose this hotel due to it's walkable location, near many attractions and good restaurants, and affordability. The room was a bit dated and tired, but very clean. I found a comfortable spot from which to work in the lobby. The staff was warm and welcoming.",3,2015,09,08
121,Nice Hotel with good service.,"My whife and I had a pleasant stay at St. James Court Hotel, Westminster, London. The room was toward the backyard, and we was not desturbed by the traffic. The staff was friendly and serviceminded. My whife and I will like to stay at the same hotel, when we are back in London.",4,2015,09,08
121,Damn I LOVE this hotel - Home from Home in London,"We stayed at St James Court for 3 nights at the end of August for our Civil Partnership anniversary. This is out 4th visit to the Taj and we love it. 

The greeting from reception was lovely and we really felt like welcome returning guests. 

We received an upgrade to a Master Executrive suite which was fantastice. The suite was huge and spacious with plenty of room to relax after walking aorund London. 

The service at the Taj was excellent as always, the door staff were polite & welcoming with reception always saying hello when we walked past. 

The staff in Hamptons were lovely and made some great cocktails for us. The manager (Royston I think) was professional as ever and really looked after us. 

We had a superb meal in Kona. The food was really fantastic & the service impeccable. I certainly recommend this restaurant. 

My partner used the spa and and an ayurvedic treatment that was extremely good. 

Overall this hotel is excellent. Superb location with a warm genuine welcome and great service.

I look forward to returning on the 19th September.",5,2015,09,08
121,Taj Quality in the Heart of London,"If you've never stayed at a Taj Hotel, you're truly missing out. This hotel is everything you would expect from the Taj group. The room service menu has all the staples you'd expect to find - salmon, Caesar salad, streak, plus an incredible authentic Indian menu with an impressive wine and beer list. The on-site restaurants and breakfast buffet are fabulous. The rooms are small, but well appointed, with robes, slippers and safes in every room. The hotel is also surprisingly family friendly. Upon check-in, each of my children was handed a goodie bag filled with coloring books, a stuffed animal and a nice box of crayons. The showers are powerful and hot. The location is ideal. Truly, this hotel is all you need for a wonderful stay in London.",5,2015,09,08
121,"Great location, attentive staff","We spent 7 nights at the St. James.  Our first room smelled of mildew. The next room was noisy. (the tube)  Our last room was fine except for some electric issues.  Thats the bad stuff.  What is good about this place?  The staff bent over backwards to make our stay the best.  They moved us without complaint BOTH times, and moved our luggage for us.  We booked with the breakfast option.  DO THIS!  We have never had room service before.  This was included with the breakfast if you wanted it.  OF COURSE we wanted it!  It was great!  Every single staff person we encountered was polite and friendly.  These people make this place somewhere you want to book again.  Some of the rooms are a bit tired-walls need freshening, bathrooms a bit of attention. The reception area is very nice.  Would I stay here again?  Most definitely would be my response.  The location is great, easy walk to most of the to see sights in London.  There are many places to eat within the area.  Book this hotel.  For the price, you wont be disappointed!",4,2015,09,07
121,Wonderful hotel,"this hotel is wonderful. its location for Westminster and  everything around is perfect.. not that I did any site seeing as I was on business. perfect for heading to the houses of parliament, the river and Whitehall.",5,2015,09,07
121,We Love This Hotel,"We love this hotel.  The location is perfect for tourists, near many of the most important tourist sites.  The hotel is reasonably priced, and the rooms are larger than in many other London hotels.  We were there for eight nights, and we stayed in one of the studio suites, which was quite roomy.  The service at the hotel was excellent and friendly; the concierges were particularly helpful for tourists.  The hotel also has a doctor on call for guests who need medical attention, and he was very nice and very helpful to us.  One of the hotel restaurants, the Quilon, is a Michelin star restaurant serving South Indian food, and it was great.  Breakfast is served in the Bistro 51, and it wae excellent, too.  We look forward to our next visit to this London hotel.",4,2015,09,07
121,Nice rooms and very nice atmosphere in the bar,"I had a very quiet, large and nice room. The hotel is located very nice and closely to the (Green and St. James) parks and a lot of hot spots if you would like to make some sigth seeing. Approx. 25 min. trhought the parks to reach Picadilly. The bar war very nice with a live piano player.",5,2015,09,07
121,One night business stay,Excellent hotel. Very plush for the price paid. Very handy for the Buckingham Palace end of town and all those tourist attractions. Five minute walk from St James Park tube and so handy for access to Westminster or a short walk across the park for Piccadilly and Green park. My third stay at this hotel and every time a pleasant experience and remarkably good value for money. This time I paid not much more than for a Premier inn.,5,2015,09,07
121,Excellent location but Smell of mold,The Hotel is well located; 5 minutes walk to buckingham palace and all other monuments like London eye. One inconvenient is the smell of mold in Rooms and Corridors. The service was perfect and the staff is kindly,3,2015,09,07
121,... Great location ... Terrible service ... Not worth the $,"Cute hotel but that is about it ... 

Very bad water pressure in the room
Almost impossible to mix hot/cold water 
Plastic bottle opener which would not open anything :-) (one would think that such hotel could afford to get a proper one)
Odered egg white omelette with ham tomatoes and cheese and was served full egg omelette with ham and tomatoes ... 

When asked duty manager for hotel manager she did not even bother calling to check if he is there ... simply said that she is the manager ... 

Well, first time but definitely last time there ...",2,2015,09,07
121,Beautiful hotel but thin walls,"The hotel is gorgeous and spacious! There are two entrances close together. Make sure you go to the one where the flag/carpet says St. James Court. The other entrance is for Buckingham Gate Suits and Residences. We made the mistake of just walking into an entrance, thinking it didn't make a difference - the two entrances look very similar and looked as if they were for one establishment.

The room was spacious and bed really comfortable but unfortunately we didn't get a good night's sleep as the walls are thinner than expected and we could hear a murmurs of conversation and crying babies in the room next to ours. For a Taj brand hotel, we expected a better sleep environment. We could almost make out what the conversations were in the next room and definitely woke up multiple times in the night because of the crying baby next door.",3,2015,09,06
121,Lovely Hotel,"This was our second stay within 4 months.  We stayed for 2 nights on a B & B basis.  The breakfast was OK  it was buffet style but everything hot wasn't hot, it was warm and the only eggs available were scrambled.  On day 1 we were not offered any toast, we had to ask. Apart from that little niggle, the staff here are first class, the rooms comfortable and the location is ideal for seeing many of the sights.",4,2015,09,06
121,Old fashioned service in a modern hotel,"I love this hotel and stay here frequently. The staff in every position can never do enough for you and genuinely seem pleased to be at work, which is not common these days. the rooms are modern and tasteful and spacious for London and they have old style glamour throughout.  The facilities are very good and the setting beautiful so overall cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2015,09,06
121,Still the same,"We stayed here three years ago when it was the Crowne Plaza and found that little had changed.  Many of the same staff were still there, especially in the concierge staff, which is excellent.

The facilities are adequate and the value for the price was very good.  Wifi was included, breakfast was not.  

The facilities, including the rooms are a bit tired and could use some updating.

Overall it was a good stay at a reasonable price.",4,2015,09,05
121,Central comfort with flavours of India between Victoria and Buckingham Palace,"Don't expect a view, but you can expect Indian hospitality and flavours in this East meets West oasis of comfort in the heart of London. The rooms are comfortable and functional with all the key items you need. Breakfast (included in our room rate) featured excellent orange juice, fruit and tastes of the orient, alongside typical full English and continental spread.
I will use the place again for business trips.",4,2015,09,05
121,Beautiuful hotel with friendly atmosphere,"Lovely hotel with excellent lounge area in reception and lovely garden area for drinks etc. The rooms were large and very comfortable and well decorated. The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The dining room was lovely with good service and the food was very good. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. Would definitely stay again, this hotel was great for visiting the Palace.",5,2015,09,05
121,Great place to stay but check your bill,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times over the past 5 years.  It is good and central.  I like the quirkiness of the rooms and hallways to and from.  I hope they never do away with that.  The rooms are a decent size as are the bathrooms.  Very comfortable.  5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.  Would highly recommend..  But, do check your credit card statement re charges.  My card was debited twice for my stay and this has yet to be resolved meaning I am currently 1000 ponds out of pocket.....",4,2015,09,05
121,"Good location, bad room(s?)","While in a convenient location for a London visit, the rooms are not sound proof at all. We could hear everything our neighbour was talking on his phone. Room sizes were inconsistent for the same room price. We got a tiny room while other people in our group got much bigger and spacious rooms for the same price. The hotel's website says 'The chic and contemporary Executive Rooms offer views over Westminster or St. James’ Courtyard.' We got a room with a view over a generator/ AC unit which was noisy throughout the night. It was lucky we were hardly spending time in the room! Will not be returning to stay, but will still pop around for a lunch or dinner at one of their restaurants perhaps as the hotel itself seems to be good just not all its rooms.",3,2015,09,04
121,Excellent  hotel come again.,"Everything is excellent. . Services and staff are very friendly .. rooms are very nice and perfect location. . Everyone is very helpfull..Thanks to Anubhav Rana.. he care a lots ...Definetly will come again..
Me and my wife both of us enjoy and lovely stay...",5,2015,09,04
121,"Very nice, and well-located. However...","Be careful : in some of the rooms, it is difficult to sleep because of the sound of the tube. The staff is very approachable and helpful. The hotel is beautiful ans near the magnificent monuments of London",3,2015,09,04
121,"Great location, superb hotel, superb staff!","I booked one night at this hotel (executive double) as a wedding anniversary present, I chose this hotel as much for the location as the reviews. Right from the start the staff were incredibly helpful, and special mention definitely goes to the duty manager Rahul Nadkarni who arranged some impeccably timed room service for our arrival, what a fantastic start to our stay. The location is superb, we walked everywhere, we went out for dinner that night and had a lovely walk back to the hotel through Picadilly Circus, Green Park and past Buckingham Palace. It really added to the evening seeing all these sights on foot. On returning to our room, the hotel had sent up a cake with 'CONGRATULATIONS' iced on the plate! A fantastic touch!!  The room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean, a good size and there was no noise at all from outside.
 The staff were more than happy to look after our luggage in the morning so we could check out and still enjoy London some more before travelling home. 
We couldn't fault the place, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay here, we shall certainly be returning for another stay as soon as we can.",5,2015,09,03
121,Streets ahead of other 4 star hotels in London,"Great service, great location, with really lovely Taj inspired ambience around the reception and patio areas. Added extras: London Bikes docking station at front door. I would recommend this hotel and definitely would return.",4,2015,09,03
121,Great location,"First time staying in this area of London.  Great location for ease of walking to so many sights and great shopping.  Were upgraded to lovely large room on 4th floor.  Beautiful comfy bed and spacious bathroom.  Slightly annoying to be interrupted by staff intent on removing contents of mini bar as we hadn't wanted to hand over a credit card in case we drank anything!  Felt as though customer couldn't be trusted and was annoying.  Dressing gowns for tiny people, tv and ironing blowing electric socket didn't detract too much from comfortable night.  Would say rooms definitely not top class but functional.  Staff courteous.",4,2015,09,03
121,"Great Location, Incredible Service!","St. James' Court is a fantastic hotel. I was there for vacation with family, but also had some business to attend to. It was great for both. Rooms are very nice, dining options were great, and I have to point out the room service was the fastest I've ever experienced! Great stay, and I look forward to returning.",5,2015,09,03
121,its fine,"my review to the whole experience was fine, i though it would be amazing like the pictures on the website. the room was clean and the staff were nice. it wasn't like what i expected to be.  overall the place is nice but a bit old the prices is over rated but on the other hand the place was clean. beds wasn't comfortable at all even the pillows were too soft.",3,2015,09,03
121,A Great Stay,"We stayed in The St. James Court Hotel in London and loved it.  Everything was extremely convenient and easy, and the concierges and front desk people were always friendly and extremely helpful.  There is a good place to eat, and it opens early, which is great for early flights.  We easily walked to theaters, to Buckingham Palace, and to Westminster Abbey.",5,2015,09,02
121,Sparkling Jem near Buckingham Palace,"I have been to London a number of times for both business and leisure. This hotel was on par with 5 star hotels, yet at a 4 star, or even 3 star price. We had a small suite and it was lovely, perfectly appointed, quiet, lush towels, robes the whole ""Four Seasons"" type experience.",5,2015,09,02
121,A nice Stay in St James Court- A Taj Hotel London,"The hotel is quite good, comfortable and nice. The rooms are quite good and Hotel Staffs are very polite and helping in nature. The hotel lobby is beautiful and everything worked fine in the hotel rooms. The breakfast area is too small and service in the breakfast area needs to be improved. Overall this hotel is an excellent one in the heart of London. The location, ambience and comfort will attract repeat visitors again and again. The concierge service is very good in arranging excellent transport from the Airport and back. I recommend this hotel for visitors to London.",4,2015,09,02
121,"Wonderful staff, but mixed feelings","It is the staff who make this hotel in the top categories.  Everyone we met, from the gentleman on the door, at reception  in the bar, the breakfast staff and the two maintenance men who tried to make the television work: they were all wonderful and made us very welcome.  However, the room was a disappointment.  We can only think it was a single room, because there was no light and no bedside cabinet on my side of the bed.  The television stopped working and despite the best effort of the maintenance staff it did not come back to life.  Every few minutes there was what I can only describe as a low growl which vibrated through the room.  Presumably it was the underground.  It was not particularly bothersome and did not affect our sleep, but it was noticeable.  The location is excellent and very convenient and the breakfast was delicious.  However, we feel a bit let down.  It was meant to be a special weekend for us and the blurb on the hotel website promised an amazing experience.  It was fine, but nothing exceptional - except for the staff.  I hope the owners of the hotel realise how good they are.",4,2015,09,01
121,st james court taj hotel,"great stay in classic studio room 5 nights.plenty of seating with couch & chairs.very clean, well kept. fantastic location close to many attractions very close to bus & tube. easy walk to many well known attractions taxi rank opposite great value for the money.",5,2015,09,01
121,Overpriced tiny rooms,"This hotel was very expensive and we expected it to be the nicest place we'd ever stayed. Boy were we disappointed. The room was tiny, there was only a small TV, there was a rather uncomfortable chair (like in a doctor's office) and a desk chair, the tub/shower was thigh high and hard to get into. The room was clean and it was convenient to all the sights.",2,2015,09,01
121,"First class hotel with efficient, helpful staff.","From arrival until checkout we were provided with first class service by efficient and friendly hotel staff.  The room was spacious, well appointed and clean.  The hotel's location is within easy walking distance of several of Londons tourist attarctions (Buckingham Palace, Westminister Abbey)",5,2015,09,01
121,Weekend break,"Just spent the weekend at this hotel. First class, staff amazing with a can do attitude, nothing was to small to ask.Went for afternoon tea at the Kona,this is a must, keep up the excellent work, staff where amazing",5,2015,09,01
121,"Great hotel, great location","Taj St James Court is an absolutely great place to stay at. This was not our first stay here. The hotel is very centrally located and walking distance to Buckingham Palace and other attractions. The hotel decor is very classy. The restaurant serves a good flare. The breakfast has a very good spread. The staff is extremely helpful.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would also stay there when I visit London.",5,2015,09,01
121,"Great location, comfortable rooms - enjoyable stay","First, London is famous for small hotel rooms - this is not true for the St.Sames Court. There is space in the rooms!
The horel has a great location if you want to be in the heart of the city, near many landmarks like the Westminster abbey and the Buckingham palace.
Rooms are comfortable, equipped with all you could need.
Staff is kind and helpful, breakfast rich and tasty.
Wifi is free in the rooms as well and WORKING!",4,2015,08,31
121,Very dated,"On arrival everything was superb we thought to ourselves we had picked the perfect hotel for our 1 night stay in London. It was until we stepped out of the lift and was walking down the hallway we started to realise it was to good to be true. When we opened the door to our room we was not impressed. It just felt very odd, we had a corner room which meant our bed was placed on the wall as soon as you walked in which didn't make it very grand or welcoming. The bathroom was just completely awful, I really dont complain but we was so disappointed we might have high expectations I dont know but I do believe most people would be unimpressed with the old bathroom. Overall we hardly spent anytime in the room, we usually like to chill in the room and watch some TV and enjoy what we paid for. However this time we went out and got drunk come back late and left first thing in the morning.  The staff were incredible for the short time we was there and the hotel reception made you feel like you was Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, until you go to the room. Maybe thats me or maybe it was just the room I had and my sisters room next door too. It was not dirty or loud it was just simply to dated for us and my friends and we felt the reception and whole vibe of the hotel was completely mismatched sadly.",3,2015,08,31
121,Excellent staff and location,"Just came back from my first time in London traveling solo. This Hotel has the best location - so central to all the touristy sights and easy access to public transportation. 
But the best part was the attention I received from the staff. Very warm and welcoming and bent over backwards to please. Anubhav at the front desk goes above and beyond!",5,2015,08,30
121,Fabulous location.,"Great hotel, close to Buckingham Palace.  Beautiful alfresco eating area in summer. Lots to like with a relaxing piano bar, comfortable seating and the ambiance of a 5 star hotel. Careful when choosing rooms as they vary greatly in size.",4,2015,08,30
121,Nice location near Buckingham Palace,This is a very nice hotel near Buckingham Palace and only a few block from Big Ben and Westminster Abby.  The rooms are nice and some have great views.  I would classify it as a boutique hotel with a lot of character.  You can sit and have a drink or dinner in the lobby or outside in the courtyard.,5,2015,08,29
121,Great location shame about the rooms,"Chose this hotel for a special occasion.  This hotel is in a fantastic location but this is where the pros end.
The rooms are definitely not luxury and are not worth the money.  We asked to be move which we did and got a slightly  bigger room but the desk staff didn't even ask what the problem was!  The rooms are very tired, mould in the bathroom, a very unglamourous shower curtain, the heated towel rail didn't work and the water heater under the sink was so loud you couldn't hear yourself over it.  It never turned off so you never got to have any cold water!  Upon checking out we spoke with the Duty Manager who offered us a deal when we book again, however in hindsight we wouldn't want to waste the money for the same bad experience.
",3,2015,08,29
121,Amazing caring service,"My mother and daughter went to London, booked online and stayed at this hotel, i have to say that the staff were exceptional, very caring, the food was amazing, we ate at the Kona Restaurant and breakfast a joy! Defiantly  recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,28

121,Nice place if you get a room away from the train.,"The hotel is beautiful and the service was excellent. Unfortunately the rooms we were in had noise all night long from nearby Victoria Station. Additionally, the electricity in the rooms was not working at all outlets, which were too few for us to be able to brew a cup of tea, use a hair dryer in the bathroom or to adequately charge our electronic devices.",4,2015,08,26
121,Anniversary Visit,"This was the first time I visited the hotel. The Hotel over all is lovely, clean and has character. I infirmed the hotel before my arrival I was bringing my wife to London for our anniversary and was tols by the hotel they will take extra care of us and look after us. On arrival I was upgraded to a Executive King from a Classic room and requested an uograde to a suite ans was told £80 charge, then £50. My stay was lovely nice room and polite staff, unfortunately they had failed to look after me as they said they would have.",5,2015,08,26
121,Excellent Hotel with room for improvements ,"I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and carefully booked it online where I was looking for a quite place in London in the busy month of August. Location wise it met my expectation as its  located very nicely in Buckingham Gate few steps from Buckingham Palace . It's close to shopping area on Victoria Street and many restaurants and pubs are available in close proximity to the hotel . Hotel building is a very old historical building converted nicely to this hotel . There is a court yard in the middle of the hotel offering a nice seating area, weather permitting.its understood that the other wings of the building consist of apartments and under different management.
The hotel is managed by Taj Hotels and this is another reason why I selected it . During my last trips to India I stayed at some of Taj Hotels and their service was awesome. However , there hotel in London did provide good services but not as good as those on India.
When I checked in I proceeded to my room and I was disappointed with room standard, size and toilet as it was not as per the expectations. I was told by the Receptionist that I was getting an excellent room overlooking the Court Yart!. When I saw the room , there was only part of the court which was visible and in fact there was a wall in front of the room . That receptionist, a lady , should have stated the proper explanation without any exaggeration. I stayed at that room for one night. On the second day, I complained to the front office manager and he agreed to offer me an upgrade but at additional cost . I negotiated the price and finally agreed for the upgrade . The new room was excellent and located on the 6th floor. Though I paid extra to what I budgeted for , it was important for me to enjoy the stay.
Generally speaking , staff where nice , helpful and friendly. There are 3 to 4 restaurants attached to the hotel as well as the bar. One of them provides South West Indian cuisines and others are European. I tried three of them and they were very good.
Regarding negative points , though my rate included breakfast , every morning I had to go through that hassle of convincing that it's part of my rate. Not only this, even when I received my check out bill , breakfast rates were added but wrentit hey were removed,
The other things is that the housekeeping attend to the room once a day whereas other hotels do this twice a day ",4,2015,08,25
121,"Great Location, Stinky Lobby","If you have read my previous reviews, you will know that the sister hotel (the 51 Buckingham Gate suites), - adjancent to St. James Court, in my opinion is one of best hotels in the world.  This time around, my partner and I stayed in the St. James' Court Hotel for seven nights. here is my review:
Pros: location, location, location: hotel is located between two tubes stops, 5 minutes to the first station, and around 15 minutes walk to Victoria station. My partner and I either took underground everywhere we went or just walked. The hotel is walking distance to parliament, London bridge and most major attractions. We even walked to evening songs at the Abbey.
Pros: tons of good restaurants and shopping - on Victoria street - five minutes from the hotel,
Cons- the smell: I don't know if it was the summer heat but OMG, the moment we walked into the lobby, the smell of dirty carpet or something awful hit us hard. The hotel is aware of this terrible musty smell as you can see them trying to spray misty stuff to tone it down. The third floor where we stayed, the corridor smelled like someone had used a toilet and left the door opened. Yes, location is great and even though I like the property I will continue staying at the Suites and avoid the hotel.
Tip; walk around the corner to Victoria street - turn left - there are various nice breakfast/lunch joints and pubs - for much reasonable prices.",3,2015,08,25
121,Atmospheric hotel,Just had a lovely weekend in this lovely hotel which has lots of character. In a fantastic location we could walk to all the places we wanted to go. All the staff were very helpful and just let us get on with our break although we knew they were there if we needed anything. Had a meal in the courtyard which had  a great atmosphere. We could hear some rumblings from the underground but this was not annoying and think is acceptable in the centre of the city. Only downside were the towel robes which were not much use of you were over a size 8. Will  take my own on next visit which we hope will not be too far in the future,5,2015,08,24
121,A great stay and good customer service,"Our stay at the Taj was very good, the staff are very attentive and little treats for the children made it extra special for them. We had a small issue of party noise one night and we commented on this during checkout.  We were offered reductions on the rooms without question, this is good customer service and means I would stay with the Taj again.",4,2015,08,24
121,"Excellent Hotel, fantastic location","I was at this hotel with my two teenage children. This hotel is an extremely well looked after hotel. From the concierge to the cleaning staff, everything was extremely well run. The room was immaculate! No paint peeling, no chipped tiles, everything worked perfectly and looked perfect. This is certainly a 5 star hotel in every facet. The selection of restaurants, at the hotel, was exceptional. The location could not have been better for Buckingham Palace and all of the Theatres near Piccadilly Circus. I would Highly recommend this hotel, and will stay there again when I return.",5,2015,08,24
121,"friendly, central Hotel","friendly and qualified service, quiet rooms, centrally located near Victoria Sation and St James Park. Pubs and cafes close by if you prefer taking your breakfast and dinner outside the hotel. Comfortable for both business and holiday travel.",4,2015,08,24
121,"Yes, Clearly a ""TAJ"" Hotel - Friendly Staff, Excellent Food","We stayed for 7 nights in August 2015 and enjoyed every day of our stay at the St. James Court - clearly, a TAJ Hotel.

Ideal location, pleasant staff, excellent food, clean rooms - what more can one ask?

Very impressed with the breakfast spread - caters to all tastes: vegetarians and non-veg; Western and Eastern. WOW.

Efficient service - and with a smile. 

The room service was very ""prompt"" and the mini-dosa was surprisingly very good.

The Front Office Manager, Sunaina Soares and the Head Concierge, Binoy Nair go out-of-the-way to fulfil all your special requests and needs. Great assets indeed.

My only complaint was that the free WiFi was rather 'slow' - it should be 'bumped' up to at least 1 or 2 Mbps.

Clearly this is the hotel for my family whenever we are in London - for business or a holiday.",5,2015,08,23
121,We were treated like royalty,"My wife & I helped organize a five day family reunion in London which just concluded.
Our base of operations was the St. James Court Hotel in Westminster. We were all treated like royalty. There were 12 of us and the check in (by the very pleasant and professional Andrea) went smoothly. Every morning we had a wonderful breakfast  overseen by the wonderful manager Abdul who catered to our special needs and helped provide familiar items like fried rice for us. Thank you again Abdul. The concierge Fredrick was also helpful in arranging transportation.
The hotel itself is in a great location for many wonderful sights and fine restaurants where we had no problem getting a table for 12 each day. We highly recommend this hotel for tourists and those like us on a family reunion.",5,2015,08,23
121,Excellent Hotel,"Visited this hotel for a short break with friends. Had a lovely room on the fourth floor which was comfortable and quiet which was only spoiled by a false fire alarm activation in the early hours of the morning!
However, our friends who had a room on the second floor were less fortunate. The hotel was hosting a large wedding party for a Saudi family who continued to celebrate, getting louder all of the time until 04:30.
Although the hotel apologised the following morning, it didn't compensate for the lack of sleep. Instead, had the hotel allocated the bedrooms in close proximity to the wedding party to wedding guests and allocated rooms well away from the party venue to other guests, the problem would have been solved.
It's a great pity, because the hotel and staff was excellent on all other levels.",4,2015,08,23
121,Very convenient location,"A good hotel, conveniently located close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey. St James Park tube (can feel the train vibrations!) and Victoria Station complex. Standard room is a bit on the small side, but this is Central London. Breakfast is quite adequate. Service is good. Public areas are quite classy. The décor reflects the Indian ownership but in a tasteful way.",5,2015,08,23
121,NICE EXPERIENCE,Staff  is very very and skilled: Good quality of sleeping  Good choice for restaurants We appreciate very much bistrot andhis main courses Historical places Also relaxing piano player during the evening  in the hall was  very appreciate Historical  places also relaxing  Relax zone in the garden  I miss some magazine in the hall Normally you find HERALD tRIBUNE  FT  and DaILY Mirror  free,5,2015,08,23
121,Overall,"Lovely Hotel wth lovely garden, excellent food & service. very close to Buckingham Palace, lots of resaurants around. Nice quiet hotel. Staff are very willing and helpful. We would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone who would listen.",5,2015,08,22
121,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights, we stayed on floor six and had a lovely very clean room with slippers and robes, the toiletries are plantation and they smell beautiful. There is an iron and ironing board in your room and I forgot our toothbrushes phoned reception and they sent up 2 complimentary toothbrushes straight away, the staff are very helpful and polite and nothing is to much trouble.  The hotel is also in a great location. Outside they have a beautiful courtyard where u can dine or just simply have a drink and it is so peaceful.",5,2015,08,21
121,Just OK for a 5*,"I wouldn't rate it as a 5* as I have been to better 4*.  Breakfast was disappointing, coffee was cold, no tomatoes for cooked breakfast and service was slow.  Good location for Buckingham Palace and the cleanliness of the hotel was good.

121,Great City Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights, nice hotel. Staff efficient and friendly. Double room a good size for London. Decor a little tired perhaps but not too bad. A special shout out for letting me check in to my room at 8am after flying in from Australia! Great location, close to sights and transport. Would definitely recommend.",4,2015,08,19
121,Disappointing Service (although 1st time),"There is always a first time and this was it at St. James Court. We didn't really have much to complain at our previous stay at this property previously, but it all came undone this time. House keeping and front desk services, well below the hygiene factor expected from this property",3,2015,08,19
121,Another good stay,stayed last year on visit to Buckingham palace and stayed this time using a gift voucher I had for Christmas from my wife.Lovely refurbed room this time king size bed and no view so quiet which we always like as we live in the country so it is always quiet.Will deff stay again.,5,2015,08,18
121,Great Place to Stay,"A great place to stay. Right in the middle of everything in London. Great location, great service. All questions and required necessities were solved immediately with no difficulties. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,18
121,Incompetance,"The best word I could use to describe the second-tier level employees (i.e. not the waitresses or the busboys or the initial responders, but the managers, the lead maintenance employee, the front desk and in-house meal receptionists) is incompetence. It took nearly 24 hours, with multiple failed attempts, lost of confusion and lack of response, in order to receive a working minifridge, which we required for medical reasons. We were unable to enjoy our short time in London because of the delays at the hotel. Worse, each employee operated in its own silo, which meant that the not one person knew enough about an issue to provide a response, so instead of getting an answer or a thoughtful response immediately, every question was met with, ""I don't know about [X] but I will call this person who is in charge of that matter.""  The hotel was clean and food was great, but the incompetence of the managing staff was very disappointing.",2,2015,08,18
121,Great Stay,"Polished Service and great room. The reception service smooth and efficient. The car parking service very handy. Breakfast offering diverse and fresh. All staff attentive and courteous at all times, nothing is too much.

121,The Majestic Taj!,"We decided to stay at this hotel as it was near to Buckingham Palace, where we were going for the Royal Day Out tour, but we were bowled over by the hotel itself. Beautiful rooms, lovely restaurants and bars, live pianist adding to the atmosphere of the evening. This just made our visit to London even more special. And not only is it near to Buckingham Palace, it is also in walking distance of Whitehall, and over the river to the London Eye. Magic!",5,2015,08,17
121,Short sightseeing break,"The service at SJC is terrific. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was really nice, very spacious with a lovely en suite.  The location of the hotel is great being just a couple of minutes from Buckingham Palace and just a 15 minute walk to Harrods. There are also good shops round the corner in Victoria Street. The food was fabulous and it is the first hotel which has asked how I would like my poached egg cooked! I have nothing negative to say and we would definitely return on a future visit to London",5,2015,08,17
121,Luxary at a great price near EVERYTHING!,"This was a Very nice place to stay, Great room, great staff and wonderful amenities. It is walking distance from Buckingham Palace. Close tot he subway and bus lines.. Pretty quiet street and a beautiful courtyard. Staff was very helpful with arrangements for activities and not pushy about tipping..",5,2015,08,17
121,Birthday treat,"I recently stayed at the Taj hotel for a birthday celebration. 
When we reserved, Francesco was extremely helpful on the phone and after talking to him we were very looking forward to stay at the hotel. 
When we arrived at the hotel we received a warm welcome from Raoul. 
We checked in in a lovely spotless room. I really appreciated the birthday cake in the room. 
We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant ""Bistrot"". Both of our meals were very good and tasty. 
Thank you !

121,Great hotel in London!,Great hotel with excellent location in London. It's easy to walk to many major attractions. The hotel's interior is very stylish and the service in the hotel is very good! Excellent breakfast! I recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to enjoy of the good quality!,5,2015,08,17
121,Fabulous,"Have stayed in many Taj Group hotels in India (mainly on business) and all are superb in every aspect of luxury and service. Tthis one is on par with all of them and is something of a ""treat"" for anyone wanting to spoil themselves or have somewhere that is very comfoatable and relaxing to stay when on business trips or simply just want somewhere to stay at a reasonable price in a very nice and accessable place in London. Recommend to anyone",5,2015,08,17
121,Superb location,"Very nice hotel.  Good service, comfortable beds and a nice bar. A TAJ hotel therefore an Indian flair which I find charming.  The central London location is great. Walking to many popular tourist areas is easy. We purchased the breakfast included package and this never disappointed us. Great way to start the day.",4,2015,08,17
121,"Great location, service","I stayed at St. James Court for 4 nights last week. Great experience! 
Rooms - The rooms were clean & well equipped. Bathroom was spacious. The only problem I had was that the TV wasn't working in our room.
Service - the hotel maintained the high service standards of Taj Group. Everyone from concierge to house keeping to restaurant attendants were pleasant to talk to, always ready to help with a smile ( even after I'd checked out).
Location - the hotel is centrally located, 5 mins walking from St. James Park tube station, and a 2 min. walk from Buckingham palace. Even a taxi to Harrods cost £6-8.",4,2015,08,16
121,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff.","We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights after traveling around England. I had selected this hotel after reviews on Trip advisor and was not disappointed. From the moment we walked through the doors we were well looked after. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was very spacious, clean and well presented. The grounds are very peaceful and well kept. Our air conditioning stopped working after the 2nd night. We were given a new room immediately. Staff were polite and  very attentive and always available to help with any queries. Hotel is close to buses, the underground, restaurants and waling distance to some attractions.",5,2015,08,16
121,ANDY,"I have been staying at this hotel for over 15 years , so that should be good enough to explain why i am still there. One concern that i do have ,is why the staff keep changing every time i have been there recently?",4,2015,08,14
121,Excellent Hotel,"We had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this hotel without hesitation - the customer service/experience is exceptional. We were looked after very well from the moment we arrived to the moment we left - staff went out of their way to make sure our experience was a good one.  We had dinner in the lovely Quilon restaurant (adjacent to the hotel) which was also fantastic, the food, wine and service make this restaurant a very special place to dine. Breakfast at the hotel was very good – a fantastic array of food and again very good service.   We look forward to having an opportunity to stay at this fantastic hotel again in the near future.",5,2015,08,14
121,Grand ole Hotel - nice and comfortable,"We had an excellent room on the sixth floor which had a king size bed and an excellent view of the courtyard.  The bed was very comfortable and afforded my wife and I a fantastic night's sleep.  Even though this is an old hotel, everything is well kept up and clean, The lobby is beautiful with plenty of places to sit and the bar is OK as well.  The really good thing about this hotel is its location,  It is approximately four long blocks from Buckingham Palace along quiet streets, just two blocks from Victoria street where all the shops are waiting for your money and diagonally across the street from the Bon Gusto which has excellent food.  The London Eye is a good walk from the hotel, but it can be done.  This was our second time here and we will stay here again when we go back to London.  Again, we completely enjoyed everything about this hotel.",5,2015,08,14
121,Friendly and charming,Not quite the grand Taj hotels of India but a perfectly respectable 4 star London hotel with a good location. There was sometimes a lack of staff available at reception and the rooms were a little tired but overall experience was good.,4,2015,08,14
121,Very Pleased with this hotel choice,"We were able to get a 100% discount on the room, which included breakfast, due to the credit card my husband found on the street on the way in….. score!. Just kidding!!! However we did get a 50% discount on booking. The superior room was a very good size, comfortable bed and nice walk in wardrobe area, some may say it was super superior. 

The only criticism I have of this hotel is the terrible water pressure in the shower. It was like a trickle of water. Not very satisfying.   Next time, I would opt for the super dooper superior room; I believe this room comes with added water pressure. 

The breakfast was decent where you could order eggs any style. 

The location of the hotel is good and very its very easy to get to anywhere in London. There are a lot of pubs in the area, where you can grab a pint and a pub meal. However this area mainly caters towards the mon – fri work crowd, so a lot of businesses in the area are closed over the weekend.  Come to think of it, this location kind of sucked, suits walking around everywhere until 5pm on a Friday and then bam!... ghost town.  The bar attached to hotel was closed on Sunday, there was a pub around the corner that didn’t even open at all.  Disregard my initial review, go and stay at The Shard, its only $3500 US per night.  Bet those rich folks had water pressure ;)",4,2015,08,14
121,Beautiful hotel,"A really really gorgeous hotel with all the normal stuff, TV kettle robes slippers etc.
The bar downstairs is a great place to start or finish your evening in London.
Beautiful rooms which have always been immaculate and a great breakfast make this one of my favourite hotels",5,2015,08,13
121,Well located hotel for the sights,"My wife and I stayed in the St James's Court hotel for 3 nights whilst visiting London to celebrate our anniversary.  I have actually stayed before on business recently, so this was my second visit.  The hotel is located close to Buckingham Palace and Westminster, as well as to both St James's Park and Victoria tube stations.  The hotel itself has a lovely reception area and good, if not slightly tired, rooms.  The staff were all extremely helpful and pleasant - they even sent a cake to our room for our anniversary - and I would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying in London for a city break. ",4,2015,08,12
121,Very happy with our stay,"We stayed at this hotel during a quick 3 day stint in London after a lengthier Ireland vacation. We were very happy with the service here. My husband picked something up in a market that didn't fit in his checked luggage and the night before we were leaving and the morning we left (6am) Leo was so helpful in getting it shipped home to us. All of the staff in fact were very cordial and professional and wanted to make our experience great. Additionally, there was live music by the bar each night. We stayed one night and had a drink before heading to bed and it was lovely. Finally, the location can't be beat! It's so convenient to all things ""tourist"" but I will agree with another reviewer's tip that we stayed on the 3rd floor and you could hear the tube. It didn't bother us but I could see how some people may be annoyed by it.",5,2015,08,12
121,Staying in Taj St James Court Loandon,"overall a pleasant 7 day stay. Though I must say,  the carpets and bathroom doors need a little refreshing.  The service was very good, our Tv was not working and the technician was in our room within 5 min t fix the problem in no time. One of the most hospitable holes in London, that I have stayed in.",4,2015,08,12
121,"Great location, great room","We booked a Classic Kingsize Bed room and got upgraded to an Executive Kingsize Bed room which we appreciated very much! The hotel's appearance is elegant but not overdone. Our room was on the 5th floor with no view but very quiet, its size perfect and so was the bathroom. Our rate included breakfast which is served in Bistro 51. It was buffet style and if you preferred something else than scrambled eggs you could order them to your liking at no additional charge. We truly enjoyed our stay at St. James' Court.",5,2015,08,12
121,"Underwhelmed with hotel, great location ","We stayed at the Taj this week, I can honestly say I think it is 3 star at best.

The location is 200 meters to Buckingham Palace, 10 mins walk from Victoria and 5 mins walk from St James tube Station. St James Park is gorgeous and 5 mins walk away.  There is a nice courtyard and reception area. 

Our experience started after coming off a long haul flight 30+ hours in transit and had asked months in advance if we could get into the room early, we waited 2.5 hours (and our plane was delayed so actually 4.5 hours vs the initial request). We were told our room was ready but needed to be checked, another hour passed... Much needed rest before an event did not eventuate, needless to say we took our own bags up as we thought may take 2 days to get from reception after demanding the key we thought an hour to check was quite long enough.  During this time many guests were checked in ahead of us, so this was a lesson in how to completely irritate a customer before they even get to their room. 

Unfortunately they didn't seem to have the basics sorted;

Housekeeping:
Day 1: no towels. 
Day 2: walked in on by housekeeping whilst naked 
Day 3: some towels but not a full set 

Bed:
The bed was very uncomfortable and had seen better days, should have been changed a few years ago and the pillows end up folded in half so I could try get comfortable. 

We were on our honeymoon, they left us a slice of cake in our room to congratulate us which was thoughtful but unfortunately not well thought out as we discovered it after coming home at midnight post dessert, it's the thought that counts though I suppose. 

I wouldn't stay here again, the room was large by London standards and the location great but I expected more from the Taj.  ",3,2015,08,12
121,Nice hotel and location,"Very conveniently located to the underground, yet in a quiet neighborhood.  Only issue we had with the room was trying to figure out the master switch to control the electricity.  Took several tries to determine which direction of the switches by the main door was in the ""on"" position, then trying the switch by the bathroom door.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.",5,2015,08,11
121,A True First-Class Experience,"We were on a family vacation to Europe from the US. London is one of the stoops, and I am glad that we booked this hotel. It is very close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Big Ben. Great location!! The staff were friendly, well-trained, and treated guest like they were all VIPs. Breakfast was expensive, but very good. If you have a long day of travel activities, it is worth to eat well in the morning before you go!",5,2015,08,11
121,Outstanding service! Book it NOW! ,"I booked St James Court only a few days before travelling and found a fabulous deal through trip advisor. I had previously visited the hotel for afternoon tea which was wonderful so hoped the hotel would live up to expectations. 

St James Court totally exceeded expectations! From the moment we arrived the customer service was exceptional. We were checked in early and our room was upgraded due to a request for twin beds. The receptionist asked if we were celebrating and I explained it was my birthday. Later that day I had a birthday cake delivered to my room which was a lovely surprise! 

We stayed at St James for two nights and the room was a great size and well decorated. Comfy beds, air conditioning, robes, slippers, designer toiletries and all the little extras you would like in a room. The bathroom large and very well lit. 

Our booking included breakfast and I would certainly recommend an offer which includes this. The food was delicious and you could help yourself to the buffet or place individual orders for items such as Belgian waffles, poached eggs etc. 

The location is excellent. Buckingham palace is only a short walk away as is St James tube. The hotel is also near to St James and Green Park which are lovely little havens during the busy Summer months. 

I will be returning to London in a couple of months and very much hope I can find another great value deal for St James Court! If you are travelling to London make sure you check this place out....",5,2015,08,10
121,Superb!,"From the moment I booked the SJC, I was treated with the utmost deference and respect. I felt like royalty!  They responded to every query immediately and positively, they had a solution for every potential problem (I am handicapped) and they did everything graciously and with a smile. 
I needed a walk in shower.  No problem. I needed enough room for my Walker. No problem. I needed an early check in.  No problem. And when I arrived, unwittingly I was escorted to the wrong room (bathtub), I was immediately escorted to an upgraded Suite. 
The staff were exemplary, the room and bathroom immaculate and the decor was amazing!  I dined for lunch in their Michelin rated Quilon and for dinner in the beautiful al fresco Coutyard (using the Bistro menu). I think the moderately priced Courtyard dinner was the best meal I had in Great Britain with amazing lamb chops and a super Summer Pudding! One caveat however... The cocktails are very pricey.  A Negroni was £12.50 ($25 CDN)!  Wine was more reasonable though. 
Plus! It is around the corner from Buckingam Palace!  Very handy for shopping and sightseeing!
I highly recommend the St. James Court. I wish there were more Taj hotels in North America (there's one in New York and one in Boston) as I would like nothing better than to be pampered so indulgently again as I was at the St. James Court. Bravo, bravo!",5,2015,08,10
121,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here for for nights from August 1-5. I just love where this property is located, right next to St. James Park tube and Victoria. Very easy to get to. The fact that is is right next to Buckingham Palace is a great plus.
 The staff at the hotel are very professional and courteous. One night i needed a few bottles of water and they got it immediately for me. The room lay out is very nice and size of the rooms are great for 2 people and the noise level outside is at a bare minimum. The rooms are very well appointed and beds very cozy. The central air is fantastic and the rooms never feel stuffy at all. I loved the breakfast buffet in the morning on the first floor and one on the ground floor and be a bit packed at times. They have a nice spread for breakfast. The courtyard is lovely and nice way to unwind after a long day. All in all a great place to stay for business or pleasure. 5 stars for me.",5,2015,08,10
121,Great location - Excellent friendly service,"The location is fantastic.  Only a short walk to many many attractions or the tube or bus stops.  During our 8 day stay, the staff was very friendly and genuinely concerned with providing us a pleasant experience.  We would definitely stay here again",5,2015,08,10
121,"Comfortable, Clean & Recommended","I stayed at this hotel for 1 night for a dinner event. The hotel is situated at a strategic location, near Buckingham Palace, and the bus stop is just within a walking distance. Tube station is also near. Very comfortable and I highly recommend it to families, friends, solo travellers, business persons.",5,2015,08,10
121,"Good location, good service quality value","From moment of check in until last day of our 5 nights stay, the friendly staff of St James Court, Taj Hotel, did everything to make it pleasant.

121,"Great amenities, service could be better","I chose your hotel based on reviews from other websites, and I wanted to have as same as wonderful as it review mentioned. It was wonderful amenities. Bed is perfect, Very clean, large shower room.  But one bad experience upon check in and check out.  I could not check in right away when I arrived the hotel at 19:30 was non sense. ( The reason was that previous customer stayed longer, and cleaning has been delayed.) After flying and travelling roads more than 24 hours, this was least I expected from this wonderful 4 star hotels.  I had to wait at lobby for 40 min waiting my room to be ready.  It took me good 40 min to finally get my room, after I tried to check in to the room, and I needed to wait another 15 min to get my luggage. I was exhausted and I was extremely unhappy about this incident.  As I emailed this to hotel manager, and they replied with nice offer, but other staff does not seem to be notified about this offer, and I saw them as a bill at check out.  The wonderful hotel facilities, clean and quiet. But unfortunately, I have some unlucky experience add to my stay.  But I get a feeling that I was just unlucky this time, and this is not usual case.  There is no doubt that this hotel is very convenient for people who like to see musicals near Victoria station or visit Buckingham Palace.",4,2015,08,07
121,Great Hotel - Great Service,"When booking this hotel we did so because we wanted a lodging close to various attractions such as Buckingham Palace, the Eye, House of Parliment, Westminister Abby, to name a few. It definitely provided what we had wanted. It was also close to several restaurants and pubs as well as right around the corner from the St. James underground metro station. There also are some nice shops/stores for shopping. Other than location the hotel provides a nice room (Classic King and Classic Studio King) and outstanding service. For instance, twice we called housekeeping for little things and within five - ten minutes someone was at the door. The lobby which is very nice has a bar/restaurant area just down from the receptionist desk and what is nice is they had someone on the piano on a couple of the evenings. We would definitely recommend this lodging.",5,2015,08,07
121,Great location and staff,Great location and the staff was always helpful. Room was small but well furnished and the bathroom was very modern.  Short walk to Victoria Train/Tube Station & St. James Tube.  Buckingham Palace was just a few blocks away and it was an easy walk to Westminster.  The concierge staff was especially helpful.,5,2015,08,07
121,Short London visit,"We stayed at the St. James court for our time in London. The Hotel is beautiful and the staff are quite friendly. The location cant be beat as your in walking distance to Bunkingham Palace, Big Ben, and the house of Parliament. So glad we stayed here as the subway as on strike and it made getting around complicated for those not staying near Westminster. We had a free breakfast which was included.  All of London is quite expensive but I felt this hotel for the quality and location was well worth the price.",5,2015,08,07
121,The taj,"The Taj was amazing experience, it offers just more than any average hotel. With bars and restaurants connected and in the heart of central London there is so much to offer.   Will defiantly be staying here in this glamours hotel rich in tradition and a modern twist. Recommend to others to stay will thoroughly enjoy the experience.",5,2015,08,07
121,Great Location - Not Right For Every Traveler,"My wife had never been to London, so we booked a room at the St. James Court for two nights. The location is great. At the heart of many must see locations, close to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and all the sites in Westminster. The prices were reasonable, and the hotel has some great staff who will go out of their way to ensure your stay is comfortable. 

Inside the lobby is comfortable, and there is a bar that serves everything from high tea to a nice whiskey. 

If you are staying at this hotel, you need to understand this is a very old building. Some rooms (like ours) was a bit of a hike from the elevator (lifts) down some interesting halls and several doors. Inside the room which was quite nice, was a fairly nice bed, seat, luggage rack and small desk with chair. The bathroom had an interesting tub that was a really big step up from the floor. 

After getting to our room which was ready early, we relaxed on the bed after the long flight from the US. At this point we heard the ""rumbling"" which looking at the map revealed that this wing of the hotel was directly over the District Line of the London Underground. The noise from the trains was noticeable while we were awake, and never bothered us while sleeping - this could have been due to the jet lag - however we slept quite easily. If you ask for a room near the front of the hotel you should be able to minimize if not totally avoid the sounds from the tube below.

Go to this hotel if you simply was a nice clean room that is centrally located. Don't go to this hotel if you need a view out of your window - Most of Westminster is under construction.",3,2015,08,06
121,Great Hotel,"Lovely location , hotel superb , would recommend, staff friendly , close to Buckingham Palace , tube / bus stations nearby. Breakfast is good , self service or you can order table service , quiet area.",5,2015,08,06
121,A very good choice in London,"This hotel was excellent. Good responsive service. Excellent food in the restaurants (breakfast was very good and the Banks was very good for Dinner.) We had an excellent room, well appointed and clean. Very comfortable bed. All this comes with an excellent location for local sites or any thing you wish to do in London. Close to the St. James Park tube stop.",5,2015,08,06
121,Horrible stay! Way below the expectations of any 4 star hotel,"Had a 1 night stay in this hotel..too bad we did not take pictures....
WARNING! The rooms do NOT look anything like the ones advertised on major booking platforms. 
It seemed like we were in a very very very old 2 star hotel, in a very creepy way.
The hallways have a depressing greenish color (at least where we stayed), bad lighting, they are extremely narrow,you cannot have 2 people passing through at the same time, the carpets are stained and in general the way to the rooms can be confusing. 
The room itself...again, NOTHING like on the photos of what we should have had. Old, stained, the bathtub floor was brown-dirty....you would just simply get a really depressing feeling while staying there for more than 5 minutes.
I am not sure if all rooms are like this ( and I would hope not!)
But we saw 2 more rooms, which were exactly like the one I described and the experience was just horrible.
Staff was okay, nothing outstanding, but okay.",2,2015,08,05
121,"Fantastic location, very nice hotel","Located a 10 minute wealk from Victoria station and even closer to Buckingham Palace, this was a great hotel we found by chance online. reception staff was very friendly and helpful as indeed, was the entire staff. Lovely rooms, recently modernized. We appreciated the padded hangers for delicate items, the ironing board and the hair scrunchy packed with the shower cap - Little touches that make a lot of difference. Our rooms were corner rooms, facing the inner courtyard, on the 4th and 5th floors - great location!

One evening we had dinner at the Bank restaurant, a very pleasant venue with attentive staff, lovely food and very good value for the price.

Our only gripe was with the Bistro breakfast room. While not huge, the breakfast buffet was perfectly adequate and they will do eggs and other items on separate order. But the restaurant itself is cramped;  due to it's architecture, it's split into  several smaller rooms meaning that the tables are close to each other and there is a constant traffic between the tables.

But we really enjoyed our stay and will certainly be back.",4,2015,08,05
121,wonderful hotel,"this is the second time we went to this hotel. Even it changed his name, it stays the same. The staff is very pleasant; professional. they tried to speak slowly in English for us. The breakfast is good but expensive",5,2015,08,05
121,Majestic Hotel,Beautiful Hotel in a great location. Excellent staff. We dined at the Bank restaurant looking out onto the courtyard and the food was superb. Service was attentive but discreet. If you get the chance I would highly recommend staying.,5,2015,08,05
121,Good hotel in Central London.,"Except for the sound of the tube at 5:00AM, this is a wonderful hotel with great service just one block from Buckingham Palace.  A three-minute walk gets you to a tube station or a bus stop.  The rooms are spacious, bathrooms a bit tight, and the included buffet breakfast was great.",4,2015,08,04
121,Vacation Travel,"Picked this hotel mainly for the location but were well pleased with the room and with the service. The hotel was spotless, the staff friendly, the courtyard beautiful to sit in and have a relaxing drink on an evening and the central location was amazing.",5,2015,08,03
121,Shades of old empire ,"Beautiful, if shady, courtyard behind the hotel is perfect for an aperitif and there are three excellent restaurants within the hotel along with a comfortable lobby. The vibe is 'old empire' so those wanting a more modern experience probably best look elsewhere.  However, it's not old in a fusty sense and the customer service is attentive and professional to the core.  

The TV 'state of the art entertainment' system however was a complete disaster - all I was entertained by was a blue screen.  Couldn't get it working even after the engineer reset it. For that it loses a star. ",3,2015,08,02
121,Inviting,"Very nice. Charlotte checked us in and was so nice and informative! Rooms are small as you would expect but so clean and comfortable. We had robes and slippers ready for us along with turn down every day. The tube (train station) was very near and easy to follow. We had breakfast included which was nice but prefer having breakfast along our walks. 
Would stay here again. Thank you!",4,2015,08,02
121,Birthday treat to London,"Booked for 1 night, extended to 2 night. Great location for Buckingham palace (5 min walk) Houses of Parliament and London eye. Knightsbridge 30 min walk. Nice restaurants and pubs close to hotel. The hotel is of a high spec as soon as you enter the lobby.  Doormen are friendly and efficient when hailing taxis. All staff are friendly and very helpful.  Our room was classic queen size. Bed was so comfy, towels and bedding were fresh everyday. Hair dryer in bathroom and also one in bedroom which could be plugged in wherever.  Iron and iron board were also supplied as was the obligatory trouser press. Along with bottled water and tea and coffee. Complimentary toiletries were of a high standard. There were bathrobes and slippers hanging up in wardrobe for your use. We booked a spa treatment at the wellness centre, utterly wonderful treat followed by use of the steam and sauna facilities.  The courtyard is a lovely oasis amongst the hustle & bustle of the city and the afternoon tea at Kona restaurant is another wonderful indulgent treat. Would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,08,01
121,Excellent Service and Great Hotel Location,"After reading many reviews for hotels in London, we chose St James Court due to location and overall ratings. I was not disappointed and the service exceeded our expectations. Take time to orient yourself to the area since the streets do not run parallel and can be confusing. The location is perfect for access to Underground and to both St James park stop and close to Victoria if you schedule bus tours or travel to St Pancras for the Eurostar train. Buckingham is just down the street and you can easily walk through Green Park to Piccadilly for shopping and cafes. The food is excellent at the hotel as well. Good access to a couple small markets for beverage or snacks. If you enjoy an older hotel with atmosphere and old world service, you will love St James Court.",5,2015,08,01
121,Poor start,"We arrived for check in at 1345, acknowledge check in not till 1400.  1 hour  still waiting for our executive master suite to be ready!  Told it won't be ready till 1500.  Struggled in with 2 suitcases each whilst concierge watched,  hope things improve.",2,2015,08,01
121,"Stay at St. James Court Hotel, London",Very Good Hotel.  Good hospitality and great place to stay in Central London. Team takes care of every need very well. Truly a great experience. Would recommend to all my friends to stay at St. James Court. Very conveniently located.,5,2015,07,31
121,Highly recommend! I'll definitely return to St. James' Court.,"I actually rate this place 4-1/2 but we don't have that option on Trip Advisor. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and found that St. James' Court offered the comforts we were looking for when on vacation in London for the first time: a very clean, spacious, and quiet hotel room (we couldn't hear our neighbors), air conditioning and temperature that we could control, free wifi access, and fantastic customer service (we were greeted every time we entered the hotel). Buckingham Palace is down the street, and Westminster Abbey's only a couple of blocks away. The hotel being walking distance to the major tourist spots, which was - and is - the biggest benefit. Also, Bistro 51, the restaurant in the hotel, laid out a buffet that captured the complete English breakfast, and the bar/restaurant next to check-in offered nice dinner options. I didn't rate St. James' Court a full 5 out of 5 only because the wifi was spotty in our room, and, after considering the regular hotel rate, I found the TV small and lacking in TV channels and recent movie options. We were quite hungry after 11pm (because of jet lag) and found the room service menu (for after 11 pm) to be weak. Aside from that, everything was fabulous. We will be sure to stay here again when we return to London.",4,2015,07,29
121,Surprisingly large room for Europe,"We stay at this hotel every year for a conference and we really enjoy it.  They always take good care of us and they keep the bar stocked.  I don't know if we got an upgrade or not, but the rooms are unusually large for Europe.  If you want to book an excursion, the concierge is happy to help you out and they will even bill it to the room.  When walking through the hallways watch your step and watch your head.  There are plenty of places to trip if you aren't paying attention.  It's a good hotel, but you probably won't have a view from your room.  That's ok though because the size of it more than makes up for it.",4,2015,07,29
121,Very warm welcome,"We stayed for just one night, a fantastic location. Minutes from Victoria Station, minutes from theatres. Tube just around the corner along with Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament etc. The Hotel comprises of beautiful old buildings built around a courtyard which has a very nice restaurant area. Our room was very large, very traditional but with all mod cons and extremely clean. We were welcomed at reception by Noah who could not have been more helpful. Highly recommended",5,2015,07,29
121,PRISTINE VISIT,"IF your looking  for a perfect location, lovely hotel and GRACIOUS staff then the St. James court is your best choice. We were 7 days and loved every minuet of them. Our trip was To the Open at the Old Course and then on to the Open. Our experience will never be forgotton.",5,2015,07,29
121,"Great location, poor breakfast","Stayed there for 3 nights beginning of July. Very nice hotel with great location, big room. The only major complaint goes to breakfast room and breakfast itself. First of all, breakfast room is too small for such a big hotel and it's always crowded. Second, for the price of 28 GBP you expect a larger choice of everything, from bread, cereals, fruit etc.
If I compare this breakfast and room with Sofitel Piccadilly with similar price it's two different worlds. Altogether, since the whole hotel is well designed the breakfast location is poorly done.",4,2015,07,29
121,Nearly Good!,"Stayed at this hotel, when visiting London, attending a Musical in the West End. Hotel was very clean, generally staff very polite, rooms very well presented. Breakfast was a complete mess: The coffee never did arrive, we had to get our own. The toast arrived very late, after the breakfast had gone cold. It took 20 minutes to get croissants. The tables were far too close for comfort!",3,2015,07,29
121,Excellent Central London Hotel,Well situated hotel close to Buckingham Palace and St James Park. 3 minute walk to Tube station. Would recommend the king sized rooms as rooms are not massive as is often the case in central London hotels. We had a standard king which was certainly spacious enough with small balcony overlooking the delightful courtyard. Highly recommended especially if you book early for a bargain price.,4,2015,07,29
121,"Very comfy bed, hotel needs upgrading but good stay overall.","My wife and I live in London and know quite a few hotels in the center. This is the first time we came across the Taj. Whilst having work done on our apartment we checked into this hotel. It's a 4 star so we were not expecting to be overwhelmed but were pleasantly surprised:

This is not a luxury hotel from the look of the corridors, lobby and the rooms first impression but the beds are comfy with brand new sheets and the towels in the room are also brand new. The bathrooms are old but the shower is powerful. The rooms are clean and we were happy staying there. The hotel has ALL the amenities of a five star; branded toiletries, chocolate on pillows, dressing gown and slippers, good bottled water etc etc

The courtyard in the center of the hotel is incredible and has a great bar. We will be going back. The Indian restaurant is Michelin starred and worth a visit. 

The spa is slightly run down.

Overall this hotel is good and worth staying at. Great beds are the best feature and probably the most important anyway.",4,2015,07,28
121,A very pleasant hotel,"A lovely hotel, very clean, very welcoming, excellent location We will be returning. We booked this hotel direct with the hotel and found them most helpful with information on London and directions to theatres. We wound highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,27
121,Nice hotel - poor view,"We enjoyed our stay in London and really have no complaints except that all we could see out our window was a brick wall. It was a small room and not getting sunlight or a view made it seem even smaller. For a 4-night stay, I would expect we would have received a nicer view or a larger room.",3,2015,07,27
121,"Nice But Too Large, Too Impersonal","I recently stayed at the Taj, St. James Court Hotel.  On a positive note, the hotel is very attractive, the location is excellent for touring and the rooms are quite nice.  However, I believe the negatives outweigh the positives. The hotel is very impersonal.  There is no sense of warmth, of comfort, of greeting.  As a guest I never felt welcomed by any of the staff.  I cannot set this aside as a bit of the tough British attitude as in my many visits to London I have generally found hotel staff to be quite pleasant.  The rooms NEED modernizing.  The small TV is on a desk 15 feet from the bed making viewing impossible.  Internet service is very poor.  Room decor is not what one would expect from a 5-star resort.  The room service menu is extremely limited.  There are very few choices for lunch or dinner, certainly less than what you would expect.  So, while the exterior is nice, the location great there is nothing about the St. James Court that would compel me to return.",4,2015,07,27
121,London,"We had a great time, the hotel is pretty and clean as well as the rooms and bathrooms. The only thing I didn't like is that you had to walk a lot to get to your room. It had good restaurants and it's at walking distance from many interesting places.",4,2015,07,27
121,If you want location this is your hotel,"Having stayed at TAJ hotels elsewhere (US as well as India)..this one is a disappointment.  Rooms are old and they look old and poorly maintained (paint pealing, carpets faded etc). If you add on BF to your stay and say there more than 3 nights you can predict the menus for the rest of the year! Check-in slow, lobby un-inviting. Room not ready on time. Over all an average hotel in a good location.",3,2015,07,27
121,Expensive for a relativ customers experience,"Had the room with discount so the price was kind of okay.
The room was booked for special occasion but the staff didn't made any effort to make us feel okay. 
This hotel rely to much on his business card to look after client.

To compensate their spa is just perfect. We had a warm welcome, nice treatment perfectly orchestrated by smiling and cheerful therapist.

I recommend this hotel for the spa but not for a specific occasion celebration.",3,2015,07,27
121,"Fabulous Service, Decent Location, Needs a Facelift","I have been staying at the Taj St. James on business for nearly 2 weeks.  I moved to the hotel from the Radisson Blu Edwardian Kenilsworth to be closer to the team I am working with.

Taj is a luxury hotel and this is primarily felt through superior service.  Everyone smiles, says hello, and makes eye contact.  The staff are eager to help and make one's stay comfortable.

The rooms are luxurious and are competitively sized with other Central London hotels.  The rooms will easily handle a couple; however, one shouldn't plan to have their family stay in a single room.  I stayed in two different rooms - the 4th floor and the 7th floor.  The fourth floor room was a tad bigger and better arranged.  The 7th room floor was definitely more cramped, particularly the narrow space between the dresser and the foot of the bed.  If one is drunk, clumsy or large, the narrow passage between the dresser and the bed could pose challenges.  Otherwise, the decor is modern, complete with luxury bedding and cushy robes.  The bathroom is also has modern decor with a single sink.  There is ample room to spread out toiletries.  Water pressure was strong in my 4th floor room and barely adequate in the 7th floor room.

The hotel restaurants cater to a variety of tastes - European, Arabic and especially Indian.  Taj is an Indian hotel chain, so all of their restaurants serve some India menus.  If one is of Indian descent, or really enjoy Indian food, then the Taj restaurants will certainly cater to one's tastes.

Quilon is a southwest Indian inspired restaurant.  The food, ambiance and service is top-notch - the food is tasty, unique and well presented.  Indeed, Quilon has earned a Michelin Star.  We also tried Bistro 51, which is adequate. The food was well prepared, but unexceptional and service was a bit slow.   If the weather is nice, the St. James Courtyard is an enjoyable place to spend a meal.  The Courtyard has an eclectic menu, with European, Arabic and Indian menu items.  The food was solid and the ambiance can be pleasant if the weather cooperates.  

The Taj is convenient to Buckingham Palace, the Victoria Train Station, Westminster Abbey, Parliament and Big Ben.  The hotel sits on Buckingham Gate street and is only several hundred meters away from Buckingham Palace and the adjoining St. James Park.  Victoria Station is about a kilometer away - great if one is heading out to Gatwick.  Westminster Abbey and Parliament are about a 5 to 10 minute walk.  The St. James Park tube station is about one block away - where one can catch the Circle Line.  Victoria and Westminster (Parliament area) also have tube stations that serve different lines.

The dining and shopping selection in the vicinity of the Taj are rather limited - there are a number of chain restaurants (e.g., Nandos, Wegamama, Zizzi, All Bar One, etc.) in a nearby shopping mall; however, there are few good local unique restaurants.  There are also a number of fast food places - Pret A Manger, Leon, Eat, Itsu, Wasabi - in the area; however, they are not open very late.  Similarly, the shopping in the area is primarily timed with offices, so the stores tend to shut down by around 6, and is limited to a House of Frasier and a smaller Marks and Spencer.  If one wants late evening quick casual, dining (e.g., past 8 PM), one should head to Victoria station. There is a Waitrose Express, which is a short walk from the hotel, that is open until 10 PM, so it is easy to stock up on water, soda and snacks.

As I mentioned earlier, Taj is a luxury hotel.  The St. James Court would compete with the likes of Hyatt, Conrad / Waldorf Astoria (Hilton), Ritz Carlton / Renaissance (Marriott), Four Season etc.  From a service perspective, they are certainly competitive with the best of the hotels.  From a facilities perspective, the hotel should consider a facelift.  The lobby seems a little stale and there are signs of wear in some common areas.",4,2015,07,27
121,Wedding stay,"Amazing service, my husband and I had an amazing day.  We had our wedding reception at the hotel.  The service was fantastic.  The chef's paid particular attention to our requirements and they over exceeded our expectations.",5,2015,07,27
121,Beautiful Experience,"At the conclusion of a 5 week holiday around U.K. it was indeed a pleasant experience to have my last stay at St James Court. Treated with utmost respect by doormen and concierge  who could not have been more accommodating on arrival. Reception staff most polite and informative with offering alternatives to setting up any extra spending accounts.  When  entering my room i was enthralled at what i saw. Very roomy+++, very tastefully decorated, clean and well stocked with coffee making facilities, fridge stock and bathroom toiletries which was refreshed and restocked daily by very pleasant staff. Following my very  full day of shopping and sightseeing i thoroughly enjoyed a soak in the deep full sized bath and to relax in the  quietness of this room in a very busy London. The shower in the morning was the best of the many i had on my long trek vacation. Location was within a good walking distance to most of the sights i wished to see., and the hop on hop off bus close by saw me to those further away.  My only 2 frustrations were 1) my room was a fair hike from the elevator , but in such a large hotel i guess someone has to be toward the back of the building, 2)following successful initial logging onto wifi , my numerous following attempts were futile, however when seeking an explanation from reception staff they assisted me and  gladly explained alternative way to log on explaining that different devices respond differently . (Understandable) I did not have my meals at the hotel due to former experience of cost of hotel dining but found several alternatives close by , ranging from cafes, pubs, and mini supermarkets where i often obtained a wholesome salad, fruit, sweet and wine supply. Oh that reminds me of a negative. My room was not stocked with a wine glass so i had to use an ordinary one. I loved  staying here.",5,2015,07,26
121,A fantastic gem in the heart of the city.,"We have stayed in this hotel many times now and I have to say we can't fault it in any way, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the food is excellent and good value for money. The location is just perfect a short walk to Buckingham palace and if you would like to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city St James park is an ideal place to relax and take in beautiful gardens and wildlife. Can't wait to return!",5,2015,07,26
121,Luxury in central location,"Excellent, luxurious and stylish hotel in a very classy building. Very attentive service and highly ranked restaurants. Central location on the doorstep of Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace and St. James Park. Ideal if you come in from Gatwick with the train to Victoria Station",4,2015,07,26
121,Very dispointed,"Old, dirty, small bed, small TV, dilapidated it is time to refurbish it, the shower are terrible, the bed and the mattress very bad… very dispointed for this price there are other places in London much better…",2,2015,07,26
121,Very very disappointed!,"This hotel is by far the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in. We have just returned for a 5* resort in Mexico & we arrived feeling tired and jet lagged. When we arrived our bags were not carried in like other guest and at check out we were served my a novice staff member who couldn't take our up front cash payment nor swipe a card for a £50 cash deposit. 
We were asked what we would be doing for the rest of the day and we replied saying ""we were tired after a lovely honeymoon in Mexico and would be sleeping before heading out for dinner later to tonight"" 
When we arrived at the room no lights worked, we called reception & we were told to put the swipe room card in a white box - there was NO box and when a staff member came up we were told it was an OLD room and showed us to the main switch! 
2 hrs later we were woken up by a staff member delivering a lovely desert which read ""Happy Anniversary"" Lovely gesture but you could at least get it right after waking us up after mentioning it was our honeymoon and secondly we wanted to sleep.
After arriving back from dinner at 12.00am we went to the bar to get a night cap but we're told it was shut and we would need to go to our room and order the room service. We went back to our room and like we had previously noticed the bar was open till 1.00am - we called reception to be told to come back down as it was open. We went downstairs and again we were told it was closed due to excessive noise from other guests they closed the bar early. After a brief conversation we were told they would make exceptions and we were lead into a back bar with no music or atmosphere and were charged room service rates. We honestly felt that we naughty children being shoved in the back room, we expressed our concerns to the night manager who did send up two complimentary red wines to our room (two drinks cost £20 and they didn't even know what a Vodka Martini was)
We were then woken up from 8am onwards by staff and loud guest outside our room which I have never experienced in any hotel across the world. 
After a day out we returned to find our Air Con was not working and again had another staff member in our room at 1am trying to sort it out. We have given up but can be rest assured we will NEVER return again. 

 ",1,2015,07,25
121,Ok - needs a facelift,"I visited here on business and everything was ok - I'm not complaining about the stay, the staff were great, the ambience was great! It just seemed alittle tired! The bathroom in my room needed a major revamp. The tiled flooring was beautiful but the tiles around the bath all needed either cleaning throughly or replacing. The shower could have done with being replaced. The beds are comfortable and my stay was fine. But I just didn't think 'wow- I must stay here again' I did feel it was a lot of money for a room that was just simply 'average.'",3,2015,07,25
121,Pretentious,"This is quite a grand hotel in the midst of office buildings and businesses. The location was very cool with The Underground nearby. Our room and bathroom appeared to be clean with many upscale amenities and rare, neat touches - towel warmer, light and A/C switches embedded into the night stand, etc.

Looking back, you're sort of in awe approaching the property and entering the lobby. That ""awe"" slowly fizzled out to the next morning when I was sitting on the end of our bed putting my shoes on. 

The TV selection was not good, nor was the WiFi. It you want better of either you must pay extra. The TV channels were mostly many different international offerings catering to international business travelers. When you logon to the WiFi you select ""Standard"" (slow) or High-Speed ($$$$). The breakfast buffet was nearly $40pp American, which we gladly avoided.

We found a decent rate on Booking.com and stayed the last two nights of our trip. The first morning I was sitting on the end of the bed putting on my shoes where the coffee/tea selections and hotpot were. There was a long, old coffee drip on the cabinet below. It didn't affect me but spoke volumes about the care of the rooms.

We then went out to the elevator and while waiting for it to arrive we noticed a large, framed restaurant advert positioned on an easel in the elevator lobby. It was completely covered in dust. It also didn't directly affect us but, again, spoke of quality.

In the evening I stopped by the desk to ask about any Indian restaurants nearby and the clerk actually got annoyed with me because I couldn't understand the name she was saying in what was for me a strong accent.

Most people we very nice but this place tries to come off as extravagant. Once you peel back the layers you realize its just a facade.

This hotel gets 3 out of 5 because it just barely served its purpose. A room which appeared to be clean where we could lay our heads down and rest. Unless you're affluent, or an affluent business traveler who wants to 'appear' to be staying at a top-notch property I would avoid this place as you'll surely feel out of place. Plus, too many signs of bad management which fail to keep up with its price tag.",3,2015,07,25
121,St James Palace Hotel,Excellent in ALL respects. Had not stayed in this hotel previously  so we took a gamble. From reception onwards; to room quality:service and departure experience everything was perfect. We would definitely stay in this hotel again.,5,2015,07,25
121,St James Court,"Excellent, central hotel, just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.    Fairly expensive, but the service was excellent from all the staff.     Excellent breakfast was included as special deal to guests who booked by calling the hotel directly -- well worth it.",5,2015,07,24
121,Beautiful hotel in need of modification ,"Yes the piano player in the lobby and the tophat and tails loitering on the pavement are quintessential and impressive. Having lobster thermadore on an in room menu is not seen often either. From the second you walk in it's a not so subtle sales pitch? Do you want an overly priced breakfast? Do you want a newspaper? After walking through the dates corridors of a sour mint green with carpets as old as the hotel I arrive to my rooms which are nice but with an adjoining door (single female business traveller). The room is sprawled with baskets of treats and wines to add to your bill and so far removed from having a green policy there are almanacs of paper on every which way service or tourist attraction or FAQ. For somewhere so lavish you would expect integrated iPads or at least modern day TV guide landing page, rather than shower curtains and corded phones. Wouldn't stay again.",4,2015,07,23
121,Great hotel.....with the slightest of issues.,"Wow this hotel is great. It's got wonderful atmosphere, wonderful people and just all around presents the feeling of fancy. Everyone says hi to you as you walk by and everyone makes eye contact and is attentive. The customer service is great and the room (as seen in the picture) without all the fancy films or lighting tricks looks perfect. It is a great place to stay while visiting and totally makes up for the quite depressing hotels I've stayed at in the UK so far. 

Now; those few cons I talked about. One of which is the shower. The shower, although looking fancy, is a fallacy. (The glass, shown in the pictures) doesn't go all the way across the shower leaving an open spot for water to leave, this is okay....if the shower head would have worked. The shower head instead couldn't stay mounted in the correct position and because of this (as seen in pictures) sprayed to far, or sprayed to low. It couldn't sit anywhere in the middle....now if you were able to get the shower head to sit right, water would still leak out of the glass below leaving water on the floor so STAYERS BEWARE don't leave things on the ground whilst showering. And second, (yes that was all problem one), the bar and restaurants are VERY EXPENSIVE if you want a beer go to the shop next door. I paid 5.50 pounds or $8.60 for a small beer. Way to expensive. 

To finish, great hotel the best I've stayed at so far on my trip to england.",4,2015,07,22
121,Fancy pants treat,"Wonderful hotel, great service and perfect location for all the tourist hotspots. Very much the classic, well to-do service, although potentially a little cold at times. One bellboy was whole other level of polite and really made us feel at home. Stayed for Valentine's Day and would happily stay again!",4,2015,07,22
121,Exceptional Service at St James Court,"Back in April of this year roughly 14-16th April I had the chance to stay at the St James' Court, A Taj Hotel. I can honestly say that this hotel is remarkable in every way. The service received by all staff across the hotel was impeccable and could not be faulted.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I hope I have the opportunity to stay here again in the future.",5,2015,07,22
121,July visit to St James Court,"A very efficient and friendly hotel. Well appointed room and excellent built in breakfast.  Close to Buckingham Palace and within easy walking distance of main shopping area. All staff were a pleasure to speak to and were most helpful 
      
      ",5,2015,07,21
121,Elegance personified,"This property is now my fave in London. I have stayed at a lot of hotels but this property tops them all. 

The staff is courteous and accommodating without being cloying. The room was spacious and clean. Every little thing you could need was available.

The best part is the location. The property is conveniently located to everything you could possibly want to do in London. We were able to experience the best of London away from the hustle and bustle. The hotel was the perfect oasis after a long day exploring. 

If you are looking for the perfect getaway, look no further.",5,2015,07,21
121,Elegant and friendly with a couple of niggles,"I am a fan of Taj Hotels. I have found that the staff are efficient, friendly and (and this is where Taj Hotels beat other hotel chains) seem to want you to enjoy your stay at the hotel.

This was our first stay at this hotel (or any Taj in the UK). We were in London for a short (three night) break.

The hotel is really well located. It’s a short walk from St James Park tube station and close to Victoria St for busses. It’s walking distance to Victoria station, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.

The hotel building is an old (1902) building with a superb courtyard.  This has implications. The corridors can be a little maze-like and (I suspect that) the bedrooms are of differing shapes and sizes. This brings me to the major problem I had with the hotel.

The room we stayed in (room 371) was large for London, nicely furnished, recently decorated, had a/c that was unobtrusive, and a comfortable bed. It had a nice bathroom and was clean. However it overlooked a school playground and some nearby building work. Neither of these would be a problem other than the absence of double glazing / soundproofing. It is not really acceptable to have a hotel bedroom in a hotel of this class without double glazing albeit secondary. Had we realised initially, we would have requested another room. As it was we couldn’t be bothered once we’d unpacked etc. Oh, and the District Line Underground trains rumble nearby too but that’s kind of comforting.

We ate in the hotel a few times. The food is excellent but go somewhere else for afternoon tea. The courtyard is nice for a drink and a light meal in the summer evenings and we had a really nice meal at Bank. 

So would I recommend the hotel? Would I return? Apart from the noise in room 371 and the afternoon tea, I would. The hotel is a Taj and has the staff that give it the edge over competitive offerings. If you want a new hotel with lots of glass and steel, straight lines and gadgets, then look somewhere else. If you want an efficient but friendly, elegant place to relax, I’d recommend this place.",4,2015,07,21
121,"Excellent stay at St James Court, A Taj Hotel","I stayed at the St James Court last month for about 10 days.

This is truly a Taj Hotel which provides world class Service/Hospitality, had a wonderful stay.

The service throughout the trip was consistently great & a very high standard is maintained.

Right from Front Office, to dining to concierge, all of them are very consistent with the spirit of the Taj Hotels.

Would like to say a big 'Thank You' to the following people at the hotel for their wonderful hospitality.

Mr Digvijay Singh - Like they say culture flows from the Top & Mr Singh truly personifies outstanding Service. Very warm person & welcomes you very well.

Mr Naveen Sikka - Front of House Manager works overtime to ensure every guest is well taken care of . He is simply amazing & just wears a great attitude to ensure that all guests have a wonderful experience at the Hotel.

Mr Anubhav Rana - Works at the Reception & makes a very deep impact with his very warm & welcoming attitude. Went the extra mile to deliver delightful experience for me.

Thanks so much to all of you for making my stay a memorable one !

Needless to mention that St. James Court is now my favourite Hotel in London.",5,2015,07,21
121,St James Court Hotel,Excellent Hotel I stayed here for one night while visiting London with my husband. Loved the Hotel got a great deal and it was more than worth the price. I stay in London often and this is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed in. Great location. a stay is a must,5,2015,07,20
121,Lovely,"Stayed overnight here before my daughters graduation. Lovely hotel full of old world charm. Very attentive staff right from the word go. Commissionaire helped us out of taxi and would whistle for a taxi if you requested.
Great location , really close to Buck House , St James's park , Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament , Big Ben etc etc.
Beautiful lobby and spacious , spotless rooms. Had room service breakfast as we had an early start and this was delivered right on time in a hot box attached to folded table all decked out and laid for you , quite a novelty but  a really nice touch.
Kept our luggage after check out with no problem.
Wish we could have stayed longer. Will definitely consider next time we are in London",4,2015,07,20
121,Lovely stay!,"I chose this hotel for a weekend with a friend. We wanted a base so we could go shopping, eating and drinking in the evening and an afternoon tea, so this location was good for us to get around easily. Victoria and St James' stations are both about 5-10 min walk away. 

The reception staff were fantastic and offered us coffee on arrival, and as requested when I booked, they had converted our room from a double to a twin. The room was beautifully decorated, spotless and very spacious with lovely furnishings, powerful shower and super comfy beds.

I cannot comment on the dining here as we ate out, however I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for exploring London either as a couple or with friends.",5,2015,07,20
121,It's the small details...,"Just returned from a 2 night Weekend stay with my wife and cannot fault the hotel in any way.
Location - 5-10 min walk from Victoria station and once you're at the hotel, as you leave and turn left, Buckingham palace 'front door' is literally 5 mins walk. Great sightseeing if you so wish.
Hotel staff - very friendly and efficient. Front desk were polite and helpful pros as were the concierge staff.
Hotel and room - as I said in the title, the small details. Beautiful reception area and bar leading to courtyard. The walkways to rooms etc were very pleasant and plenty of flowers and excellent pictures from London history.
Our room (Exec Double) on floor 5 was extremely comfortable. Although we spent little time in our room we could appreciate the details. Nice fixtures and fittings and bathroom was excellent. Modern and ultra clean. It was the fittings that I noticed most, no cheap shortcuts with anything. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed we've ever stayed in.
Didn't use any restaurant or spa facilities but all in all, a very enjoyable stay and absolutely would stay there again. Bravo Taj!",5,2015,07,20
121,Pleasantly surprised,"Booked this mainly due to a favourable price for the size of the room, especially for its location. When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded and the room was massive with kitchen, living area and the most stunning bathroom with his/her sink and toilets and a seperate bath from the shower with a tv. The bed was also massive and comfortable. The concierge recommended us to the most amazing restaurant (coya on Mayfair) and also went to the length of ensuring our travel plans were ok due to the Eurotunnel strikes. The hotel is situated a 5 minute walk from the tube and other major sites. ",5,2015,07,20
121,"Recent stay at St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London","Overall stay at this hotel was very good. Travel to and from the hotel was very easy, excellent location, very close to other attractions within walking distance of the hotel. Business and conferencing facilities were very good - event attended was well planned out and staffed appropriately. Very friendly staff and levels of service high.",4,2015,07,20
121,If it weren't for the breakfast.....,"This hotel is in a great location and for the hotel itself, I'd give it 5 stars.  For breakfast, you're better off going to one of the pubs nearby.  The breakfast area is small/cramped, very loud and the buffet is not all that good.  Most of the hot items are dry, the scrambled eggs seem to be of the reconstituted variety.  I will say that the wait staff are very nice.

For the hotel, very nice.  Front desk is great, bar staff are great.  Except for being at the back where construction on the building behind the hotel was going on starting at before 6am, it was a pleasant stay.",4,2015,07,20
121,Not the taj I know ," 
1. This morning the water pours out of the ceiling
2. When I return back, while the ceiling was fixed, the room smelt bad!
3. Rather than an apology letter, I was asked to contact reception for my room balance! Really!!

Very disappointed!! Have stayed in many taj hotels and they are known for exceptional customer service. I understand problems can happen, I guess it's how they are handled make the difference!

",1,2015,07,19
121,Service and quality,"From the time we arrived, two hours before we could check in, all of the staff were helpful and friendly. The service throughout the hotel was excellent. The location was great, but the atmosphere in the courtyard bar area made us feel like we could have been anywhere on holiday. Overall I could not fault the hotel.",5,2015,07,19
121,lovely stay,"We booked the hotel through a website for a 2 night stay. I e mailed the hotel before we travelled to check our booking and they replied immediately. On arrival the desk staff were very friendly yet efficient , as was the concierge. Our room was pleasant, comfortable , clean and quiet.. We made use of the ice machine in the corridor( a nice touch during a hot spell of weather) to cool our drinks as we did find the room quite hot.  Our deal included breakfast which was varied and plentiful. The location of the hotel was ideal and within walking distance of many attractions. We would definitely revisit for another stay .",5,2015,07,19
121,Taj the best always,"Taj is one of the best hotels I have ever lived and they are impeccable when it comes to hospitality and service,   We need more Taj hotels in Europe especially in Ireland and other UK cities.   BTW forcing 200 character typing is little too much :)",4,2015,07,19
121,Stay at St James Park,We enjoyed the stay at St. James Park Taj Hotels property it was nice and overall experience was good. It is located very much centrally one side is Buckingham Palace other side is Victoria Station and the other side is Big Ben. The Staff was very much co operative and tried to make the stay comfortable at all point.,3,2015,07,18
121,London Luxury,"The hotel was great!  We arrived from LHR at 0900 hrs and we we're just looking to check our luggage.  However, while at the desk the desk clerk advised that we could check in immediately as a room just became available.  It was great to be able to take a shower and change clothes before heading out for a day of sightseeing.  The room was neat and clean and appropriately appointed!  The breakfast meal that was included with the room was fabulous and I would highly recommend it before heading out in the morning.  The hotel staff were great and very helpful througout all aspects of our stay.  The hotel is within walking distance of Buckingham Palace and most major sightseeing attractions.  I definitely recommend a stay at the St. James' Court, you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,07,18
121,construction site spoiled a comfortable hotel,"This is a large and established hotel, formerly one of the Crowne Plaza chain and now in the Taj chain. It is comfortable and well located, but on our stay the construction site outside marred any pleasure we might have had to stay in the room.",4,2015,07,18
121,Hotel Review,"very good hotel and location is very good. though there was little choice on north indian food we enjoyed the south indian food also. breakfast was very good. Bar is good but it can be more happening if events are going on. 

nearest tube station is st james park. hence very easy to approach . 

overall it is a good hotel.",4,2015,07,17
121,"Feel The Service, Fabulous Restaurant, Excellent Location","Extremely welcoming team, always at hand to assist with your needs and beyond, food and service in teh restaurants are one of teh best I have experienced. Perfect location for a holiday. Big rooms and restrooms with all amenities provided. televisions could be improved",5,2015,07,17
121,A nice hotel with not too bad location,"We were there for new year fireworks. The room was a good size and clean, big restroom and comfy bed. Doorman was really nice, acknowledge every person walked bass him. Hotel is not too far from Victoria station, which was good for traveller. However, front desk wasn't friendly made us not bothered to ask for some information of London.",4,2015,07,16
121,"Classy hotel, great staff, great bar","Stayed already two times in this hotel. It was nice coming back. The staff is very welcoming, it has a great concierge service too. The hotel lobby bar has live piano music and the bar next door served the best gin sour cocktail I've ever tasted. Nice rooms, although some of them could get a bit noisy due to a school behind the hotel. Superb location to visit London as it's located in the heart of Westminster, 5 mins walk from Buckingham Palace, 10 minutes from Westminster Abbey.",4,2015,07,16
121,"5 star service, 3 star hotel","The rooms at the Taj hotel were disappointingly old and tired looking. However, the service was consistently excellent.  At check-in, the woman I dealt with was very friendly and gave me her name in case I needed anything. At the bar, our waiter was very friendly. The concierge was very helpful in navigating the tube and finding our way back to Heathrow. 

My room smelt faintly of smoke. It was annoying but not bad enough for me to say anything. The walls were marked and beaten up, the bench was stained...I would definitely not consider my room 4 stars. However, it was kept clean (discounting scuffs etc on the walls) and quiet.

Depending on pricing, I would consider staying here again. ",4,2015,07,16
121,Living the dream....,"Gorgeous, opulent hotel....stunning from stepping through the doors into the magnificent reception.  Staff were charming and helpful, had a lovely upgraded room, no view but it is London and space is a premium. Didn't eat at the hotel - too much to fit in to a weekend break but enjoyed staying there.....just check your bill as I had several added items on mine which weren't supposed to be there!!",5,2015,07,16
121,Great Location & Service,"Very good central location with short walks to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station & Westminster.
Room on Level 2 courtyard - very nice room, clean & spacious.
Wifi in room was poor & TV played up a few times. TV resolved quickly by staff each time.
Staff were very good and helpful.
Breakfast was fair - plain and no variation.",4,2015,07,16
121,Very disappointing,"does not justify neither names - from St. James' and/or Taj's I would have expected for much more. for the prices they charge I would have expected a lot more. rooms are tiny, some renovated. Free wifi is insufficient unless you pay extra. peripheral services (like late check out, breakfast, bar etc.) are expensive.",3,2015,07,16
121,wonderful stay,"First impression was wonderful. Met from the taxi and case taken to my room. The receptionists are polite and helpful. Decor amazing. My room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The meal at the function was beautifully presented and very edible.
The Spa/fitness suite was very welcoming and I partook of the steam room and sauna which are complementary.
Location of the hotel is very central for all attractions.
Courtyard is a dream and a calm oasis to relax.",5,2015,07,16
121,Nice hotel but expensive ,"We stayed at St James court for 3 nights. It is centrally located very near to Buckingham palace west minister abbey and London eye and Thames cruises a short walk away. Nearest tube station is st James which must be few yards from hotel.
Service was excellent. Concierge was v helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Wifi worked well. All the staff were pleasant and professional. Although room was not very spacious everything was arranged in perfect way to utilize maximum space. 
They have a South Indian restaurant called Quilon we found the food very tasty but expensive again.
Hotel made a mistake in our billing but rectified it with apologies when we pointed it out.

Overall a very pleasant stay but it falls under expensive category but most good hotels in London do so!

 

",4,2015,07,15
121,"Nice hotel, but disapointed.","I had got a very good deal for the hotel for two nights in July and when given a room on the top attic floor I was not surprised. However I was disappointed on two counts:

Firstly the corridor from lift to the room had a very unpleasant odour. I mentioned this at reception on the first day and the response was an air freshener spray application, but the smell returned and the cause was not fixed.

Secondly the wash hand basin in the bathroom was completely plugged with water only draining away after a matter on more than an hour. I again reported this at reception twice and once to the room maid. It was never fixed during our stay .... this was very poor.

I will think twice about booking the St. James again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,2015,07,14
121,Great Pick!!!,"We went to London for the first time last week and picked this hotel based on reviews and recommendation by European Destination, and boy were we glad we did.  We upgraded to the executive suite which was a large room, large bathroom with a King Bed.  The location being in Westminster, specifically St James Park was great.  When we were out sight seeing and was asked by someone from London where we were staying, they all responded on what a great location!!  Within walking distance to many historic sites and the tube.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.",5,2015,07,13
121,Luxurious,"This hotel had an amazing location as it was 3 minutes walking from Buckingham Palace. Not only that but it also had amazing restaurants within the hotel with a great bar and hotel staff. The rooms are small as many european hotels tend to be. However, the rooms are nice, clean, and very relaxing to come too. The bathrooms were nice and cleanly as well.",4,2015,07,13
121,Ideal location,"Just an overnight in late June for my first trip to London (yes, not long enough and I will be back!).  Four ladies travelling and arrived around 11 a.m. Initially only one of the rooms were ready but the front desk was able to pull a miracle, found a second room just next door to the first.  Well done!!  A delightful hotel, beautiful lobby and a hidden gem, the gift shop. Room size was more than adequate, amenities exceptional and wonderful a/c in the room. Housekeeping had failed to leave bath towels and a phone call had them to the room in less than 10 minutes.  Big, fluffy towels!  A pleasant, cordial staff and comfortable beds/pillows made for a wonderful stay.  A great hotel with an ideal location for a tourist, highly recommend.",5,2015,07,13
121,Great location,"Stayed here for one night to attend an opera at the Coliseum. Very efficient and friendly check in. Got lucky and was given a refurbished room overlooking courtyard. Lovely decor! Easy walk from Victoria and 2 stops from StJames to embankment for theatre made the evening nice and easy.
Post theatre cocktail in the bar was very nice too and service was good.
Nice toiletries and plenty of tea/coffee, dressing gowns and slippers and complimentary paper in the morning. 
Good value with an ebooker  deal.",4,2015,07,13
121,"Nice Location, but needs updating","I was on a business trip for work in London and this was my first time staying at this hotel.  The hotel lobby, exterior and restaurant created a warm and inviting experience.  The location is also good as close to tube stops and major train locations.  Room was adequate, but in need of updating and also hallways were extremely dated and uninviting.",3,2015,07,13
121,Top Quality Hotel... truly TAJ!!,Excellent hotel location and services. Very cooperative and pleasing staff. Very helpful and knowledgeable and quick to resolving issues. My experience of managing the maiden investment conference at the hotel was extremely pleasurable.,5,2015,07,13
121,wonderful,this hotel was simply wonderful the staff were curtious and friendly the room was beautiful with a lovely view of the court yard the location was superb  there is nothing i would have changed about this hotel,5,2015,07,13
121,"Exceptional Hotel, great Location and Service!!! 5 Star Quality!!!","A great hotel, great Service, and great location. Will definitely recommend to anyone and will stay again in the future.

High quality breakfast included in the price with fresh squeezed orange juice, omelets etc. We enjoyed the stay very much.",5,2015,07,13
121,Great spot,"We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and when we first arrived we were very impressed by the building and the reception. The staff were all really welcoming and helpful, the hotel is lovely and less than 5 minutes walk from St James Park tube station.. the building itself is really old and some of the interior in the rooms are too from when it used to be the Crowne Plaza but everything the Taj are trying to do is to make it look amazing. Would definitely stay here again and it is only a walk away from Buckingham Palace!",4,2015,07,13
121,Luxury and great service,"Just returned from a weekend stay and can thoroughly recommend this hotel.

The staff were so incredibly attentive, friendly, welcoming and helpful......the courtyard was beautiful to sit and relax in with a drink.  Beds very comfortable and all in all would love to go back.

Thank you to all the staff for making us feel so special.",5,2015,07,12
121,5 star !!!,"Taj St James is a very good hotel. Centrally located. Highly recommended for families.. Rooms are not very big but thats London. Breakfast was good. Most important, the Front desk was very helpful. Ms NOAH, was very professional and curteous. She was kind and polite. Overall, my experience was 5 stars (though it is a 4 star hotel). Great room amenities. I stayed alone for 3 nights from 8-11th july and i will return with my family at the end of this month again!! Once at Taj, Always at Taj !! Welldone !!!",5,2015,07,12
121,Old world charm at a cost ,"This hotel has an old world charm nestled in a good location and offers excellent service. However when we moved in the room, we were disturbed early in the morning by the basket ball taps in the adjoining school. It was extremely noisy. When we requested a room change, they did that immediately . My suggestion is if you would want to catch up with your sleep until 8 every morning, please get a room which is on the other side of the school. 
Breakfast was great, very suitable to the Indian palette . It does seem a favourite with Indians for sure ",4,2015,07,12
121,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff","Stayed in the A Taj while on business trip. The hotel looks, is decorated tastefully, rooms are large and clean. I had to be in the neighbourhood, but if you would need to be in the city location is perhaps a bit out of the way. Although the nearest tube station is only 5 minutes walking. Would visit again.",4,2015,07,12
121,Close to the palace,"Very nice two night stay. Room was by Londons standards a nice size but still not what you would call spacious, It was plenty big enough for our needs though. No view from our first floor window. Had all the usual complimentary toiletries, dressing gowns and throw away slippers. Bed was comfortable and air conditioning worked well. Staff were excellent, always ready and willing to help and answer any queries. Breakfast was good and set us up for the day. Location was great, only a short stroll to Buckingham Palace. Only negative would be the cost of room, but that's London for you.",4,2015,07,11
121,"Great service, rooms a bit outdated.","This was one of the cheaper hotels I found in London for this weekend and on looking at the photos I thought it was stunning and in a great location in comparison to the price. 

The hotel itself is in a quiet area but surrounded by everything you need - there's St. James Underground just round the corner, a number of shops including House Of Fraser and Boots and a selection of restaurants and pubs.

Upon arrival, the receptionist, Charlotte, was very welcoming and helpful. 
We requested a top floor room when booking which we received - 6th floor. 
The lobby is exquisite, the staff were all extremely helpful and the restaurants looked modern and fantastic quality. 
 
The room was slightly outdated, not like the pictures shown on the website so I can only assume they were the most expensive rooms being showcased. 
We did have an issue with the TV - it was very temperamental and worked sometimes then nothing other times. 
The view wasn't too cracky either as there are building works going on outside, but that can't be helped! 

On the first morning we ordered room service for breakfast - Continental Breakfast;- 1x mini croissant, 1x mini Danish pastry, 1x brown toast, 1x white toast, 1x bread roll, 1x cereal of your choice and 1x hot/cold drink of your choice and a variety or condiments - £20.50. 
It was brought up to us within a reasonable time and the staff were extremely pleasant. They came and collected our tray once finished. 

On the second night we didn't return to our  room until midnight as we'd been to a concert, so we ordered room service again - Steak Baguette and Burger, it arrived within 20 minutes and both came with chips and condiments. 

Once again, we had room service for breakfast the next morning and it was equally as pleasant. 
All the room service is a tad pricey but it's better than going without and the food was lovely. 

Our room was serviced whilst we were there too, which meant everything was spotless. 

We did the express checkout so just dropped our keys in a box and left - checkout at 12 midday. 

We didn't eat in any of the restaurants, but looking at the menus, they look great too!

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, but I prefer a more modern style myself. 
Staff were fantastic.

121,A hotel that has slipped away,"There was nothing good about this hotel except the bell staff. For an expensive hotel ( I expected to pay for a great hotel) it was a terrible experience. Service staff acted like they were in a hotel training school and failing. McDonalds would have had better f&b service as well as food.. What a shame that a once proud lady has fallen so far. If all the other hotels are full in town, go to a difference town before you stay here!",2,2015,07,11
121,Central London Location,This is an excellent hotel which has been considerably upgraded since it became a Taj Hotel previously Crown Plaza.  Convenient to Buckingham Palace and Westminster. Great central outdoor area.  Staff very friendly and helpful,5,2015,07,10
121,Tired - in need of some TLC,"The main lobby area looked great but once on the guest level both the hallways and the room itself looked tired and in need of refreshing - e.g. the furniture was shabby, the walls in the corridors were badly marked and some of the woodwork was damaged (lift frames).  I'm not sure if my room was above the kitchen/dining area but the room had a smell of curry in it, which was slightly off-putting.  The drainage when taking a shower was also poor.  The room was very small for the price paid - fine for one night as a single business traveller but I wouldn't want to stay in it for much longer than a couple of nights especially if there was two people.  As I only stayed one night I did not have much contact with employees but the check-in and check-out process was quick, efficient and friendly.",3,2015,07,10
121,Great hotel,"We stayed here for a few nights in June. Really well run, the staff (especially at breakfast) were all very polite and attentive. Breakfast was amazing but pricey, it wasn't included in our deal and it cost £20 each. The room was big for London standard and the hotel was in a great location, around the corner from Buckingham palace. The courtyard out the back was a lovely place for drinks in the summer! ",4,2015,07,10
121,A nice hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights at at James court this month and found the experience pleasant. 

After request, they have us a quieter room on 1st day itself and it suited us perfectly. 

The location of the hotel is very close to the tube and some of the attractions - the staff is always smiling and helpful - Charlotte at front desk and Patricia at breakfast deserve a specific mention - the concierge and porters are also helpful and courteous. 

The breakfast had the Indian touch (which we liked) and we got masala tea and some Indian items every day - which was excellent. 

Would recommend - but do ask for the quieter rooms ",4,2015,07,10
121,short stay summer,Room was surprisingly large for London hotel. Very comfortable beds and great hot shower. Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Lovely courtyard bar and lounge. Very close to tube line and walking distantce (less 5 min for a slow walker) from Buckingham palace.,5,2015,07,09
121,nice hotel in great location.,picked this hotel as had a good deal on booking.com - and was in a good location for business..  checkin pleasant - took a while to find the room through corridors. again pleasant - bathroom needed a mild refresh .. sleep was great . quiet room.. breakfast was okay - food was average for hotels in London.. would stay again.. big choice of bars/ restaurant - the bar was not part of the hotel though.. so charging to room was more complex than normal..,5,2015,07,09
121,Great hotel in an ideal location,"I stayed for a week on a business trip and also enjoyed some sightseeing with my daughter. The hotel is ideally located, close to Victoria and St. James' Park tube stations in a quiet side street. It's a gorgeous big old Victorian building and provides the service you'd expect in such a setting. The old world charm that the staff offers is refreshing in today's busy world. The room was big for London standards, well appointed, clean and calm facing the inside courtyard. I especially liked the well working and silent A/C system plus the great lighting in the room and bathroom. A bigger TV set would be a nice asset, but it wasn't a problem. The TV channel choices are very broad and cover all geographies - very nice. The elevator capacity is a bit limited with only two. Overall, I can recommend this hotel and would certainly stay again there.",5,2015,07,09
121,Excellent location,"Fabulous location. I had very short time in hand, but was able to move around in a small distance to reach out to most of the ""must see"" places. Bucingham Palace, Its palace stores, Westminister, London eye, Aquarium, Thames river cruize....the list goes on and on for things that I managed to cover, thanks to the hotel location. the wifi works well. the staff very hospitable.",4,2015,07,08
121,Great Hotel and Excellent Location,"St. James Court Hotel is one of the best hotels I stayed in London, the staff is really helpful and its just a minute walk from the St. James tube station and 7min walk from Victoria Station. Lots of tourist places around and good for shopping. Also some really good food joints nearby as well, Pimlico Fresh on Wilton Road is a must go.",5,2015,07,08
121,"Perfect Hotel, perfect Location","Great hotel. Very clean. 
The entire staff is wonderful. We only tried one of the restaurant and the food was good. They have a nice buffet breakfast in the am that is included.  It's location is great for walking around and seeing the sites.  Short walk to Buckingham Palace and Westminister Abbey.  Big Ben and the London Eye are also within a 30 minute walking distance.",5,2015,07,06
121,Most Comfortable Place to Stay,It was a pleasing experience staying in The Taj Hotel. Truly impressed with the standards of service and friendly staff. Everything was perfect that made my stay the best ever. I would like to recommend everyone to once stay in this hotel.,5,2015,07,06
121,Good but not quite there yet....,"We were visiting London for my girlfriends birthday and after a bit of searching I came across this hotel. All the pictures made it look good so I thought why not. My summary is this, nice location, a stones throw from Buckingham Palace. The rooms....well all I'm saying is stay on the top level as the rooms are much much better than those lower down. The staff are friendly and helpful. The cons....I didn't get my paper in the morning and having seem a room on the 2ND floor I would not stay in one of those. ",3,2015,07,06
121,Great service and staff,"Travelled with my daughter (age 12) as a birthday treat - first impression - very impressive reception area and staff excellent. As arrived late had a meal in hotel .. which was in line with what would be expected with a hotel of this rating.
Breakfast was included in room rate and was standard fare , the waiters were very helpful and advise you that should you like something that isn't on display then it is no problem for them to get it for you ie scrambled/poached eggs/Pancakes which are not on general view.

My disappointment with this hotel would be that allocated room 455 and this is dark room and requires the light on as is in the corner of the hotel and is over the courtyard as you can hear the noise from below  there is a corrugated structure right outside the window so no view and obviously obstructs light - and in the morning you can hear pigeons cooing?! so have a perch somewhere -  the room was clean although a little shabby in parts - 
Overall lovely hotel with great staff and easy to travel anywhere in the capital",4,2015,07,06
121,Topnotch and a garden court to match,"Love this hotel and have decided it is my favorite in all of London. Why? The rooms are lovely, the staff is helpful and most of all the garden court is pure heaven. The bathrooms are large. And I got a welcome back from the manager upon my second visit. How cool is that? You can walk to St. JamEs Park, Buckingham Palace and yes even Westminster Abbey. There is a fine Indian restaurant attached. I cannot praise this place too highly. And oh, did I forget to say, Bring money?",5,2015,07,05
121,"Excellent hotel, great location, breakfast to be improved","After 2 stays in this hotel, this is becoming one of my favorite address in London. The entrance and the garden are very pleasant, and the staff extremely professional. As in aTaj hotel, you also get some exotic feeling during your stay. Rooms are relatively large (for London standards) and well-designed and equipped. They are also quiet. 
The location is unusual but very convenient, 5 minutes from Buckingham Palace and St James Park, with St James Park tube station very close. 
The negative point is the breakfast: very cramped room, limited selection not changing from one day to another, and very noisy place. The staff did his best, but it was overall an unpleasant time of the day.",4,2015,07,05
121,Great location and very comfortable room,We were really pleased with our stay at the Taj - very close to St James station which is conveniently location on the central line. The room was big for London standards with a great bathroom.  The fitness centre was excellent!  It was a great stay.,5,2015,07,05
121,"""An Oasis""","We stumbled upon this hotel by chance. We needed a hotel near Westminster and in the past any London trips involved a Travel Lodge or a Premiere Inn, but in a search neither were local enough and didn't seem as reasonably priced as usual. In widening the search we found St.James' Court A Taj Hotel. What a find, an Indian based company with most of their hotels in India, all top class .
The St. James' was no different, from the doorman to the receptionists to the house keeping staff, all had the time to welcome you and say good morning when ever you past.
When we checked in we were offered an up grade to an ""Executive Room"" for a small charge, front of hotel with large bay window. They even changed the bed from a double to two singles, and offered complimentary drinks while we waited. The room had all you needed, safe, TV, WiFi,etc.etc. with complimentary sparkling water and chocolates. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and the room was cleaned to a very high standard. Breakfasts were very good even had a few Indian options (chickpea curry was very tasty). There is a beautiful courtyard an Oasis in the big city ideal for a chilled bottle of white on a warm summer evening!!
All in all a great hotel would recommend it to any one, we have just rebooked to come back in December for my Birthday can't wait!",5,2015,07,04
121,Reasonable stay and good location,"Early check-in was very good and although the room was not ready our bags were stored and delivered to our room prior to arrival.
When we arrived at our room late in the evening it was stifling hot and despite all of our efforts we could not make the air-con work. Although the wind opened the air-con units were outside and noisy - not a good night's sleep. I should add the rest of the room was OK. We raised our concerns at check-out the receptionist handled it well, but that was not going to restore a lost night's sleep.",3,2015,07,04
121,Quirky hotel in very nice area,"I have been staying here on and off for at least 15 years mostly for business- well before the Taj Group took it over. I came back here yesterday for a few nights with my wife.

This hotel is in a lovely area; convenient but relatively quiet.

The exterior of the hotel is a beautiful design.

The rooms are - and always have been - hit and miss. You have to be careful with what type of room you book.

We did have a disturbing experience checking in. We had booked a ""standard King"", and I asked if there were any complimentary upgrades. The person at the desk kindly spent a long time checking and concluded there were none and gave us what we had supposedly booked. Unfortunately it was not - it was a tiny Queen size room; that was not only not an upgrade but a downgrade. We went back downstairs and spoke to another person at the desk (the original one had left) - she gave us a King room. I am not sure whether it was one we had booked or a slightly better one. The point is we should not have have had to go through that after a 10 hour flight from the West coast of Canada. Did the first person intentionally do that or was it a mistake?

One more small but annoying thing. Our room is supposed to get a newspaper delivered (as specified on the booking). The first morning we did not get one. On calling the desk in the evening the next day to arrange one the next morning I was told we could only get The Independent. Any other paper, such as The Guardian, would be charged for. With these rates, does the hotel really need to do that?",3,2015,07,03
121,Great location - average hotel,"Rooms are a bit dated, bathroom is small, not everything works (e.g., ice machines).  Service and staff are pleasant.  Great location to the parks, trains, Victoria theatre.  Hotel is like a maze with winding hallways.  Spa facilities are above average with Sauna and Steam and good shower facilities.",3,2015,07,03
121,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location,"I chose this hotel because it was walking distance to the QEII conference center, and it turned out to be an amazing choice!  The building is clearly old, but it has been beautifully maintained or restored, and the decor is charming.  The staff is first-rate, especially the concierge desk.  The restaurants in the hotel are excellent.  My rate included breakfast and a complimentary bottle of champagne.  You can walk to Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben & Parliament, Whitehall, etc.  Perfect!",5,2015,07,03
121,"Another Great Stay, never disappoints","Have stayed here a few times and love this hotel.  The rooms are very large and well maintained.  The staff are very helpful and friendly and the location is very central.  
Thanks for another great stay.",5,2015,07,03
121,Very nice but some quirks,the bellmen are so very helpful.  Probably some of the best I have seen and we travel extensively.  Ice machines on floors 2-6 only but it is a secret that most of the staff does not know.  the thermostats are very hard to read but work well.,4,2015,07,02
121,The Place to stay in London,If you want to be pampered and well looked after then this is the hotel to stay in London. The hotel is in a prime location and the staff are there to look after you at all times and nothing is too much trouble.,5,2015,07,02
121,Wonderful Magnifique ,"One of the best hôtel in London, perfect location, the rooms are very big wich is unsual in the city. The manager Was very nice and tried his best to please us. The breakfast was more than perfect and the staff was very warm and professional.The concierge know perfectly his job and was also very caring. We had a great time and look forward to come back ",5,2015,07,01
121,Great location in London; wish we had chosen the Taj Suites next door....,"Beautiful building, great location (close to Buckingham Palace).  Rooms and hallways were in need of updates, rooms were generously sized and comfortable though.  Lobby was crowded and chaotic one day, and then was better the next.  The restaurant/bar off the lobby needs to control food odors better, too.",3,2015,07,01
121,Good location. good service,"The location for this hotel is great.. Just minutes away from Buckingham palace.
Also minutes away from Victoria station.
The service is also good.
The rooms are varied sizes although they are in the same category.
The concierge was helpful in suggesting modes if transport and places to dine.",4,2015,07,01
121,Great location/Value,"Close to Victoria for trains and easy access to west end etc Some hotels like the Cape Grace in Cape Town and St James's Court are just simply great at being a simple hotel  (rather than spa, resort etc). I got a great rate, and will try again to do so, have never had a bad experience at Taj anywhere. A well run, well equipped, comfortable hotel.",4,2015,07,01
121,Lovely and a good location,"I booked this prior to a holiday as it was near Victioria Station, it was very busy but still very pleasant. There is not a lot of space in the lobby, restuarant/bar area but the rooms are quite spacious and very comfortable. The location is very good and there are a number of good places to eat & drink nearbyy",4,2015,06,30
121,Fantastic hotel,"Fantastic hotel in an excellent location. Could not fault this hotel at all.
Value for money, especially if you get a deal!
Would not stay anywhere else now when we visit London. My sister and I try to do a girly weekend twice a year.",5,2015,06,30
121,Two Days in London,"Check in was prompt - Room was good (second floor overlooking the courtyard) - lifts were somewhat busy in the morning - Bar food was excellent - only real ""negative"" was the queue and delay both mornings for a table at breakfast !!",4,2015,06,30
121,A 1990's decor with 2015 prices,"I sincerely hope that with the arrival of air-b&b these 'once-upon-a-time- posh' hotels will have no other option, but to finally deliver according to what they are charging. St.James's Court isn't an exception. The reception is of course very much 21st century combined with grandeur and style, with very polite and attentive staff. But it all ends when you get out of the elevator walking to your room. Old stained carpet, old, scuffed, marked wall paper and and old-pub musty smell. The bedroom is all the same - someone has tried with few 'odd jobs', someone unskilled - as the patch up finish is terrible. The en-suit is of course equally unappetising. Dated doesn't have to mean bad, but when it just feels unkept and not looked after, it just makes you annoyed as this is where clearly your money doesn't go….",2,2015,06,29
121,Average,"Basically a premier inn (with nicer decor) charging uber premier prices due to the location.

The showers in the rooms are terrible by the way.

The staff were generally helpful but the whole place seems quite stagnant and old school.

Always do the same things, always get the same results.",3,2015,06,28
121,Honeymoon in London ,"Stayed here in early June with my husband for afew nights and have to say, was pleasantly surprised.  Hotel reception was very professional and helpful and rooms where spacious (classic room).  Breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the wait staff in there were remarkable - very attentive and extremely polite and lovely.  Hotel is located within a 5 minute walk to Buckingham palace and at James park so there's no real need for a taxi.  We walked to the main attraction sites from our hotel - Just make sure you pack comfortable shoes!  Only let down was the bathrooms, no ventilation in there so it gets rather stuffy, and as a result the bathrooms are a little damp and are suffering structurally as a result.. Also.. There was a weird smell in the hallway entering our room which can only be described as very bad smelling incense! All in all very small criticism for what you get. Would stay here again.",5,2015,06,28
121,The taj london,"After staying at the Tag Exotica in the Maldives, I was very disappointed with the Tag in St James London. The room was small, the bathroom needed updating and it was like staying on top of a building sight with jack hammers and angle grinding  consistently going from early morning",2,2015,06,28
121,Always fine,"We've stayed here many times over the years.  Always reliable, clean, great location, good facilities.  Close to Victoria street for all necessary facilities. Reasonably close walking distance to all the highlights of London.  Very helpful concierge, in fact all staff have a sense of ""nothing's too much trouble"". ",4,2015,06,28
121,Great central location and great hotel,"Stayed here for its central location and proximity to Buckingham Palace, Westminster and Victoria rail and bus station.  A great hotel with fantastic facilities.  The staff were excellent and courteous and always available to help with any question about the hotel or how to get to a certain place by walking.  I did get a good deal through booking.com so best to shop around for the deals.  Checked out around midday and we were able to leave our luggage in a secure location in the hotel until we needed it again around 1800 to get home.  Didn't eat here for breakfast as that was pretty expensive but just around the corner there are plenty of places to get a decent meal.",5,2015,06,27
121,Great location and Great Service. Would stay again.,"Really enjoyed my stay at the St James' Court. Great location, just 5 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. Fantastic central London location. Modern and clean rooms. Great hotel facilities. All staff gave excellent service. Would recommend and would stay here again. Thank you!",5,2015,06,25
121,St. James' Court,Great place and had good food.  Its proximity to the business District was excellent.  I would recommend i to several of my friends who travel to London.  The rooms were excellent and the gym facility was just by the building.,5,2015,06,25
121,Elegant Hotel--Walk to Buckingham Palace!,"From the uniformed door men to the gleaming, elegant lobby to the perfectly appointed room to the extensive breakfast, friendly service and attention to detail, we were impressed and delighted with our recent three-day stay at St. James' Court Hotel. We did upgrade our room to a beautifully renovated room on the 6th floor (room 632), and it was well worth it. Our room was large by European standards (we had just come from a cramped 3-day stay in Paris) and included every amenity: robes, sparkling water, stocked refrigerator, wine and snack basket, and more. Buckingham Palace is a mere 5-minute walk away, as is beautiful St. James' Park and palace. Very convenient location to London attractions. Several upscale pubs and shops are also in the area. We would definitely love to stay here again!",5,2015,06,25
121,Overall recommended!,"Despite a bad smell in our first room, we were happy with our stay since the staff were very helpful and we were able to change room smoothly.  The breakfast was slightly on the poor side for a four star hotel.  Location was perfect, walkning distance to Big ben, Buckingham Palace and also to Victoria station which gave it excellent transport links.  Helpful staff, we got to borrow a power socket adapter, which saved the trip!",4,2015,06,25
121,Great location & service,Overall a great location & experience.  Executive rooms are large and comfortable.  Rooms have single beds if you have booked twin room. Try to request a higher floor room for better light.  The hotel has a fabulous bar area & courtyard for outside dining.  It is really an easy walk from St James Park or Victoria Station (a little further away).  Very close to Buckingham palace.,5,2015,06,25
121,"Great location, good breakfast,nice staff!","We stay there for three days, hotel is on great location, just 5 min from victoria station,10min from Big Ben...wifi is good, brakfast also, my doughter received a gift from hotel she was so happy, a tedybear, some crayones,a book... 
They have a great restaurant in hotel...",5,2015,06,25
121,Great hotel in a nice location. perfect service!,"Ive stayed in this hotel with a friend, we had a nice big room in the 8th floor in the back of the building, with small windows overlooking the roof/business buildings.
It was a nice large room. good bathroom. The service was good, everyone said good afternoon. The receptionists were fast sometimes to fast, to follow and understand. But I understand when its busy its the way to get through.
The concierge men were so incredible good!! Ive enjoyed theyre kindness the most of this hotel.
The bed in the room is comfy! our bathroom was old, it was oke, but some things were ready to be replaced. It would be a good thing if they made a new bathroom. Then it would have been 100% perfect. But still the shower was good, everything was there. the bathtub was nice. ( dont have this at home )

I would stay here again next time, the location is perfect. to walk towards big ben and other surroundings. I reccommend this hotel!",4,2015,06,25
121,Nice enough,"Stayed here recently. Nice place, comfortable room & nice products in the suite we had. Breakfast wasn't great, they clearly hadn't understood our order & sent lack lustre poached eggs & very little else. No toast or coffee. There was no offer to correct this. Sadly for me, the company I was with was even more lack lustre than the eggs, so no reflection on the hotel itself.",3,2015,06,24
121,Wonderful hotel that takes you back to a forgotten time,"I stayed here on business whilst in London, and usually stay at Marriotts or Hiltons.

As I couldn't get booked in to either of those brands near enough to where I wanted to be, I found a good deal on this hotel.

I would ask that you imagine the old Indian decadence from the turn of the 1900's and this is exactly the feel that the hotel had.

A fantastic internal courtyard that was simply stunning. Beautiful flowers adjourned the reception also.

The lobby and restaurant areas were exquisite, and although getting to the rooms was a bit of a rabbit warren, this seemed to add to the charm.

The hotel would be positioned in a perfect place for any tourists wishing to visit the landmarks that london has to offer.

A truly unique experience that I would love to repeat.

The restaurants should also be commended, whilst up market, they had a very reasonable set menu , and the food was out of this world. ",5,2015,06,23
121,Working In london,"Overall this hotel is in a perfect location and teams very positive, i travel to London and stay around 50 nights a year. this hotel was my first stay and i have to recommend to everyone, I am a smoker and had a smoking room that to be honest you could not tell",4,2015,06,23
121,Luxury & Location,"A quaint hotel in the heart of London, few minutes’ walk away from the royal address, what better can one ask for! While not a five star property like the Taj Hotels in India, the hotel has an appealing colonial aesthetic about it. We stayed in the Junior Suite and were very happy with the size and standard of the room. 
We enjoyed a fantastic meal at their Michelin Star restaurant Quilon, which we highly recommend to all, whether they are staying at the hotel or not. The buzzing Bank Bar at the hotel is also a great place to unwind and catch up with friends. 
A short walk to St. James Park tube, the hotel is perfectly located for business and leisure travellers. Shopping and sightseeing, both are within easy reach of the hotel. Several cafes and restaurants around the hotel offer a hearty breakfast and are open all day for either a quick coffee or a leisurely meal. 
Would definitely stay at this one again!",4,2015,06,23
121,One of the Best Places to Stay in London,"Our favourite hotel in London. A great location for business and leisure and on weekends you can park on the street! The staff at this hotel are wonderful, helpful and charming. They really do understand about Customer Service. The rooms have had a makeover and the decor and fittings are all very stylish. This would always be our first choice although prices latterly have increased since changing to Taj from an IHG Hotel",5,2015,06,22
121,Excellent Stay!,This was a great hotel and a great location.  It is only a short walk to Buckingham Palace and great walking and eating areas.  The people were great and made our stay more pleasurable.  I would not hesitate staying at this hotel again when visiting London.,5,2015,06,22
121,"A great location, but lacking in the Taj charm","I chose to stay here as I have become a huge fan of the Taj hospitality whilst travelling in India. Whilst i knew this wasn't a 5 star property, I did expect an experience that reflected the service levels and welcome of the other Taj properties. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. We originally checked into a 1st floor room - which was apparently an upgrade as we are gold members of the Taj loyalty programme. Were returned to the hotel late in the evening and realised the noise was going to be a huge problem for us. There is significant noise at the back of the property. We were relocated to the 6th floor and had a decent nights sleep. I would say that the original room was tired and needed a refresh. The club room was nice and had quality bedding and furniture, although nothing to write home about. Breakfasts were busy, a short wait for the buffet, but with guests handling the food with there hands , we were a little put off. Seating was also a little cramped. Staff were once again polite and very efficient. Would i stay here again? Probably not unless there was a special offer. The location of the hotel was super.",3,2015,06,22
121,"Very clean, friendly and great location but a tiny room for the price","We wanted a good hotel for a reasonable price for an anniversary weekend away and chose the St James' Court because its location is superb, the reviews were very good and for just a bit more than some of the bigger chains, it seemed ideal

The check-in staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient, offering us the opportunity to upgrade for £35 extra, which we declined

I had booked a Classic Double Room with a ""partial view"" and having seen the pictures of the hotel and the courtyard and although this was fairly low down on the scale of their charges, had high hopes.  We had a decent sized window in a properly small room, which opened to let in some fresh air and another in the bathroom, but unfortunately, the partial view out of both was of the bins at the back of and the outdoor seating area of All-Bar-One on Victoria Street, which also provided a decent amount of noise while the bar was open

Coupled with the mysteries of the A/C unit, this led to one chilly night and one stuffy night, although the bed was very comfortable and the room was possibly the cleanest I have stayed in

The ice machine in the corridor was also not switched on, which made a mockery of providing an ice bucket in the room",3,2015,06,21
121,Comfortable and good location,"This is my second stay in this hotel. It is still neat and tidy. I enjoyed staying there very much. However, it was hard to contact the front desk, I feel very bad about this. Otherwise, everything is very nice.",4,2015,06,21
121,Location,"Near Metro, central London. Well appointed rooms. Good all round. Friendly staff (especially Joseph - reception)
Will definitely consider again for future bookings.  

Tip: check traffic road closures as the hotel is quite near to Buckingham Palace. ",4,2015,06,21
121,good value,Excellent facilities and service. excellent location for business and pleasure. Would recommend it highly for either. The staff throughout was first class. The only minor fault was that the breakfast was not quite up to the standard I would expect from a hotel of this calibre.,5,2015,06,20
121,Weekend break,"I stayed at this beautiful hotel in January and during this time asked my partner to join me in a civil partnership nothing was to much trouble for this hotel , it was beautiful the rooms were large spacious and spotless clean , breakfast was second to none , I am hoping to stay in London again soon and will defiantly stay her",5,2015,06,20
121,Overall impression,"I had a wonderful two days staying in this hotel.  It was spotlessly clean, the staff were very helpful, courteous and friendly.  Nothing was too much trouble to ensure my comfort. Exceptional breakfast and service. Fantastic location.",5,2015,06,19
121,st james  court,"what a bad experience the cost was very high , the room was small the service was poor and everything very slow I paid 400 GBP  for a room was curtain did not properly close and the bathroom was quite small. the  hotel is a not a 5 stars hotel where the costs are high  NOT MONEY FOR VALUE",2,2015,06,19
121,Excellent Heritage property,"a very nice hotel, in the heart of city, practically every thing in proximity.

must say, since its a stones throw from the Buckingham Palace, the place is quiet and that's really great considering London traffic.

very well connected to national rail and tube. good spread of food and on top the Taj hospitality as always...........................",4,2015,06,19
121,Very good and nice hotel,I liked the hotel and enjoyed it. The hotel has class and style. Very friendlly staff. The hotel is near to al palces and to the underground. I liked this hotel and were satisfied. Thank you for evrything,4,2015,06,19
121,Taj - Naah!,"Property's location is excellent & personally i was proud to see an Indian brand & the Indian flag there, just a stone throw away from Buckingham Palace. Beyond that, it lacks the 'Taj' experience that the brand is known for.",3,2015,06,18
121,St James Court,"Recently used this hotel for a business event and was very impressed by the hotel and the staff.  Some of the Executive Rooms were a bit pricey, but then it's probably about right for the location.  The food was amazing and I would definitely recommend it.",5,2015,06,18
121,Good location,"Good location where you are close to Victoria station, close to St James's park, close to tube and busses. Hotel a bit run down- rooms need refurbishing and breakfast poor. Was nothing like what we expected from a 4* hotel. Staff in reception unfriendly unlike concierge and door staff. Busy hotel lobby. ",4,2015,06,18
121,Quiet room in the heart of London,"I wanted a quiet room in a good quality hotel in the centre of London within a short distance of an Underground station and the St James's Court Hotel delivered on all counts.  Well placed in Buckingham Gate a short walk from two tube stations (Victoria and St James's Park - although unfortunately the latter was closed the weekend we were there) this hotel is a lovely example of high quality furnishings, old-fashioned ambiance and a real sense of charm. All the staff we met were courteous and helpful.  Because I wanted to be guaranteed a walk-in shower, I went for a Classic Suite, although this was far larger than we needed.  The bathroom was equally spacious and very well equipped.  The towel rail, however, was extremely slow to heat up and didn't reach its top temperature until after both my husband and I had had our morning showers.  Fortunately, the weather was warm enough for it not to be a real concern.  I do not sleep well and had asked for a quiet room, which we certainly had.  However, had the next morning not been a Sunday, this might have been very different as the room overlooked a building site.  To be fair, most of the Victoria area is a building site at present as it is undergoing major redevelopment.  The food (bar meal at Hamptons - pricey but excellent - and breakfast) was first class.  Overall, I would recommend the St James's Court on the grounds of location, quality and good, old-fashioned charm.",4,2015,06,17
121,A Quiet Spot in the next to Buckingham Palace,"We had a huge room, junior suite. Very comfortable. Bathroom small, but room so great it wasn't a problem. Excellent service. Very busy with tourists, but we didn't notice, except the crowded lobby with people waiting. Excellent restaurant options, especially the Michelin Star Quilion! Wow! Nice Fitness Center and Spa. We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,06,17
121,Super boutique hotel in great location,"Lovely ambience, a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace. Courteous staff, in constant company of Who's Who from India. However, compared to most Taj Hotels in india, quality of food was 8/10. Small restaurant, minor issues with reservation.  However, I got excellent value for money and would love to go again, if price is right",4,2015,06,16
121,St James Court Hotel,"St James Court Hotel is ideally situated for London attractions. The hotel experience from check in to checkout was excellent. We arrived early and left our luggage with concierge staff who following our check in conveyed our luggage to our room, whilst we were sight seeing. Food in the hotel was of excellent quality. The staff are all extremely polite and courteous. Excellent hotel, if returning to London will book this hotel again.",5,2015,06,16
121,Quality slipped a little.,"We stayed at this hotel in 2013 when it was the Crowne Plaza and had a wonderful stay.  Since that time, the facility has changed hands and while still a very nice hotel, we felt that there a few areas where the quality had slipped.  When we arrived, the hotel was VERY busy with a convention (toys & games, I believe).  We were not able to book a King Executive Junior Suite because of the convention (settling for a regular King), but when we checked in, the hotel upgraded us to a King Executive, which was nice, although it overlooked a very busy street and was a bit noisy. We had flies in the room...not just a couple, but about 6 or 8, and they were the big buzzy ones.  We swatted flies for about 20 minutes and thought we got them all, but when we came back later, we had more.  This went on daily and we ended up with at least 25 kills during our stay.  We think they were coming in through a vent in the bathroom, and we advised management of this early in our stay, but it persisted.  Housekeeping did not change the bedding on a regular basis, and we noticed that the dirty glasses were not replaced.  We also had several burned out light bulbs and left a note every day for housekeeping to no avail.  Minor issues, but I felt that they were notable.   Breakfast buffet was included with our room package and was very good with a wide selection.  You could also order variations of egg preparations that were not on the buffet, and the fresh juice was excellent.",4,2015,06,15
121,Fantastic hotel fantastic location,"I stayed here over a long weekend with a friend. We had asked for a twin room but when we arrived we were in a double. We brought this to the attention of the reception and when we returned from a visit to the House of Lords we had a new room and our luggage had been moved as well.
The location is fantastic, 5 mins from Buckingham Palace and 10 mins walk from Westminster.
The facilities in the hotel are fantastic. Lovely breakfast, bars in the courtyard and very friendly staff. We had afternoon tea in one of the restaurants that was beautiful- very calorific!! 
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,15
121,Fantastic Weekend :),Anniversary weekend at St Jame's Court was just fabulous :) Every member of staff that we met were just lovely and so friendly. The hotel treated us to an upgrade and a gorgeous little 'Happy Anniversary' chocolate treat in our room. On the Saturday evening when we returned there was a guy at the piano and a guy on the double bass playing wonderful tunes. Bliss. A few minor grumps . . . room not sorted for the evening on second night - curtains drawn / water replenished etc. Breakfast - poached eggs rubbery - looked like they were cooked the cling film way! Mushrooms didn't appear 'fresh' - more like pre-packed - would expect flat mushrooms in such a place - cooked yumtastically!!! Tetley tea doesn't work for me in such a hotel - would expect Twinnings. However I was very impressed with the bathroom products and the scrummy big wrap around towels. The bed was just bliss-tastic. And the little extras such as the ice bucket & bottle opener . . . and the fact that if you had forgotten any toiletries they would just be supplied. And to finish (I could go on more) - I could not believe how quiet it was . . . even with the windows open . . . an amazing experience. Thank you :) ,5,2015,06,14
121,Birthday Bash,"We arrived at 1pm and were allocated room 680. Check-in staff were great (especially Omar from Spain). In fact, all of the staff we encountered on this trip were very good. 680 is a classic room but with twin aspects, a comfy but not huge bed and a dressing/seating area. It is old world charm. Stylish but unpretentious.
The afternoon tea was ok. £27.50 each and the bread was dry. It was also very stingy on the sandwich front. I ask for a couple more duck finger sandwiches and received an Oliver Twist look. 
Breakfast was included in our excellent rate of £152. We took it in the first floor function suite which is much more relaxed and comfortable when compared to Bistro off of the lobby. 
Cocktails were excellent although there was a language barrier. We gave the waitress the three room numbers in our group (two cocktails came to £27) and this was miscommunication. As we went to leave the garden we were accosted by the bar manager who had a very shocked and indignant manner. We then had to wait like criminals in full view whilst she sorted out THEIR mistake. 
Overall, we loved the hotel and staff and apart from a couple of hiccups we would stay again in a heartbeat. 
",5,2015,06,14
121,Perfect location and price,This hotel is located only 5 mins walk from Victoria railway station (express to Gatwick airport). This hotel consists of two parts: one is hotel and another is apartments managed by hotel. Prices are not high. Generally is clean. Rooms equipped good. Bath facilities are poor. If you have a business trip to London it is good place to stay. I recommend this hotel,3,2015,06,14
121,"Great Location, Great Hotel",The St James Court is in a great location (within walking distance of numerous landmarks).  Service was great.  Room was large and very clean.  Breakfast was very enjoyable. Also very close to St James Park Tube Station.,5,2015,06,14
121,"Great trip, good hotel.","The room we had was average and we waited a while to get in, which was disappointing since we had such a short stay in London.  However, the courtyard of the hotel  was beautiful, the hotel gym and spa (for free) was excellent, and the restaurant adjacent to the hotel had great food! We would stay again. The hotel was a good location to walk around the city.",4,2015,06,11
121,Superb hotel. ,"We stayed at the taj for my wedding anniversary,  were on the sixth floor.  Room619. The hotel is set in the heart of london. Within  a 2 minutes walk from the hotel is Buckingham palace,  we  stayed for two nights.  I booked a early check in as wished to speed three full days In  london . The hotel was very accommodating and the room was ready on arrival. The staff were very helpful and welcoming . Offering to take luggage to the room. I quick booking in. Room was a good size and bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom was great with lighting and tv able to be played in to it so you could listen to music also I found to be of use a telephone in there also. 
Food at all restaurants was very high standard and a very good verity of both western and Asian food. Food could be ordered to your liking witch was to liking of the guests.  
The gym was very good with all the equipment that you would find at your local gym with towels and a water available to guests. 
The staff were always very friendly and helpful and very welcoming with coming and going from the hotel. 
And for a hotel in the heart of London the rooms were very quiet.
Would I stay at the taj again I would have to say ""absolutely"" a fine hotel and staff should be very proud of themselves .

",5,2015,06,11
121,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We chose this hotel for a one night stay at the last minute.  From the moment we arrived, we were impressed with the service from the doorman, our check in and the speed in which our bags were delivered.  Our room on the 6th floor was very spacious and immaculate.  We stayed in a few different hotels in Europe during our stay but this was by far the best.  Every detail had been well thought out - nothing had been overlooked.  The bathroom was spotless and the amenities superb.  We had a drink in the courtyard prior to dinner and again, the service was very attentive.  I had never stayed at a Taj hotel before this but will definitely stay in one again.  Very impressive.",5,2015,06,11
121,Taj Hotels are not what they used to be,"We selected the Taj St. James for two reasons, the location and the excellent service we received in Taj Hotels over the past 25 years. Unfortunately, we were disappointed: Service - maybe above average compared to the UK standard but sous terrain for Taj standards. Rooms small, not well kept and too expensive for the value. Breakfast in McDonalds is better, but the location at least gives a reason to help justify the price during a weak moment of regret... what is the matter with Taj Hotels? Is the economic situation so bad? If our first experience with the Taj Group would have been this hotel (or one of the Taj Vivanta Goa by the way) it would have been definitely our last...",3,2015,06,10
121,"Very disappointing, with some saving graces","I booked this hotel through booking.com, and was really looking forward to my one night, two day stay there, having heard so much about it's legendary rooms and services.

We were kindly switched to a twin room rather than a double room I had originally requested, with no fuss. But the room itself - and the bathroom - were shocking. My friend and I are both clean freaks so when we saw that the tap was dripping, the window in the bathroom had debris on the inside ledge and there was leftover food fallen in the crevices of the minibar, we summoned the staff who cleaned it and made some mumbled excuses about how their was refurbishment work going on and hence the debris.

My friend, whose husband worked in the hospitality industry for years, was no stranger to such things and decided to take on the battle. She complained politely but firmly and soon we were upgraded to a newly furbished room and even received a late check out permission at no extra charge. 

What disappointed me was just the fact that at the prices they charge, such an incident should not have happened at all. It is simply not fair that one receives good service only after protesting and demanding. 

Hopefully, they will improve this aspect of their service.",3,2015,06,10
121,good experience,"good place, excellent service, excellent personell, kindness. Liftsare  a bit too busy and slow.  I would recommend it for sure. Prices could be a little bit mode moderate, but this is London. Food is average as for all tth rest of the Uk, but one of the inners restauarants is good indeed.",5,2015,06,10
121,perfect weekend away,Had such an amazing welcome to the hotel we felt like royalty. took awhile to find the room but once found we realised there was a quicker way we could have gone as there are a few lifts around the hotel. we walked into the room which did look a little dated but that's only minor details. the bed was so comfy it was amazing. the mini bar wasn't as cold as i would have liked but the drinks were chilled enough. all of the staff give you a nice welcome and a smile which is a nice little touch. i would defiantly stay at this hotel again only a short walk from 2 tube stations it is perfect for a weekend away.,5,2015,06,08
121,My experience about St James court London,"Me and my family were on the way to the U.S. and we decided to break our journey via London .We decided to stay at St James court 54 Buckingham gate London a Taj hotel.
         It was an unbelievable experience .In their breakfast they have one indian cuisine .they have in house indian food in their own restaurants which match the taste of indian style and their chefs indian or foreigners are more than ready to prepare as per our requirements .
The staff at reception very friendly and ready to help .the concierge the bell boys always eager to sort out problems .
      The front office manager Naveen Sikka amazing man .i saw him handle number of guests at a time and he made us feel at home away from home .sunaina soares and so many others .we were so overwhelmed by the hospitality that on our way back we again stayed for two nights .
        All in all I would always stay at St James court .I can only say Wah Taj in London .",5,2015,06,07
121,"St James' Court, a Taj Hotel",An excellent hotel that feels like home. Location and facilities perfect for business and leisure. The management is warm and responsive. I would keep coming back here whether I am on business or leisure.,5,2015,06,07
121,Poor staff service,"The bed is comfy in your room and the location is ideal for exploring London, Buckingham palace is a short walk away. The bad points about this hotel are the staff that work there. Whilst sat in the bar waiting to order food, we waited over 25 minutes for the waitress to take our order. This was frustrating because a lot of the waitresses appear to just walk around not achieving much!!!  Check in is horrendous.... We arrived early and they kindly too our luggage stating it would be available in our rooms when we arrived later on. We returned again  half an hour before check in and our room still wasn't ready. I asked again if our room had been swapped to a twin, it was confirmed for a second time that it had.  So we went to eat in the bar, when we returned check in had been open for an hour. The queue was now about a 20 minute waiting time. The reason the staff were taking so long to check people in, was because they were asking guests if they needed any tourist assistance drawing out the process massively!!!  When we did finally get our room - guess what, it hadn't been swapped to twin...  I couldn't be bothered to queue up again. We returned from the city about midnight and ask the man on the desk for some extra milk... Guess what??? It didn't arrive!!! Very frustrating stay in what is actually a gorgeous hotel!!",3,2015,06,07
121,Very nice hotel! ,"Stayed for one night on business. Arrived late evening and was instantly impressed with the hotel's appearance. Definite wow factor!

On check in I was asked for my credit card for any extras, when I explained that I wouldn't be having any extras as I had a meal allowance which had been pre-paid I was told I was my mini bar would be locked. I was fine with that as I planned to have room service and get an early night. 

I'd been in the room for two minutes and a member of hotel staff was at the door to lock the mini bar. It wouldn't lock. So the guy proceeded to empty the bar onto a trolley in the door way in front of two other guests. I was most embarrassed.

After this I attempted to to order room service to be told I was cash only so couldn't have it. After a long explanation that I had a prepaid allowance and a ten minute wait for a call back I was told I could order. 

Once we had got over this, the food was actually very good. And reasonably priced for central London. I liked the fact that there was no tray charge for room service but a service charge based on % was applied which I thought was very fair. 

The room was stunning and I couldn't fault it at all. The breakfast was well presented but very average, a table service system is in place, which was good. 

Overall, a good hotel with a few glitches but I would give it another try. ",4,2015,06,06
121,Girlie Weekend,"Me & my friend reunited for a weekend in London. The hotel is perfectly located with friendly staff. This is my second visit and the standard is still as good! Not far from St James Park or the Victoria underground, Buckingham Palace or the London bridge",5,2015,06,05
121,Perfect Business Trip but not only !,"The hotel is not faraway from Victoria Station, walking distance but isolated from the ""... jam"" of the Station. I've got a very big room  breakfast included at the same price i booked. Good services inside, and after the business you are at walking distance from the main place of London as well. I frequently travel to London for business, and i'll come back here. Good value for money.",5,2015,06,05
121,Business stay at St James Court,"second stay at this hotel with 5 colleagues following first very successful one but this time rooms were a lot smaller, tired and needed updating. bed moved around the room and not upto the usual standards. 2 of my colleagues kept waiting upto an hour in lobby for rooms to become available, dissapointed.",2,2015,06,05
121,Business trip,Amazing hotel. Gorgeous place to stay. Location is amazing. Very friendly staff. Enjoyed my stay and will definately use this hotel again. Breakfast was included and was also very good. Veryy happy overall. Highly recommended.,5,2015,06,05
121,Fantastic hotel,"Do not hesitate this hotel is great. Close to Buckingham palace, close to the train and tube station. I loved the decor, cleanliness, fresh flowers in the lobby, very polite and smiling employees. Great morning buffet. I really have no complaints. We went to the restaurant in the court yard, great experience, decor and food. Special thanks to Damiano from the Bank restaurant who made our last evening in London very special. The concierge was very helpful. If I go back to London I will get back to the St James Court without any hesitation.",4,2015,06,04
121,Great Location comfortable hotel,"Selected through TripAdvisor and not disappointed, comfortable and well positioned hotel with very pleasant well trained staff.  Functional and central to everything in London.  Good restaurant and excellent breakfast, good for business or a tourist visit and excellent value for money.  Check in seems to struggle and we actually waited nearly 45 minutes for our room at 2pm in the afternoon so this needs attention, otherwise, highly recommend.",4,2015,06,04
121,Fabulous Hotel and courtyard,"We stayed in this hotel as it was convenient for our stay in London.  Whilst usually out of our price range, we decided to treat ourselves and were pleasantly surprised.  The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful, the hotel was clean (if a little tired in places) and the food and drink was fantastic.  We ordered room service which arrived very quickly.  The concierge staff were very helpful.",5,2015,06,04
121,Surprisingly good value for money.,"First, note that my girlfriend and I got quite fortunate with the booking and paid substantially less than the original asking price, I think we booked with a 40-50% discount. For that price, it's perfect.

Close to the underground and walking distance to Buckingham palace and the surrounding gardens. If you plan to have tea with the queen, this is an ideal location.

Lovely courtyard outside the hotel, nice decor, friendly staff.

It is a Taj so the in room dining is superb, especially the Indian dishes.

Rooms could probably do with a lick of paint, and the school opposite our window was quite noisy early on in the morning but a great place none the less.

Look to book when it is on offer, I am not sure if I would pay full whack for the room, if I had to I would probably search the area for alternatives.",4,2015,06,03
121,Visited London for two days in May,"We chose the St James Court because of its close proximity to Buckingham Palace. The suite we had was of a good size, clean and well appointed, the only problem was the noise from the road outside.  It would be worth asking for a room towards the back of the hotel.  Staff were welcoming, friendly and willing to spend time helping with requests.  
Breakfast was fine but coffee was a little cool, however we were offered Americano when we complained, these were hot and well flavoured. The scrambled eggs were the best I have had in any hotel, pastries not quite so good.
we ate in the bistro and Quilon, both were of a good standard but I would particularly recommend Quilon, the Indian restaurant where the food and service wet excellent.

If you want a central hotel within walking distance of many attractions you could do far worse than this one.  Price wise, it is a central London hotel so don't expect it to be cheap!",5,2015,06,03
121,great hotel experience,"Just got back from a fantastic weekend in london, we have never stayed here before but will definitely stay again, everything that I look for had big ticks, clean room, good nights sleep,great shower, excellent breakfast and a really nice environment.  All staff were very welcoming and helpfull. I really cant fault standard double room with garden view, for what we paid right next to the palace, bargain.",5,2015,06,03
121,Friendly and great value,"The hotels own restaurant - The Bistro - serves good English food combined with a few tantalising dishes from India.  A great idea. However, what I'd let travellers know, is that if you're on business on your own and staying at this hotel, dine at the Bistro and the staff will make you feel really welcome and at home.....with some nice, simple but tasty good food. I recommend it. ",5,2015,06,03
121,Fine Experience,"Everithing was as advertice, and the price, service and location was perfect match. Near a metro station and the train station, also 2 blocks from brand stores and restaurants. People nice and eager to help",5,2015,06,03

121,Service at a glance,"As I know Taj Lands End Mumbai and The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai, I have never stayed anywhere else at hotels with the same or better service. My citytrip led me to London, and happily I found a Taj Hotel. Curious about if it is comparable to Taj Hotels in India I stayed there. And I got again a great service that made my stay very pleasant. If you want a little bit more excitement then I recommend 5* Taj Hotel.",5,2015,06,01
121,Very good stay,Just come back from a very pleasant stay at the St James court hotel. Upon arrival we were told we'd been given a complimentary upgrade and our bags were in our room before we were!!!  The room was excellent well furnished. The concierge on duty Fred was very attentive for the duration of our stay and nothing was too much trouble for him. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice. We were given a lovely table in the breakfast room over looking the courtyard. We would highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be returning. ,5,2015,05,31

All staff were friendly, professional and nothing was too much trouble.  Our room was quiet, light and clean as was the bathroom. We had a very comfortable bed (although it was only 4' 6"").  We dined in 2 of the hotel restaurants:  We had afternoon tea in Kona, which was lovely and being London we paid £27 pp but we don't do this very often so it was a treat.  We had a cocktail and then dinner in their Bank restaurant which was very enjoyable. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment.  We were able to leave our luggage so we enjoyed our last day luggage free before heading back to the station.  Very good 4 star hotel and convenient for business and/or sightseeing.",4,2015,05,31

121,Excellent hotel and location,"Stayed in March 2015, recommended by my travel agent. My husband and I were the youngest guests we saw there since it's a little pricey- many others looked like fancy business travelers. It was gorgeous though, the rooms were perfect size, the robes and bathroom amentities were great. Beds extremely comfortable. The front desk and doormen would greet you each time you walked by, which was nice and welcoming. We found most of their restaurants too expensive for us (19p hamburger, almost $28) but that may just be average for London, I'm not really sure. 
The location was absolutely perfect, 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, St. James Tube. There was a convenience store next door, where we bought most of our drinks and snacks. 
Definitely recommend.",5,2015,05,30
121,Another Stay at the St. James Court,"Another two nights at the St. James Court in late May convinced me I've found something of a jewel. All my descriptions from my review in October, 2014 still stand and it was another restful and comfortable stay. This time, my room had a nice view of the interior courtyard. A wonderful thing except for the birthday party (with loud music), that happened on my first night. Nevertheless, the party (and music) ended about 1030 PM, so no hassles there for me. As usual, the room was clean, quiet and well appointed, although the bath was slightly smaller than a broom closet and difficult to move around in - unlike my last stay where the bath was positively palatial. Each room is unique in some way! Again, this is not a negative in my opinion. Staff was friendly and helpful as usual and room service was much quicker than advertised as my late evening meal arrived in about 15 minutes as opposed to the advertised 25-30. Thanks again, St. James Court, for another quality visit to London!",4,2015,05,30

121,Great choice in the heart of London,"Being at a walking distance from major landmarks while at the same time enjoying comfortable rooms is always a challenge in London. Especially if you are lucky enough to get a good offer, this hotel is the perfect choice, providing great value for your money. Very friendly staff, comfortable rooms, and free wi-fi are a few of its benefits. Didn't have the time to check the spa, unfortunately. Excellent restaurants. I hope to come back soon.",4,2015,05,27

121,Will be going back,"Great hotel, staff and location. We were greeted by a lovely member of the reception and made to feel very welcome. We were able to check in early which made things better. 
Overall, a fabulous hotel and when we visit London again will return to this hotel. ",5,2015,05,26
121,Great value but a little tired,Found a room at the Taj St James on Trivago and got it for £107 on a saturday night which in my opinion is outrageous value in central london. Overall hotel is fine....I had room 177 which was small and rather tired but nevertheless pretty good for £107...if I had paid £180 plus I would have been annoyed but overall can't complain with this...service and check in were good and hotel was clean and in a great location.,3,2015,05,26
121,Excellent,"Absolute fab hotel in the centre of London.  All staff, from the porters on arrival to reception, room service, bar and waiting staff and housekeeping are all so helpful and polite and cannot do enough to assist you throughout your stay.",5,2015,05,26
121,Taj Hotel in name but not quality,"Found everything after reception to be below expectations...  room was average, wifi appalling...though staff did move me to another room in the back annex, felt like a dodgy b&b.  Breakfast staff were very friendly.
      ",3,2015,05,26
121,Excellent hotel in St. James Near Buckingham Palace,"My wife and I spent a week at the hotel and we loved it. It was in a wonderful location, and the accommodations were excellent. The staff was incredibly helpful and we had an excellent view of the courtyard. I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to London!",5,2015,05,26
121,Very pleasant stay at St. James' Court,"Conveniently located near Victoria Station, this hotel is in the upper range. Comfortable rooms, not a low price hotel, but quality, ambience, and service reflects the price range. I enjoyed staying at this hotel, and would definitely consider returning.",4,2015,05,26
121,Great hotel in a great location,"A superb hotel with all the intimacy of a boutique hotel and the amenities of a big hotel. Our fifth visit in the last three years, this time as a base to visit the Chelsea Flower show. Check in was excellent, we arrived at mid day and our room was ready. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable and we slept well each night. Breakfast was great with a good range of choice but if you wanted to economise, Pret is just across the road and there are numerous other places within 5 minutes walk. As a location, St James tube station is a few minutes away, Westminster Abbey, the Embankment and  Trafalgar Square are all within an easy walk.  We had dinner in Quilon, the Michelin starred Indian restaurant attached to the hotel and had a really excellent meal with great service at a very reasonable price for London.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will be coming back.",5,2015,05,26
121,Great experience,"I am a frequent guest of the hotel, mainly due to business travels. I would always recommend it for the cosy atmosphere, elegance and style, as well as proximity to main London attractions. The indoor garden is lovely, especially when the weatehr is nice, otherwise the lobby bar offers enjoyable afternoon tea with piano live music.",4,2015,05,25
121,Very polite staff at the hotel. Booking and payment confusion by Mumbai booking office.,"I had booked this hotel 2 months in advance. Full payment (as known at the time) was made upfront in its head office in Mumbai. I have copy of the email whereby this hotel was informed of our upcoming stay and payment. I arrived at the hotel on May 16. The front office staff duly noted that there was no payment received. After numerous conversations, we are yet to see when will we get refund back for over payment. 
There seems severe disconnect between booking office and this hotel for customers paying in advance. This was an awful experience. 
This being said, it is a nice hotel to stay in, excellent food, excellent customer service (except for what I said above).",3,2015,05,25
121,great loaction,"excellent location - very close to St James' tube, Westminster, the Royal parks and Victoria. Generously sized rooms. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I didn't use the bar but it looked quite lively.",5,2015,05,25
121,RECOMMENDED ,I stay  here quite  regularly  for business breaks.  Spacious comfortable rooms and great efficient service.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel for short stays  in central London.  Good location.  Helpful staff. ,4,2015,05,24
121,St James Taj,"Un stuffy luxury in a great location  for the tube to go sight seeing in London. Comfy bed, quiet, quality rooms at reasonable price. Lovely toiletries and great bed linen - robes and slippers available too. Breakfast a bit on the expensive side - but Greggs and other outlets within a stone's throw if you want to nip out for croissants etc. Very helpful and professional staff and the facility to leave luggage till well after check out time was a real plus.",5,2015,05,24
121,"Stylish hotel, warm welcome","An overnight stay as part of birthday celebration. Tasteful, sophisticated hotel very convenient to tube station. Lovely outdoor courtyard. An oasis away from hustle and bustle. Recommend the extensive variety of cocktails on offer.  All hotel staff very warm and welcoming. Very comfortable.",4,2015,05,24
121,Great hotel,"We only stayed at this hotel for one night, but the quality, cleanliness and customer service was excellent. We went to the apollo theatre to see wicked that night and the location to victoria is great. The rooms are clean and well furbished and the staff even left a complimentary birthday cake in our room for my wife's birthday. It is quite pricey, but for the location and quality, definitely worth the money.",5,2015,05,24
121,London,"Had an amazing time in London. Business trip & a little leisure time in between meetings. The Taj is the perfect place to stay. We walked almost everywhere despite having tube tickets. Staff are excellent, facilities excellent & the overall experience of staying there made for a really memorable trip to London. Will be where I stay on my next visit.",5,2015,05,24
121,So welcoming,The staff couldn't do enough for myself and my 6 year old. He was given a soft toy and back pack on arrival- which was filled with all sorts to keep him amused. Room in breakfast was a welcome change- and easier than going to the restaurant. Breakfast was ok. Room huge! Really lovely. Would stay again for certain. Right next to Buckingham Palace too!,5,2015,05,22
121,One of my favourite  hotels,"Stayed here for one night on business. Room facilities  were good, standard of room excellent and quiet. Very comfortable  bed. Would definitely  return. Great location for tourists being walking distance from Buckingham  Palace.",5,2015,05,21
121,Nothing Special,"Stayed here for 4 nights in April.  The room was adequate but lacking in a few areas.  The stopper in the sink did not work properly and the floor in the bathroom could have used a good cleaning.  On the upside the staff went out of their way to be helpful and the buffet breakfast was to die for.  You have a choice of all kinds of fruits, cheeses, meats, cereals as well as made to order eggs, omelets etc.  The waitstaff in the restaurant were delightful.",3,2015,05,21
121,spot on,"We only had one night at this hotel, but our stay was truly enjoyable.  Nothing to much trouble for the staff, lovely bedrooms and the food was lovely.  We stayed as we were going to Buckingham Palace and could not have asked for a better location.  It was also great for going to Westminster.

Looking forward to our next trip and staying the hotel again.",5,2015,05,21
121,"Excellent hotel, great central location","Perfect service, room good, some signs of wear and tear, but not a big problem for a 1 night stay. Breakfast very good, lots of choice.  Worth filling up for the day, especiially if breakfast is included in your rate.",4,2015,05,21
121,Excellent Location!!,"We spend 9 nights in this lovely hotel in march this year. Location is the reason we choose this hotel in the 1st place. And everything turn out great for us. this hotel located strategically near to Buckingham  palace (3min walk), from there you can visit Green park and walk to Ritz hotel and move you way to to New Bond Street. How easy is that?
we also walked our way to Westminster Abbey and Big Ben and from there we walk to Jubilee Walk for London eye, OXO tower and so on.
The Hotel room is clean and comfy although the queen bed is a bid small for us, but we managed.
Staffs are welcome and friendly. We had an enjoyable stay overall. Definitely a come back and recommendation to friends.",4,2015,05,20
121,"Great hotel, great location!","We stayed here for 3 nights after a 2 week cruise.  Our second time at this hotel based on our previous experience.  We were not disappointed.  While we are sure there are many fine hotels in London, we really like this place for its amenities, outstanding service and great rooms.  One can walk just about anywhere to London's famous attractions, including Buckingham Palace, which is just two blocks away. Particularly of  note is the outstanding service of all staff we encountered. Truly exceptional. Breakfast was included in our rate and was ample. We had a ""classic king"" room which was large and comfortable.  We had three large cruiser suitcases which we could easily postion around the room for easy access without having to unpack. A traditional afternoon tea service is held in the very comfortable lobby and cocktail/lounge areas. An integrated, but separately owned restaurant called ""The Bank"" serves excellent food. We ate there twice and it is chargeable to the hotel bill.  We would certainly stay here again.",5,2015,05,20
121,Truly Taj....,"I have just checked in with my family and the welcome was more than what i expected. I got the room that i wanted, its a beautiful courtyard view suite, neat and clean...everything is great. I am sure our stay for the entire 10 nights will be comfortable and memorable. Truly Taj...",5,2015,05,20
121,Excellent!,"Great hotel. Wonderful service. The location is great for sightseeing. Restaurants within walking distance not so good. Room service was very good. Hairdryer was broken.  Had toilet flushing problems, but they were resolved.  Very comfortable bed.  Planning to go again!!",5,2015,05,20
121,Splendid Hotel In The City Centre,"The Taj is the perfect example of luxury hotel with extreme hospitality. I Stayed at the Taj for 4 Nights. The Hotel was  splendid and i had a great time there. Check in was started with welcome drinks, cold towels, and simple massage. All the staffs were highly accommodating, all the facilities were luxurious, all the menu during breakfast was  tasteful, and all the details in my room were perfect. I asked late check out at 3 PM, and it was accepted without extra charge. 

Charming and efficient staff who look after all their guests in a friendly and interested yet always professional way. I urge you to try it...and recommend this hotel to everyone who can afford to stay.

121,Splendid Hotel In The Heart Of London,"I stayed at St James for 4 nights, The Hotel was Comfortable, large, basic room with nice decor, simply furnished, full bath and large wash basin :)  St James has a spectacular location surrounded by Monuments, Lots of restaurants close by and a Short walk to the city centre.  My room was overlooking The courtyard which sported some great Car Watching during my stay... Simple pleasures for a GearHead!",5,2015,05,20
121,perfect for us,This hotel is full of old world charm and in an excellent location. The staff are great and very attentive going out of their way to help with anything we needed.The Indian restaurant on site was excellent. The courtyard is a lovely place to sit out and eat or have drinks. The bar in the lobby is a good place to unwind and sip a glass of champagne.,5,2015,05,20
121,Elegant courtesy,Obviously great management throughout... With the exception of switches and electric plugs the only negative comment are the length and convolution of narrow corridors. The lift seems a little tired....BUT IT WORKS OK !,5,2015,05,20
121,What a hotel!,"Booked this hotel for my partner's birthday. Friendly staff, beautiful hotel and amazing room – the Classic Master Suite. A shame we didn't have a view of the courtyard but the room more than made up for that. Added the romantic turn down option in too through the hotel's website which looked lovely. I'd recommend this hotel!",5,2015,05,20
121,Very good,"Positive overall experience. Cleanliness was apparent and the hotel staff were courteous and obliging. The check-in experience was fairly speedy, as was the check-out. Bags were held by the concierge for the day which was useful. Excellent!",5,2015,05,20
121,"Pricey, but worth every penny!","From the moment the door was courteously opened for me upon arrival, this stay counts amongst my most memorable in London.....and memorable for all the right reasons.  The hotel is ideally situated for me - close to all my areas of business and when suggested by an online hotels reservation website, I decided to give this hotel a try.   Ok, it isn't the cheapest, but, it does provide good value for money being in the bracket of what I would consider a luxury hotel.   The hotel is clean, bright and just a little bit different to the other hotels in the area offering an interesting mix of Western and Eastern decoration. The staff are polite and attentive and are obviously highly trained in all matters of customer service.   I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel as an excellent place to relax, unwind and dine in one of the excellent restaurants that are available.",5,2015,05,20
121,St James' Court,"A great hotel all round in a very handy location. The only criticism I have is that there was loud music playing in reception and I found it hard to hear the receptionist when I checked in and out. The room was very comfortable, though.",5,2015,05,20
121,Good for a weekend stay ,"Stayed twice in this hotel. First time  in a standard room that seemed to be a little bit small, second time was upgraded to and have absolutely no complaints about the size and furniture. The hotel has a very nice yard so if you are lucky to get that view room it's really great to wake up in the morning and look at a window. Restaurant was also not bad, but nothing exciting, I preferred to eat in the city therefore. Lobby and reception are are absolutely awesome. Great design and space usage. It's less that 10 mins to Victoria station and around 5 mins waking to the Palace. Positive impression after each stay.  ",4,2015,05,19
121,London long-weekend visit base hotel,"I stayed here with friends, one of whom ran in the London Marathon. It is a beautiful hotel, rooms a good size (by London standards), excellent breakfast, and cozy lounge. Most outstanding in my opinion were the great location (down the street from Buckingham Palace, walking distance from St. James Park, Westminster Abbey, War Cabinet Rooms and Parliament buildings/Big Ben, near St. James tube station, a bit of a longer walk to Westminster station), and the excellent and well-trained staff, who were always highly professional, courteous, and helpful but also friendly and welcoming, not stuffy. A pair of decent-sized elevators were available and appreciated. The WiFi worked fine for me. Business office services (printing, fax) were available but too expensive to use; I think this is better as a vacation headquarters than for business, which I postponed until moving elsewhere. We enjoyed visiting a pub nearby for a pint and a generous platter of fish and chips!",5,2015,05,19
121,"Wonderful location, nice accommodations","The hotel is 2 blocks from Buckingham Place.  The hop-on hop-off bus stop is right at the corner of Buckingham Palace Road and Buckingham Gate Road.  The underground can be used from St James Park or Victoria Station.  All of the staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  The Hamptons bar staff not only helped us with our food choices, but also understand our British money.  Our room (266) was much larger than expected (being from NJ we were used to NYC closet-sized rooms with high price tags).   It was a handicapped room and designed for limited mobility comfort.  A bit more shelf space in the bathroom would have been nice.  Our friends who were on the first floor needed a room change due to subway noise, but we were on the second floor and did not notice any noise.  Our room faced a lovely courtyard with fountains and flowers. The breakfast buffet was included in our price.  It was substantial with many choices, and eggs, toast, or anything else you wanted not at the buffet was prepared with a smile. It is not an inexpensive stay, but there is value for your money.",5,2015,05,18
121,Pleasant stay... But,"I have to say, the setting is lovely, the room was pleasant, the staff were helpful and knowledgeable and I have no complaints. However, for the price of the room and meal we had, I am not sat here thinking what a wonderful experience it is either. I just feel with a little more care, a little more attention to detail and some additional touches I would def make an excuse to go back. However, as things stand I am just left a little cold",3,2015,05,18
121,"Comfortable hotel, perfect location","Our stay at this hotel was a great experience. We stayed for two nights for a long weekend. The staff was very friendly and helpful. As we arrived early in the morning, our room was, of course, not ready yet. The concierge kept our luggage and brought it to our room once it was ready, so when we came back at the hotel at night, we didn't have to deal with our luggage ourselves. The room was great and clean, the bed was big and very comfortable, the bathroom was good and also clean (there was even a towel heater). We had read on Tripadvisor that people complained about the noise from the underground, but we didn't have any problems with that at all, while we were on the first floor. There is free wifi both in the room as in the common areas, also complimentary newspaper delivered to the room.
The hotel is perfectly located, at walking distance from Buckingham Palace and both St. James' Park station and Victoria station. It was really practical to be so close to Victoria station, as there is a direct train connection from Gatwick airport to Victoria station. There is also a very good tube connection.
Opposite the hotel, there is a great place to have breakfast, as we didn't want to have breakfast in the hotel.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,05,18
121,Superb,"What a hotel and as James Hilton the famous hotelier of Hilton hotels fame said ""location, location,location"" is what makes a hotel. Three minutes walk from Buckingham Palace - what more could a visitor to London ask for. The hotel itself and the suites are very comfortable and the vaunted Taj hospitality and warmth very evident. The benchmark of our stay in London - truly memorable",5,2015,05,18
121,Vandazhy Nellikkaledon K Kutty / Our stay at your hotel from 3rd May to 10th May'15.,"I stayed with my family at yr nice hotel from 3/May to 10/May.

Though we could not spend more time in the hotel due to our busy schedule in and around London, we really enjoyed our stay. 

Especially, the location of yr hotel is  excellent as we could walk around easily for our sight seeing  to  most London attractions around yr hotel.

We also felt at home by the very good and cordial hospitality extended by your front office staff, especially we need to point out the name of Mr.Anubhav Rana, who with his warm approach quite impressed us.

Still one thing I'd like to address here is that we felt the rooms we stayed in (# 281 and 282) had become old and may need some renovation at the earliest. 
This may be so as we compare the room ambiences with other Taj properties in India..

Sorry for our frank comments.

Yet we'd like to stay in yr hotel on our next visit , maybe in Oct'15

121,Top hotel in London,This is one of the best hotels in London. Very good service in the reception and the rooms are excellent. Good foof and wine in the restaurant. Location one of the best if you want to see London. Top service overall!,5,2015,05,16
121,Never lets me down!,"Comfortable, efficient and creates some peace amongst the hustle and bustle of London! Staff always helpful and the concierge knows a little more than most! Good choice of restaurants on site too. Always my first choice of hotel in London.",5,2015,05,16
121,C. Owen,Stayed here during the London marathon weekend with my Mum. We try and stay here every year due to the hotel's location as it's very well situated to go and watch and support those running in the marathon. Lovely hotel and attentive staff. We requested to stay in the same room as we stayed in last year due to it being a spacious room and our wishes were fulfilled. Great stay and lovely breakfast. Lovely hotel.,5,2015,05,14
121,Consistently excellent service,"I often stay at this hotel for business and recommend it for business or personal travel. In addition to its location, the personal attention and generally high quality of service makes staying here a delight.",4,2015,05,14
121,A day in london,"We visited London for a day staying overnight at the A Taj what a lovely hotel 
On arrival greeted by the very friendly and helpful staff booking in was swift and we got into the room early
The room was well appointed with a mini bar and tea and coffee facilities
We had a busy day and evening so it was nice to have a really comfortable bed 
Breakfast in the morning was good nice choice and good service again really friendly and helpful
The hotel is ideally situated 7 mins from Buckingham palace and a short stroll to St James park tube station
Really good hotel in an ideal situation and the staff are its major asset 
Well done all and thanks for a great stay ",5,2015,05,14
121,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location",This hotel is in a superb location for a visit to London. Friendly and clean with great staff.  Not the cheapest we found but well worth the extra amount.  I have to have a gluten and wheat free diet and this was accommodated without any fuss.  Infact when I asked for gluten/wheat free bread they told me about other food items the had.,5,2015,05,14
121,Superb hotel,"I have stayed here on business three times so far (more bookings are pencilled in) and each time I have really enjoyed my stay. The welcome is courteous and friendly, the staff are helpful, and the old-fashioned feel of the place adds to its charm. It isn't one of those impersonal, modern hotels where you just feel like you're on a conveyor belt. The rooms I've been allocated have all been a good size, especially for London. The location is really handy for lots of places if you're here on holiday as well. I thoroughly recommend this place.",5,2015,05,14
121,unbeatable price/comfort/location package,"The standard of service, location, and hotel rooms is second to none in London. This was my 3rd stay in the Hotel and the front desk staff are the most attentive and friendly I have seen in many hotels around the world. The free Wifi access in the room is fast enough. The Gym although not the largest, has very good equipment and is also free of charge.",5,2015,05,14
121,Taj stay,The hotel is in a really good location to explore the sights that london has to offer. hotel has excellent and very welcoming service.  The executive rooms on the 3rd floor over look with courtyard and are excellent with very comfortable beds and very spacious.,5,2015,05,14
121,"Great location, Great Food, Great public areas.....","See title for main review, cannot fault this hotel in all the above, however, we got a great 'london' price for our room and were excited to be staying in such 'swish' premises, sadly the same cannot be attributed to our very tired room.  We didn't challenge this as the main reception was extremely busy, and whilst the room was tired and dated (but very clean!), we had got this fantastic price and felt perhaps rooms were allocated to guests who thought they had got a 'bargain'.... lesson learnt perhaps.... not everything that glistens is gold.... you do get what you pay for!  Back to title, it was GREAT, just disappointing not to be one of the fabulous rooms on their web site....",4,2015,05,14
121,The staff are everything,"The quality of a hotel is worthless if the staff are no good. But at St James Court the staff are beyond exceptional.  The food was also exceptional and the portion size was perfect for me.  It is just the shame the hotel lounge bar closes so early, it made socialising with colleagues not quite as much fun.",5,2015,05,14
121,the tube is noisy,"lovely hotel, nice people but a lot of rooms with noise from the tube.  i have been twice and had to move twice. This time I tried to ensure (by ringing in advance and checking at check in) a non train affected room but still got one and had to move.",3,2015,05,14
121,Recommended,"Great hotel, perfect location for exploring central London on foot. Friendly staff and very helpful. We stayed for one night and couldn't fault it at all. Decent pub at the end of the road and a very reasonable cafe almost opposite.",5,2015,05,14

121,Quick London Stay,Stayed here in early May with my cousin for a couple of nights and we had a great stay.  Originally we had a King room which we asked to be made into a twin and the change was made so quickly the housekeeper was actually putting together the new beds before we even got up there.  The staff was very friendly and the location was very convenient to everything.  Would stay here again.,4,2015,05,13
121,Highly recommend this fabulous hotel!,"The location was excellent, and the staff were very attentive.  I was upgraded on check in because they said it wasn't full.  The décor was really luxurious and the room, or should I say suite, overlooked the courtyard fountain. I intend to stay here again and can't help telling everyone else to as well.  You won't be disappointed and simply must stay here for the Taj experience. ",5,2015,05,12
121,Nothing is too much trouble ,"I have stayed at St James several times for work and am consistently impressed by their staff; customer service, breakfast offering, gym and beds... Not to mention the setting is lovely and round the corner for all tourist attractions as well as being in the middle of St James/Westminster for work as well. Love it and can't wait to visit again soon!",5,2015,05,11
121,Excellent location,"Stayed here in April, friendly staff, room small but clean, only fault was we had the steak sandwich which was fatty and sent back, this was taken of our bill with no fuss. Close to theaters and walking distance to all major locations however tube station round the corner. Would defiantly stay again.",5,2015,05,11
121,Exactly what was expected,"on this occasion I just wanted a relatively inexpensive overnight stay, which was clean and comfortable and I got exactly what I expected. For the money paid it was not a disappointment, the room was a little tired in terms of decor. The wallpaper was at the outer edge of needing replacing and the bathroom was dated, but again it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bottom line is that you get what you pay for and I am sure if I wanted to pay more then the room would have been far more salubrious. The staff were lovely; very helpful and the position of the hotel was ideal for what we wanted i.e. A evening meal out with family in soho and a visit to the Kings Road the following day. The walk back from Covent Garden up to Buckingham Palace of an evening is a delight and the walk through Green Park and up Bond Street gets you into the heart of things very quickly so all in all the hotel is ideally situated.  One query; there were a number of those perfumed sticks in oil all over the place....why? They certainly didn't improve my olfactory experience.",4,2015,05,09
121,Unique Hotel in the heart of London,"Great location, booked one of the standard double rooms at the discounted price. The room was pleasant enough although tired round the edges seems they are discounted for a reason possibly waiting for refurbishment. I would have been disappointed to pay full price and the room didn't look like the publicity pictures, granted its the same one for all rooms but misrepresentation in my book. Room 625 is not a room with a view and maintenance need to take a closer look at the electrical outlet sockets as they crackle when used. The TV system is overkill and the menu drive interface so common in hotels is so slow I gave up. No fan in the bathroom and you are advised to close the door when using the shower to avoid setting of the smoke alarm. On a plus note the price is low for such a grand hotel in the hearty of the city and no a bad size to boot. I would go back but this time invest in a upgrade.",3,2015,05,08
121,Great 12-Night Stay for the London Marathon,"I had a really enjoyable and satisfying stay at the St. James’ Court Hotel for the London Marathon.  I had bought the race entry/hotel package through Marathon Tours and had extended my stay.  A daily buffet breakfast was also included.

The hotel service was very impressive.  My room, 529, was quite spacious and very quiet.  Room had a mini bar fridge which had extra room to place additional drinks/food items.  The in-room safe was the standard 4-digit code hotel safe and was at a decent level in the closet.  There was even an electrical outlet at the desk that fits North American devices without a need for an adapter.  Free wi-fi in the room was available.  Daily complimentary chocolate and water came with housekeeping.

The large selection buffet breakfast was a great way to start the day and was available starting at 6 am.  On marathon race day, the buffet breakfast was available at 5 am.  There was even a special dinner buffet on the eve of the marathon that was very good.  The marathon finish line was quite close to the hotel.

The business centre on the ground floor has three computers linked to a printer available for use.  The nearest Underground station is St. James’ Park and is only a few minutes walk away.  Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament are within easy walking distance.  The hotel restaurants were very good.",5,2015,05,07
121,A charming hotel near Buckingam Palace,"My stay at St James Court Taj Hotel was absolutely fantastc. The ""old English"" atmosphere, the courtesy of the staff makes this hotel a unique place where stay.  It is in  the heart of London, few metrrs from Buckingam Palace and St James Park, in one of the most elegant quartier of the City.",5,2015,05,06
121,Great London Hotel,Had a brilliant stay at St James'. A very elegant hotel near to Buckingham Palace that also boasts the UK's longest bar. The room was very comfortable and the view overlooking the courtyard was very unique in London. I'd recommend this to anyone wishing to stay in this area of the city. ,4,2015,05,06
121,Poor Service!,"Check in was very slow. £50 had to be paid from my credit card at check in. This is Hotel Policy, I've never encountered it before.It was returned 3 days later but I lost out on exchange rate. I had booked a twin room but the room assigned had a double bed. It took 4 phone calls to Housekeeping for a fold up bed (most uncomfortable) to arrive. Breakfast was chaotic, long wait for buffet to be replenished.",2,2015,05,05

121,Comfortable and modern ,"Friendly staff at the hotel reception, was checked in by Isabelle who was really nice and welcoming and while checking out, Anubhav made sure everything had went well! It's a great location and a modern interior, the only negatives of the hotel as the long walk to the room from the lobby, it could literally take you 6 min to reach your room, it's kind of a maze to get to your room. 
An overall good experience ",4,2015,05,04
121,Mediocre service at st James court hotel,"My boyfriend and I went to book a room very late in the morning (3rd of May around 4am) as we had a party with friends and it was too late to go back to Surrey.
Upon check in we have been given a room which is was great. The service was quick and efficient. Arriving to the room we called to ask two dental kits that we never received. Called a second time to ask for 5S charger that they never sent to the room. I had to call a third time to ask for the charger and the answer was : of sorry we don't borrow charger: bring it to the reception we will charge it for you. Very unprofessional and rude service. 
Its sad to realise that the service is different depending of the guest... I didn't like my stay at this hotel and will never stay!",1,2015,05,03
121,Great London Hotel,"Located just minutes from Buckingham Palace and Liverpool St Station, a little gem in the heart of London.  A very nice hotel with very professional, friendly and courteous staff.  I would recommend this hotel to any traveller in London.",5,2015,05,03
121,better management ideal location,stayed here second time in past few years and a tad sad that the management could have been a bit well oiled. of course the signature taj management is changing fast i hear from india but yet not swift enough to respond to requests. the bar is lovely and my favourite though and the location wins over in heart of london steps away from marble arch. would be back in june this year and hope to see changes ,3,2015,05,02
121,One day in London,"I recently traveled to London for the fist time. Though my travel was work related and outside of London, on a Saturday I took the train and spent one night. I was fortunate to have a friend recommend the St. James Court. Though a bit outside my budget, it was worth every pound. The hotel has a good location, close to Westminster Abby, Buckingham Palace and the St. James Park. It's a very impressive building with a beautiful court yard. The staff was welcoming and friendLy. Though my room was far from the elevators, it was worth the ""maze like"" walk. The room was small, but what it lacked in size, it made up with comfort, lovely decor, soft bed, and a marbled bathroom. I had no view, but that's what you get for the price. The lobby has a nice bar with the traditional tea time and a lovely selection of cocktails. I highly recommend the splurge.",5,2015,05,02
121,"Central and quiet location, good value","the rooms we got (281 & 282) were a tired and they didn't feel to be really clean, although there's not much to complain as everything was working well, the beds and linen were very comfortable
the food in both restaurants and in the bar was of excellent quality - one complain here: when you get the check you should know that the hotel will ad later on the 12.5% service charge on your bill. I was left with the impresison (and the bar check looks like this) that gratuity was not included so I happily added 15% on top of the sum for the good service..and discovered later on an additional charge of 12.5% at check-out, that wasn't nice! 
if the breakfast is not included no need to book it, it's average - better options across the road available
environment is not priority number 1 at this hotel: towels are replaced every day despite hanging them on the hook for a second use, the toilet flushing wastes an incredible amount of water every time you use it and the windows leak on evey corner so there's no need tovent the room - I'm not an ecologist at all but I was puzzled by this facts this time, a pity!",4,2015,05,02
121,Perfect location,"Booked this hotel for a show we were going to see at the Coliseum and close to Victoria. Didn't feel like we were in central London as quiet room. Upgraded us to an executive king room when we got there for free! Great service, 3 bars to choose from in the evening after returning from the show. Walked into covent garden and easy direct bus route back of an evening. Gorgeous room and bathroom. Spacious, CLEAN. Perfect for our one night stay. Great location and fab service. Would recommend whole heartedly and will definitely return.",5,2015,05,01
121,A pricey pleasure,"I stayed at the Taj on Wednesday evening and had a lovely experience. The hotel is always immaculate, the staff friendly and the rooms comfortable and clean. My only criticism is that iris very expensive. I would stay again and would recommend it to anyone. ",4,2015,05,01
121,Nice hotel,"I stayed here using my Delta miles for one night.  No idea how much the hotel costs so not sure of value for money.

Anyway my room was spacious.  Largest hotel room I have ever had in London and almost as big as my last flat here. But the bed and pillows were hard, which is a personal preference, so I did not sleep well.  The bathroom is also spacious and I liked their toiletries.  My windows opened which was nice at night.  I didn't try any food but I have used their spa in the past and liked it.  Check in was quick and friendly.  On my way to check out now.  The location is fantastic as well.",4,2015,05,01
121,Excellent,"Excellent with indo continental culture. A business hotel, clean, efficient , centrally located and a most secured place for stay with indo continental cousins.

121,"Amazing, friendly, and helpful","I went here on the 29th of april for 1 night with my girlfriend. As soon as we arrived the service was amazing, door been held open and having our bags taken for us, every member of staff welcoming us in saying hello with a smile. At the reception we were told our room wasnt quite ready yet but they'd give us a call when it was and we were welcome to leave our bags which would be taken to the room.  The room itself was great too, no dirt a large comfortable bed with a view looking out onto the beautiful courtyard. Later on when we wanted to look for a place to eat we asked the concierge where is a good place to eat as we were looking for some place up market as it was my girlfriends birthday. He made us a reservation at the greenroom which was a 2 star Michelin restaurant with the best food ive ever tasted. The sleep we had was the best ive had in ages, and as we were leaving the same concierge was on , he remembered us and asked us how the meal was. And right before we left he said happy birthday again. Ive never stayed at a more helpful and friendly hotel. I will definitely be going back next time im in London. ",5,2015,04,30
121,Business trip in London,"Excellent location and great service, I had the pleasure to stay on a business trip and I would come back to this hotel again for sure!
There should be one Anubhav in every high class hotel.. Thank you Anubhav!",5,2015,04,30
121,Gracious and friendly,"The best part is the location. A stone throw away from Buckingham Palace,  this hotel has the grace of a palace. The reception is handled by friendly staff. The lobby has good seating and the concierge desk is very helpful. 

The rooms are comfortable and well designed. The hotel has very good conference rooms also. 

Breakfast is a dream with excellent service. Try and go early for breakfast on weekends as the queue may get pretty long later. The poached eggs are a delight.

Quilon is a restaurant serving south and west Indian food. The room service also serves dishes from Quilon. 

The two drawbacks I noticed were: 
(1) There are no house phones on the lobby level. One has to go to the reception to call a room, which is inconvenient if there is a rush. (Hint: Request and use the cordless phone kept at the bar), 
(2) Only two small bottles of water were kept in the room. Really painful if you get up thirsty in the night.

Overall a great place to stay. 
",4,2015,04,29
121,Disappointing check-in experience,"I booked an executive double through the hotel website for 2 nights arriving April 24.

I know this was the London Marathon weekend, but when we arrived, it was obvious there was a problem with our reservation. It took 20 minutes with no queue to check-in. The girl at the front desk looked flustered.  We got our key and we discovered it was a smoking floor.  We didn't even enter the room as the whole place stank of cigarettes.  I did not book a smoking room and never would.  The excuse was fully booked and Marathon week-end.  If on booking the website said smoking rooms only, I would have gone somewhere else.  We booked the Taj because we stayed at the Pierre New York.  I expected a similar experience.  It is the worst check-in experience of my life.  We did get an upper floor executive room eventually with a view of a brick wall.  The whole experience has put me off Taj.  

The hotel is nice, the restaurant is nice, the bar is nice, the reception staff are crap. Not even sure they could understand English as a first language.  I will not stay here again, ever.",2,2015,04,29
121,Trip to london with stay,"Booked and stayed at this hotel for a night on Monday , reception was very helpful and polite on arrival and throughout stay , was always happy to say have a nice night or day when passing if they weren't busy serving. Hotel was first class and nothing to much trouble, all staff I couldn't fault. Room was spacious and of a good standard but I was in the refurbished floor, which I asked for. Breakfast was very good and I think this hotel is not far of 5 star in my  mind. Location was spot on for shopping  and other attractions , on leaving hotel and paying duty manager Antonio Piccoli was very helpful and gave us his card In case he could help in future visits to london which I thought was very nice . Highly recommend this hotel",5,2015,04,29
121,"Amazing hotel, great experience","I recently stayed at the Taj Hotel, St James's Park, London.  The hotel is beautiful with the most amazing lounge area to relax in.  Both food and service was excellent and would recommend this hotel to anyone.  My only regret was, staying on company business did not allow me to enjoy more time in the hotel!",5,2015,04,29
121,Boat Race,"I only stayed for one evening room only, was a very nice hotel with easy access to the tube, I had a discounted room which made it affordable, however I think breakfast at £24.50 is a little OTT but for this class of hotel probably the norm.",4,2015,04,28
121,Perfect place to stay for a London break,"Perfect location, 2 minute walk from the palace short taxi ride into main shopping attractions & west end shows.

Rooms were surprisingly large especially baring in mind of where you are in London (we stayed in a classic king room) Hotel reception & bars were gorgeous a really nice hotel without breaking the bank.

Breakfast... Was very impressive with lovely full English, cereals, pastries, fresh fruits and yoghurt... well worth the money!

Would return here for sure on next London break.",5,2015,04,28
121,Our First Stay,"Our expectations were too little for the service that was provided. We have never experienced such a stay anywhere, it was amazing and saddening that we had to leave, we will most definitely be coming back, we look forward to trying our your other packages like afternoon tea, vintage car experiences and so on.  Everyone must experience the Taj before they die!",5,2015,04,28
121,St James Court is a great place to stay.,Great Hotel. Team takes care of guests very well. You don't miss home at all while in London!! Strategically located. Good value for money. Quilon is a great restaurant with Chef Sriram turning out excellent food.,5,2015,04,28
121,Home to a Traditional 5 Star Hotel with a touch of Eastern Spice!,"What an experience, everyone was so caring, nothing was too much trouble, everything we asked for appeared within minutes, would recommend the Golden Afternoon Tea Service. As it was the week before Easter, the floral decoration in Reception was beautiful. Well situated for the London Experience!",5,2015,04,28
121,Has everything you are looking for!,"Great location, beautiful property, warm hospitality, stylish rooms, excellent breakfast (with Indian options), fancy bar! What else does one need!   Quilon, their Michelin-star restaurant is another highlight of this Hotel.   Highly recommended!",5,2015,04,28
121,uncomfortable experience,"we booked the hotel for 2 nights as a vacation getaway in London and for the 3 days we stayed in the hotel we have not been able to sleep properly since the bed was too small and not comfortable  the bath tub was not clean properly, we have been missing clean towels that took too long to replace and the room had a wired marijuana smell we can to be pampered and hope to get exceptional service by the hotel, but were sadly disappointed when asked for a late check-in  (2-3 hours extension) free of charge we were denied  in general, it felt like no extra effort was done to try and make us feel comfortable during our stay even-though we specifically mentioned during the reservation time that we are coming to celebrate a special occasion and expected nothing but the most special great experience",3,2015,04,28
121,very  good hotel,I have been using this hotel regularly for 25 years everything is just perfect I highly recommend it be it for business or leisure everything is easy access and the location is nevertheless very quiet,5,2015,04,28
121,A Special Weekend in London,I found this hotel via laterooms in December 2014 and have now been twice. The quality is excellent the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The quality of the food in the Bank restaurant is excellent. It is very well placed to explore the sights and theatres etc. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you are prepared to pay a little extra for quality this is for you. Very reasonable cost for what you get.,5,2015,04,27
121,London vist,Very friendly helpful staff. Great location. I would recommend this hotel as the place to stay in London. Most sites within walking distance. Close to tube station when needed. Palace and park only a block away.,5,2015,04,27
121,Home away from home,The Jt James' Hotel is a hotel with tradition. This being said: it is in no way stiff and distant. The Friendly atmosphere and staff and the hotel itself invite you to spend the evenings in the hotel itself.  A place to remeber.,5,2015,04,27
121,Excellent,"For our first time in London , it was truly a pleasure to stay at the St. James Court . The lobby is really fantastic , the rooms tidy and spotless , the staff friendly and professional. The food really unico.Ci will definitely return . Very welcoming .",5,2015,04,27
121,Outstanding,"This hotel is outstanding value for money. The room was spacious, spotless, modern and very clean and had every modern amenity. Unbelievable at this price. The staff were very friendly. There is also an old world charm to this old London hotel. I would recommend it highly and will be back for sure.",5,2015,04,27
121,Great Location!,"The staff is friendly and very helpful. The hotel is gorgeous. The food is good, too, if you choose to dine inside. (But you should explore London!) The location is great - within walking distance of several tourists attractions, like Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, etc. It is also very close to the Tube (or subway) which is very easy to navigate.",5,2015,04,27
121,Great Hotel,"Close to many atractions and right around the corner from the tube. Fee free ATM across the way. Good location, superb service. i'd reccomend this hotel. Food at the restarant was good. We had trouble selecting a location but this locations turned out to be great.",5,2015,04,27
121,Can't do better,"The hotel can't be better situated, 2 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and all the amenities of the area.  Built around a square just of the road, the quadrangle is charming with its terracotta tiles telling tales from Shakespeare.  Couple this with staff achieving the very high standards of the Taj group and prices reasonable for the area, you really can't go wrong here.",5,2015,04,27
121,Excellent place to stay,"clean, quiet, nice employees with the ""perfect"" expected behavior in this hotel category very close to Buckingham palace the room are spacious and the environement is quiet all amenities are allready in the room perfect for a business trip or during the week end with the rest of the familly!",5,2015,04,26
121,"Excellent hotel, superb customer service!","This was a fantastic stay and we would highly recommend this to others.  The location was excellent, just a few blocks away from all major attractions.  The Michelin star Indian restaurant on-site, Quilon, was really good.  We dined there several times and can't wait to go back.  Our room was nice and clean, although it's an older hotel that has lots of charm and character.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  If you need anything, ask for Benson, who went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and special.  He recommended a few really good restaurants and afternoon tea options, which we enjoyed.  He also told us about the Taj innercircle membership, which gives you 15-20% off discount on food and spa services at the hotel.  Overall, this was a great experience for us and we have high standards and expectations, which were not only met but were exceeded.",5,2015,04,26
121,Honeymoon,"Definitely one of the best hotels we have visited and definitely would go back again the staff that was dealing with us where really helpful and friendly and help us find the theatre we wanted to go to also the complimentary buffet breakfast in morning was really nice as well.
 ",5,2015,04,26
121,Felt unwelcome but very clean,"Felt slightly unwelcome even though we were paying customers, by security staff , on the other hand reception were out standing very polite and couldn't do enough to make are stay enjoyable. An extremely clean hotel standards extremely high. Beautiful hotel lovely modern rooms .",3,2015,04,25
121,Very well equiped!,"I rarely give hotels 5 stars, especially ones that don't have a pool but I really loved this place. I was lucky enough to stay as my husband was a guest speaker at a nearby conference so it was paid for.  

I've found in recent years that even good hotels are starting to scrimp on items in the room.  Not the St James'.  They have every toiletry you could need, good quality as well.  Plus a card saying other items can be provided upon request.  I use face clothes and they are like hens teeth these days, but not here.  There were also robes and slippers and free bottled water.  The bathroom was great, with a deep bath and a super illuminated magnifying mirror - great when you need to put your makeup on and your eyesight isn't that great anymore.  Generous bed which was comfortable.  Despite the central location the room was very quiet indeed (floor 4)

I really like the décor of the corridors, very pale colours unlike the normal dingy hotel ones.  There is a wonderful courtyard with fountain, plants and seating which is a really bonus for a city centre location.  The staff could not be faulted.  Everyone had a smile on their faces and greeted you enthusiastically.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.

I'm very picky about breakfasts and generally moan about the quality of the orange juice.  Even decent hotels tend to buy the cheapest value product they can find but the orange here was lovely and if not freshly squeezed then clearly a quality product.  Great to have both iced water and lovely hot chocolate on tap.

My only slight criticisms are that they only seem to have one lounge area, just beyond the lobby which can get extremely noisy.  And I believe their piano player must know where the bodies are buried because his playing was actually quite unpleasant with tunes that were too raucous and not identifiable.  A nice quiet lounge would have been a bonus.

But all in all a wonderful place to stay within a stone's throw of Victoria Station, and Parliament with a stand of Boris bikes directly outside.  From what I believe the room rates seem to be very reasonable as well bearing in mind the location and would certainly stay here again at the drop of a hat!

I ate at the Bank restaurant one night which I don't believe is actually part of the hotel.  It was reasonable, nothing to write home about but for £40 a head was OK for where it was.

All in all, can only praise the St James and hope they continue maintaining this standard.",5,2015,04,24
121,Lovely!,This hotel was lovely. It was in a great location and very easy to get around. The hotel was very clean and I loved my stay. I also had to change a few details with my booking before I went. The hotel staff responded to me promptly and were always very accommodating. I would not hesitate to stay their again.,5,2015,04,24
121,Excellent property in a great location!,"Great location,  close to many of the attractions on foot.  Underground station is a few minutes walk away. The hotel is well appointed and the suite we stayed in was excellent.  The hotel staff are exceptionally pleasant and efficient.   House keeping have the rooms immaculate.  The court yard is a great outdoor space for a drink.  Would highly recommend the St James Court.  Its an excellent hotel and can be much better value than other hotels of this class.",5,2015,04,21
121,Really a 4 star hotel?,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my familiy. A total of 6 persons. Not my choice of hotel and I will definately not choose it for my next visit to London. Although close proximity to Victoria station and Buchingham Palace, this is most likely a business type hotel. Overprized definately. Fairly small rooms, and if you are interested in what people in the next door room are talking about, you will not have problem doing so. Not what I expect from a 4 star hotel. Old building which probably explains why it is like this. Bathrooms was okay. Staff very polite and always on top of the situation. Thankfully the weather was very good, so you did not have to spend to much time in the hotel. The staff is the only reason I will hand this hotel a 3 star rating. Clean rooms and always polite. That still do matter.",3,2015,04,20
121,Nice Hotel with a few snags,Stayed one night as my son was visiting a nearby university. Room was small but clean. Service was polite and attentive. I was given a room on the 8th floor overlooking the courtyard fountain. Only problem was the fountain was not working although the weather was 23 degrees. My nightstand drawer was inoperable because strangely the drawer was used as a light switch. Both bath robes and slippers were junior size so could not use. The closet doubled as a coffee/tea prep area but the room refrigerator which was also squeezed into the closet was so small the choice of beverages was extremely limited. In general the hotel was nice but room layout could be better thought of.,4,2015,04,17
121,Stylish Hotel with very friendly staff,The St. James' Court Hotel is a very nice traditional place which has recently been taken over by new owners that have done a good job in improving this hotel. Even though I had a quite small room in a floor which has obviously not yet been refurbished I enjoyed the stay. All staff members are extremely friendly (Isabella from the reception and Daniel outside) and made my stay a very pleasant one. A good place to come back!,5,2015,04,17
121,Good size room,"Booked this hotel for one night. Locations is really good for all the main attractions. Room was lovely size, decent size bathroom nice bath and heated towl rail. Lovely walk to either Westmister Abbey and Bukigham palace. The staff were friendly and professional at all times. They were helpful.",4,2015,04,16
121,Business and pleasure,"Have used this hotel on 4 occasions, primarily for business but also for pleasure. 
In general a high service level although often gets busy at reception and concierge. Good location, great for a run or stroll in St James Park. Shops and restaurants within walking distance or  a short taxi ride away. The breakfast is a vast buffet which also caters for the many Indian guests. the courtyard and bars can give a great backdrop for business or a romantic rendezvous.

121,Perfectly located for business trips and tourists.,"I stayed at this hotel for business 2 nights in April, room number 216.

The lobby of the hotel is fantastic and check in flawless, Michaela was so helpful explaining different aspects and features of the hotel, I was really welcomed and made to feel at home.

I ate the first night in the bar area which was very comfortable and if you are looking for an informal bite to eat, perfect. All the staff in this area were also exceptional.

For me the staff really excelled and delivered a five star service.

My room was large with a king bed and more than enough room for my luggage etc. the only niggle would be the bathrooms and the lack of any view from the window.

There is a great choice at breakfast plenty of different options hot and cold, all well cooked and tasty.

The location is excellent a short stroll to Buckingham palace and well placed for Victoria station, I would certainly return.",4,2015,04,14
121,Excellent customer service and good value by London standards,"We had stayed here previously when it was a Crown Plaza.  The new management have clearly spent time/money on staff training as the service was excellent.  The room was newly decorated and immaculate.  This hotel is rated at 4* but is better than some 5*.
The only downside was the breakfast - very expensive for what it was.  Plenty of staff on duty at breakfast but no organization evident...chaotic!",5,2015,04,13
121,Very nice hotel in the heart of London,"Set in a beautiful building, only 5 minutes away from Buckingham Palace, the St. James' Court is a great hotel for London tourists. As expected from an old London hotel, the rooms are not huge, but completely sufficient. The staff were very professional and very helpful and I'd absolutely recommend this hotel to London tourists!",4,2015,04,12
121,Fantastic hotel and excellent staff,"We have stayed at the hotel several times as it is a great standard of accommodation with excellent staff. They always greet you and smile and say hello whether it be housekeeping staff or management. Reception staff so helpful and will do their best to accommodate any special requests regarding the room.
Rooms are spacious and have beautiful furnishings and spacious bathrooms. 
Breakfast is a good choice and waiting staff very attentive.
Would have no hesitation in recommending hotel. It is excellent for exploring the sights, Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament, Museums, Harrods and Hyde Park.",5,2015,04,10
121,"Big hotel, Small rooms, Nice Service","I was expecting something special for booking a Taj. The location was close to underground & Buckingham Palace. Though the entry was commendable, it took me some time to check in due to system issue. the hotel is quite big & i had to walk through hundreds of rooms to get to my abode. The room was quite small & the view was also disappointing. However, the service was splendid. I forgot my car keys in the room, which was informed to me by hotel staff through an e-mail.",4,2015,04,10
121,Excellent hotel in prime area of London,"St James' Court Hotel in traditional Taj fashion is a very good stay.

The rooms are of decent size and well kept - with minibar, safe and plenty of on-site facilities.

Complimentary wifi is an important plus and ideal for business. The location also makes this very accessible for central London with Victoria and St James a brief walk away.

The hotel has a variety of dining options for each palate. The breakfast is of good quality although served in a 'buffet' style.

A fairly peaceful place, the ability to work in the hotel room or get a good night sleep was not spoilt by screaming children or party-goers which is definitely a plus.

The price is very reasonable, lots of corporate rates available which is handy for the business trip in - I did also notice the Taj membership which is worth considering for the business person that requires a London stay now and again.

Staff were very friendly and courteous.

A very pleasant stay.",5,2015,04,10
121,A superb hotel,"i was taken here by my girlfriend for a two night stay whilst visiting London. The hotel itself is very well situated for a lot of attractions, quite a few are within walking distance. It's in a reasonably quiet location for London and we were not disturbed by any noise at all. The staff are all very friendly and attentive, you didn't have to wait or have to ask twice for anything. The breakfast was very substantial with a great choice. The room was well laid out and very clean and tidy. The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is down to the shower! Whilst the bathroom was spotless and roomy the shower was quite poor. It had very little pressure and was a little hard work. Other than this it was perfect. ",4,2015,04,10
121,A superb hotel in a superb location,"Stunning hotel matched by the excellent standard and attitude of their staff. They consistently went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, and were polite and knowledgeable. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and the room was spacious and comfortable. As other reviewers have said, the room provided all the equipment you might need - hairdryers, ironing board etc - and was very quiet given its location. We both slept very well and were offered a complimentary newspaper in the morning. We were staying one night for my Wife's birthday (went to see a musical at the Apollo) and the hotel suprised us with a little birthday cake for her, which was a lovely touch. The next day the hotel let us stash our bags whilst we explored the local area, which is easy as everything seems to be a 20 minute walk from Victoria! Overall I thought it excellent value (admittedly we had found a discounted rate online) and wouldnt hesitate to stay there again.",5,2015,04,09
121,Royal Afternoon Tea,"My mother and I visited the St James Court hotel recently for a belated Mothers Day afternoon tea treat I had booked. This was our first time visiting & having been to quite a few afternoon tea's I can honestly say this one ranks as being one of the best! Upon arrival we were taken directly to our reserved table (very comfortable chairs!) where we then picked our tea choices/drinks before being brought the afternoon tea itself displayed very prettily on a three tiered stand. The selection of cakes and sandwiches were delightful including some very different & tasty combinations. I especially loved the elderflower and strawberry jelly with white chocolate crowns! During the experience we were regularly checked up on by the waitress for any tea top ups & were not rushed at all which I loved.
Overall a fantastic experience and will definitely be booking again!",5,2015,04,09
121,Fantastic Hotel & location,"A nice room, great hotel, fantastic location. We stayed over the weekend which was an advantage for parking on the street outside. Walking distance to many attractions, or hire a bike from across the road.
              
              ",4,2015,04,08
121,Outstanding,"Once again this hotel has exceeded my expectations. My partner and I stayed for one night on Easter Sunday in an Executive Suite. 

The room is excellent, very spacious and the bed is very comfy. The quality of sleep was very good with no noise or disturbances. 

Upon arrival, after checking-in early, we found an Easter Egg and Cookie in our room, with the cookie specially designed for myself. It was a special touch. 

The location is excellent, we enjoyed the short walk to Buckingham Palace and the tube is just a few minutes walk. 

The room provided all additional amenities including a hairdryer that I required. We also forgot toothpaste which the Receptionist provided promptly. The fitness facilities were good too to help burn off the cookie and egg!!  

We left our luggage in the Hotel whilst shopping on our check-out date which saved a lot of hassle. 

I will be back in no time at all when we enjoy our next stay in London.",5,2015,04,08
121,Great location,"I've stayed here several times when it was a Crowne Plaza. It was nice to see that Taj had retained the previous good qualities.
The Executive room was perfectly clean and comfortable with a large bathroom and very nice toiletries.
I used room service (consistently good), and The Hamptons bar to eat. The food in the Hamptons is very good with a more varied menu than most bars. The bar service is friendly but it's not always easy to attract staff attention. On one occasion, with 3 staff and 3 tables of customers I had to go to the bar to ask for service. 
Love the live weekend jazz music in the foyer.
Unless breakfast is included in your room rate, I would recommend using the excellent Royal Quarter Café opposite. It was full of Taj guests every morning! I'm not a very big eater and couldn't justify a breakfast rate of about £25 p.p. at the hotel.
I would probably stay here again. The location is perfect and the hotel is generally lovely but a little sting in the tail at check-out was a bit off-putting. I had pre-paid the room but the express check-out bill included a £208 extra room charge. I expected sorting this out to be a quick deduction and a smiling apology. Sadly, it took 20 minutes of arguing with the reception staff to resolve it.
 Moral of the story - ALWAYS take a paper copy of your confirmation with you. I did, and it took 20 minutes. I suspect it would have been a longer job without it. Ironically, the trainee receptionist -Charlotte? - sorted it out and was a great deal friendlier about it than her supervisor who behaved as though I was trying to get my rate reduced.
I'll probably stay once more to see if this was just a blip, as under the previous management this was my favourite London hotel.",4,2015,04,08
121,Fabulous,"Everything was perfect throughout our 8 days stay at this hotel. Check in / check out was fast and staff very efficient. They gave me upper floor and adjoining rooms which i had requested at the time of booking without even reminding them. I really enjoyed the service of staff at Bistro, they are too good and were always ready to serve us with a smile.

House keeping and room dine-in staff were very helpful and, fast to attend to any request we made. I am really amazed to see that the same high quality guest service is displayed by all the staff of the hotel, without forgetting to mention door man or bell boys.

I simply can not think of anything negative of my stay here. All the best wishes for the wonderful staff!",5,2015,04,07
121,Amazing,Great hotel and great location . Rooms were amazing ( 428 ) . Staff excellent ( Isabella is a credit to you ) . I have already told my friends what a great find this hotel is and I will always try and stay here the next time i visit London,5,2015,04,07
121,Excellent!,"This hotel really meets 5 stars rating. Very large luxurious rooms (Family room), with bedroom and sittingroom part. Excellent breakfast and real English service. The porter was great too. Every part of the hotel exceeded my expectations. Location is in Knightsbridge. Just round THE corner of Buckingham palace. Go there!",5,2015,04,06
121,Excellent ,"No complains at all. 
My sister and I stayed the weekend in feb. 
Absolutely great stay. 
Lively rooms. 
Check in was quick. 
We had a light bite and wine in the bar sat night. Nice ambience. 
Great location. 

I will definitely come back here for my london weekends ",4,2015,04,06
121,Great hotel in the best location,Stayed for one night. Brilliant location. Staff lovely. Would definitely stay again. Bistro 51 very good. Easy to get too Central london sights. Executive rooms above london average. Nice lobby. Quick walk too st james park.,5,2015,04,06
121,Great Stay,"Warm welcome upon arrival, and the atmosphere was great. Although it was someone who was in training when we arrived, check in was still quick. We stayed in a Junior Suite. It was a great room, but the only problem I had was that it was a bath tub shower, rather than a walk in shower. The price we payed for the room, I think it should come as standard. Plus the water pressure wasn't the best.

But it was only a room after all, and much of our time was spent outside.

Last problem was the service of an evening. When all four of us were at the bar ordering cocktail after cocktail, there was a 25 minute wait after each order, and the staff were not very attentive once your glass was empty. The drinks although great tasting, just could of been coming a lot quicker.

The hotel was placed where we really to be, with a tube station handy. Would be staying here again when back.",5,2015,04,06
121,Don't have to research where to stay in London any more!,"We have just returned home after spending a fabulous night at this great hotel. Our reception could not have been more welcoming by a lovely young lady called Lidia she gave us a very nice comfortable room 330. The bed and pillows were so comfortable, we slept like babies! Room/bathroom was exceptionally clean and recently decorated. There was absolutely nothing to fault there at all. We enjoyed several drinks in the Hamptons bar which was a really pleasant place to relax. The staff there were dressed so smartly and couldn't have been more charming and attentive. Breakfast was just wonderful, great choices of good quality foods. I loved the smashing Tarka dhal most of all, hope people didn't notice how much I ate!! We were served by Giujlio who was superb. He made sure we were well looked after and wanted for nothing. Please say a big thank you to him for us! We loved everything about this great Hotel but what did stand out most of all were your staff, there is no question that the Taj Hotel group selects its staff incredibly well, they are the best of the best and that's why your hotels are exceptional. When we next stay in central London I will be staying with you no question about that! Thank you so much.",5,2015,04,05
121,Lovely 2nd stay,"This was our second stay at this hotel. The first time we stayed for four nights in a suite and although it was nice we did have a few issues. This time we booked a standard room but on check in found we had been upgraded to a beautiful room over looking the courtyard. This was a very pleasant surprise and much appreciated. We had breakfast in our room both mornings and it was lovely and arrived at exactly the time we requested. We had drinks in the bar and the service was excellent. My husband has to come to London on business at least three times a year and we both feel that the service, staff and accommodation at this hotel is excellent and we plan to use it for all our visits to London. Many thanks to all the staff",5,2015,04,03
121,Two things prevented excellence,"The hotel easily acheived 5 star service, the reception did a great job on check in and check out and any questions or queries were answered very well.

We had an Executive room, which was an ok size, but (as you can see on tripadvisor room pics) the gap between the bed and the chest of drawers was laughable, the drawers could hardly open, yet the unit was unnecessarily deep. I also agree with the reviewer who took those pictures that the room was not overly warm, but that is how I prefer it so just take it into account if you get the same room (sorry cannot remember the number!). Finally on the room, the water pressure in the shower was very poor.

Even at peak time at the weekend we didn't wait for a table for breakfast and the service and quality of food was excellent.

The location is not ideal as the nearest tube (St James) does not have the best connections. Victoria is about a 10 minute walk.

If you need a hotel in this neighbourhood I would recommend it and I would be more than happy to try other Taj hotels.",4,2015,04,03
121,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, very helpful staff, good service. Location is very good. Very close to Buckingham palace. Part of rooms are renovated and are very nice. In old, not renovated rooms is very cold in winter.",4,2015,04,02
121,Gorgeous Hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the hotel, a few basics went wrong i.e, booked a twin and was asked on check in if I wanted a twin again and when we got to the room several hours later it was a double !! Toilet did not flush (very embarrassing) the service was very good and breakfast superb",4,2015,04,01
121,Overpriced breakfast and very underwhelming,"My husband treated me to a night here on Friday. Service was excellent, room was too hot even with air con but the most disappointing thing was the breakfast. £24.50 ahead, buffet breakfast which was warm and you had to order your eggs with the waitress but we had eaten the breakfast before the eggs arrived. Filter coffee is not nice. For the price I would have expected a made to order breakfast with much more on offer. I would stay at the hotel again but would never eat here again and urge others to look elsewhere for breakfast. ",3,2015,03,30
121,A tale of two hotels,"I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Taj.  The hotel was originally 3 buildings that was combined to make the hotel. With that said, we were first given an old room in the back with much need of a paint job etc but what really made the room awful was that it was adjacent to a huge construction site and an all boys school yard. Can you say noisy???  I ask to be moved and was next given another noisy room in the back but this one was the size I a shoe box, Make a long story short, the final room was a renovated room towards the front of the hotel and they are not only buildings apart but worlds apart. This room was recently renovated with a very nice bathroom much better lighting and electric,  it really  felt like another hotel. The first rooms were below average and the last room was an above average very nice room, (hence the only  average rating) The concierge staff were excellent and very helpful, They have good restaurants in the hotel as well. I would go back but only to stay in a renovated room, Worth the difference in price",3,2015,03,29
121,In the heart of London,"The best thing about this hotel is its location- proximity to Westminster Abbey,  Buckingham palace, St James/Hyde Park, Oxford circus, Piccadily,   etc and its accessibility.  Good sized rooms.  Restaurant (coffee shop) downstairs and the lobby can be a little noisy at times. We stayed in the main hotel but adjacent to the hotel, they have serviced apartments too. Quilon,  a coastal South Indian  fine dining Michelin star rated restaurant is a must do. Busy place - so need to book a table.  ",4,2015,03,29
121,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location for exploring London","I stayed at the St James Court from March 8 - 12, 2015 on a business trip to London, and I would definitely stay again.

The common areas are lovely; the desk in the reception area appears to be onyx and is beautifully back lit to showcase the stone. The front desk staff was helpful, especially sensitive to my desire to get into my room early following an overnight flight, and after only an hour's wait, I did have a room with a nice view of the courtyard.

The rooms themselves are a bit spartan and small, though clean and comfortable - reminded me of New York. That said, the wifi worked well, the staff quickly delivered adapters to my room so that I could charge my phone, and there were Sottish shortbreads for tea, so I have no complaints.

The fitness center was in the building next door, again, rather minimal but more than adequate for a few days stay. There is free coffee and fruit available in the fitness center, which I appreciated; in room coffee would be nice, but this worked well enough once I discovered it, and provided a bit of extra motivation to get a workout.

The real advantage of this hotel is its location. It's a ten minute walk to Westminster Abbey, ten minutes to Buckingham Palace, and a delightful walk across Green Park to access the Piccadilly line; the Circle and District are a five minute walk.  Easy to tour London from this location!",4,2015,03,28
121,Charged Wrong Credit Card,"I went to the St James Court on a business trip. Upon checking in they did not have our corporate card and so I gave my personal credit card as assurance until the office could send them the corporate card details. 

More than 24 hours before check out I verified with the front desk that they had the correct credit card and that the office sent over the correct card, which they had since received. I verified that my personal card would not be charged but rather that my corporate charge would be charged. 

I then checked out via Express Check out (which did not have payment method listed).

Upon checking my personal card, I found posted 2 charges of close to $1000 each for mine and my co workers room.

This is absolutely unacceptable.",1,2015,03,28
121,Nice Hotel & location,"Stayed for one night on business primarily due to proximity of a business meeting.  Nice old-fashioned hotel in a very central location, priced accordingly.  The only meal I had there was breakfast, only because it was part of the room rate.  It was OK but I would not have been too happy paying the advertised £24.50 price.  
Service was good apart from one strange incident that I am still expecting an explanation for.  Having been allocated a room early (around noon), I was grateful to be able to deposit my luggage and freshen up before my afternoon meeting.  Returning to my room around 6:15pm, the keycard would not operate the door.  I know this can happen if the key is placed next to a mobile phone in a pocket, so I trudged the long and winding trail back to reception where they re-programmed my keycard.  It now worked, but when I got into the room, I could not see my suitcase or clothes I had unpacked earlier.  I confirmed that I really was in the room that I had checked into, and telephoned reception.  Five phone calls and one hour later, my luggage was finally brought to my room, having reportedly been found in the health club.  Everything was intact, but I received no explanation of this strange occurrence, even when checking out the following day. No lasting damage, but still a bit disconcerting for a quality hotel group, and to be unable to offer an explanation is inexcusable, especially when there has been a significant security breach in my opinion.
Despite this experience, I would probably return to this hotel in the future.",3,2015,03,27
121,This was a beautiful Hotel.,"This is an upscale hotel Great and helpful staff. when my daughter needed a battery for her insulin pump, they sent a maintenance main to go get her one. Just a few block down from Buckingham Palace and  the tube. 
              
              ",5,2015,03,27
121,Stay at St James Court was excellent,"The St James Court is an excellent hotel, before and after the Taj group took it over. The rooms are spacious, wifi is now free, the staff is helpful and the location is fine. Because it is a large hotel, it has space most months of the year and one can discuss the type of room that suits you. I have been there for several years and it gets better each time.",5,2015,03,27
121,"Outstanding Hotel, Service & Location","Stayed overnight for business. Super close to Buckingham Palace- Short walk. Perfect touring base. Walking distance to Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Harrods, Piccadilly, Hourseguards. Staff are amazing an super friendly. Service is exceptional. Quiet location with fabulous courtyard. Room was well appointed and spotlessly clean. (Be aware of prices for mini bar and in-room food and snacks. A can of coke is £3.50 and a chocolate bar£4.00- nothing in the room is free, including water. In such a nice hotel you would have expected water at least) Multiple restaurants on site. Averagely priced for this part of London. Breakfast is £22.00. Lobby is gorgeous and relaxing. Pianist by the bar. Concierge service is first class and they do it with style! No request is too small. Will definitely stay again. First class!",5,2015,03,27
121,classic british charm,"Classic old style british style, miles away from multinational chain boxes. Excellent service throughout all sections of the hotel. great location in central London close to parks and attractions with nearby tube, train and bus stations. Would be very happy to stay again",5,2015,03,26
121,Good location but beware of tube noise in your room!!,"Stayed here for one night only because of its location to St James' Palace but had two rooms as our older boys were with us.  Sadly our rooms were on different floors but at least we eventually had the room-types of our choosing. 

Wonderful reception area with extremely helpful staff.  Two very nice bars not overpriced (cocktails £5 each late afternoon to early evening!). 

Rooms a little disappointing but perfectly adequate.  Good location for Buckingham Palace, St James' Palace, Westminster etc.  

****The drawback for me was the tube noise in the room throughout the day and into the late night - when I enquired of Reception as to the noise I was told that it is mentioned in their website but I have yet to find this statement!  The trains eventually die down around half past midnight but, if you can sleep through this and it doesn't disturb you, it is a very nice hotel. For this reason and this reason alone I would not chose to stay at the Taj again.*****

The Royal Quarter Cafe just opposite does a very nice breakfast should you choose not to eat in the hotel.",4,2015,03,26
121,Beautiful hotel but  poor TV system and breakfast........................!!!!,"Actually staying at Taj St James for the wkd. The hotel is beautiful without doubt. I have only one bit of advice: at breakfast, if you are told "" dining room is full, sir/madam"", (as it isn't big enough when hotel full booked).......as most weekends!; but we have an overflow facility on first floor..............DONT GO! It is a function room with tables arranged around the outside plus the food isn't warm due to being brought upstairs. On the second morning we arranged to have a table in hotel dining room. That's the way to go.",4,2015,03,25
121,Ideally located hotel,"We stayed at St James Court for two nights. The hotel is ideally situated as it is only a short five minute walk down to Buckingham Palace! As you enter the hotel the concierge soon takes your bags and will leave for you in your room. The hotel has a few restaurants attached that we didn't eat in so cannot pass opinion, the bar in the lobby of the hotel was lovely although service was extremely slow! We waited 25 minutes for our drinks. Our room was lovely and came complete with nice toiletries, it was a very good size. The only complaint would be the construction that was being undertaken on a building next to the hotel, the noise meant we were woken at 7:30 on the Saturday morning. We did not complain to the hotel about this as we understand it is out of their hands although we would have appreciated some warning as it is not what you expect when you are paying nearly £200 per night!! Other than this the hotel's service was pleasant and the hotel is very comfortable for a weekend break in London.",4,2015,03,25
121,Wonderful weekend,"Wonderful hotel offering excellent service.  Staff very friendly, nothing is too much trouble.
Room was spacious and spotlessly clean, it had everything we needed.  Excellent location, perfectly situated for sightseeing and shopping.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again.",5,2015,03,24
121,Very comfy night.,"I was just staying one night on a semi business trip.  I stayed here because it is a Taj Hotel and I had previously stayed at the Taj Mahal in Mumbai which was fabulous.

The St James Court was very comfortable, the bed was great and the room was large even though it was only a classic one.  I had a drink in the bar and the waiter was very friendly and unobtrusively attentive.  I expected polite staff with friendly attention and I got that.  The room was also very quiet which was amazing bearing in mind this is in the heart of London 300 metres/yards from Buckingham Palace in one direction and the Houses of Parliament in the other!

I would not hesitate to come here again next time I need to stay a night in London.",5,2015,03,24
121,Excellent location to explore London,"Wonderful hotel with excellent staff and great atmosphere. The rooms are a bit dated, and the long hallways are challenging, but the staff are friendly and very efficient.
There are many great places to eat within a short walk",4,2015,03,23
121,Even Better!,"We returned a year after our last visit because we were so pleased last time and we were not disappointed.  The position is ideal for a London visit (5 mins walk from Buckingham Palace) yet out of the way enough for a relaxing arrival and departure.  Very convenient for the tube, the staff are courteous and discreet but also efficient.  The rooms very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  As good as any hotel we have ever visited, we are certain to return!",5,2015,03,23
121,Glorious,"We have stayed in the taj hotels in India and this is just as wonderful. Beautiful room, spacious and so comfortable. Great choice of bars and restaurants in the hotel. Lovely courtyard for coffee etc.The staff are quite exceptional. Everyone passes the time of day, smiles, and goes out of their way to be helpful. Excellent quiet location and moments from Buckingham Palace, St James park, Westminster and Victoria. We will definitely be back. ",5,2015,03,23
121,Great stay for a weekend treat,"We decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel whilst on a weekend stay in London. The location is ideal, just down the road from Buckingham Palace and the nearest tube. The staff were super friendly and couldn't do enough for us. we had a classic double room and it was acceptable given we were in central London. It was clean, quiet and very comfortable, if a little on the small side. We had lunch in the Bistro restaurant paying what I consider a lot (£120 for 2 people) and though food was quite nice it didn't blow me away. We ate elsewhere for breakfast. (there are a number of places to eat nearby). All in all we had a really nice stay and would consider using the hotel again.",4,2015,03,22
121,Nimish Swarup,"Outstanding location and attentive staff...the Taj exerience one is used to. The only blemish in the otherwise wonderful stay is the lack of knowledge the staff has on its own Taj Innercircle program.

Inspite of repeated reminders, could not manage to have a newspaper delivered to the room. Was also a little upset that the staff at checkin did not know that gold card members receive a discount on Laundry. Inspite of pointing out, the duty manager- Patricia refused to oblige. When I asked to meet her in person, she suddenly found that indeed there is a discount applicable. She still did not have the courtesy to come out and meet.

A small blip in an otherwise memorable stay!!!",4,2015,03,22
121,"Great gym, reasonable size room, good location for exploring London and friendly service","We were tacking on a few days in London at the end of a business trip. We chose to stay at St James Court as it was central to Westminster,  the parks and tube stations. We fitted a lot in to our 5 day stay . A play, a musical, shopping, dinners out, Camden markets, Hyde Park, St James Park and theTower of London. All were easy to access from this hotel.The room was very reasonable in size, bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was good and overall service was helpful and friendly. We were pleasantly surprised  by the gym. The equipment was really good and helped us work off the good food we were enjoying! My only criticism was  the size of the bathroom and the toiletries in the bathroom were a very limited range and had no vanity kit or the extras we usually find in a good hotel.",4,2015,03,20
121,All in all I would recommend it,"I stayed there twice last month with my husband and daughter. On our first visit we were so happy to find a beautiful spacious room (which I understand in London space in a hotel room is a rarity). It was clean and comfortable and in our daughter's cot was a gift for her! Breakfast spread is good but what stood out the most was that ALL the staff were so friendly and nice. 

The location of the hotel is prime! It's so central to everywhere in the London city area. 

On our second visit we got what seemed to be an older room. The standard was just not the same, furniture and bathroom looked very dated, which was such a disappointment for us. The service was just as good as the first time though. 

All in all I would stay there again and I guess I'd ask for a better room if I ended up in one of the older ones.",4,2015,03,18
121,Nice property with fantastic hospitality,"Whenever i visit london then prefer to stay in this hotel , centrally located, very good service. Over and above two indian restaurants Quilon and Bombay Sapphire. The staff are excellent. In particular the breakfast staff are amongst the most attentive and pleasant I have ever come across, they couldn't do enough for you.I was upgraded on my most recent trip and the room was very comfortable with a complimentary fruit bowl. The hotel is really well located for shopping and sightseeing, but being on business I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy these or any of the many other amenities the hotel had to offer.",5,2015,03,18
121,Classy Hotel,"The St James Court is reasonably well situated in Buckingham Gate, to the side of Buck House. The staff are excellent. In particular the breakfast staff are amongst the most attentive and pleasant I have ever come across, they couldn't do enough for you. If you can't find the food you want at breakfast it doesn't exist. Reception was fast and efficient. Special mention to the doormen - genuinely pleasant and very proficient at getting taxis to the door. We did not have an evening meal at the hotel so cannot comment on that. We booked a Classical double then got an upgrade to an Executive Double on arrival - at checkout the hotel did not charge us for the upgrade even though we had quite happily agreed the extra. All in all, a good hotel for a long weekend visit to the capital.",4,2015,03,17
121,Wonderful stay,"As always we had another wonderful stay at the Taj. I love this hotel. The staff are always friendly , the service  excellent  and the rooms are great. 
Once again the hotel kindly upgraded us which is always well received and the standard of the rooms is always faultless .Thank you Ed x
Its a great location for tourists, with Buckingham Palace (3 minutes  walk) and underground is the same. From there walk across Green Park for nightlife and Piccadilly or along the Mall to The Strand.
Lovely lobby bar with pianist in the evening. A choice of two restaurants which are attached to the hotel.
I haven't posted photos this time , see past stay
Everything for a perfect stay in London !",5,2015,03,17
121,Superb Hotel,"One of the best hotels i`ve stayed in, all of the staff are a credit to this great hotel. I stayed in a executive junior suite ""wow"". Breakfast in the room was superb, recommend to everyone. Thank You for a great stay, i will be back",5,2015,03,15
121,Good business hotel,"I stayed in the St. James court several times. Overall it is a good hotel at high standards, hence nothing to complain.
The few things which are missing for a top score rating are that the bathroom does not have a ventilation. Heating is a bid tricky. Although I like to sleep in a cool room it is getting cold if you turn the air-condition off at night. On the other side the radiator in the bathroom does not have enough power, hence it is a bid chilly in the morning.",4,2015,03,15
121,"Great location, but otherwise unimpressive","I booked a twin room for my Mum and I on a recent one night stay. The location is undeniably great; the hotel is barely a five minute walk from St James' tube and very close to St James' Park and Buckingham Palace. The hotel's exterior and reception area are very impressive on arrival and, despite the lengthy up-selling spiel, check-in was prompt and efficient. However, having paid a hefty rate (room only) I was disappointed to have a mammoth trek through endless corridors, only to be eventually met with a very basic and small room. It was clean, but otherwise disappointing - given the hotel brand, I had higher expectations. Considering the rate we paid, I felt totally ripped off. Breakfast was £20+ which is ludicrous - don't bother, there's plenty of nice cafes to go to in the area. Just before 8am there was loud drilling which, although short lived, woke us both up. I've seen this hotel crop up on many search engine results previously and although I'd read some of the more negative reviews, the positive ones and the quality brand image convinced me it was worth paying a little more for - it really wasn't. There are far nicer hotels to stay at with much greater value for your money so we won't be returning.",2,2015,03,14
121,Lovely centrally located hotel,"I've stayed in this hotel on business on a couple of occasions and it's  somewhere I would return to and recommend. It's reception and communal areas are quite palatial.   I stayed on a room only rate and didn't use the dining facilities. Breakfast was very pricey and formal so I went to one of the local cafes over the road. I was upgraded on my most recent trip and the room was very comfortable with a complimentary fruit bowl. The hotel is really well located for shopping and  sightseeing, but being on business I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy these or any of the many other amenities the hotel had to offer.  Next time perhaps......",4,2015,03,13
121,Comfortable family room,"We were in London in the lead up to Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights at St James Court. My husband is aTaj InnerCircle Gold Member and often stays here for business. On this occasion, we were traveling with our 8-year old twin boys and the hotel kindly allocated a family room to us (thanks Edward Riches for being so helpful!)The family room was very well designed with 2 queen-sized beds and a partially separated sitting area. Having 2 TV sets was such a boon - we could watch our own TV programmes while the kids watched their own. We were most comfortable in the room.

Housekeeping was very responsive. When we found the airconditioning to be weak even on the highest fan setting, a mechanic was in our room within 10 minutes of our call to housekeeping. The only minor criticism of the room is the rather small bathtub, which felt all the more claustrophobic because of the glass panel on the shower side.  

We weren't impressed with our dining experiences at the hotel. We tried the afternoon tea at the hotel, which was a little underwhelming both in terms of taste and the ambiance - we felt rather exposed sitting at the sofa set in the lobby with people staring as they walked past! It didn't fit in with the cosy setting of afternoon tea. We had in-room dining from the Michelin-starred Quilon and we were quite  disappointed - we tried the cauliflower chilli fry and the cottage cheese with soya chunks. We've eaten at Indian restaurants including the various Taj hotels in India and were simply not impressed with the average offerings at Quilon. There's no shortage of cabs right outside the hotel and lots of little cafes/restaurants nearby.

We enjoy the location of the hotel and walking/driving past Buckingham Palace never gets old.",4,2015,03,12
121,Luxurious and comfortable,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for a romantic Valentine's weekend and had a perfect stay! From the moment we even approached the building we were made to feel special, and the lobby which greets you is very grand.
The room was a perfect size for us, not too big, but better than 'cosy' and the bed was incredibly comfortable.
Room service was quick and friendly, they brought us extra towels and were happy to provide toothbrushes and toothpaste when we realised we'd forgotten ours.
The only thing that I had a small issue with was the temperature of the water in the shower in the morning, but more fool me for showering 15 minutes before check-out once the entire hotel had already had their morning wash!
Overall, a fantastic and comfortable stay, and well worth the cost, especially as a one-off treat!",5,2015,03,10
121,Lovely Hotel,Only stayed one night but I loved the atmosphere and I thought it was extremely good value for money. I was on the top floor but had a good sized room with all the usual amenities.  The staff were very helpful and made you feel like you were a VIP.  It is very handy for Victoria Station and I would definitely stay there again,5,2015,03,10
121,Amazing Central London Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel from 1st - 4th Feb 2015 for my 40th birthday. What can I say, this place is fantastic. 
Having stayed at Taj hotel in New Delhi, Agra and Jaipur in India I booked with high expectations. It met all my expectations and exceeded them. 
On arrival we were met by the doorman, who opened our taxi and swiftly helped unload our bags. We received a VERY warm welcome from reception and were checked into our executive master suite. Which was stunning. The bedroom, living room and bathroom were immaculate. There was even a lovely 40th birthday cake from the hotel waiting for us. A very nice touch. The suite really did make us feel at home. 
We drank in the Hamptons bar throughout our stay, the bar manager and staff really looked after us and nothing was too much trouble. We found it very pleasant to sit and relax prior to going to the theatre. 
We ate in Bank restaurant one evening prior to the theatre which was very good with excellent  service.
The breakfast was good, but I am not a fan of hot food being on a buffet. It dries out very quickly. I would love to see the hot food cooked to order. 
I put on twitter how much I was enjoying my stay, the hotel were quick to respond in a very professional manner. I was very impressed that not only was the service immaculate in the hotel but so was the virtual world!!
I can't recommend this hotel enough, we are booking to return for our 5th Civil Partnership anniversary in August. 
The whole hotel looks lovely, especially the lobby area. 
People keep commenting on noise from the tube, we were in many areas of the hotel and did not here the tube once. I don't think it is the big deal that people make out!! Although the lifts are freezing!
Overall though I LOVE this hotel and can't wait to go back. 
Thank you to all the staff that looked after us during our stay.",5,2015,03,09
121,In need of some attention,"Great location, fairly good room-rates but tiny rooms that could do with a lick of paint and are generally not finished to a high standard. I stayed on the executive floor (2nd), although I don't know how it would be different from other floors.

I had an 'executive double room' at 285$ / night which is not excessive for the location but the room was the smallest on the floor (I think it was 218), and apart from the bed a mini desk, there really was no spare room, it was probably something like 6-7 square meters, if that. 

It was pleasantly quite in that corner of the hotel which gave me a good night's rest. The view of the hotel's air conditioning unit completed the feeling that I might well be on the ""executive level"", but left me in no uncertainty that I still had a long way to go as an executive... 

Another positive is that the free WIFI was fast enough for facetime and streaming video, that is probably a first!",3,2015,03,09
121,Expected better,Stayed a week at St James Court / Taj Hotel... good location but the rest was between average and even poor. Room was clean and size was average but bathroom was *extremely* small. The TV they could not get working so I couldnt watch anything for a week and no one apologised. Most of the staff was fairly helpful. Will not come back... sorry,3,2015,03,06
121,Could be so much better - a little underwhelmed,"It looks very impressive from the outside and the hotel reception is rather grand but the room was very basic, small and standard. 

Upon check-in I specifically requested a quiet room because I needed a good night's sleep for an important meeting the next day.

The receptionist was very keen to help and pointed out she had given me one of the quietest rooms on the fifth floor which should be perfect.

I really appreciated that she went out of her way to assist. 

The room itself was small and basic but standard for London hotel rooms. The corridors and rooms do not reflect the grandeur of the exterior or lobby area so do not be fooled when you arrive.

Early next morning I was awoken at 05:30 by loud noises, a crane and the commencement of building work. I looked out of my window and I was directly above a building site opposite. I couldn't believe the receptionist had put me in that room after specifically requesting a quiet room or that she would not have known work was on-going here?

So overall this hotel underwhelmed me after promising so much upon arrival and I was disappointed at the room I was given after requesting the opposite. As an aside, I was told the hotel bar has the longest bar in Europe and I did have to see it - it is very long and impressive and I should imagine at a weekend when it is busy it looks really good.",3,2015,03,06
121,"The Good, The Bad and the Indifferent","I had nostalgic personal reasons for choosing this hotel, having been successful at interview as a young man here in 1991.  This was my first time across the threshold since then and I was immediately reminded of the grandeur of this amazing old building.

So, 24 years on, how did I find things?

The Good - The Hotel is in a superb location, is spotlessly clean, the rooms are well appointed, quiet and spacious with supremely comfortable beds. The complimentary 'Plantation' toiletries are at the highest of 'high ends' and it was fantastic as someone who has an SLS allergy to be able to use those offered for the first time in years. The Doorman and Porters acknowledged and offered help to you in an appropriately discreet and friendly manner.

The Bad - In a word - 'Reception'. Check in was abysmal. We approached the desk as the receptionist fought with her printer and having remained completely unacknowledged for an embarrassing number of minutes  I eventually had to speak first.  She then moved from printer to computer to check the details I had given her. STILL no eye contact, STILL no greeting and by this point, a smile would have shocked more than appeased us.  My partner was blanked throughout the whole process even when her details were requested (from me), which would be just plain rude if you were in checking into a campsite.  Everyone behind the desk seemed edgy and frazzled even though it was anything but busy.

The Indifferent - Maintenance issues.  On check out I handed over a list of issues with the room that really should have been picked up before it was ever offered for occupancy.  From the extraction not working in the bathroom to the booby trapped tea tray - it was lengthy. often comical, but again, not at all acceptable.  Reception on check out (different person) did thank me for my dossier and did tell me that we could have been moved if we had told them.  This however was the whole point. We shouldn't have to 'move'.  We were happy with our room, we were settled in our room and as a lot of the problems were bathroom related we didn't notice them until the morning.  If people were doing their jobs properly, there would be no need to move, moving would be an inconvenience, this was all VERY basic stuff.

So in conclusion, this Grand Old Hotel does show promise and for location and general comfort is comparable with the best.  However, Front Desk Staff need a  a crash course in being pleasant and rooms need to be fit for purpose. Once these basic failings are addressed, the establishment may quite easily achieve the standards it clearly aspires to and which many of its peers already deliver.  We did have a lovely weekend in London and would try this hotel again.",3,2015,03,04
121,"Cant wait to go back,","Spent a lovely long weekend here, we had a junior suite which had lots of space to relax after lots of shopping. Buckingham palace is at the end of the street 4 or 5 mins walk and houses of Parliament  are also very close 10 mins walk so its an excellent location. On site you are spoiled for choice on dinning possibilities. The Michelin stared Quilon is simply amazing as was the bistro, Zanders bar was a great place to have a classic cocktail. 
On arrival we were given a room with a shower and no bath, I really wanted to relax in a bath and spoke to reception who changed our room immediately without any fuss, nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff, who were all very attentive but not intrusive.",4,2015,03,04
121,There is only one positive aspect about this hotel: the location,"Although the housekeepers are kind and attentive I would definitely not recommend this hotel. The endless corridors leads (at least in my case) to a   sourpouss and inexplicably small room. Likewise, the room's furniture was utterly outdated and unexpected for a TAJ Hotel as well as the bathroom which was again extremely small and antiquated.",1,2015,03,04
121,We would return .....,"Nice hotel with good location.
Rooms were big and very clean if just a little tired.
We asked for quiet rooms and whilst they were quiet throughout the night the morning brought schoolchildren to the playground below. On the 5th floor the tube could be heard rumbling below but it was not obtrusive.
Dinner if Bank was excellent - huge portions and lots of choice.
Breakfast was very good in what was offered but I would have preferred, for the price, that it was cooked to order.
All the staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough.

Watch for reception putting a £50 charge on your credit card, we had two rooms and it was added to both, even though paying for both with one card. We were not told this was being done and even when we returned it was 'Pending' payment on our card.",4,2015,03,04
121,"Lovely, Central, fab concierge, nice cocktails. ","Two nights in a double room. Lovely hotel with a fabulous cocktail bar and loved the 'happy hour'. Skilfully made drinks with the most beautiful olives I've ever eaten. Dinner in the restaurant was fabulous and the waitress was sweet if not I suspect a little new. Concierge extremely helpful and a lovely touch to offer us brollies for the day. Only let down by the bed which was too small and a tired bathroom. Such a shame as we didn't sleep well as a result. 
",4,2015,03,02
121,Fantastic,"Beautiful hotel, lovely and clean and the staff are polite friendly and helpful. The room we were given didn't have a view which we were expecting but this was changed straight away with no fuss at all and the room we were given was fantastic. It was my partners birthday and even a birthday cake was waiting for him on arrival! ",5,2015,03,02
121,Met all our needs so no problems!,"There is nothing really that I can fault about our stay at the St. James' Court.  
Our room was located on the 6th floor and yes, while perhaps a bit dated in decor, was perfectly clean, comfortable and well appointed. Everything we needed was there - tea/coffee tray, safe, iron/board/trouser press, toiletries, fluffy robes and slippers, large fluffy towels, hairdrier, daily newspaper, minibar, daily housekeeping, etc.  The only gripe was perhaps the Wifi as it did not work when we were in bed but if we stood or sat near the bathroom it did!  But this I do not consider important enough to affect my overall rating of ""excellent"" for the hotel.  
Breakfast was served in the Bistro 51 and again the staff were very professional and efficient - as soon as a table was vacated it was cleared and set again for the next guests.  Nothing was trouble if you asked for it.  The breakfast selection was pretty good - both hot and cold. It was served as a buffet.  The only small thing was that because it was buffet, the bacon and sausages for the English breakfast were a little tough due to being under the hot lamps for quite a while. I'm not sure what you can do about that apart from cooking to order or else eating earlier (breakfast was served till 11am and we appeared at 10am).  Eggs (apart from scrambled on the buffet) are cooked to order.
There is a bar in the lobby of the hotel and also there is the Bank which is more of a cocktail bar.  For a quieter drink, opt for the lobby bar as the Bank is noisier and not much atmosphere to be honest!  
The litmus test is:  would I stay here again?  The answer is simple - yes.  Excellent value for money given the high level of service, comfortable amenities and the location (our rate was GBP 119 B&B per night).  Victoria is less than 10 mins walk and St. James' Park tube station about 5 mins.  Taxi rank is located just outside.  Buckingham Palace a 10 mins stroll.  Victoria Road around the corner from the hotel (5 mins walk) has a good selection of high street shops (e.g. House of Fraser, Zara, Monsoon), banks, cafes, places to grab quick food, the Cardinal Place shopping centre, etc.
As for observations by other guests about tube rumbling, yes even on the 6th floor we heard it but not THAT loud to really disturb.  We heard it the day we arrived (Friday) but then never again for the rest of the weekend as technical work was underway and the tubeline was closed.",5,2015,03,02
121,Well positioned for Central London Stay,"A really excellent hotel only approx 10 minutes walk from Victoria Railway Station. A similar short walk from the Houses of Parliment, London Eye, Buckingham Palace and other London attractions etc. The hotel is very well appointed, very comfortable, excellent value for money and is part of a larger complex of apartments and residences all around a central court yard. The bar is very comfortable with waiter service and there is a choice of 3 restaurants in the hotel complex. The Buffet breakfast was excellent. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is also a short walk from several London theatres and numerous well known restaurants which is great for pre-theatre dinner. My wife and I were extremely impressed and will certainly be using this hotel again when in London.",5,2015,03,02
121,Great location and cocktails,"Had a three night stay here with friends. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were lovely ( only one little thing was hairdryer didn't work  but not a big deal as was sorted quickly) . The rooms were a little bit of a maze to get to . The bar was great to sit in and the cocktails were delicious. 
The hotel is between two train stations so perfect to get anywhere.",4,2015,03,01
121,The Taj,Luxurious hotel and very efficient helpful staff.  Our room was lovely but the bath quite small.   So nice to find a hotel that still does smoking rooms!  Several restaurants there and I tried the Bistro which wasnt particularly overpriced and very nice.  Lost my hat there but staff soon rallied around and found it for me.  Nice breakfast in the bistro and hotel just around the corner from St James tube so very convenient.  Whole hotel bordering on being slightly cool though - turn the heating up a little!  Wifi free and very good.,5,2015,02,27
121,Location did it,Not the best of hotels; but it was in a great location. The executive room is nice with some wow factor; it looks like it's been updated but has the beige look which is very similar to other hotel rooms; nothing to say that's their USP. Toilet is nice; with toiletries being of premium level similar to a resort which used this in southern Ireland. Breakfast was reasonably good with the usual choices; but it was in a private function room rather than in their normal place as it was a private event.,4,2015,02,25
121,Great location. Happy employees :),The hotel is a nice walking distance to all the good places.employees are always smiling and helpful. Our room was not in the best location in the hotel. It was beside a maintenance room or something and the Walls a were a little thin.,4,2015,02,23
121,Great location,"Stayed at the Taj a couple of times now and both times where great.
Stayed for business purposes and it's central location is excellent. 
Second time stayed in an executive room and it was well worth the small extra charge and nd at £14 per night is great value for money.
Will definitely stay again.",4,2015,02,22
121,Premier Inn rooms - gorgeous lobby,"Location was great for us as we were going to see Billy Elliott, but it's not the best area other than that. It looks far more impressive on the outside. The lobby and bar are very nice. We ate in Quilon which was very nice - we had the tasting menu - the prawn masala was to die for. The room was drab, the tv worked on arrival but not the next morning. The bathroom was one of the smallest I've encountered. The halls are very drab and with only the one location of lifts it's quite a trek to your room. Breakfast was served in one of the conference rooms so zero atmosphere, conference chairs and ok food - not worth the rate. Had we known we would've booked room early and ate out. There are far better hotels in this price bracket. The bar is quite nice tho - they had a singer and musician and the staff were very attentive albeit I didn't like my cocktail - for 1 night I guess it was ok. ",3,2015,02,22
121,Lovely little extras,"A friend of ours made the reservation for us as part of a birthday celebration so didn't really know what to expect! We were greeted by a very friendly doorman who helped us find close by parking at no extra charge. At the desk we were politely told our room wasn't ready but they would take care of everything with our luggage and we could come back later. Once checked in (with a free upgrade) we received a birthday cake - such a lovely gesture from the hotel and very tasty!!! The service throughout our stay was excellent. The room was spacious, clean and nicely decorated. The bathrooms are clean and modern with a great shower (very important). Great location less than 3 minutes to the tube. The spa facilities were a little disappointing but as this was not the main reason for our trip it didn't really matter. Overall a fantastic experience and would recommend the hotel to anyone and stay here again ourselves in the future.",5,2015,02,22
121,"Excellent service, perfect staying conditions",Since the beginning to the end of our staying here we were surrounded by a care of the staff craving to help us in everything. The hotel has brilliant breakfasts and clean spacious and nice rooms. I have no any complaints. ,5,2015,02,22
121,Very Annoyed..Avoid this place,"The hotel itself is OK however having booked in with my family for a weekend London break & looking forward to a spot of shopping  the receptionist asked for a swipe of a card in order to secure against any additional charges to my room. 

I handed my debit card to be told that there would be a fee for using this type of card and a credit card would carry no fee. I then handed them my credit card and the details of it were taken by the check in staff. 

Unknown to myself the hotel had taken not 1 but 2 charges of £235 (£470 in total) against my credit card resulting in me reaching my CC limit and having my card refused whilst out shopping in London..!!!

To top it all a week later there charge is STILL on my card with no sign of when it will come off after having paid the hotel bill in full on my debit card on departure !!

Overall, very unhappy and as a result will certainly not be staying here again.  

They do not tell you or inform you that a charge will be taken so anyone wishing to stay here please be aware.  Avoid !!",1,2015,02,20
121,Second excellent stay at the St.James !! We love it !!,"My wife and I have the habbit to spend a Christmas weekend in London every year.
Last stay was our second stay at the St James. 
And for the second time we have been absolutely pleased by our stay.
First the location is great, calm however central. We again were very pleased by the atmsphere as soon as entering the hall, people are professional and friendly. And they must be happy to work there because we recognised a few of them from the previous year. 
We had the chance to be in the renovated room, serioulsy fantastic ! From the quality of the bed, the decoration, the size, everything was excellent.
We had breakfast at  the hotel this time, great choice of food, very pleasant staff and good.
So yes, we highly recommend the St. James.
And we look forward to being back again!!",5,2015,02,20
121,Indian hospitality in England,Great Hotel overall...lovely location..heritage feeling..100 metres from Buckingham Palace and all famous places @  30 minutes walking distance... Quilon is great for Indian food and  has excellent business centre.. I would recommend..,4,2015,02,19
121,Perfection,"Second stay in a number of weeks at this hotel. Fantastic room, staff, service and food on each visit. Also a great location short stroll to the tube I must also mention that although the food is perfect in the hotel there's agreat little Italian restaurant over the road. Both visits were on business and I'm looking forward to the next visit be it business or short break. Keep up the good work!",5,2015,02,17
121,Over priced,"Over priced 2 night stay here for our wedding anniversary and paid close to £400. We have stayed in Taj hotel before in India and had an amazing experience, not the case here. Rumbling of the tube that kept us awake, building work outside (not sure this was related to the hotel), tired  rooms, mouldy grout in bathroom, wobbly tap, towel rail did not work, radio switch in the bathroom did not work! Overpriced breakfast at £25 per head, we didn't have it! On the plus side, good location, but very disappointed given how much we paid.",3,2015,02,17
121,"A beautiful hotel in a great area close to Buckingham palace, worth a second visit.","Was very overwhelmed on arrival and on departure. Lobby clean, bright, very nicely decorated complemented with very kind entrance and reception staff. Hallways, lifts all very clean and tidy with lovely hallway furniture. Room was very spacious neat, clean and no bad odours. En-suite very nice marble effect with a big enough bath accompanied by hotel shampoos and body washes. In the morning in room breakfast was really well presented with a white table cloth, with a hot holding below. When heading out for food, before leaving was given complimentary umbrellas, which was very nice touch making the experience even better. Overall, a beautiful hotel, lovely staff and we'll worth a second visit if in the area again. ",5,2015,02,16
121,Great,"Great location, great service and staff. Room was nice, spacious and had everything we needed.
Also great value for money!

Would definitely recommend to anyone, and will stay there again.

Thank you for a lovely stay :)",5,2015,02,16
121,Wonderful Experience,"Myself and my daughter on the weekend of 7/02/2015 stayed at this hotel. 
The location is brilliant for London's sights and West end shows
The hotel itself is just beautiful, lovely rooms and spotlessly clean
The ultimate service that this hotel has to offer is the customer service, it is second to none
All staff, across the board are the most helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them
We would recommend this hotel at the highest level. ..You will not be disappointed. ",5,2015,02,16
121,Valentine's Delight.,"I arranged to have a one night stay at this hotel on Valentine’s Day. I had looked through so many reviews of so many hotels in London and decided on this one due to fantastic reviews. I was not disappointed. It was a surprise for my partner who works in Regent St. 

The hotel is situated on a busy road (but what road in London isn’t busy?) You’re welcomed by the very polite staff who offer to take your luggage (I chose not to) as I was nervous about turning up on my own as it was. I suddenly felt like I was not the ‘average normal girl’ I usually see myself as but actually like an upper class person just from the way in which the hotel felt. (There was me in my casual jeans and t-shirt) haha! I checked in where the hotel had organised me to have a court view room as I had emailed them to request a higher floor room which was facing the court due to reading reports of noise if you’re facing the front. The hotel had emailed me back and said they would try their best with my request. Guess what, I was on the sixth floor with a beautiful courtyard view looking straight out to the court yard clock. (if you have stayed here you’ll know what I mean)

As soon as I walked into the room I done a little celebratory dance as it was so exciting. I was like in a different world it seemed so very posh and out of my league and yet there I was in this outstandingly amazing room. I explored around the room (as you do when you turn up at a hotel) and found things which excited me, for example you’re able to listen to the telly while in the bathroom too, which was perfect for me getting ready I was in my element, sending lots of snapchats and videos to my friends. (not my partner though) 

After setting up the room ready for my partner with love petals ect.. The door knocked and I was nervous at first that my music and awful singing was to blame for the knock on the door. But it was a waitress with a complimentary cake for my/and my partners 1st year together which I had informed the hotel to by email also. I was so impressed and chuffed (means happy). And it made me feel like the hotel really does go that extra mile. 

Just so that I can get the company in to mention too I hired a private Rickshaw to pick me and my partner up and they’re company was also brilliant. Search for bugbugs.com first and then ask for Mike Faye. He’s service was fantastic, and for £30 took us (the longer route) to our destination and had twinkly lights and music from the rickshaw (very happy customer to that company)

Anyway the room I had at the hotel was beautiful and I can’t explain how special and upper class I felt.  

Only negative comment is that I was unsure what I had to pay to use in the room and what I didn’t. I really wanted to take the pair of slippers in the walldrobe as a memory however didn’t know If I’d later be charged for this, also it was not clear if the toiletry items and the supplied food in a little hamper if you ate any if you’d be charged. Same with the tea and coffee in the walldrobe. I was too scared to use them encase I got charged later which is a shame to feel that way. And of course take extra money for lots of taxi's, unless you don't mind a walk. 

In the morning we left at 11.30am (check out is 12) and as we couldn't afford the hotels breakfast we took a walk up the road after having some pictures taken out the front of the hotel by the lovely staff, we went to a little cafe. (breakfast still came to £20) but hey! Thats london prices i'm not complaining. We went for a nice long walk from the hotel to Waterloo station passing all the main attractions such as Buckingham palace, the change of the guards, Big Ben, 10 downing street, and walked past the London eye ect, its so doable but you need to get your walking feet in gear. 

I would most definitely visit again, my partner actually was stunned by this hotel. And we’ve said we’ll be back every special occasion. So be prepared to see us again, St James Court.",5,2015,02,15
121,The best 5 star all the way,"We are now sat in out room the the last night of our weekend break. As regular visitors to London on a monthly basis we have stayed in a lot of 4/5 star hotels in the centre. We found this one by chance!

I work in the hospitality sector as a Area Manager for the Housekeeping Department across many brands of hotels.  Check in by Duty Manager Rauell was extremely welcoming and friendly, our standard classic room was far bigger then expected room 268 , immaculate, clean and lovely. We had a drink in the hotel bar where the waitress was very polite and friendly. The corridors smell fantastic and are so wide and fresh- not to mention the court yard , a little taste of India itself. 

This hotel underates itself surely it must be 5 star. We love it, we will be back and will recommend to all. SIMPLY AMAZING !!  ",5,2015,02,15
121,"A ""palace"" near the Buckingham palace","This is one of the best old renovative buldings that hosts a very cosy (despite its size) hotel.Very nice rooms,clean & fresh ,white and good smelling linen  with great room service and an  interesting bar with a serious collection of mults.If it is spring or summer take your breakfast in the indoor garden it is superb!The restaurant Taj is one of the best in town and there are at least 15 pubs nearby for a typical early or late beer!!A 10'-15' walking time through St James park to the Trafalgar or Piccadilly and 2' walking from U station ""St. James Park""",5,2015,02,15
121,Disapointment,"Hotel looks only in the lobby like 4* ,rooms are small and cold.
I was in Feb. outside was +5 and in my room was max +18 , heating is not functioning. Corridor is like a labyrinth in Arctica ! Narrow and cold !!!
I got a room with view on playing field of school - so it was loud till 20.00 and on hotel trash which they started to grab at 6 am !
All in all - very bad impression",2,2015,02,14
121,excellent on all aspects,We were treated to a stay in this hotel as a Christmas present and what a lovely treat!  This hotel is excellent for its position -so close to St James Park and Westminster whilst very quiet at night. The room was spotlessly clean and those lovely soft towels were magnificent.  The most outstanding thing for me was the polite and courteous staff - always welcoming and helpful such a pleasure to enter the hotel.  Breakfast was hot and plentiful and served efficiently without having to wait.  The garden in this hotel looked great even though it is February so I am sure it will be outstanding in summer.  Thankyou to everyone for making our stay so pleasurable.,5,2015,02,12
121,This excellent hotel that just gets better and better,"This is the best place that I have found to stay in London, and I have tried a lot of hotels in the city.
All the staff that I have met at the hotel are excellent; going that extra mile without question or need.
The rooms are wonderful. 
The restaurants and bar exceptional.

For me the place to stay in London.",5,2015,02,11
121,The Hotel was Average,"We arrived in the afternoon but were checked in quickly. The staff were okay, but we never really mixed with them as we spent most of our time outside the hotel. The rooms were quite dated. This hotel was okay, but we did spend most of our time outside of the hotel. I probably wouldn't return.",3,2015,02,11
121,Wonderful.,"This hotel was gorgeous. The bedroom looked newly decorated, the bathroom looked a little tired but the room was huge for a london hotel. Had everything we needed and the staff were lovely. Some people are complaining about the noise from the tube but I'm a light sleeper and was not at all disturbed by the tube. We were on the third floor.",5,2015,02,10
121,Worth the money for a special occasion,"I had a surprise night's stay here as a birthday treat. I later found out a ball park cost of this and even though I didn't foot the bill, I can say it was worth the money. Fantastic place, the bar is brilliant (I was dragged there before i knew we were staying by being told (truthfully) that it's the longest bar in Europe and we had to check it out). Only ate breakfast there, but the food was really wonderful and I am very keen to go back just for breakfast again. Highly recommend",5,2015,02,09
121,"Lovely decor, great location and friendly staff","I was pleasantly surprised with the grand building, lovely decor and the friendly staff. We were greeted in the rain by a very helpful member of staff and every other member of staff we came in contact with during our stay was extremely helpful and friendly. The bar serves some wonderful cocktails, although you can expect to pay for good quality cocktails and service. Fabulous location and various coffee shops are nearby on the very short walk to the tube station. The only fault I had was the wifi was not working in our room although it did say it was connected and the hot water seemed to run out Sunday morning unfortunately. All in all though I would recommend this hotel on account of the service and location! ",4,2015,02,09
121,Fabulous - couldn't fault ,"Couldn't ask for more - got a fabulous deal two nights for £119pn. Room and hotel overall was perfect . Staff very friendly and very efficient . Room was very clean, spacious and comfortable . Lovely fluffy towels too. Breakfast was delicious too and again waiting staff and all other staff were attentive and helpful . Will definitely be back again. 

Perfect location - easy walk to tube or to the Apollo Victoria . ",5,2015,02,08
121,Lovely stay,"Had a lovely stay here.  Booked an executive king, which was vey comfortable and remarkably quiet!  All the staff were pleasant and helpful.  
The only problem was they were unable to provide a VAT receipt as we booked through Expedia.  Expedia say it should come from hotel, hotel say it should come through Expedia!  Not hopeful to resoolve this but wasimpressed with the hotel.",4,2015,02,08
121,So much better than last time!,"Last year we stayed in an 'un-refurbished' room that really didn't meet expectations. This visit our room was exceptional. In fact, because of our experience last year we had a free upgrade to an executive suite and it was absolutely superb.  We will definitely stay again!",5,2015,02,08
121,Simply the best,"I have been staying at this hotel for 10 years, it has always been owned by Taj but operated under the Crowne Plaza franchise until last year.it is truly a hidden gem in London the standards of service are superb and the quality of the food is first class, the rooms are spacious, elegantly furnished and well equipped.
I have never been able to fault this hotel it is well managed and excellently located, whilst I mainly stay on business my wife needs no second invitation to join me if she can get away it has a good spa and gym. The Hotel Restaurant Brasserie 51 is first class serving excellent food and wine  next door is Bank an two doors away is quilon which is a Michelin Starred restaurant serving fragrant southern food, a delightful experience and not overpriced.",5,2015,02,08
121,"Cheap price, cheap room :( - great hotel!","I booked well in advance and paid just £119 - when I stayed the prices were £260.The room I got however I think is saved for the cheap booker! There was frosting on the window so I couldn't see out at all and couldn't tell what the weather was doing. The room was quite small, just about ok for me and my daughter - it did have all mod cons and was clean and comfy. The bathroom however had a peeling ceiling, and the towel rail was cold; the room needed a re-furb!
Having said all that however, the hotel itself is very nice indeed. The tibe station is a two minute walk but be careful there are four exists!!
The staff are fabulous - attentive, kind and personal. The check in lady was very nice to my daughter and made her feel special. The Hamptons Bar Staff deserve recognition for attentiveness and service. I would definitely stay again, but not in room 355!!",4,2015,02,07
121,Excellent with a personal touch,Great hotel with friendly and attentive staff. Facilities good and getting better. Would highly recommend. Location is perfect and I must say that the cocktails were fab. We stayed in a suite which was very nice. If I had one small gripe I would say the water pressure in the shower could of been stronger but apart from that the room was well appointed and a super comfortable bed. Thought the turn down service was a nice touch. Would definitely come back. Love taj!,5,2015,02,04
121,Lovely weekend !,"We stayed here overnight on the 31st jan. The hotel was clean and hotel staff couldn't have helped us anymore ! It felt like a little bit of luxury ! We had a classic master suite which we loved only downside was forgetting to shut bathroom door as it sets fire alarm off, and the shower wasn't even that steamy . We did find it noisy due to the tube but it didn't stop me sleeping well as the beds are so comfy ! I would have liked to have seen proper eggs at breakfast , fried or poached would have been nice . The scrambled egg offered was not very appetising it felt like it was those fake eggs mixture, or frozen not sure but it didn't taste fresh . Overall though we had a great stay !",4,2015,02,03
121,Awful service. Awful smell. Awful price.,"After reading loads of positive reviews I was so excited about staying in this hotel for my two night stay. Well I could not wait to get out of it . 
We arrived early about 11 o'clock in the morning and we knew our check in time wasn't until 2. Arriving at reception they took our bags off our hands and sorted out all our details . I booked one room for two nights. The woman at reception argued with me on arrival telling me that I had not paid for my hotel (which I had and I brought the bank statements over with me as proof incase this had happened) she then told me that that payment was for the only ONE of ""TWO"" rooms I had booked (I only booked one room). I then started panicking incase I made a mistake in my booking. I had all the print outs of the invoice for the hotel with me and read over them and it stated I had one room booked for two nights. Even after showing her all my confirmations she still presisted to argue with me and ended up ringing the manager to see what she could do . After she got off the phone she said it was sorted and the other room was after being ""deleted"" even though I knew she was lying and she knew she was in the wrong the whole time instead of admitting she was in the wrong . She then told me we had to pay an additional fifty pound as a deposit! This was not stated on their website! I paid it anyway and left the hotel very upset as we waited for our room to be ready. 
We arrived back to out hotel at four in the evening and got our keys no problem and when to our rooms. As I was booking the room I did request the highest floor. So when I seen my room was 160 I was once again disappointed . We entered our pokey small room which stank of cigar or weed! The pictures for these classic rooms are very deceiving! However even though the room was in immaculate condition except for the stanch of weed it wasn't what I asked for or what I was expecting especially for the price we paid! 
The first night my boyfriend and myself left to go out for a few drinks and food so we asked at reception was there a set time we had to be back for before the doors locked or did we have to buzz in. An Asian woman gave  us a dirty look and looked down on us as she snapped and told us that it was open 24 hours that we should know that . I was shocked at the response and continued my way out of the hotel relieved to get out . 
The second night we stayed there we decided to stay in and get a takeaway. My boyfriend went down to reception to see if we could order food from theoutside the hotel. The man out the reception told us there was menus up in our room and all we could order room was room service! We wernt allowed to get our food elsewhere.  It was an absolute disgrace! We where that hungry we paid for the roomservice which we got two chips an a burger with cost is 51 gbp! We got about 10 chips each and our burger bun was burnt  and our burger was undercooked! I woke up the next morning with the runs due to the terrible food! 
Overall a terrible experience! Awful service! Would not recommend to anyone!",1,2015,02,03
121,Perfect.,"A hotel with history and charm! Luxery at point. Great location, near the tube and beautiful parks. 5 min walk from buckingham palace. Great hotel! 

PS. Do not get room in the two first floors, may be noise from the tubes. ",5,2015,02,03
121,Friendly staff,"Stayed here for two nights and experienced a comfortable, pleasant stay. The hotel was perfect location, easy to find but tucked away from the busy streets of London and easy to walk to all the main tourist attractions, we didn't need to hop on the tube once even though we had st James and Victoria station on our doorstep. We arrived before check-in to see if we could drop off our luggage, staff were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful and checked us into a room that was available. We stayed in room 373 which was a very large spacious room compared to previous hotel rooms I've stayed in and was pleasantly surprised. We occasionally  heard the rumble from the subway trains below which may bother some people who are light sleepers but was no issue for us probably because we were fascinated by how comfortable the pillows were. Will without a doubt  be back to stay in the future.",5,2015,02,02
121,"Booked It, Let Them Know What I expected & They Still Got It Wrong","I booked a suite including breakfast at this place on the recommendations of my parents who are frequent visitors for my wires birthday.

I even tweeted a message to say it was her birthday and all we wanted was a relaxed hassle free time.

We arrived and the checkin was exceptional! The lady who checked us in had all our details and advised she was going to give us a complimentary upgrade. She advised that as we were a little early our suite was not yet ready; this was fine and no expectation on our part of getting in to the eroom as we had to meet some friends for lunch in Covent Garden…the lady the asked if the concierge could take our bag and she would ensure it was put in our room when we returned later the evening after the theatre.

We returned at approx 23:00 and i was really impressed with the reception staff and the security check they did prior to handing me my key card.

When we got to our room it was apparent that the case had not been brought up, we rang down and 15 mins we were reunited with the case and little lighter in the wallet with the tip of the folding variety!

We had a reasonable nights sleep although it sounded like trains/traffic running all night. 

The shower was in a right mess, took ages to get warm water and it sprayed all over as well as having bits missing off it (see pic) the TV looked like it needing rewiring as there were cables having down like a birds nest (see pic)…remember this is meant to be a suite and an upgraded suite at that.

We went for breakfast and found that there was no one at the entrance to seat us, we walked in and found someone I presume was the breakfast manager who seated us at a table that needed a clean. A young waiter came over and asked us what we would like, he offered us orange which we accepted and eventually the earl grey with lemon appeared along with cold toast. 

The waiter then stood near the table and stood and stood…despite having a jug of orange next to him and our glasses empty as in never had the orange he offered…we waited some more until I asked him for the orange.

We then tried to order some breakfast but there was an issue that we still do not understand so we ate from the buffet.

We came to checkout and at no point was I asked 'was everything ok?' instead they tried to charge me for breakfast….I then asked if they would like some feedback?

Later that day i spoke with the Front of House Manager who was very apologetic, explained he was going to get to the bottom of issues in the breakfast room, get engineering to the room, explained they look at two systems so hadn't seen breakfast was included and as a good will gesture would like to offer me some discount.

So at least they acted quickly, however i'd have preferred just to have a hassle free relaxing stay!!!!",2,2015,02,02
121,Made to feel welcome.,My wife and I stayed here 1 night to meet my son who had flown in from Canada on business for a couple of days. We arrived early 1pm and were met by a friendly receptionist who offered us a room straight away with an upgrade. The room was very comfortable if a little hot initally and very quiet.We ate in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast enjoying our meals. All staff seemed genuinely  helpful and friendly. Thoroughly recomended,5,2015,02,02
121,Nice hotel well appointed room,"My husband and I stayed here for a night whilst going to the theatre. It is a great location and we had a cold but lovely walk through St James's park just a few hundred yards away. Walked on to Trafalgar Square to the national portrait gallery. 
The hotel has spa facilities and several restaurants and bars we didn't use any of them so I can't comment on them. We didn't even have breakfast we went out for it. The staff were all welcoming and pleasant though. 
For the price the facilities and standard of room were good value and I would definitely use it again and stay longer! ",4,2015,02,01
121,Almost Five Stars,"just stayed three nights here and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. It's in a great part of London within walking distance (ie much less than 30 mins) of many attractions including Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, Westminster etc. near to St James Park tube station so easy access. First impressions excellent. Very good and helpful staff. Room was spacious for London with good bed an high quality fittings. Room quiet, looks newly done; shower controls a bit fiddly and the hot water ran out on Sunday morning although was heating up within 30-40 mins. TV signal a bit intermittent on some channels but on the plus side you do get an excellent selection including all sky sports channels. We couldn't make the Wi-fi work in our room. Said we were connected but nothing happened. 
So almost there and we would certainly return",4,2015,02,01
121,will visit again,"Stayed here for 2 night 25-27th Jan for business, only a 3 min walk from the office I was visiting. I asked for a quiet room and was allocated one. Comfortable bed, good sized room, lovely quality towels and complimentary bathroom products, plenty of hot water. Staff very friendly and polite.
Only negative comment is that my room, 654, could have done with decorating as it was a little shabby.
I will visit again when I am next working in the area.",4,2015,01,31
121,"Perfect for sleeping well, just out of life.","The hotel is solid majestic building and offers some Indian style, with modern and realy BIG rooms, something you cannot find in London often. The breakfast buffet is simply one of the best you can imagine. Only negative thing is the position out of whatever bar open till late.",4,2015,01,31
121,Not a disaster but could be better,"Just stayed here for a couple of nights break in London. Hotel reception is well presented and staff very courteous bars, restaurants and public areas all nice with food excellent if pricey. The room was a disappointment we booked a standard double and were allocated a room in the roof space which by London standards was a reasonable size. Bed was a standard double and comfortable enough. Decor was at best tired and needed some work and bathroom was poor with terrible water pressure and inadequate hot water. Worst part though was noise from nearby underground which was awful with trains passing every 2 to 3 minutes from 5 in the morning till midnight. In defence of the hotel we didn't complain so they didn't have opportunity to re house us but I wouldn't expect a 4star hotel to be so badly affected by noise. In summary great location good facilities but spoilt by noisy surroundings.",3,2015,01,30
121,Nice Quiet Hotel in Heart of Westminster,"When I travel to London, I usual stay in branded hotels - Intercontinental, Hyatt, Millennium - because you at least know you are getting - a consistent brand.  Boutique and other hotels in London can be so hit or miss.  Well, I decided to branch out only a little and stay at this Taj property on Buckingham Gate and I have to say I was very impressed.  Many things would rate this hotel at excellent, but there are several little things which keep me from giving that rating.

I reserved through Booking.com and got an excellent rate.  I had requested a slightly early check in and, upon arrival at 1330 I was told I would need to wait until check in time at 1400.  Promptly at 1400 I was handed my room key - I had reserved an Executive King room which, while not a king bed, was a very nice comfortable bed combination of twin sized beds.  The room itself was very large, if somewhat meagerly appointed.  The bath was excellent - warm and inviting - though the drain in the tub ran a little slow.  The work area was smaller than I anticipated - and needed - and really smaller than it needed to be for such an ample size room.  I never heard so much as a peep from another guest and I enjoyed near silence from the early evening through to early morning.  An excellent hotel for sleeping and work.

The location is perfect for me as well.  Buckingham Gate is a quiet road, nestled between Buckingham Palace and the very vibrant and active Victoria Street.  With access to Westminster, Victoria Station and an easy walk to Covent Garden, this is probably an ideal location for active travelers.  The area directly around the hotel can be a little quiet at night, so if you want an active nightlife you won't find it in the hotel.  The hotel courtyard is absolutely breathtaking, even in January.  The staff were efficient and prompt, if somewhat less than warm.  Wifi service was average, though I found hotel wide coverage was quite nice.  The hotel bar has a piano which is actively played by staff in the evenings, providing a great atmosphere.

All in all, and especially for the price in Central London, this is one of the best value hotels in the borough.  I will return, and I am sure I will love it even more the second time around.",4,2015,01,29
121,Nice Location,"We stayed in this hotel for New Years Eve Celebration with my kids, the staff are all friendly and helpful, the room are clean and big and the location are near to tubes and buckingham palace. I definitely recommend this hotel if you come to london.",4,2015,01,29
121,Great value and service,"Writing this from our room on our second visit, having stayed for two nights last July and again now for two nights. Based on these two experiences we have decided to stop searching for other hotels when visiting London as this ticks all the boxes for us.
If you are into modern design and don't mind small bedrooms then you may find somewhere preferable for similar money, but if like me you value comfort, space and service above all else this hotel is hard to beat in London. The rooms are very large by London standards but if you can score a corner room as we did on both visits, with a separate small sitting area then you are getting what most hotels would call a junior suite. Last time we stayed we had a mid afternoon room service snack of Asian dishes that was excellent and good value, staff are great and today they came to our room with a cake wishing us happy anniversary, I told them it was not our anniversary but they said no problem so I told them we would pretend!
Also important is that everything works, from Wifi, to the big comfy king sized bed with high quality bedding etc. In many ways this place scores higher than a lot of London's 5-star hotels I have stayed in. We will back soon for sure.",4,2015,01,29
121,Lovely hotel.,"Stayed here for one night. The hotel was lovely and the rooms were cost. The courtyard was beautiful. My two cons, the beds wernt the most comfertable and the tv was too far from the bed. If the tv was bigger it woulda have been ok. Will definitely visit again but will book a king room at the minimum!",4,2015,01,29
121,Cocktails at Buckingham Gate,"We discovered that this hotel threw itself into happy hour with five pound cocktails. It became our regular pre dinner watering hole.
The bar staff were attentive and helpful.
Their sides of whitebait, sensational.
The endless bowls of pop corn topped off our several visits!",4,2015,01,29
121,Lovely Location,"We stayed at the St. James' Court for New Years Eve this year and had  a wonderful stay.  It is easily located between two tube stations and down the street from Buckingham Palace.  The hotel itself seems to consist of two parts, one portion has been renovated.  

Our room as clean and well appointed with a huge bathroom with stub/shower and towel warmer.  The room was comfortable, clean and in good condition. We were quite far from either of the elevators and did have to manage a couple of steps up and down which could be a problem for some.  

The staff was incredibly pleasant and willing to assist with all of our inquiries and needs. I did pay a very discounted rate for this room but was not treated unwell because of it.  I must say that had I paid a full retail price for the room I may have been a bit disappointed with the stay but would highly recommend it for the service, location and room comfort.",4,2015,01,27
121,"Perfect Stay , fabulous location","Wow what a perfect hotel ! We stayed here for 2 nights arriving on my wife's birthday January 23 , firstly I have stayed in various hotels around the world and the politeness and helpfulness from the staff was exceptional .  We went to our room 710 , and it was spotlessly clean ,and the bed was very comfortable , and lots of extras in the room ( slippers , iron , ironing board , safe , slippers , and a vast amount of toiletries )  As this hotel has no car parking You can park your car outside for free from 1830 on a Friday until 0800 on the Monday ( but would get their just after 6 so your guaranteed a spot ) . The location is ideal 300 Mts  Buckingham Palace , or the same to St James Tube station . We stayed for two nights and I wish it was longer ! The Breakfast buffet was also great with lots of choices , the waitresses and waiters being very helpful in keeping you topped up with coffee ... 
Will go back at a drop of a pin !! Thanks again for an amazing stay .........",5,2015,01,27
121,This is a good place!,"We stayed at St. James Court for three nights in January in connection with a musical recital at Westminster Abbey. We chose this particular hotel mainly for its location and on account of previous positive experience with Taj Hotels. The stay exceeded our expectations in every respect, from the quality of the room and public spaces, competence of the staff, perfect location, fair price, and an outstanding martini in the bar. So this is our new home away from home in London.",5,2015,01,27
121,Perfect Weekend Treat,"a late booked weekend to play tourist and take in a show proved to be a perfect break, starting with a perfect hotel! From the moment we arrived slightly before the 2pm check in time, we were able to leave luggage while we explored tHe surrounding area. found we were 5 minute walk from Buckingham Palace and lovely area full of coffee shops and restaurants. arriving back we checked in effortlessly with our luggage delivered to our lovely room. Stayed on 6th floor, and although view was of opposite hotel block it didn't take anything away from the room! Breakfast was included in a great room rate from Bookings.com, and was excellent with attentive staff and lovely range of hot and cold food. So many staff around always ready to help and always with a smile! We both loved every minute we stayed and will definitely be back, and will recommend to all our friends!!",5,2015,01,26
121,"Comfort, convenience, and space","I have stayed at so many different hotels in London and you get what you pay for at the cheaper hotels (broken lifts/no lifts, limited services, tiny or rundown rooms that cost way more than they should).  So tired of hotels with lower nightly rates that then charge ₤15 - 20 per 24 hours for wireless!

This is my first stay at the St James Court, booked this while in London on business and needed a centrally located, comfortable room with all amenities (plenty of drawers and hangers for clothes, iron and ironing board in room, 24-hour room service, fast free in-room wireless, decent-sized desk, quiet) and the St James Court - Taj did not disappoint! 

The staff were superb esp. the concierge and doormen who always pointed me in the right direction.  My only gripe was that the management seem to have 'trainees' at the checkin desk at night and when arriving late at night after a long day of traveling, you really don't want to deal with an inefficient and error-prone checkin process (my card was double charged by the hotel staff accidentally, causing the card company to think it was suspicious activity, and suspended all transactions thereafter). While I was trying to check-in, I witnessed three other people come up query the hotel staff about some issue and no one seemed to be able to help without going to the back to get the manager on duty (who seemed to have limited authorization to fix certain matters).  This was and is my only complaint - the rest of the stay was top notch and would definitely stay here again.  My room was 319 (at the end of long corridor) and I did not hear the train rumbling as others have reported and there was some minor noise from the street, but being from NYC, this was not an issue and expected, after all London is a major metropolitan city. 

Will definitely try and stay here again and I hope to get the same good rate again that I managed to find via Booking.com!",4,2015,01,25
121,a wonderful stay,"stayed here for 1 night, everything perfect from the moment we got their, check in and receptionist really friendly and helpful, room nice, had everything you needed, and spotlessly clean, needed some more tea, sugar etc, was brought to us straightaway, breakfast lovely, and waiter never asked just bought more butter, jams etc so on the ball and really friendly, went into to have a look round spa, lady their lovely showed us all round and so friendly, I would love to come back to this hotel again one day, and would highly recommend it. what lovely staff who we met.",5,2015,01,25
121,Great first stay!,"Right before Christmas we went to London. It was the first time my family came over from Germany, so it was quite important to give them a good impression of one of the greatest cities in the world. The hotel definitely contributed to their positive experience. We had two rooms with windows towards the courtyard, so it was very quiet and you could leave the window open at night. The service was excellent (e.g. one day when we came back to the hotel in the afternoon, they provided cookies for my younger siblings). The location is quite good to show some typical sights (Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Trafalgar Square); they're all in good walking distance. Breakfast was delicious, just  some more fresh fruits would have been great. All in all, a very good hotel and the next stay is already planned.",4,2015,01,25
121,A surprisingly positive stay,"We have stayed at the hotel once before and it was a bit disappointing with the room as it was scratches here and there and not as promised, however the hotel was extremely helpful when we gave a complaint and gave us a big, cozy room which was perfect. The next stay (9-11 jan) we also got treated so well as our previous stay was not that good and got a upgrade. my boyfriend told them about us celebrating one year togheter and surprised us with a cake on the room(it was so jummy!!!) And the room was amazing, we honestly didn't want to leave. We stayed in a junior suite an it was truly overwhelming! Perfect:)  Thanks for a fantastic stay:) ",5,2015,01,25
121,first of many?,first stay in this hotel or any of in the chain - was very favourable initial impression - big enough to have facilities needed but very personal feel - staff very professional and helpful - should have tried breakfast! only downside was bathwater in morning not very warm (was hot previous night),5,2015,01,24
121,BEST LONDON ACCOMMODATION,"St James Court is a very impressive looking building near to Buckingham Palace and just a short walk from Westminster.  We chose this hotel partly based on the excellent reviews, and we were not disappointed. We have stayed in many hotels in London over the years but the service and staff  at St James Court were the best we’ve ever experienced, particularly the staff - absolutely everyone was so pleasant and friendly and always had a word for you and a smile on their face.  We tend to use hotel facilities very little because we spend most our time out of doors, but the facilities on offer were superb.  Our room was lovely and my husband wanted to bring the fabulous comfortable bed home with us !!!   The breakfast was delicious, and if you wanted something other than the buffet they were more than happy to oblige. We just loved the whole experience and will certainly stay here again and happy to recommend",5,2015,01,22
121,Quick visit ,"This hotel was recommended by Etihad Airways , I really enjoy my stay , in term of room size , hospitality and service , welcoming by Mr. Jad , and the front desk staff made really relaxed in the extreme cold weather of London city , room amenities also were more than what I expect , worth mentioning that breakfast , variety of food was one of the point which I like , even checking out was easy as check in . Thanks to all the staff ",4,2015,01,22
121,A good all round hotel,"Stayed here last night for the first time.  I'd been using St Ermins [part of Marriotts Autograph collection].  I had a room on the 7th floor.  The hotel was very good.  Front check in staff very efficient and polite.  The hotel has a very good gym, far better than st ermins.  Breakfast was as you would expect from a hotel of this quality, but not exceptional.  The rooms are large enough, very clean and well furnished.

A good hotel in this area.",4,2015,01,22
121,"Brilliant location, nice rooms","Really good size 6th floor room with a comfortable double bed, air conditioning and windows that opened.  I found if I poked my head out I could see Big Ben and the London Eye, which was a bonus.  Staff were attentive and really gave the impression of a luxury hotel.  My room contained a minibar fridge with room to store some bottles of my own, along with ample storage.  WiFi was free and more than adequate, although an upgrade to superfast is also available for a tenner.

Some slight gripes:  Despite being on the 6th floor, tube ""rumble"" is evident as the hotel sits right on top of the underground line.  Moreover there was some noisy loading bay activity taking place very early in the morning outside.  Not the fault of the hotel, but enough to disturb my slumbers.

The shower (over the tub) wasn't really positioned for anyone over about 5 foot in height, and the water pressure and temperature could both have used a little improvement.  Big white fluffy towels were a welcome amenity to step out to, though.  As noted in other reviews, the TV has an execrable menu system seemingly designed to prevent you from watching television without giving notice in advance, but such is the way in many hotels.

Overall I really liked it, despite the foibles, and I look forward to staying there again.  Some great pubs and breakfast choices all within a few minutes walk, too.",4,2015,01,21
121,Must stay Hotel in London,"We just returned from a Weekend in London and stayed at the St James Court Hotel. I must say that this hotel is a must stay hotel and I have no hesitation in Recommending this hotel. It's location is just off Parlarment Square so within walking distance of Westminster Abby, Big Ben, and the London Eye. 
It is also close to Victoria, the Shops and Resturants are also very close.  
What really makes this hotel a Must Stay Hotel is the hotel itself and more importantly the Staff. Not only were they Professional in every way but their friendliness and polite way each and everyone greeted you made our City break one to remember. This is rare in London.",5,2015,01,20
121,Wonderful Hotel,"Staff were patient and persistent in trying to accommodate my special needs.  Alessia and Monica at Reception worked with me until we found a room that was perfect.  Bellman Levi was extremely helpful, friendly and professional in making sure we settled in and had everything we needed.  The room was quiet (facing courtyard), spacious, had good closet and storage, and a beautiful bathroom.  Room service was delicious and prompt, with the soup still piping hot.  A great location and neighborhood, close to the Underground, with three Starbuck's (very important for us) and lots of places to eat and shop nearby.  Door staff and Concierge always greeted us with a smile and a warm hello.  All in all, a wonderful stay.  We will definitely be back.",5,2015,01,20
121,Overly Delighted!,Got the room for a great price. The room was far bigger and nicer than I could have imagined. It was spotlessly clean and I felt very pleased to be able to make my girlfriend so very happy with our stay. The bed was huge and comfy and we both slept wonderfully. All staff were more than pleasant and I have no complaints.,5,2015,01,19
121,Awful experience,"We stayed two nights at the Taj and were happy to leave. We have an infant and wanted adjoining rooms or a suite with a door. We called to speak to reservations, and they said they cannot guarantee adjoining rooms, but after calling the hotel, they were able to assure us that the suite we had would have a door betweeen the living room and bedroom. I had also read reviews of the tube going underground and asked to be on a high floor in a quiet room. We arrived at the hotel a half hour before check in. The room was not ready, which was understandable. We said we would leave our luggage to go have lunch and would return for our room. She assured us that we would be happy once we saw our room. Once we got back and walked in our room, we were overwhelmed by an awful smell and could hear the tube underneath. There was also no door between the living room and bedroom. We called reception and explained everything and asked to move to a different room. They said they would look into it and call us back. After almost an hour of sitting not sure if we should unpack, we called down again. They said they were still working on it. Finally, we called back a third time and this time the duty manager came ont he phone and said that if we wanted a room with a door between the bedroom and living room, we would have to pay an additional 50 pounds a night. We were shocked but obliged, as we were exhausted and could not stay in the current room and just wanted to unpack our things and get settled. We could still hear the tube, but it was much more faint and bearable. The living room thermosat was not working - the only option was freeying cold or off, so we had to keep that off. The day we checked out, we went to take a shower, and the hot water was not working. We tried the sink, and there was no hot water either. We called reception to let them know. They said they would send up an engineer. We explained that we did not think that would fix the issue and that we were in a hurry to check out, so we told them we would take cold showers and just deal with it. After dealing with this, we were concerned that we would be a bit late to check out, so we called and asked for an extra hour. The receptionist said that would be fine. Shortly before 1pm, a woman came knocking on the door (which woke up the baby) and rudely told us we needed to leave or call reception. I explained that I had spoken to them, and she said they didn not tell her so I had to call again. At this point, I grabbed our things and the baby and went downstairs to tell reception how terrible our stay was, but there was a huge line. I waited for 20 minutes, then gave up and left. We also had the staff knock on our door with things we did not ask for a couple of times (which always woke up the baby) then they realised that they had the wrong room. Our breakfast was also cold on both days. All in all, this was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. We will never be visitng again. The lobby and courtyard are beautiful, but that is pretty much the only allure of this place.",1,2015,01,19
121,Comfortable one night,"Only had the one night at this hotel and it was a pleasant stay, helpful staff, situated in a nice convenient area for basing yourself for Buckingham Palace sightseeing and theatre as long as you like walking which I do. Room was clean and had everything for an overnight. Not the cheapest but worth that little bit extra.",4,2015,01,18
121,One of the finest Taj hotels across the world,"Located just next to Taj 51 buckingham gate. A perfect location with couple of metro stations nearby namely St. James Court and Victoria Station. We reached fairly early to the hotel around 10'sh and our check in was smooth even though the hotel was running nearly full coz of the London WTM 2014 in November. The hotel staff were very courteous and always ready to help. Rooms are decently sized eith classy looks and have their standard amenities. Bathroom in the superior category rooms carry a traditional and fairly old accesories, which i personally felt need an upgrade. The hotel has free wifi across all rooms. Breakfast served include the Indian menu as well. Having visited for the 1st time found its weather almost unpredictable. Morning was pretty clear and suddenly you find clouds and chilling winds blowing across. The concierge desk was very helpful in informing us with the details of the places we wanted to visit and the fastest way to reach as we had very limited to spend in london. Always smiling they always suggested us to carry umbrellas across london as it rains very often during those times. Overall an excellent experience during our 3 nights stay.",4,2015,01,18
121,Excellent - efficient and comfortable,Only stayed one night on business. I was able to get an excellent and good value bar meal at 3.30 in the afternoon. Room was very comfortable. Not the cheapest hotel but certainly not the most expensive. All in all very good value.,4,2015,01,17
121,great quality,"I've stayed here twice before and every time it impresses. I book when there's an offer on, so always consider it value for money. Staff are not just friendly but also efficient. My room (358) was spacious and clean. Everything worked and it worked in a way that was intuitive - heating/air con, shower, TV. Room service was excellent. The hotel feels like it's very well managed. After three nights, I was actually sorry to be checking out! Very minor points: shower over bath rather than separate, but I couldn't really expect that for the price and it is a Victorian hotel; the price of a beer at the bar (£6.40) is a bit scary, but the evening pianist was pleasant; and the check-in was slightly slower than I would have liked - I recall this from my last visit too. But check-out was excellent, not just efficient but I was permitted a slightly delayed check-out time to fit my schedule. One notable positive was the peace and quiet: a great night's sleep, no banging & crashing from staff in the morning, no disturbance from housekeeping with the DND sign up, but the room was always perfectly made up when I returned from my meetings during the day. All in all, I would definitely recommend, and look forward to my next visit.",4,2015,01,16
121,Relaxing Gem,"I was looking for a hotel with character and a proper experience for my friends.  I was not disappointed.  This is a beautiful hotel staffed by very friendly, welcoming and unobtrusive people.  The rooms we had were clean, quiet and together (6th floor).  The breakfast was delightful and the pastries were clearly fresh.  Only minor thing was that some of the reception on some TV channels wasn't good, but I didn't mind - had a good book - and there was no pool or jaccuzi in the Wellness Centre.  Neither of these items detracted from a wonderful stay in a magnificent hotel.",5,2015,01,16
121,Loved it. ,"It's a lovely property in Westminster. Excellent location,  walking distance from tube station. plush hotel, restaurant is excellent. Rooms are spacious and well equipped,everything works as it should. Staff very helpful and courteous. Overall it was a very pleasant stay. ",5,2015,01,15
121,Great find!,"Found every aspect of this hotel to be above expectation. The staff were very helpful, the room comfortable and very clean. The location is perfect for sightseeing. Overall I would gladly recommend the St James Court.",5,2015,01,15
121,What a find!,"We booked this hotel through an advert from a booking company to celebrate a birthday with visits to Westminster Cathedral and Westminster Abbey - both a few minutes walk so great location and a big attraction. Beautiful interior, great reception and bars. Excellent room - very small  bathroom but adequate facilities, plenty of complimentary toiletries, overlooking the courtyard so very quiet. Read about the tube noise but didn't experience it! Exceptionally comfortable bed and pillows. We also ate in Bistro 51 in the evening, excellent food, great customer service skills! Breakfast was very good and a varied selection of food - both hot and cold. My biggest comment is that sachets of instant coffee in the room is very ordinary and could be improved upon, so many hotels of lower ratings now offer ground coffee sachets/bags which enhance the experience. In addition my wife drinks fruit infusions (not green tea) or peppermint tea which is now in abundant supply in many hotels but was not apparent at the St James Court, not even obvious at breakfast. Perhaps a couple of mint tea bags per room would be a bonus! Can't wait for the next occasion to stay!!",5,2015,01,14
121,"Outstanding, friendly & old school classy!","We treated ourselves to a night here as we were in London for an event & found a good offer for this hotel.
Having stayed at. 5* resort closer to home with some very snooty staff, I expected similar treatment (call it an inferiority complex if you like!) I couldn't, however, have been more wrong!
We arrived a few hours early & asked if we could leave our bags as we knew we were so early for check in. The man on reception told us it was no problem, he checked if any rooms were available & upgraded us to a suite for free as one was available! It was a very pleasant surprise! 
All the staff were absolutely lovely & couldn't do enough for us! We vowed to return!
This hotel is what I would describe as true class, where everyone is made to feel welcome and is given 5* treatment! Thankyou! ",5,2015,01,14
121,Pricey ,I really liked this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and close to Buckingham palace. A stones throw away from all major attractions. Quite pricey especially in US dollars. Rooms were clean and housekeeping came everyday. Service was mediocre but overall good experience.,4,2015,01,13
121,Unassuming and friendly service with courtyard gem.,"I went for a 2 night stay to this hotel with 3 friends for my birthday.  Having made us feel extremely welcome we were given 2 fabulous rooms on the end of a corridor that could be separated from the rest of the corridor by a fire door.  We were on the 6th floor so well away from the underground.  The beds were comfortable and rooms very lovely indeed.  We overlooked the courtyard which is a gorgeous oasis of calm and lovely to sit in even on a rainy January evening.  My room had cake and bubbly in it on arrival (thanks to my meddling friends!).  The cake was beautiful.  Couldn't have asked for more and the bubbly likewise.  We all had treatments in the Wellness Centre which didn't disappoint though I would say the steam room could have been bigger and it could do with a pool and/or jaccuzi, but otherwise extremely comfortable.   Breakfast was lovely and varied too and the service attentive without being claustrophobic.  The location is fabulous, just a short walk from Victoria (so easy to get to Gatwick by train) and walkable to many of the main sights including the West End.  Marvellous.",5,2015,01,13
121,"Great stay, best value for money, more than expected","Stayed 2 nights 9-11 Jan 2015, at the price paid everything was better than expected.What amazed me was how clean it was. Tube and deli next door, walk to buckinham and Big Ben , gym great, free wifi and breakfast, nice and safe area.",4,2015,01,13
121,Great for Prudential's RideLondon events!,"In 2013 and 2014, my friend and I stayed at the Taj while we participated in the RideLondon cycling event and it was terrific. I agree with the member who said it has improved since it has become the Taj. Everything was wonderful in 2013, but even more so in 2014. The manager knew we were returning in 2014 and contacted us ahead of time to see if we had any special requests. How nice! We plan to book again for 2015. The staff was speedy and helpful with everything we needed. The location is wonderful and there are many restaurants and attractions within walking distance. Very elegant and comfortable hotel.",5,2015,01,13
121,Exceptional hotel,"Stayed at the A Taj in early January and we were immediately made welcome by the friendly staff. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms spotless. The location is ideal, only a few minutes from Buckingham Palace yet in a very quiet spot. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone looking for something special.",5,2015,01,13
121,"Great Hotel, Great Location","This was our first time staying at this hotel and we were very glad we did. The location is great, 5 minutes from Buckingham Palace and easily walkable to the city centre, which we did each day. The hotel is located in a beautiful stunning building which was a hospital and a school in the past. Our room while it was small was very comfortable and in fact there was adequate room. We slept well and didn't hear a peep during the night. Breakfast is good, not amazing, but good. The staff were very very good and extremely professional. There was a queue for breakfast on Sunday morning but this was dealt with really well by staff. They communicated and explained the delays well but in fact we were waiting for 10 minutes tops and nobody minded. 
Really enjoyed our stay and we'll be back.",5,2015,01,12
121,"Needed a nudge, but delivered the goods in the end","I booked for my wife and I to celebrate our anniversary in early Jan - I wanted something both romantic but with a bit of grandeur...and I have to say St James' Court delivered.

They did need a few nudges - they forgot to add the requested rose petals in the room, and we had to queue for breakfast with a few over-run waitresses - and the hotel does seem to veer from areas that are resplendent and others that feel not quite up to scratch for a 4 star hotel.

But that aside, overall the setting was splendid, we were looked after as we would have hoped, and the room nicely appointed. Would definitely recommend to travellers looking for something similar.

P.S. We appreciated the upgrade to an executive (from classic) for our special occasion - and the unexpected piece of cake with 'Happy Anniversary' inscribed on the plate in chocolate. Nice touch :)",4,2015,01,12
121,Great just got better!,"I stayed here a year or so ago when it was under the Crowne Plaza flag and was impressed but candidly, it's move to Taj has improved on what was already a very impressive offering. 
Check in was swift, smiling and friendly.
As requested, a smoking room was delivered, that had no hint before I lit a Lucky of tobacco odour.
There was an almost over supply of toiletries, robes and niceties.
Room service quickly and efficiently delivered a large, reasonably priced Biryani to my room and whisked the empty tray away from my door within an hour.
Valet did a great job of buffing my Jeffrey Wests to a high sheen while I slept.
Breakfast was available from a cockerel waking six am and whist not spectacular it was a surprise inclusion in an already reasonable room rate.
Tube near enough for me to head into work with a walk so short that I hadn't finished my post breakfast fag.
Didn't use the spa or bar but prepared to bet that they would be tip top too.
Thank you Taj, I will see you again soon.",5,2015,01,10
121,"Really, really nice hotel","We stayed a week after Christmas and through New Years. Nice hotel, good service, location convenient to transit.  One nit.  I didn't come to watch TV, but come on you guys.  Have you ever tried clicking through 7 menus with a slooooow response time just to watch the BBC News?   Sad, sad, sad.  I know you guys really want to sell us porn, but can't you provide direct access to the TV channels and have to only access the pathetically slow menu-driven interface when we want non-TV services?  Junk this wart on the back of the TV which ruins your ability to simply select a channel.",4,2015,01,09
121,excellent location in London,"My husband and I stayed at St James, for the second time after seven years, between 29/12/2014 and 06/12/2015. I knew the location, that's why I choose again the hotel. It was a pleasant surprise since booking, because a called them to ask for the invoice and paying details and staff was very supportive and prompt.
When our holiday began, I had the pleasant surprise to see that we get an upgraded room, very clean, neat and plenty of space. The bathroom was clean, with good toiletries. Really the description on the hotel site match the reality.
The bar in the lobby had live piano music, good tea and a large assortment of drinks.
Regarding the accessibility of London attractions, it is in walking distance to Buckingham and St James Park, Green Park, Westminster, Trafalgar Square.
Wifi is amazingly fast and free.
I would highly recommend this hotel for a leisure trip.",5,2015,01,09
121,Taj Hotel St James,"Thank you so much to the Taj Hotel.  I had a wonderful three nights with my son over Christmas.  Lovely atmosphere, superb service, wonderfully clean and divinely comfortable. Really welcoming staff and perfect location.  The most memorable stay, wonderful restaurant, bar and cocktails!",5,2015,01,09
121,fabulous stay yet again,"this is a beautiful hotel. From the welcome,  to the friendly amazing team and great rooms especially their gorgeous suites  everyone just wants to make you happy. would highly recommend  to everyone you wont be disappointed . Thanks taj  Julie and Natalia beach see you very soon :)",5,2015,01,07
121,Great hotel!,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel on 22/12/2014 for a night.
Hotel was a short walk (3-4 min) from St James Station and very easy to find. Well you cant miss it as it looks so different and unique from other buildings around. 
Staff at the reception were very welcoming. After quick check in we went to our room which was upgraded. Room was clean, fresh and specious. 

Would definitely stay here again on my next visit to London.",5,2015,01,07
121,1001 nights,"This is an event, the charms and majic of the Orient transfered to London. Ideally situated, in walking distance from Victoria station if you want to save yourself a £ 5 taxi ride.Everything else,  which London is famous for, is also within easy reach from this haven, no need to worry about the weather either., there is plenty of lovely shelters in house to enjoy, the bar and restaurants which make you come back, particularly if, like us, you are  a lover of Indian cuisine. We had greetings to convey from the chefs of the Taj Exotica, Maldives. Not only is the resident chef an artist in his field who is able to throw a lavish table of spicy food at short notice, but he is of a winning friendliness and loves to shake hands with the appreciative guests. This is a hotel which aims at having happy guests and one can feel that all members of the management and the staff have been schooled in persuing this aim. They have achieved this with us and we have promised ourselves to return whenever there is an opportunity",5,2015,01,06
121,Perfectly delightful!,"We were in London for 3 nights over New Years to attend the Queen + Adam Lambert concert at Central Hall Westminster, and we chose this hotel because of its proximity.  We were so pleasantly delighted at everything about this establishment.  We arrived at noon exhausted from a flight across the pond, and our room was ready!  The service was excellent throughout.  Our executive room was spacious enough, immaculate, and well maintained.  The two restaurants we tried were excellent.  The bar and music on New Years Eve was an unexpected treat.  The location allowed us to walk to all the sights we wanted to explore.  We will be back whenever we need to be in London.",5,2015,01,05
121,Disappointment..much better to be found at the same price.,"First of all, let me say that I am well traveled and open to many different types of hotels. That being said, this hotel is not what it appears to be. While the location may appear to be ideal, it is only so for a few major attractions such as Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, for example. You will have a hard time finding a non chain owned pub or restaurant nearby. I don't mind taking a cab to find more appealing establishments, and that brings me to my next point. There is a distinct difference between being polite and helpful.  The staff was polite, but rarely helpful. I do my research ahead of time when I travel, but also rely heavily on the concierge of my hotel to assist in making decisions of where to eat and patronize. I was extremely disappointed in the selections of the concierges at the St James. It was as if they had a go to list (outdated, by the way) and would never stray from it. We specifically requested a Michelin star restaurant reservation for our anniversary on New Year's Eve and were met with a reservation at a no starred, but still nice, restaurant. The request, I admit, was two days before New Year's Eve, but our own research showed availability at a handful of Michelin starred restaurants. We would have just booked ourselves, but our experience has been above par service when booked by a concierge, and we were hoping for the same. Moving on, the rooms themselves were quite comfortable. The bed was nice and the bathroom well equipped with a tub/shower combo. The housekeeping service left much to be desired. Echoing an earlier review, used glasses etc were left in our room for days at a time. Not what I am accustomed to. I would not recommend staying here if you are accustomed to stellar service. ",3,2015,01,04
121,"Good Location, Tube Noise","My family stayed here in November and booked online. Reasonable rates for London.
Very good location with quick taxi ride from Waterloo station passing both Westminster Bridge, Abbey, Big Ben and Houses of Parliament.
Nice welcome from door staff. Reception area is ornate and large - plenty of seating too.
But check in at reception was slow and muddled. Took time to select our rooms - even though we arrived at 18:00. 15 minute experience.
Upstairs is a bit like at rabbit warren. Loads of steps up and down and not easy to navigate.
The room we were provided was dated and smelly - this was changed for us whilst we dined downstairs at the Hotels' Bistro.
We then went out to a gig at the 02 and came back late (11:45pm).
At this time the street outside was quiet, but we heard distinct rumble sounds throughout the night.
Really off-putting. Not easy to get to sleep, but we managed to do this at 2:00am.
Room itself was clean, large and bathroom was clean too.
Comfortable bed.",3,2015,01,04
121,Ambiguous experience,"When reading this review, please keep in mind the X ...but... Y structure:
1) We booked two nights in this hotel in separate orders (due to spontaneous outburst) and informed the hotel reception beforehand so we can stay in the same room - they replied immediately that there is no problem. So I guess it is safe to say that the hotel online service is great... but... they didn't inform us about the massive construction work in the hotel area and about the shutdown of the nearby tube station!
2) We were upgraded to an executive room, which is large and comfortable. The room was elegant, not too fancy but really more than enough for a nice stay... but.... the shower glass door couldn't be closed and the shower handles (for the water temperature and current strength) kept falling apart upon the lightest touch.
3) Breakfast was included in our price so I feel dishonest complaining about how relatively poor it was, but I'll just have you know that if you have cravings for a delicious breakfast - eat elsewhere.
4) Staff members were overall nice and approachable... but...  concierge was somewhat not as friendly as past experiences would suggest (in London or elsewhere) and didn't show much knowledge.
5) We had a free wifi connection (and a paid one). We chose the free, which worked great throughout the hotel facilities... but... it was a bad reminder of the old adsl 256k connection.

Overall, I would not go back to this hotel because there are better hotels at the same price range on better locations... but... should the tube station construction be done and you need to stay in that area - in this scenario I recommend it.",3,2015,01,04
121,Pleasant Stay,"Really beautiful hotel, literally down the road from Buckingham palace, and if you go the other way, you're a short walk from the London eye! We stayed in a king size room which was lovely and the bed was extremely comfy! The staff are all very friendly and welcoming. After having watched the new years eve fireworks, we walked back to the hotel to find a jazz trio on! Amazing! The only thing about this hotel is the outrageously expensive hotel bar. £24 for two drinks. Although, i guess that's what you would expect in a posh hotel such as this one! We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again :)",4,2015,01,03
121,Excellent location and very helpful staff.,Location was excellent easily to get to most popular sights. Staff were very helpful and changed our double room to twin room without extra pay. Breakfest was good. Quite big sortiment. Nice view out of window to garden. Beautiful building.,4,2015,01,03
121,"Very good location, comfort, service","London was very busy on New Year's Eve. So was this hotel. However the service remained excellent and the hotel comfortable.  A good location, although the pedestrian diversions on the busy evening required a scenic route back.

This was our third stay, the first under the new branding ( previously Crowne Plaza). Excellent. Recommended ",5,2015,01,03
121,Lovely central hotel,"The staff were really helpful and when we had a problem with out room changed it without any fuss. There was a lovely atmosphere in The Hamptons bar. We only stayed one night but wouldn't hesitate to book again.  Not the biggest rooms, but very well appointed. ",5,2015,01,03
121,nice retreat from London crowds,"We did not realize London would be so busy between Christmas and New Years, and we found the St James Hotel to be an easy escape from the hordes. The room was a good size and staff were friendly. We opted for breakfast, which was fine standard fare. The hotel is very close to Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace and the metro as well as the buses. Convenient and comfortable.",5,2015,01,02
121,3+ Just misses on many levels,"I expected so much more.  The hotel is in a terrific location, just minutes to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.  The hotel staff was very polite, but not what one would call friendly.  In fact, when I entered the lobby alone, I was completely ignored by available staff.  When asked questions about how to reach certain sights, they ""kindly forgot"" to tell us that neither the Central nor District lines were not operating and did not offer alternative suggestions on how to reach our destinations.  A promised upgrade was not honored, the excuse being that I had asked for a room near family and that I was only a party of one when other people with more in their party deserved a larger room. The executive family rooms the rest of my party had were nice with separate sleeping and sitting areas. Often one had to search for a concierge or bellman for assistance.  Breakfast was in quite a noisy room with no tablecloths to soften the noise.  Service stations were set up throughout which increased the noise level at breakfast. The breakfast staff was easily flustered, clanging and breaking dishes, rushing around, and hard pressed to serve hot or fresh coffee.  The hosts were quite brusque, even telling me no seating was available when I could see empty tables yet to be set.  The selections at breakfast were many:  eggs, fruit, cereals, meats, ham, sausages, etc.  Pastries were not fresh, and condiments on the table were often not refilled or replaced.  Maid service in the rooms was neglectful of removing used glasses, letting ""hot"" chocolate and empty wine glasses stay in the room for 3 days; however, the turn-down service was nice.  Our ""executive"" rooms were quiet, had been completely refurbished, and had lovely bathrooms.  However, again, the hallway carpeting and paint needed to be refreshed. St James Court has the potential to be a 5 star hotel, but the service and some of the facility will have to be vastly improved.  It's the little things that make a difference in a hotel.",3,2015,01,01
121,"Excellent service, superb hotel!","Stayed from 27th to 29th December, booked the hotel after reviewing many in London and room sizes, location etc and on arrival the hotel exceeded our expectations.  Reception staff were extremely helpful and Michaela very kindly upgraded our room (I had already reserved an upgrade from classic double to classic king but we were given an executive king on the second floor).  The room was spacious and clean as was the bathroom, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable.
Location for us was great as 15-20 mins walk we were in winter wonderland at Hyde Park and on the Sunday it took about 25 mins to walk to Leicester Square.  We are not fans of the tube and enjoy to walk but the tube is only a couple of mins walk away.  Breakfast was very good and plenty of it, the bistro staff were all extremely courteous and service was fantastic.  Overall we had an extremely pleasant stay at the St James Court hotel and would definitely stay again, thanks for a lovely post Christmas break.",5,2014,12,31
121,Excellent Hotel - Excellent Location,"My Mom and I went on a once in a lifetime trip to London and Paris in September 2014 and stayed at St. James Court.  It was the PERFECT location, easy walk to Buckingham Palace (less than 5 min walk).  It was also an easy walk to Westminster Abby, Parliament, Parks etc.  It was also a short walk to the Tube to get to locations further away.  As for the Hotel, I cannot express how much we enjoyed staying there.  It is beautiful inside and out! The room was very clean and we had plenty of space.  We were on one of the upper floors so there was no street noise.  The hotel staff was wonderful and so helpful when we had questions or needed assistance.  My Mom and I were on the go most of the day into the evening so we never ate at the hotel.  We did eat at a deli and a restaurant across from the hotel and both were great.  We also found a great little convenience store next to the hotel which was nice to have to pick up a few snacks etc.  We had a wonderful time in London and if we ever have the opportunity to return we would definitely stay at St. James Court again!",5,2014,12,30
121,Staying at the New Taj in London !,Always a good stay with great Staff !  Like the fact you can walk to most famous London locations.  This was a Crowne Plaza run by the Taj group and was a superior Crowne Plaza experience./  Now it is a Taj experience.  The Quilon which is a Taj restaurant next door serves excellent Kerala food in the best ambience possible.,5,2014,12,29
121,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed one night on business and found the hotel excellent. The staff were very efficient, room lovely and had a great night's sleep (floor 5). I would be very happy to stay again- either for business or pleasure.",5,2014,12,29
121,Makes for a special mini-break,"The location is wonderful for a central London mini-break. It is right by StJames' and Green Parks, Buckingham Palace and lots of other landmarks and well as being in easy reach of the West End. 
The decor is beautiful and luxurious and the hotel smells lovely (kind of like orange blossom) everywhere!  Best of all, the staff are so welcoming, friendly, helpful and super-polite.  The whole experience makes you feel special. 
There is a lovely spa with the gym, sauna, steam room, showers and relaxation lounge all free to use for guests. Our room was quite small but it overlooked the courtyard and was very quiet.  The bed & bedding were soft and comfortable. We had a fantastic meal at the hotel's Michelin starred Indian restaurant, Quilon, which was an experience in itself.",4,2014,12,29
121,Another wonderful Taj experience,"We continued the wonderful Taj experiences we had on a recent trip to India by once again being
delighted in London.  Of course the St. James' Court is wonderfully situated practically around the
corner from Buckingham Palace.  It is easy to walk everywhere.  But what makes the stay special
is the staff who are all incredibly friendly, helpful and polite.  They have an excellent and generous
breakfast buffet and a great Afternoon Tea and a bar with a pianist.  The rooms are small but
adequate.  We plan to stay here in the future.",5,2014,12,28
121,The Best,"This is a wonderful property!  The location is only 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace and you can walk forever, or take the tube.  My special requests were honored and confirmed by email immediately.  Our room was beautiful and so well appointed.  We spent Christmas Day here and from breakfast through dinner, we enjoyed everything.  The bar is cozy and the bartenders are great.  Food in the bar was very good.  Bistro 51 has an excellent breakfast.  We had Christmas dinner at Bistro 51 and it was perfect.  The staff at the hotel and the restaurants are the best.  We were at the end of a very long trip and this was the perfect ending.",5,2014,12,28
121,A great stay with top service.,Just got back from a great stay here. I stay in lots of hotels in London and I am impressed with this one. Great location for tourists (literally a minutes walk from Buckingham palace). special mention must go to the staff who offered some of the best service I had had in London. from staff at check in to concierge. Thank you.,4,2014,12,25
121,Why not!!! ,"It is really special to find an hotel and all its employees in the why not mode!!! Every thing you might need or wish is possible in this hotel, the buffet breakfast delicious, and for all kinds of taste and diets! having 3 top restaurants is also a PLUS!!! The bar with music almost all day long, charming! 
The st james underground station just 2 min walking, London Victoria with train and underground service also perfect to commute everywhere!  
Just the mattress, just fine, i would expect something more comfortable!!!

121,Excellent stay - beautiful hotel,"I stayed here for 3 nights just before Christmas. What a lovely hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, very classy and posh. We were offered a free upgrade on arrival to an executive room on the top floor of the hotel. The room was great; the bed was huge and extremely comfy as well as everything being spotlessly cleaned every day. All the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. Anything you asked they would do for you. Very professional. The hotel is a five minute walk from Buckingham Palace and Big Ben and had some lovely restaurants/cafe bars close by. Definately considering returning already. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2014,12,22
121,Luxury in London,"Have to be honest and say that I only chose this hotel due to a preferential rate after seeing a show at the Victoria Royal Palace Theatre. But having said that, what a wonderful treat the hotel was. It was spacious, spotless, with well equipped room, lovely polite staff, free wi-fi and plenty of breakfast choice. The stay was booked as part of a birthday weekend, and the hotel even provided a lovely birthday cake for the room and a free upgrade! Thanks to the manager and all staff for a great stay, would love to return.",5,2014,12,21
121,Very nice rooms could use a bit of a refresh,"Only thing we didn't like is that we can hear the tube, feel the vibrations from our room.... Our room is a bit run down but otherwise hotel is lovely. It is also really well located only a five minute walk from Big Ben.",4,2014,12,20
121,Location is ok,"Me and my wife stayed here for one night. 
The pro's ...are the location. It's near Buckingham Palace and very close to the underground. We enjoyed the walk across Green Park. The lobby is quite nice and the staff were very polite.
The con's ... Our room on the first floor must have been directly over the tube. We could hear the rumble every few minutes. The room was very small. The hallways were looking very old and in need of a refurb'. The shower didn't have hot water and we had house keeping knock on my door at 9am. This may not be too early for some, but it's nice to have a choice of a lie in! Especially after a night out!",3,2014,12,14
121,Excellent hotel but avoid 1st floor ....,"Really enjoyed our stay but if anyone is going to stay there in the future please avoid the ground floor as you will hear the underground throughout and it loud, other than that can't fault the hotel
We will definitely be staying here again as the location was perfect also.",5,2014,12,14
121,Pleasant stay in a quality hotel,Very helpful staff who were always polite and cheerful. The room was very good for its category (classic king) with plenty of space and comfort (ask for 774). The complimentary features are very welcome and plentiful. The only slight downside was the shower was not a walk in but over the bath and it was not the best of its kind. Breakfast is a well stocked buffet which was well served and excellent value for money. I wouldn't hesitate to return.,5,2014,12,14
121,Different in a good way,"Actually I ended up sleeping here by coincidence. My travel agent made a mistake as I wanted to stay at Taj 51 next door. So initially I actually was irritated to be at their doorstep as I didn't want to stay in just another business hotel. Despite the fact that the mistake clearly was made by the travel agent, the staff was very accommodating and went out of their way to apologise and even offered finding a place next door. As it was fully booked I decided to stay for the night here. What a pleasant surprise, a large room, refurbished and nice. A beautiful building and excellent gym. Cherry on top: roomservice that allows you to order from the menu of their 1 star Indian restaurant, Michelin star room service,... Now here's a first. But not the last time as I am sure next time I need to stay in London for business it will be here,... I found my spot. And thank you Taj personnel (Martijn and the front desk manager) for being so friendly when I was annoyed,.. I entered with a grim face but left with a smile. Your hotel deserves a great rating for being different and authentic. ",5,2014,12,13
121,"VERY NICE HOTEL, super central location","The hotel is very well decorated in the lobby, you feel the indian touch.
The Breakfast room is really really nice and the breakfast is rich and good.

The rooms are well decorated and with a lot of attention to details, with all the amenities that you need. 
The location is amazing to explore London because is very near to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Harrods and the tube station of St James' park.

the only flaw was the noise of air conditioners (I've had a room on the courtyard: not the perfect view)",4,2014,12,12
121,Great hotel,"we stayed there only for 1 night but I had the feeling that the hotel was great.
atmosphere, staff, cleanliness, room was comfortable, bathroom great..
we had all what we need.
the staff most of all is really helpful and nice.
I would absolutely go back for one more night.",5,2014,12,12
121,Immaculate city centre hotel,"larger bedrooms than most london City Central hotels.  This hotel has a lovely feel to it.  The queue for breakfast was a bit crazy but apologies were given so possibly not a usual event, it was clearly very busy.  Breakfast was quite good, gorgeous fresh orange juice, more of a cafe feel than a restaurant.",5,2014,12,11
121,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed here for one night, to enjoy a full weekend in London. We arrived too early to check in, but the concierge was happy to look after our bags until we returned later. The room was larger than we expected, and very quiet, and although we couldn't work out the controls of the air-con system, it kept us at the right sort of temperature. We ate out, but had a drink in the bar towards the end of the evening, and the ambiance was very pleasant, with prices very reasonable for this quality of hotel. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",4,2014,12,11
121,"Great location,Great service.","I booked this room as classic twin room,The stay was fabulous!
This hotel is approximately 5-6minutes far from Buckingham palace by step,so It was comfortable to reach city centre.
Entrance looks like million dollars hotel, and the room and reception was beautiful.
There were a little stale smell at corridor,but it was just little so I can bear it.
The day of departure,I left the jacket in there,but they sent it to my house!
I was impressed at this level of service,so I  already made reservations again at this hotel!",5,2014,12,09
121,An excellent hotel,"We loved this hotel!  a one night stay on a visit to london for a west end show. from the moment we walked in to the time we left we were extremely well looked after, the room was very comfortable and spacious. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the aircon/heating actually worked,  We had cocktails before bed that were a delight, the associates were charming and respectful but with a welcome humour that can be lacking in some good hotels.",5,2014,12,08
121,Pleasant Experience,"We booked a room from Hotel.com and got a good deal. After checking in the room on fifth floor and spending some time, we got to know the Tube runs right under the hotel. Every time the train pass it makes shattering noise and felt a lot of vibrations. Which was pretty irritating in just 10 mins. After requesting for the solution front desk were helpful and we got our room changed to seventh floor. The new room was quite peaceful. We ordered In Room Dining an Indian dish for dinner, which tasted awesome. Next day ordered Indian breakfast which was ""Upma"" and that tasted horrible. Overall a good and expected 'Taj' experience.",4,2014,12,08
121,Good hotel and great location,stayed here on a 1 night break and enjoyed the stay. Room was nice and quiet and breakfast had good selection although bacon was poor. Great location for central London and easy access from the tube but we also found that you needed to book in advance as several restaurants we tried on spec were all booked up so plan ahead especially with the festive season upon us.,4,2014,12,08
121,"A disappointing experience.. cold, noisy, small room with awful views","Myself and my girlfriend spent 3 nights in London, choosing a hotel at the airport for our first and final nights and opting for a more central ""fancy"" hotel for our 2nd night as a bit of a treat. We booked an Executive Double Room for 1 night at The Taj St. James Court and were really looking forward to staying in such a highly rated and classy hotel. It was however a very disappointing experience from the moment we walked in the door to walking out.

We arrived at the hotel and proceeded to where we believed the entrance was based on the pictures on the website.. this was in fact the entrance to the courtyard and not the main entrance to the hotel. We were stopped by a member of staff who refused us access and after a couple of attempts trying to explain we were trying to check in where then told we were in the wrong place and had to walk a little further down below the Union Jack flag to enter and check-in.

We entered the hotel and were greeted by a concierge who then directed us to the main desk to check-in. We joined a queue of people and stood their waiting patiently. After a while other guests arrived and stood behind us.. THEY were then ushered over to the desk by a receptionist advising that there wasn't a queue. We made our presence known and said we were waiting to be served and no one had even acknowledged us and were told to wait while they served these other guests. Another member of staff became available and checked us in. 

The check in time took a while despite us having everything booked and paid for upfront. While waiting other guests arrived and we listened to them being checked in, the person dealing with them seemed friendly asking them how they were and what their plans were and had them checked in pretty swiftly. The receptionist we had hardly said a word to us and the whole process took quite a while.. not the worst thing in the world but having already stood around having been overlooked and then seeing other guests arrive after you and be checked in before you it doesn't leave you feeling ""special"" as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.

We arrived at our room, number 702.. my girlfriend struggle to open the door since the doors are pretty heavy but with a bit of help from myself we walked into the room and I saw her face drop in disappointment. We had come from an airport hotel and had been looking forward to staying in a ""luxury hotel"", the room we walked into was very small and very little space to move. In order to get from once side of the room to the other we literally had to climb across the bed because the space between the end of the bed and the unit that the small TV was sitting on was so narrow that on my first attempt to squeeze past I bruised my shin hitting it against the drawer handles.

We put our bags down and opened the curtains in the hope of looking out on the courtyard below.. we were disappointed again, not only could we not see the courtyard, all we could see was green algae stained stonework and directly across from us a very ugly, what seemed to be a burnt out, roof top air-conditioning unit. We had only been in our room for 1 minute and our luxury hotel experience was already so bad my girlfriend was asking if we could leave and check into the hotel we had just left from at the airport!

We left the hotel to do a little sight-seeing and go for a meal. We had planned on eating in the hotel but after our initial experience we decided not to.

On returning to the hotel we went up to our room and while my girlfriend went to have a shower I tried to find a movie to watch on the TV. The TV in the room was very poor quality, the picture was very bad and there were no movie channels or Pay-TV as I was expecting. I looked through the hotel booklet within the room and although there was reference to In-Room Entertainment when going to look at the pages in the booklet they had been removed and nothing was mentioned. There was nothing on the TV either so assume either the room doesn't have this or the hotel doesn't offer this any longer. I had a USB stick with my own movies on it so though I would try this since it said a Media Hub was attached to the TV. On the wall there was an HDMI port and a USB port but the USB did not allow me to display anything on the TV, it seemed only to work for charging my mobile phone. We ended up just putting E4 on and started to watch a movie with a very poor quality picture. Halfway through the movie however the TV just switched off.. this wasn't a loss really so we just gave up on it and left the TV off. This wasn't the last of the TV however.. throughout the night the TV came on by itself twice waking us up. In the morning I wanted to get the news but when we turned it back on the system looked like it may have been reset since it was asking us to select a language.. I wasn't going to waste any time with it though so just turned it off again.

The room was VERY cold. I must emphasise this.. VERY cold. The room has a A/C heater control outside the bathroom and despite setting the temperature up to the max no heat was coming from the system. Additionally, the fan was very noisy even on the lowest fan setting. I even went as far as downloading a copy of the heating control manual since it was not explained within the room anywhere, a Daikin BRC2C51, but this just confirmed that what I was doing was correct but still the heating was just not working. All night the room was very cold and uncomfortable. We woke up during the night not just from the TV coming on as mentioned above but due to the coldness felt as my feet stuck out the bottom of the bed. My girlfriend was shivering throughout the night and woke up believing she was ill due to this.

The bathroom initially looked very nice but it also had it's flaws. I'm not a big person by all means however struggled to use the shower without banging my arms and elbows against the in-bath safety bar and the rack for placing my toiletries on. The shower door was very stiff to open, again I had to open this for my girlfriend and had to use 2 hands and pull very hard. There is not much space to get in and out of the shower, the door opens out over the toilet and floor meaning water drips all over the floor making it very hazardous with a chance of slipping.

We never made use of the hotel facilities such as the Fitness Centre or Health Suite since we were only staying the 1 night. The lobby of the hotel looked very nice and when we arrived back the hotel in the evening we saw then setting up to play live music in there also but did not stay to listen. We never saw the court yard at all and wonder if perhaps had we used all the facilities that maybe we would have thought more highly of the hotel however as it stands for a single nights stay I cannot recommend this to anyone based on our experience.

Ultimately the service was poor, the room was cold and noisy with very poor views and even if the room was the stated size then the way the bed and furniture has been arranged made it feel too crammed together making it uncomfortable. We did not get a decent sleep at all here and left unhappy despite believing prior to our arrival that this would be the highlight of our trip.

A very disappointing experience.",3,2014,12,08
121,Just exellent,"This is a highly recommended hotel !  The staff were very accommodating, special thank you to Michaela, who helped us with all our request, and provide to us a really professional service.    The room was spacious and well equipped for comfort. The location of the hotel is excellent, just 10 mints walk from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Palace and many others of London 's  attractions. I also want to say thank you to Michelle Housekeeping Office Coordinator for her immediate help. I forgot my ring in the room and called back to the hotel on  the next day from home. I sent email to Michelle with my address and she sent me my ring. The service and staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful.
 I would defiantly recommend this hotel and would come and stay again.",5,2014,12,07
121,"Good, but not great","Booked for a 3 night stay in early December, and booked a superior room. Arrived at the room, which had been upgraded, to find a fairly small room, similar to that found at a Premier Inn or Holiday Inn. Asked for something a little bigger, and we were moved to a bigger room for the second and third nights. Found no plug in the basin, but years of travelling in Eastern Europe meant that I had one in my washbag! Reception did send one within an hour. 

We rang concierge to book a taxi to take us to Drury Lane for a show, and were told that there was no need to book, as taxis were available at the front door. Arriving at the front door we found ourselves behind a gentleman who had been waiting for 10 minutes, and we missed the first part of the show as we too had to wait for 10 minutes. If concierge state that there is no need to book, then they need to ensure that there are taxis available.

We ate in the restaurant on Saturday night, delicious food, but rather a spoiled evening as it appears that it is now common to add 12.5% 'discretionary' service charge to each bill. To add a tip to the bill leaves the diner with the choice of asking for it to be removed, or paying a tip. I prefer to leave a tip when I feel that the service/dinner is above average. The MD stated that as staff were on minimum age the 'discretionary' service charge was essential!! Perhaps this is now becoming the 'norm', but I find it distasteful and greedy.

Overall, perfectly adequate but not memorable for the right reasons.",3,2014,12,07
121,Perfect Anniversary!,"My wife and I booked this hotel for the 6th December and we could not have found a better hotel to suit our needs. From the moment we booked the service was amazing and we were delighted with our room which made the stay absolutely perfect and truly memorable.

The hotel has to be commended on its team from reception through to the Hampton Bar and room service - all deserve recognition for their ability to make each guests stay enjoyable and comfortable!

We will certainly book this again in January 2015 for a birthday celebration especially as the location is ideal for Theatre trips.

Well done and looking forward to the next visit.",5,2014,12,07
121,Lovely Stay for the London Marathon!,"Our stay was amazing.  We were in London for the Marathon in April and it was a perfect location.  Rooms were wonderful and services was spectacular.  The Concierge ""Fred"" was the most helpful and gracious person we have met.  He was ""The Best""!  Highly recommend this hotel and we will be back!!!",5,2014,12,07
121,Changed Hands,"Although it has changed hands the staff and the food was still excellent , the room that Ireceived was very good after a short email to the manager he met my requirement as I am disabled and have a phobia about lifts but he always takes that on board . I would recommend this hotel just sitting in reception is a luxury itself so beautiful , one small thing and it is small when I was there the usual beautiful display of flowers weren't as good as over the years , they were brown and looked like they were dying but apart from that everything perfect",4,2014,12,05
121,Fantastic hotel and bargains to be had!,"We have stopped at this hotel a few times now (booked through the discounted hotel sites so got great rates).Both times we were impressed by the quality of the rooms and their size (compared to many London hotels).
Our last stay was early December and we were treated to hearing ""Carols in the courtyard"" Their courtyard is worth having a look round it was beautifully decorated with artificial snow and Christmas touches - magical!
",5,2014,12,04
121,Just excellent....,"We made a late decision to spend a weekend in London and were struggling to find a room in our budget, for a hotel in a good location. We found this hotel on HotelDirect, when other sites were saying it was full. HotelDirect's handling of the booking, information and subsequent confirmations were first class - we'll certainly use them again.
The hotel was brilliant in every respect - reception really helpful - we arrived quite early - they were friendly, welcoming, and really helpful, sorting out our luggage so that we could enjoy the most of our time rather than wait for the room to become available at the proper check in time.
The room was large, clean, comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast (which was included) was a buffet, - the food was well presented, hot and an excellant selection. There was no rush to encourage you  check out early.
The location is excellent - easy walking distance to Victoria Station, and a nice stroll down the Mall in central London
The price, at under £200 for 2 people, including breakfast for this quality, in this location, is a bargain.
We will return...........",5,2014,12,03
121,"Small Room, Dreadful View, Good Breakfast at a Cost - overated","Admittedly this was booked through a hotel booking site and was greatly reduced.  I would have been sorely disappointed if I had been charged the full £500 plus per night rack rate!  The hotel was a maze of corridors and the room was small overlooking what looked like a school games court and next door to a massive building site.  Luckily our stay was for a Saturday evening so we had minimal noise from the site.  On arrival the beds had not been configured as requested but this was dealt with quickly and efficiently.  The room had all of the amenities you would expect from a hotel of this standard it just felt dated and it didn't have that extra wow factor.  The bathroom was quite shabby and the shower was so high up and not movable it was difficult to shower without getting your hair soaking in the process.  The breakfast was very good but extra at c£20 per person so you would expect it to be!

All in all I would have expected a lot more from a hotel with this type of high profile reputation and would rather opt for smaller establishments that go the extra mile in their rooms and facilities. I would not recommend this hotel as a must stay in…",3,2014,12,03
121,Absolute Luxury,"What a find! This hotel has so many well trained members of staff who are all very courteous, helpful, professional, yet not overbearing.
The hotel is so tranquil with understated luxury and quiet hospitality that could go unnoticed to a busy guest. The rooms are wonderful as is the food, certainly room service was. They seem to think of everything including a bucket of ice at turndown time, ready for our return - a lovely touch and very welcome.
Sunaina Soares the Asst Front Office Manager could not have been more helpful, she found us a room very quickly, as i was not feeling very well and was glad to find my bed for the afternoon.
We have a 30th wedding anniversary coming up next year and we have already decided where we will be spending that!",5,2014,12,03
121,Low value-for money,"while the location in central London is really nice, given the price, I would have expected the rooms to be a bit more upscale. My room smelled damp and felt like it could use some updating (e.g. tiling in the bathroom).

At a rate of 449 pounds a night, I would have simply expected the hotel to do better than the average B&B in the area, which I have not found to be the case.

Staff tried to be helpful and look for another room for me but the theme was pretty consistent across all the rooms they showed me (I think I was in a classic room...).",2,2014,12,02
121,Weekend in London,After moving from another hotel at nearly midnight we were treated so well here. Checked in and given a lovely comfortable room. We had the breakfast buffet which was very good though busy. It was close to Victoria Station. The whole hotel was very attractive with friendly and helpful staff. We also had late drinks at the bar which were served efficiently . Apart from the fire alarm going off early Saturday morning for a short time we found the room quiet .We stayed 2 nights and would return again .,5,2014,12,02
121,One of the best hotels I've stayed at,"This hotel is an experience. I've stayed at a few 4* hotels in London now as a little treat to myself to get out of a busy flatshare. As soon as you walk in you get a little taste of how the other half live. The staff made the biggest difference. The reception staff member who checked me in (wish I had gotten his name!) was the best I've encountered in London. He was friendly, helpfully, and ever so polite. Even a maintenance man I pasted on the way to my room was very polite, calling me mam and the whole shebang. The room was also lovely, with great little touches like little chocolates and a bath robe. It wasn't the biggest room I've had but it was more than adequate. The bath was lovely and I really enjoyed a relaxing night with my boyfriend. It truly felt like I was spoilt even if it was only for one night.",5,2014,12,02
121,Everything you need,"I stayed here for one night on a business trip and was entirely satisfied. I wouldn't call it a luxury hotel but it is certainly of a high standard and has everything you need. My room overlooking the pleasant courtyard, unlike the ubiquitous  air conditioning shaft, was spacious and well furnished. It was the opposite of modern but that suits me OK for this sort of trip. I ate at one of the restaurants, Bistro, which was also of a high quality with pleasant staff. I carelessly forgot my phone charger but the reception staff helped me out with that too. I thought breakfast was a bit on the expensive side so I nipped across the road to a cafe. I don't know what the regular price is----probably quite high---- but I had a good deal from a booking website at £159 for a Monday night so  no complaints about that either.",4,2014,12,02
121,Pleasant enough but not WOW!,"We had a short 2 day stay.  Staff very pleasant and helpful.  The bar was pleasant and busy in the evenings with a pianist providing atmosphere.  The location is good with tubes very close by.  
Unfortunately our bedroom was at the back on the 1st floor so we had both the noisy construction site and the tube noise.  The bathroom was quite cramped, noisy and cold - I gather that the heating had not been turned on yet and there were only old steel windows (no double glazing) which didn't help.",3,2014,12,02
121,Birthday Weekend!,"We stayed this Saturday night for my birthday, my partner arranged a show and a hotel!! The hotel was lovely, the staff was so friendly and were happy to help if we needed anything!! Our room was clean and spacy and we was all very close to all attractions which I wanted to see!
The buffet breakfast was very nice too! I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would also stay here again!! x",5,2014,12,01
121,Just lovely,"Everything about it was just perfect. From the minute I arranged the stay to moment we departed.  The staff were very attentive,  the room was perfect. My wife was just in heaven. A few more nights the next time we stay over.",5,2014,11,30
121,Business & Pleasure,"Work called in London and circumstances dictated that my wife accompanied me as well. 
Good Hotel, service excellent and the room large and comfortable.

Well situated in Victoria and Buckingham Palace area.

One area which was not to my liking but resolved  and responded to in a positive manner by Management.

Would certainly return as staff attentive and pleasant. 

Breakfast was excellent",4,2014,11,30
121,Interesting for a british experience in london,I was here for a business travel. The hotel is located very close to Victoria station and right behind Buckingham Palace. The place is extremely beautiful and comfortable. Breakfast is very well organized and the buffet is worth to try,4,2014,11,30
121,Great location! Lovely stay!,"We stayed here for one night and the hotel was great! Staff were absolutely amazing, especially at the concierge desk! There was a young man named Ivanstez (I think) and he brought our luggage up to our room really quickly and then fetched our luggage from the luggage room when we were leaving! He was really polite and a great asset to the hotel! The hotel itself is really beautiful. The courtyard was lovely and the hotel bar also! We didn't eat in the hotel as we had prior arrangements but the food menu looked great! I would definitely stay here again! Our room was great also and looked out onto the courtyard! ",5,2014,11,29
121,ExcellenH,"This was our second visit to this hotel, our first was exceptional so we thought we would give it another try. Wow and was it worth it, this hotel must be the best in the Capital, all the staff are friendly and helpful, the surroundings are out of this world, and the location, ideal.  The receptionist at check-in knew we had stayed before, as did the girl booking us in for breakfast. I cannot praise this hotel enough. We travel a fair bit, and credit where it's due this hotel is top class. Thank you to all the staff that made our stay outstanding.",5,2014,11,27
121,Excellent hotel,"I stayed for 2 nights in mid-November 2014. Greeted by friendly staff, efficient check-in, and promptly ushered to me room. I got a spacious room, well furnished and well lighted. The location of the hotel is excellent, just 10 mins walk from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Palace another 15 minutes further. There are a lot of those tour buses on the way as well, so you can basically hop onto one, and made your exploration of London. The tube station is also a very short walk away as well. Breakfast selection is full English breakfast, and more than satisfactory for me. Recommended hotel!

My gripe:

Lighting control, in my room it will be either all lights on, or all lights off",5,2014,11,27
121,A bit dissapointing,"I arrived approx. 6pm on a Saturday Evening, very wet and looking forward to reaching my room and a cup of coffee. My bags were in the hotel before I had stepped out of the taxi. Check in took a while, much longer than I expected as there was only one receptionist on duty. I took the opportunity to look around the reception and foyer area...loved what I saw. Plush!! Eventually I was checked in and shown across the courtyard to the annex where my room was located. Room was comfortable and clean. My companion was already there so really checking in shouldn't have taken so long. Next day after a day in London for the Remembrance Day Parade we returned to the room to find it hadn't been cleaned or refreshed...rather disappointing given the 5 stars!  We had to ring down and ask for the room to be refreshed. Nice surroundings though and seemed to be lots of entertainment. Staff were welcoming but I felt a tip was expected every time. I didn't although I did tip the lady that came up and cleaned the room as she had just come on duty and it wasn't her fault. Also found that the bath would not dratin..this was reported and fixed but the maintenance staff had left the old drain fitting on the side of the bath.",4,2014,11,26
121,Perfect hotel for exploring the West End,"This is a highly recommended hotel.  The staff were accommodating the minute we stepped through the doors.  I'd also requested a room with a good view on account of it being my civil partners birthday which was acknowledged without a prompt upon booking in at the reception.  The room was spacious and well equipped for comfort.  The feel of the hotel is decadent and we made use of the spa facilities.  Once returning from an evening out in the Covent Garden area there was a lovely dessert in the room with happy birthday written on it, this was a lovely touch and partner and I thouroughly enjoyed it here, we didn't want to check out.",5,2014,11,25
121,Fantastic family friendly hotel,"A family 2 day visit to London. The hotel was very welcoming, a fantastic childrens pack on arrival which our 3 year old was thrilled with. All staff warm & attentive. Will definitely stay again & recommend. Thank you :) ",4,2014,11,24
121,Good location for one night stay,"Overnight stay in a classic room - entrance, reception and ""public"" areas all very impressive and up to date.  sadly classic room we stayed in was not.   long long walk from elevator, tired decor to room, room decor dated as well and the smallest bathroom I have ever experienced.     Real shame as this hotel is in a good location and held great promise from initial searches.    However as we only stayed for one night no harm done but not keen to retry.  Staff were very  helpful.

121,Excellent customer service,"Lovely hotel with friendly and accommodating staff. 
I stayed in an Executive King room which was decorated and furnished to a high standard. The only slight problem I had was the lock on my room was faulty which meant on a few occasions I couldn't get into my room which resulted in me having to return to Recpetion to get new key cards programmed. 
Special thanks to Mr Vikram Vijay the Reception Manager who provided first class customer service when checking out and offered sincere apologies for the problems I had encountered with my hotel door.
Highly recommended hotel and I will certainly stay in the future.",5,2014,11,20
121,First Impressions matter,"We stayed here as part of a garden tour organised by an Australian travel company, while we visited the Chelsea flower show and other gardens in London. The hotel itself is well located and the public rooms are nicely decorated. The staff were generally helpful, but our whole experience was marred by the check in experience and our allocation of rooms. The travel company had agents who had been onsite for a couple of days, to facilitate  the check in of our group. Despite their best efforts, however, our rooms were not all ready on our arrival at the time specified by the hotel. Some people were allocated to their rooms quite quickly, but others, including my husband and I, had a very different experience. Having been given a room card (but no key) after a wait of about 30 minutes, we were told quite suddenly that the room was still not ready. After another considerable wait we had that card taken from us, and we were at last given the card and key to a different room. No refreshments had been offered during this time, although other guests not in our group were offered tea or coffee while they waited for check in. Having complained about the wait, we were duly given cups of tea.
The room was small, and located on an upper floor right at the back. It had obviously not been used for some time, as the bathroom basin was blocked and there was another wait while a plumber fixed it. We discovered later that other members of our group had similarly poor experiences, with at least one couple being moved to a smaller room after they had already started to unpack!
Apparently there was a large wedding group booked, which obviously had priority over us, despite the travel company having booked our accommodation months in advance. So, while this hotel is clean, pleasant and well located, it does seem to matter very much who you are. Not the way to treat guests.",3,2014,11,19
121,Excellent place to stay!,"The service and staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful.  The room I stayed in was quite comfortable, clean and cozy.  The St. James Court is conveniently located near many of London's attractions like the London Eye, Big Ben and Parliment, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace.",5,2014,11,19
121,High standards,I have stayed here for both business and pleasure and this hotel never fails to please. I had a executive suite which was roomy and well equipped. The staff are courteous and every detail is attended to.,4,2014,11,19
121,Absolutely brilliant,"I took my wife to london for her surprise 30th birthday an found the hotel fantastic,the service was absolutely amazing and the overall experience was great,the location was right where we wanted to be,the price was affordable an will definitely be looking at staying again in the near future ",5,2014,11,16
121,Terrible first room but what awesome service recovery,"My first room was right next to the tube line and i had to move at 11 15 at night.  The second room was much better.  When i spoke to the duty manager he was cery good   
The star of the show though is thr concierge. In moving rooms i lost my cufflinks but the concierge offered to give me a pair of his.  He didnt need to do this but went above and beyond.  If only more hotels had such care for customer service. ",4,2014,11,15
121,"great location, some improvements neded","This is a nice hotel in a great location. We are staying in an executive suite for a week. The room is spacious and well appointed. A few issues with amenities -- buffet breakfast was nothing to write home about, room service is advertised as 24 hours but it's a very limited menu, and the free wifi is so slow we ended up having to pay for the higher speed option. There's no evening turndown service. All in all a nice enough hotel, but a bit disappointing overall.",4,2014,11,13
121,quiet and cosy,"Saint Jame's Court is a very quiet hotel, close to Buckingham Palace and not far from Picadilly, Soho, Westminster, etc. A very good place, both for business trip or entertainment. The price is not so expensive compared to other similar hotels and the service is caring. The place is quiet and I slept very well (no noise, very good bedding). I recommend.",5,2014,11,13
121,Nice hotel,"We stayed at this hotel recently. Check in was very busy, only three receptionists but there were approx 8 people trying to check in. Reception staff were very stressed at this time. Our room was not ready on arrival and we were asked to leave our luggage with the concierge and return in a couple of hours time. We had pre-booked a non-smoking room but they could only provide a smoking room. This was not ideal as you could smell smoke in the corridor.  It was very  inconvenient at not being able to get into our room straight away as we had travelled quite a long way to get to London and wanted to rest before going to the theatre. When we did get our room on the 2nd floor, it was very comfortable, albeit quite small. Bathroom was very spacious. We had a room overlooking the courtyard so it was very quite. The only problem with our room was the curtains had come off their rail and did not pull properly. Concierge were brilliant, helpful with looking after our luggage and helpful with advice about the city and getting us taxis in the rain, well done concierge service. We departed at 10am the next morning to begin our travels home, we queued for breakfast for about 15 minutes and gave up, we ended having breakfast in a local coffee bar, not ideal as we had paid for the breakfast but the hotel had been very busy and lots of people were complaining about the lack of food. 
Ideal hotel for tourism, price was reasonable if booked with an online booking service and not direct with the hotel. Upon checking in, we were  invoiced a price double the amount to which we had booked so check your bill carefully, this could have been due to the very stressed receptionists on the day.  We would definitely stay again, in the hope that it was at a quieter time of year and reception being better managed.
I do notice that the hotel only comment on good reviews on Trip Advisor, not negative ones, when realty it is the negative comments that they should be taking note of to enable improvement in the service.",3,2014,11,12
121,Great Location and Service,This hotel was in a terrific area.  Very Close to Buckingham Palace.  The rooms were spacious.  I found the hotel to be very clean but did not crawl under the sink as some reviewers apparently do.  Some rooms were a long walk from the elevator but the halls were well lighted and had good signage.  We stayed at the beginning of our trip and decided to return for the last night.,4,2014,11,12
121,Business Stay,"I have stayed at the hotel for the last several years. the front desk service as well as the service staff in all parts of the hotel were always efficient and friendly.
The room was clean and the hotel offers free WI-FI. I will definitely stay there again next year.
Perfect location and close to the Tube Station.",4,2014,11,12
121,Old friends,"I have been staying at this hotel for several years both on business and with my family. The hotel is investing in upgrading the rooms and each time is a better decorated and supported hotel. For me the most important part is the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. From the check in team and concierge, who are always excellent, to the support of the management and backroom staff. This is a hotel that is great for holiday breaks and the business traveller alike and I will continue to use it for all my trips to London.",5,2014,11,12
121,business stay,"the hotel was efficient and is in a good location.the breakfast buffet was a little tired looking and the service slow.lunch in the dining room was average and the service a little confused.
the bed in the double room was actually a little small for two tall adults and the smell from the drains in the bathroom was unpleasant, we had to call housekeeping to sort it out,although the problem was not resolved.",4,2014,11,11
121,Very disappointed,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for the Remembrance weekend. The room that we were given was, room 872 on the eighth floor, the main lifts don't even go to the eighth floor. We had to get out on the seventh floor, walk to the other side of the Hotel, go up a narrow threadbare carpeted staircase to get to our room. The room itself had a musty smell, overlooked a building site and had no double glazing to dampen the sound of the tube trains or the school below. They seem to have a policy that, if you complain they will change your room. In my opinion, if they cared about their customers, they would not put us in substandard rooms in the first place. We booked a table in the restaurant, I ordered a well done steak that arrived uncooked. I spoke to the restaurant manager and explained that I couldn't eat it. I was told that I would be given a complimentary steak, after waiting a further half an hour by which time my wife had finished her meal, it was explained that I was not getting any food. Complimentary meant that I wouldn't be charged for the steak that I couldn't eat, so I had no food that night.  To add insult to injury I was charged a 12.5% service charge for my wife's meal. I am all in favour of tipping good service, but by any standards this was wrong. I only learned about the restaurant and bar service charge when I received the final bill. The quality of the food at breakfast was very poor and our all round experience at the hotel was the worst that I have known.",2,2014,11,11
121,Great 2 Night Stay,"We stayed here on the recommendation of friends we were meeting over the weekend for a celebration dinner and show.  We hadn't realised when booking that it was the weekend of the WWI centenary.  Things didn't get off to a good start with our room grade, but were quickly rectified and we were moved without fuss.  Whilst waiting for the room we decided to take the champagne flight in the cellar room, which for us was perfect as it was peaceful and we had the room to ourselves.  Though not a cellar the room is nicely furnished and the champagne flight was a lovely experience with paired canapes ending with a vintage 2004, and represented great value.

Our spacious executive king room was nicely furnished with a modern fresh feel on the third floor with three windows overlooking the courtyard, and the bathroom was also well appointed - quality toiletries, hot water, bath with an overhead rain shower, and big towels.  The bed was probably the best I've encountered in some time.  We had breakfast in the ground floor bistro restaurant on the first day, and in the 1st floor dining hall on the 2nd day - the latter by far the nicer experience, although the waiter was a bit overbearing about getting us and our friends to sign a ticket.

Check-in/out all smooth, leaving our bags with the concierge was hassle free and the door men were helpful with directions to the tower and flagging down taxis.

Great location and a very pleasant stay.",4,2014,11,10
121,"Excellent location, quality accommodations and great service","Really pleased with this hotel.  I was upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite from an executive king room upon checking.  Very comfortable room, staff is very accommodating and responsive.  Location is very good if you are working in/visiting central London and planning on taking taxis.  The nearest tube stations are Victoria (10 min walk) and Green Park (12 min walk), so if you're headed out and in a rush, cabs might be the best bet.  Otherwise, you can easily walk to Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar and Leicester Squares.  You're about a block away from Buckingham Palace. Food on premises is quite good (several restaurants).  There is a spa - but you do have to walk outside to get to it.  Also, the hotel shares an enclosed courtyard with the other Taj properties which is lovely  - you can sit outside and enjoy cocktails and light food.  Highly recommend this property.  A little more expensive but worth it.",5,2014,11,10
121,Fantastic location for our remembrance weekend,"Had come to london for remembrance service at cenotaph so needed a hotel close by.  Location fantastic, a 15 minute walk to the cenotaph.  Beautiful hotel but more important, very helpful and friendly staff.  Would certainly stay again.",4,2014,11,10
121,Birthday treat!,"I have just returned from a one night stay in London with my daughter  to celebrate my 75th. birthday. Unknown to me she had contacted the hotel to tell them it was a special occasion. 
When we arrived at 10.30 a.m. to leave our luggage we were told the room was ready, which was most unexpected, and we found we had been upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise.
Upon our return from the theatre in the evening there was a birthday cake and a card from the hotel staff.
We had not stayed here before  but will certainly return and will recommend it to friends and family. It is so conveniently situated and all the staff were so welcoming and friendly.",5,2014,11,09
121,Unbelievable,"We took a mini break to London to see a couple of shows and have a wander around the Capital.
We originally planned to stay on the outskirts and commute in, but at the last minute decided to stay in the centre.
The hotel was fantastic, given the fairly budget price and the location we weren't expecting much, I saw the top hatted doormen outside and honestly looked around for a dark alleyway our hotel must be in, because it couldnt be that one.

Check in was a breeze, the room was spacious (for London), the bathroom excellent, the bed comfortable, the cleaning excellent and the concierge desk knowledgeable and helpful.
Walking distance to the theaters and all of the sites.

Fantastic, we will be back next year",5,2014,11,08
121,Passing Through Town at the St. James Court,"I chose the St. James largely due to its proximity to Victoria Station and the Gatwick Express, since I was only in town for two nights before continuing on to Italy. My husband and I have stayed for years at another nearby hotel, but it has fallen below an acceptable standard for us. I am happy to say that it's likely the St. James will become our new hotel base in London! The place has apparently been through quite a few iterations over the last several years, but if my experience is anything to go by, I hope the Taj group continues its work on the hotel and I appreciate their great standard of service.

I had no trouble at all with check-in or check-out during my stay. The room was about the size I expected and was quite cozy and had a wonderful bath and shower. It was quite far from the main desk (something I don't really care about), down quite a few roaming corridors as the building is actually shaped as something of a hexagon and rambles a bit. I didn't mind as my room was located on a quiet alley (no view, oh well...), so I was able to get a really good night's sleep after an all-night flight. 

Upon arrival at the hotel, which was quite early, the hotel very nicely stored my baggage and allowed me to use their spa shower area to refresh and clean up before heading out for some walking in the neighborhood. I returned that afternoon and had a very nice tea in their bar/pub near the front desk, before checking into my room.

There's plenty to do near the St. James as well. There are a few little pubs and stores along that part of Buckingham Gate but you are not far from Victoria Street, which is being made over into something of a shopping district, possibly due to its proximity to the train station and the recent renovations there. There's a John Lewis, a Zara and several other High Street stores on the walk from the hotel to Victoria as well as a couple of nice food stores and restaurants.

You can also take in a few of the major sights of London in just a few minutes walking time. Buckingham Palace is only five minutes (if that) from the hotel, so you can walk over for a tour or hang out around the front of the building to watch the Regimental changes of the Guard - not the big fancy ones but just the small regimental parades that take place between 1130 AM and about 2 PM each day. They're just a few minutes, but are fun with the band playing and all that walking to tap. I did regret not having the time to go down to the Tower to see the Poppy display, but I just didn't have the time. It will be being dismantled in just a few days, so if you have the time - and even if you don't - go see it! You can also spend a few minutes walking the Mall and strolling in the park before returning to the hotel. Just a bit farther afield -possibly something of a hike for some but only one tube stop from Victoria - is the Sloane Square shopping district and Kensington Palace and Gardens, among other places to visit.

For me, though, the location was paramount as I was leaving early on my second morning. Easy walking distance to the train station was one of my priorities in making a reservation at the particular  hotel, but there's no doubt that the hotel is quite nice, with good service and friendly staff. Since I will be passing through London again in just a few months, I am already planning another stay at the St. James Court!",4,2014,11,06
121,Excellent location and attentive staff,"We stayed for two nights at the beginning of November. The location was superb, just a short walk from Buckingham palace. The room was very large by London standards, comfortable bed with nice linen. The staff were very helpful and a good breakfast was served each morning.
We would certainly stay again.",5,2014,11,05
121,"Elegant hotel, minutes walk from Buckingham Palace","The St James Taj hotel is a lovely building that is a five minute walk from the palace. The neighborhood is quiet and has less activity that Trafulgar Square or Knightbridge. The lobby is very nice and the room was luxurious with a big and comfortable king bed. The bathroom was very nice, even including a towel warmer. Everything was clean. Though I was able to get the room for $270 for one night which is not cheap at all, this was the least expensive in an area I wanted. Our stay was pleasant. I wish we had more time in London. ",5,2014,11,05
121,"Excellent service, great location","Checking in at 10.50am we were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. Service overall was great. We had a junior suite as it was only £7 more than a normal room on the deal we were on. Great rooms, upmarket hotel rather than anything more luxurious or extravagant. The rooms were laid our one after another and some of the corners were a bit tight. Good large showeroom. Big wardrobe with iron, ironing board, kettle and hair dryer. Very comfortable bed 

We were on the 4th floor and you could still faintly hear the tube - a talking point rather than disturbing. 

The bars are a series of rooms so it's worth walking through. We had the champagne room just for the 4 of us but didn't drink champagne. Good to have our own room as a guy in the next one was talking business very loudly and not stopping for breadth!

Breakfast was fine but a bit of a disappointment.  I expected it yo be somehow special. Melon and pineapple only fresh fruit, not much choice of breads etc. but all the basics for a full English etc.

Would be very happy to stay again. Had to leave for work at 7.30 and driving past Buckingham Palace just a few minutes walk away it was beautiful in the morning mist. No one around apart from the very glamerous looking horse guards.  If I went again I'd walk along before breakfast and take photos.",4,2014,11,05
121,Brilliant,This hotel was absolutely fantastic and perfectly located in London.  The staff are outstanding and very very helpful in every way.  We will definitely stay there again.  Our room was excellent with super comfy beds and  they served a wonderful breakfast every day.,5,2014,11,04
121,Good location but pricey,We stayed two nights at St. James' Court in October 2014. The location of the hotel was great. Buckingham Palace is just a short walk away along with Westminster Abbey and Parliament. Our room was clean and comfortable with a view of the courtyard. Things to be careful of are: the prices at the bar adjacent to the lobby is ridiculously high - even for London standards. The cost of breakfast is really expensive as well. Also be careful at check-in because the staff will try and find you a better room than you booked but the price for the upgrade will (in my case) be double what I originally had booked for a room.,4,2014,11,04
121,Excellent service and location,"Check in very efficient and friendly. Our room initially was very dark. On looking out the window we were facing a black wall and room was tucked in a corner hence very dark. We contacted reception to say we were unhappy with the room and they very kindly allocated another room. This was very comfortable and very clean.
Breakfast had good service, no wait and waiting staff friendly and efficient. Good choice of food and juices. 
Reception area very pleasant to relax in and there is free wifi in hotel. Location excellent for tube and also walking from the hotel to lots of city attractions.",4,2014,11,03
121,Valentine weekend,"Excellent hotel in superb location.

Very busy hotel, but the staff were friendly and attentive.

Room very comfortable and superb value for money. Good size room and nice welcome gift in our room on arrival.

Looking to return here on out next stay in London.",4,2014,11,03
121,Great hotel in ideal location for visiting London,"My wife and I spent one night in St. James' Court in an outstanding location for visiting London, with  the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey just around the corner and a 3 minute walk from the Tube station.
The service was outstanding with very friendly and helpful staff, and our room was nice and comfortable. However, as so often when we book with booking.com, we probably got one of the lesser rooms facing a building site with some noise from both the building site and the Tube - but nothing too disturbing.
The building together with the neighbouring Taj Hotel is beautiful and very well preserved, and there is a nice courtyard behind St. James'. There are several very good restaurants in and around the hotel.
My only criticism would be the price of the breakfast - 25 £ per person! Unreasonable, but not uncommon in London hotels. Instead we had breakfast in a very nice Italian Ristorante just across the street - 5 £ for a huge English breakfast with a large and excellent Italian coffee.",5,2014,11,02
121,This hotel is amazing,"I had the pleasure of staying at  this wonderful hotel for the second year running last weekend, together with 5 friends. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. We were upgraded to executive rooms and the rooms were ready on our arrival, which was well before the usual check in time. We had been allocated 3 rooms which were very close together. The rooms were spotlessly clean, with ample drawer and wardrobe space.We had drinks outside in the beautiful courtyard, cocktails in the cocktail bar and once again, had a fabulous meal in the Bistro 51 restaurant, where the service was excellent. Breakfast was delicious and on our second day, the restaurant was very busy so we were shown to another room on the first floor, without delay, where a further breakfast buffet was laid out. The hotel is ideally situated for many of the London tourist attractions. We were able to walk to the theatre in the West End, Buckingham Palace which is just around the corner, past the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey to the London Eye and even to the Imperial War Museum. We would like to say a huge 'thank you' to the manager and staff at the Taj hotel for a most enjoyable stay.",5,2014,11,01
121,I can't wait to return,"I recently stayed at this hotel with my family. It was a wonderful experience, from the moment we checked in. I had originally booked 1 room for my husband and I. When I arrived in London, my daughters (who we were visiting while they are studying abroad) wanted to join us. The woman who checked us in went above and beyond to find accommodations that were suitable for us 4. Everything about this hotel, from the room to the staff, including the breakfast crew at the delicious buffet was perfect. The St. James does everything possible to make you feel at home. I cannot wait to return!",5,2014,10,31
121,Lovely Hotel with a Great Location,"Just returned from a three night stay here. I thought everything about this hotel was perfect. The staff was helpful, the breakfast was delicious, our room was large with a great view of Buckingham Palace off in the distance. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to London, the location is great. Room was quiet as Buckingham Gate Road is not a noisy location.",5,2014,10,31
121,Excellent,"It is centrally located, near Buckingham Palace and two of the best parks of London. Service is one of the best I've seen among the best rated hotels of the globe. I would always recommend my friends and associates to have a feel of it.",5,2014,10,31
121,A VERY PLEASANT STAY INDEED,"We stayed at the St James Court last weekend we were in London to see a show and do some sightseeing.  St James Court is very close to Buckingham Palace and St James Park it is also a short walk away from Westminster Abbey, Big Ben etc so is in an ideal location.  The Hotel itself is beautiful and very  clean, the rooms are spacious and quite modern I especially loved the bathroom the shower was excellent.  The Staff at the hotel are very polite and friendly, we dined in both the bistro and the restaurant and the food was very good.

We will be staying at this hotel again very soon I hope.",5,2014,10,31
121,Service with a smile,"Everyone working there is very accommodating and the concierge went above and beyond to help us with everything.  This was our second stay, first was in a refurbished new room that was big and quiet.  This time we were in a older, smaller room and the tube line sounds every 10 mins until 12:00 is aweful!  We were on the 3 rd floor and our friends on the 6th directly above us and we all heard the tube line noise.  The location is ideal, only a block and half from Buckingham Palace and Victoria station and Albert's pub.",5,2014,10,30
121,London Experience,"We stayed here last year and brought friends this time.  What a great experience.  The staff is excellent. The only downside was the limo service they recommended. £185 from Gatwick.  Taxi is £96.  Concierge was best for help once we arrived.  Breakfast was good. Service excellent.  Dinner out back, so so and slow.  Over priced. Rooms, excellent.  Would stay here again. Near the Albert Pub and Buckingham.",5,2014,10,30
121,The Perfect Location for a stay in this wonderful city,"The St James Court Hotel is a great location to get to all the sites in London, some with in walking distance.
We found the staff really helpful with any information we needed.
Nice room, with everything  in for you to enjoy a good stay,plenty of T.V Channels if you fancied a night in with room service.
We ate at The Bank, great  service and pleasant food, also a couple of nice bars to try out yummy cocktails they will make whatever you ask for, exalent  service from lovely friendly staff.
We would stay there again.",5,2014,10,30
121,Ladies Get Away Break,"Our party was consisted of 9 ladies on a weekend theatre break. We booked the hotel through the Victoria Palace's web site and paid an unbelievably cheap rate for the weekend, in fact it was just £20 more for the room that a well known cheaper hotel chain and we had a great nights sleep too!
The hotel Staff were all welcoming and helpful especially the restaurant guys who made sure we all sat at the same table at breakfast which was really nice. The hotel itself was absolutely spotless and the rooms were large and well equipped.The position of the hotel was fantastic, Buckingham Palace was just at the end of the street!
We all had an amazing time here and I can't wait to go back next year!",5,2014,10,30
121,Could have been a perfect hotel !,"The staff is fantastic, they provide a great service; the hotel lobby and bar area is beautiful. The room we stayed in, is modern, ( seems the hotel rooms are being refurbished).....food at the restaurant is delicious, location is just ideal, but there is one big negative, the hotel is just over the tube line and being on the 1st floor is not ideal. When Coming back to london I will surely consider it again but only on higher levels so that tube noises are not heard.",4,2014,10,29
121,Excellent Hotel,"St. James service, rooms, and food were fabulous. Especially, the Service. Location is excellent with Buckingham P, the War Rooms, Big Ben, and Westminster Abby all around a 10 min. walk. During the week, St. James Underground is one block away. Victoria Station 10 min. away. Very easy to get around.",5,2014,10,29
121,An outstanding hotel,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel in September and could not fault it.   The staff were extremely friendly, always offering to help.   We were upgraded to a suite which was extremely comfortable, plenty of space and very clean.   We were impressed that the bed was turned down each evening and about half an hour after this was done, the room was inspected by a senior of the housekeeping staff to ensure all was correct.

It was close to Buckingham Palace, central London and St James Park which allowed a pleasant walk if one so desired.

We would not hesitate to stay there next time we visit London and strongly recommend it to other travellers.",5,2014,10,28
121,Great hotel and Staff but outdated room,"WE stayed last weekend for 2 nights and were very impressed with the public areas and staff. Staff were very well trained, polite and very helpful indeed. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food or restaurant service though the restaurants all looked good with excellent menus.

Late night bar service was professional and cocktails exceptional.

Our room was huge, well appointed and generally very clean which was a pleasant change in central London, however 661 was one of the rooms yet to be given a full refurbishment so there were a few problems... Curtains which didn't cover windows, damp staining on walls, poor quality paintwork generally, outdated bathroom with a basin that didn't hold water.

Next time we stay (and there will be a next time if we have a 'refurbished' room) I'm sure the room problems will be markedly less and we will be able to enjoy the hotel as we expect.",3,2014,10,28
121,Excellent Stay,"A gorgeous hotel with lovely friendly staff. Excellent location, a minute walk to the bottom of the road will bring you to Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. Expressed we were at the hotel to celebrate a special anniversary and were given a complimentary upgrade. Hotel made our stay. Will definitely be back again!",5,2014,10,28
121,Tranquility and serenity in a big busy city,"Situated right in the middle of Central London, St James' Court, A Taj Hotel, is the place where all the hustle-and-bustles are left behind. Gone are the annoying road noises, this hotel really offered a very quiet stay, coupled with a luxuriously decorated room, finding a place to stay in London? Look no further.",5,2014,10,28
121,Great Wekend,"Great location, once we found our bearings. Excellent staff and food, extremely quiet both in location and rooms but close enough to get into the city.
A short walk from Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, not too far to walk into the centre of London, we walked several times without a problem.",5,2014,10,28
121,Amazing experience,"I am not a travel writer. But I have travelled a lot on official work. And within India the Taj has been a constant companion. When coming to London the High Commission of India (HCI) asked me where do I want to stay. I have come to London earlier and the HCI has made arrangements in different hotels, which by any standard were fine hotels in their own right. However, this time  when they gave a choice and the name of Taj St. Jemes Court cropped up, I got reminded of my childhood memory when my father had stayed in this hotel and had brought home lovely brouchers and equally lovely memories. I simply fell for this hotel. And I am not repenting.

Generally people write after leaving the hotel. Here I am only in the second night of my 13 nights stay. But the hotel has left its mark on me in just 24 hours. The first room, which I got on the fifth floor was a fantastic room which looked towards a street. Nothing wrong with the view. But the courtyard view was even better. I went to the reception and told the lady there that my wife is coming to join me in a couple of days and it will be nice if I got a room with the courtyard view. I also told her to take her time. To my astonishment the lady told me that she would like me to have the desired room much before my wife came since I could see the room and decide whether it is good enough for my wife (definitely the most majestic woman on this Earth). And my room has been changed today with an amazing view. Not only that, I received a call to ask whether the room meets my expectations. 

Yes, the room meets my expectations. And above all, the legendry Taj hospitality exceeds my expectations. This is a lovely hotel with an amazing location. Very quite, very tranquile and very lively. Beatifully furmished rooms full of warmth of the people who run it. All the important central London locations are walking distance from this hotel. To take care of the food, it has London's most celeberated restaurants in the hotel itself and a lot of choices around the hotel.  Here I am writing from the room no. 532 with an amazing view of the tranquile courtyard. I will post my updates as the days go by. Hope the magic of Taj grows day by day....",5,2014,10,27
121,A trip we will always remember.,"Excellent location , the hotel has large beautifully decorated rooms with a very warm atmosphere.
All the staff we came across were outstanding and always happy to be of service. Shivanni thank you for the  wonderful greeting you gave us on arrival you made us feel very special. We can't wait to return. Oh I mustn't forget  the food was marvellous  too. :)))",5,2014,10,27
121,Very impressed with staff and hotel,We recently spent a long weekend at this hotel.  From check-in (with charming Christina) to check-out we had no complaints.  Hope to stay here again in the future.  Transport in the area was good as were local amenities.  Easy connection to central spots.  Thanks for an enjoyable stay.,5,2014,10,27
121,Luxurious and conveniently located,"I hardly ever stay in hotels this nice, and it was a Treat.  The staff was so super helpful - once I asked for some mint tea bags as I came in through the lobby, and the staff actually beat me to my room with them and were waiting at my door for me.  The room had individually controlled AC/heat, which was delightful.  The room was so quiet - I know I had neighbors, because I saw them, but once in my room, it was as if I was the only one in the hotel.  The bed was so comfortable that I overslept one morning by a couple of hours, and I wasn't sorry.  My only complaint about anything was that the water pressure wasn't superb, but apparently it's better on the lower floors (I was on 7 - the top floor).  Then there's the location - it's within walking distance of many of the major sights, and just a few minutes walk from two tube stops, so it's easy to get around from here.  There's a breakfast buffet in one of the lobby restaurants, which was included in some of the room rates.  There was a lot of variety, and it made it easy to get a quick meal before heading out for the day.  I loved my stay here - it was a huge treat for me!",5,2014,10,26
121,Awesome Location,"This hotel is in a wonderful location, just a block or so from Buckingham Palace, and a block or so from the St. James Underground.  We took The Underground from Heathrow and changed trains at South Kensington.  It was an easy trip, followed by a short walk to the hotel, approximately 30 minutes.  We arrived in mid-morning and we willing to just leave our bags with the concierge.  Fortunately, our room was ready when we arrived so we were able to get cleaned up after after our flights.  The reception staff and concierge were quite friendly.  The room was very comfortable and looked out into the courtyard.  The bathroom was large and was appointed with classic facilities.  We had breakfast the following morning.  I was surprised that it wasn't included in the price of the room but it wasn't a show-stopper.  When we left, the concierge quickly hailed us a cab to take us to King's Cross Train Station.",5,2014,10,26
121,Great Honeymoon,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon and what a delight it was! 
We were upgraded on arrival and the staff were very attentative, my wife is coeliac and there were no gluten free biscuits in the room but after a quick call the reception we had gluten free macaroons in the room. Breakfast was delicious with the head waiter looking after my wife ensuring she had gluten free food and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.
Ideally placed 1/4 mile from Buckingham Palace and a short walk the other way to Westminster Abbey and the tube station (St James Park) five minutes away getting around was easy
This hotel made our Honeymoon extra special and we would certainly look to stay here in the future.",5,2014,10,25
121,The terrific Taj St. James Court,"My friend and I traveled to London from California and it was a pleasure to be treated warmly and efficiently after a long trip.  We stayed one night, departed to tour Downton Abbey filming location, and returned for 4 more nights.  The room could not have been more perfect.  Loads of space, beautifully decorated, large bathroom, and sitting area.  There was great value for the money and the food was also well done.  Had a special evening at the Indian restaurant on property and it was well worth it.  Highly recommend and I've stayed in small luxury hotels, large corporate chains, and country manors.  Location very convenient too.",5,2014,10,24
121,A fantastic stay,"I am a huge fan of the older, court style hotels and this is a beautiful we kept building in a good location. Our room was a long walk from the lifts and we found our key not to be working so had to make the long journey back to reception then back up to room. Other than that a really enjoyable stay. Room service very efficient we enjoyed fruit, juices etc and the room was very large and nicely decorated. Worth mentioning that rooms face inwards so remember to draw curtains! My first stay here but would love to return.",4,2014,10,23
121,"Perfect location, attentive friendly staff, needs a little polish....","A stones throw from Buckingham Palace, down a quiet street, this easy to access imposing hotel  has reception, bar, restaurants and lounges grouped together , with lovely courtyard , and wellness centre trying hard to please . All the staff were friendly and helpful without exception. The only downside was being directed to my room via corridors with their floors covered in plastic where some upgrading and decorating was going on . I was using a crutch which got caught on the plastic and I stumbled , luckily falling against the wall, not crashing to the floor. Room was a generous size, but overlooked  the playground of a secondary school , so avoid rooms at the rear of the hotel if you want a lie in beyond 8 am on a school day. Lovely sheets, heavy fluffy towels, good comfortable beds . This was work trip, but all the same, if you can get a deal for king sized room including full breakfast for less the 220 GBP ...not bad for such a central location , and good quality service.",4,2014,10,23
121,Perfect for a short stay,"I stayed at this hotel at the weekend with my husband and my mother and her partner.  The welcome as you arrive is worthy of a 5 star hotel, exceptional doormen, very pleased to greet you and impeccably dressed and polite.  The lobby and bar area is impressive.  Bar service good - we did not use any of the other facilities.  The room itself was quite compact but everything you needed for one night was in it.  Our room was on the 5th floor and quiet generally but I was aware of a feint rumble of the tube which I guess is common in central London near a major station like Victoria.  The bathroom was a little tired, and small but again for what we needed it was absolutely fine.  Coffee and tea making facilities was a plus.",4,2014,10,23
121,Who knew this would be the largest room of our trip?,"For those of you never have traveled to Europe, be forewarned that the hotel rooms are small.  Compared to the rooms we had in Paris and Rome, this room was large in comparison.  Nice lobby and friendly, helpful staff.  Breakfast was included with our room and was very good.  They will cook eggs to your liking, if you don't want scrambled.  Prices are high all over Europe so be prepared!  The hotel was close to many attractions.  We bought the 48 hour Hop On Hop Off tour bus which was a few blocks away.  I would recommend this hotel to you.",5,2014,10,23
121,A ROYAL VISIT!,"We stayed at St James' Court two weeks ago and were most impressed with the rooms and service of all the staff as well as the breakfast which was included in the room rate. Outstanding as a TAJ group hotel and deserves a higher rating for sure!
We like the central location and proximity to both the sites, shopping at Cardinal Place, pubs, the Laughing Halibut and the underground as well as Victoria train and coach station.",5,2014,10,23
121,Better than before,"I have been staying at this hotel for business for over 8 years.  When they changed to the Taj chain, I retreated to the new Intercontinental Westminster, which I never liked as much as the St James.  With the Intercontinental having been sold to Hilton, I went back to the St James.  I was delighted to see many of the same employees are still there and they are some of the best hotel staff in the industry.  I was just there for a 6 night stay and it was delightful.  It was like coming home.  Great room service, bar and if you're a runner, close to the parks and the Thames.

I believe that it is a better hotel now than it was when it was a Crowne Plaza.",5,2014,10,22
121,St. James' Court,"We recently experienced another fabulous short break in London made even more enjoyable by our stay at the St. James' Court Hotel. This hotel never disappoints and although perhaps slightly pricey we would never stay anywhere else.  The rooms are tastefully furnished, very comfortable and most importantly spotlessly clean.  The food is excellent and caters for all tastes.  The staff are welcoming, courteous and friendly without being 'over the top'.

I can't wait for our next stay and would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a good centrally located hotel.

AlanaJ",5,2014,10,22
121,High value high quality hotel,"I regularly stay at St James' Court on business and on every occassion the standard of accommodation, facilities, food and service is excellent. I make special mention of the professionalism of all the staff and the quality of food and service in the restaurant.",5,2014,10,21
121,Good location,"Loved being greeted by two liveried Doormen as we arrived in a taxi and our luggage taken into the hotel.   Reception was somewhat difficult and we were given a room through lots of corridors a long way from the lift, in fact it was the last room on the floor and very small. We complained and were re-allocated to a more accessible room.  Once that was sorted out, we could take stock of the Hotel and enjoy the surroundings.  The lobby entrance was impressive with lots of seating areas, the bar was good, and the service there, and from the Concierge was excellent.  The Doormen proved invaluable in getting taxis for us and in their knowledge of the area.  Perfect position for the Palace and Parks.",4,2014,10,21
121,"Great service and location, pricey rooms and breakfast","Reception was very welcoming, the concierge is just superb. My partner needed to consult a doctor, and they arranged for one to call us and deliver medicine in a reasonable time, and even inquired after his health thereafter. The deluxe room was great, and the hotel public areas cosy.

Buckingham Palace and parliament square are all within walking distance. Some nice cafe's and restaurants nearby, including a Pret-a-Manger (good for breakfast). The hotel restaurant is very expensive but decent.

A great shame that breakfast at GBP 25.00 is such an expensive extra.",4,2014,10,21
121,Great location for Buckingham palace,"Only a short walk from the palace and tube station is near by. Lovely hotel, excellent pianist in the lobby as you arrive. Very professional staff and nice decor in main areas. Room was a little dated but clean and tidy.",4,2014,10,20
121,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location, Not Many Negatives","St. James' Court Hotel is very nice. The fist floor is beautiful and filled with friendly / helpful staff. I'm not a coffee person but people I stayed with said it what the best coffee they've ever had. It's location is excellent. Walking distance to many attractions like Buckingham Palace (just a few blocks) and Houses of Parliament (further but still walking distance). 
The fitness center has quality equipment but is a little cramped. The sauna is nice but the steam room was musty. Tied to use it twice and it was too musty for me.
One other small negative is it's a little dated/used aside from the first floor. Definitely not rundown though. The rooms are not big but it is London so that is very common. 
All in all it's a very nice hotel with a quality locations and great service.",4,2014,10,20
121,Handy value proposition,"For the Australian traveller, London accommodation is pricy and often poor at the cost. This hotel strikes a nice balance: well positioned,  well appointed and well priced. Nit cheap...but a good value proposition. Easy check in, good size rooms, all a business traveller could want. Negatives: it's a bit of a rabbit warren, the lifts are slow, there is heavy construction going on next door and some rooms are exposed to the sound of tube trains rumbling by...every 90 seconds! But on balance, if you book early-ish you'll work hard to do better. ",4,2014,10,20
121,"Great hotel, fantastic friendly staff",Stayed at the hotel for one night with my elderly mother.  The staff were amazing.  Couldn't do enough to help you.  Room service really good and didn't have to wait more than about 20 mins.  Breakfast great loads of choice and plenty of it.  Definitely would recommend and will return one day.,5,2014,10,19
121,Thank you for the upgrade,I booked this hotel for my daughters 40 birthday and I was very pleased as they upgraded her room to the best 1 bedroom suite.  The also provided happy birthday chocolates in her room.  They had a great stay and could not fault anything.   A big thank you to the duty manager who made this possible.,5,2014,10,19
121,Disappointing - Not up to expectations!,"The hotel is in a good location. The lobby is very smart and the front of house staff were excellent.

Unfortunately that is where the positives end...
1. We arrived to check in at 4.30pm and our room wasn't ready. We were offered a free coffee in the bar while we waited, but it meant we were a little rushed getting ready for our evening.
2. The room (we were upgraded to a suite on the second floor) was tired, dated & calling it a suite was a little exaggerated. We asked to move but were told there were no rooms available.
3. Breakfast in the morning was simply a sorry affair! There were too many mistakes...endless waiting for a coffee refill, waiting 15 minutes for burnt toast which when rejected was palmed off to another table! Eggs took over 20 minutes to arrive & the buffet was small & cheap.

Overall London hotels can probably offer has a lot more for your money!

It is worth noting that when we did complain at check out we were given a small discount. 
",3,2014,10,18
121,Perfect location,We enjoyed our 2 night stay at the St. James Court. We felt the location was great near Buckingham Palace. We had a small room ( typical ) but it was quiet and very comfortable. Our only issue was the thermastat in the room seems difficult to adjust and it was very cold at night. The second day we mentioned it and someone came right up and did some adjustments and the temperature was better,5,2014,10,15
121,Post-prandial drinks......,"After dinner at Bank pop next door to Hampton's Bar at St James' Court. A very relaxed and pampered way to end an evening. Three very good, large reds and three Hendricks with tonic came to £60 including service. Wine was delicious and ambiance so relaxing.",4,2014,10,15
121,Cleanliness issues,"Having lived in London hotels for the past 12 months I am not a stranger to hotel rooms.
This being the worst experience I've ever had having received three exceptionally bad 'bites' of some description which required swift medical attention.
On approaching the hotel I was advised it was probably 'something in the air' owing to customers opening windows. 
Very dubious and still scarred from two weeks ago.",2,2014,10,14
121,Show and stay,"Just stayed at this hotel booked as part of a package through Show and Stay. The hotel is situated right by St James Park station (3 minute walk) and a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Cathedral. We went to see Wicked at the Vitoria Apollo and the theatre was about a 10 minute walk. The hotel is set in a residential area and is fairly unassuming from the outside, but is extremely plush inside. All the staff that we dealt with were very professional, if a little impersonal. The room was fabulous... Very clean and spacious, with a seating area and desk area. Lots of fluffy white towels, bathrobes and slippers. There was even a pillow menu, with a choice of pillows, and the beds were really comfy. The breakfast was fabulous - fruits, cereals and everything you could possibly include in a full English. My friend had booked afternoon tea for us, before the show, which was absolutely delicious, an assortment if sandwiches, followed by scones with jam and cream, followed by an assortment of cakes, all absolutely delicious, if a little pricey at £27.50 each.  I only have one criticism of the hotel - check in is 2pm, but when we arrived, the room had been made up as a double, although I had booked a twin for my friend and I (we're good friends, but not that good !!) We had to wait half an hour for the room to be redone, however, we were given complimentary tea while we waited. I would definitely stay at the St James Court Taj hotel again.",5,2014,10,14
121,Tradition and smile,"My overall feeling was good. The historical building is huge and very stylish, old good England as you always imagine it. My (standard) room was incredibly light, with 2 (!) windows, such unusual thing in London, and also spacy. Nice big single bed. Location perfect for discovering London, just next to the St James Park and near the tube station. Fast complimentary wi-fi, complimentary water. BUT!
Construction works right under my window made my stay very uncomforable, I couldn´t work (which was bad as I travelled fo business) and also the noisy tube under the building and noisy air-condition in the room didn´t let me sleep. I also had some issue with he room service, didn´t get what I requested several times (basic things such as shower gel, vanity kit, tea bags) - in a hotel of such category I would expect a better service. The staff at the reception and in the lobby was very nice on the contrary. Furniture worn-out, especially in the bathroom. Cheap tea.",4,2014,10,14
121,Can't find a fault with the place,"From the moment we arrived, we were extremely well looked after and made to feel very welcome and valued as guests here.
We were welcomed on arrival by the doorman and asked if we needed any help with our bags, etc. The front desk was very well staffed and we didn't have to wait any longer than a couple of minutes. Check in was quick, easy and everything was well explained.
On arrival in our room everything was clean, well stocked and well thought out as regard to what guests might need for the stay.
We went to the concierge to ask for help with directions to the theatre we were going to in the evening, he gave a map, marked all the points of change for the tube journey, etc. and despite a few people waiting, he took time to talk to us about the show we were planning to see. 
On returning from the theatre that night, it was almost 11pm and we hadn't eaten, but this was no problem, since Hamptons bar provided a really relaxed atmosphere, with a guy on a piano and we were able to order a meal and drinks, which was prepared and served to us in timely fashion.
breakfast next morning was certainly worth getting up for, a wide range of hot items, fruit, yogurt, cereal, pastries, etc. 
checkout was done with in around a minute, quick, easy, efficient.
I think all in all, it's safe to say that our stay here exceeded the quality of any of the hotels we have stayed in, we cannot find anything to grumble about and would have no hesitation in returning, or recommending. 
A great place to stay and just a two minute walk (if that)  from Buckingham Palace.",5,2014,10,13
121,Proper hotel with excellent service,"No hesitation in recommending this hotel, excellent service, especially front of house. Stayed here a few times, rooms very comfortable, and for a change, excellent room service food. Lovely courtyard to sit out in good weather, old school piano bar if its chilly, all round it feels like a bit of a treat. Location is excellent if you need to be near Victoria. Plenty of shops and restaurants on the doorstep and nice walks to the park and Westminster attractions. Hard to fault in any respect.",5,2014,10,13
121,Wonderful!,"We came to London as a party of six and stayed here overnight. All three rooms were nicely decorated, clean and spacious. We all received a free upgrade. The hotel is in a great location and made getting around Westminster really easy. Breakfast was very good and all staff (reception, cleaners, concierge and waiters) were extremely helpful and pleasant. Would love to come back!",5,2014,10,12
121,"Excellent location, great facilities and friendly staff.","I have stayed in many hotels in this area, and the value for money for St James Court is great!  The rooms were nice and clean, with plenty of room.  The front desk staff was very nice.  The location is  great.  Would highly recommend this for your central London stay.  
",5,2014,10,11
121,First time at the St. James' Court -- I will stay here again,I stayed at the St. James' Court for the first time and truly enjoyed the hotel.  The people at the front desk as well as the concierge were extremely courteous.  The room was quite nice and the amenities in the bathroom were excellent.  What I also appreciated was the very nice bar as well as the separate restaurant associated with the hotel.   I found the food at each of them to be very good.  Great quorn tacos at the bar and very good Indian biryani in the restaurant.,5,2014,10,11
121,"Very small room, no window","The St James is in a good location, and the lobby is nice.  However, our room, #155, is very small.  I cannot walk around the end of the bed without scraping myself on the dresser.  The ""window"" only opens 2"", and looks out on a dark wall that is just a couple feet away.  We cannot even tell the weather.  We ordered room service, and the only place we could find to put the tray and eat was on the bed.  If I hadn't paid for 2 nights I would switch hotels.  I am unfortunately here right now.. I will post photos.",1,2014,10,10
121,A beautiful Oasis in the heart of London,"We have just come back from a lovely stay at the St James Court, London.   The hotel is 1st class, wonderful staff, and very comfy rooms.   We especially loved the courtyard, which, we sat outside at night, having drinks under umberellas with heaters.   It was hard to believe we were in the centre of London.   Breakfast was lovely too.   All in all, a wonderful choice.",5,2014,10,10
121,No sleep thanks to St. James Court!,"My Fiancee and I decided to grab a night away in London whilst out little boy was away with cubs. We booked this hotel and paid a premium over other available hotels in central London as the reviews seemed to be pretty good. 

First impressions of the lobby were great and I have to say all of the staff were really friendly throughout. That's about the extent of the good bits!!

Our room was ont he second floor, we exited the lift to find a shabby, run down corridor which would look more at home in a 2* establishment in my opinion. Entered the room, extremely small, not that that was a problem, but we both found the room to be tired, decor poor, bed uncomfy and carpet old and stained. 

The real let down for us was receiving an alarm call at 5.45am (which we hadn't asked for) and another at 5.50am (which we also hadn't asked for) and then a call at 6.20am to say our taxi was outside (which we definitely hadn't asked for). 

We saw the manager when we went down for breakfast (breakfast distinctly average aswell too be honest) and whilst the manager was exceptionally friendly (all staff are) he simply could not meet our expectations which was for a full refund for a completely ruined stay. 

Overall a really disappointing experience and I have to say the hotel is very poor when compared to other similar standard hotels in the City. 

Sorry St.James Court, I wish I could say different.",2,2014,10,09
121,Excellent stay,"My daughter and I recently stayed for 1 night when we attended a wedding in central London. We requested and were able to make an early check in to get to the wedding on time and were delighted to be upgraded as well. We had a room on the 7th floor which really quiet.
The room was spacious and well equipped, the bathroom modern, clean and very nice. The bed was extremely comfortable and we made full us of the lie in with checkout not until 12 o'clock.
All over very good experience at a good price for central london! we will definitely go back.",5,2014,10,09
121,Amazing !,"What a fantastic weekend we had here. We stayed for 1 night on Saturday & we were welcomed as we arrived by all the staff we met .unbeknown to us our daughter had e-mailed the manager to say we were celebrating my husband's birthday. We were told at reception that our room was ready & we had been upgraded to an executive suite!The room was amazing & had everything you could have wished for , including a large birthday cake sent by the management! We were made to feel special the whole weekend & nothing was too much trouble.we had booked for another weekend in a couple of weekends time anyway & now can't wait to stay again!",5,2014,10,08
121,Exceeded Expectations,"Fantastic location. Superb staff. Luxurious room. Very safe area. St. James tube station is a very short walk. I booked this room through Booking.com for four nights of our first trip to London after reading many of the reviews there and on TripAdvisor. We arrived quite early in the day after riding the tube from Heathrow and Reception greeted us efficiently and politely. We left our luggage with Concierge and began our sightseeing. When we returned in the late afternoon our luggage was waiting for us in our room (668) which was a wonderful size with two windows facing a side street. We pleasantly discovered a plate of fresh fruit, bottled water, shortbread, etc. The king-size bed was perfect, the linens quite nice. The bathroom was very clean with lovely soaps, etc. The luxurious towels were appreciated. A newspaper was delivered each morning.
  Fred, a member of Les Clefs D'Or, was the epitome of concierge excellence and was a pleasure to work with on several occasions. And how many fine hotels can boast that as you leave in the evening, every Reception staff member smiles and says, ""Good Evening"" as you pass by? 
   *I will say that due to the proximity of the tube station we could hear and feel the trains,noticing them primarily in the evenings as we relaxed. I am a very light sleeper these days and I can tell you once we went to bed the sound never hindered my falling to sleep nor ever woke me up.",5,2014,10,07
121,weekend stay,"stayed at this hotel for 1 night in october 2014. a very clean and comfortable room with a good size bathroom. plenty of extras in the room including free wifi. the staff i encountered were very friendly, polite and helpful. we would definitley go back.",5,2014,10,07
121,Best vacation ever!!,"We stayed for 6 nights recently, and I was literally blown away the first time I walked through the door.  Nice lobby, and the concierge staff was very helpful in helping us with any questions we had.  We were able to buy bus tour passes there, so that was helpful.  

The room was average, but nice.  We stayed on the 6th floor overlooking the construction site, but not complaining.  Most of our time was spent sightseeing.  It's very close to Buckingham Palace and a quick walk to the St. James station.  It's also walking distance to Westminster Abbey and the fabulous Apollo Victoria Theater if you want to catch Wicked.  

You can hear the Tube running during the day and evenings, but it does stop running at a certain point.  I was able to sleep well all 6 nights.

The front desk staff was very courteous and professional.  We also finally ate at the restaurant the last night we were there.  The food is pretty good, but pricey.  

Maid service was also good.  At the end of the afternoon, they do turndown service and leave you chocolates.  

I'm glad I booked this hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.  Couldn't have asked for a better stay for my 40th birthday.  Thank you St. James Court for helping make this my best vacation ever!!",5,2014,10,06
121,A little bit of luxury,"A weekend celebratory trip (his 50th, her 40th). Welcoming and helpful staff, the room was well appointed (double classic), shower was a little under powered for my liking but this is a minor gripe. Room was quiet, the air-con was on when we arrived but we didn't need it and though not noisy, turning it off added to the peace and ambiance and a very comfortable nights sleep. Fantastic central location for Houses of Parliament , South Bank, London Eye, river etc.",4,2014,10,06
121,Great Location,The Hotel cannot be faulted for the location to visit the main sites they are walkable or can be accessed from the close by tube station. The hotel looks fine but our room and corridors could do with more attention to finishing details.  The room we had was fine and spotlessly clean and quite although missing something  not sure what though again missing some finishing details.  Bath room was OK but shower lacked power.  We had included breakfast but considering what we paid was self service and basic for the price.,4,2014,10,06
121,Could do better!,"This is a beautiful hotel just a stones throw from Buckingham Palace. Hotel reception, bars and restaurants are all well appointed if very expensive. Staff are very professional but lack warmth and friendliness. The real disappointment was the room. We stayed in a classic double which was very ""tired"". Some of the rooms suffer from the noise & vibration of the underground. Breakfast was OK but nothing startling. I won't be back I think, London has better to offer in this price bracket.",3,2014,10,05
121,Aesthetically pleasing sanctuary in very busy part of London,"I did speak with one traveler who was not having the best experience and I just told her to talk to the manager, as I was sure the hotel would want to improve her stay. She was paying a top rate, too. The front desk people moved me within an hour, when I requested a room with a better view. The courtyard was lovely and so was the building, inside and out. Staff were all helpful. The concierge staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and I would like to single out FRED, who looks and is Filipino, as one of the most helpful and kindest professionals I have ever dealt with IN MY LIFE. I told him I cannot afford breakfast at this hotel and he knew just where to send me for a much cheaper breakfast: across the street at Bon Gusto. Turned out to be a great, inexpensive breakfast. That was only one of Fred's treasured tips. Back to the hotel itself: rooms are big enough, bath is well supplied, there is hot chocolate and even free slippers in the room. I also liked very much that there is a large, white, elephant piggy bank in the courtyard as you head towards the SPA building in back. All donations in any currency are welcome and they go to help elephants in Asia, being slaughtered every day and soon to be wiped off the planet. I was glad to see the Taj company cares about these sensitive and intelligent animals.",5,2014,10,05
121,Good service and comfortable room,"I stayed 4 nights at St. James Court.  I arrived and noon and they checked me in right away.  I asked for a quiet room and that is what they gave me.  The room is very comfortable although I must admit slightly dated.  The bed was very comfortable and there was a strong and hot shower.  All in all very enjoyable.  The staff went out of their way to help.  It was my sister's birthday and they went out of their way to help me get a cake.  Very sweet.   My only criticism is I had 2 of the cleaning staff walk in on me while I was dressed.   I'm not sure why they do not knock.  If you just put the extra lock on your door, you'll be fine.   I also asked for my room not to be made up and while I was out at dinner they came and cleaned my room.  I give them points for wanting to provide good service.",4,2014,10,05
121,Sheer luxury.,"Staff very attentive and helpful. Beautiful, comfortable room. Lots of comfortable areas and bars to sit and have a drink.  Excellent breakfast. Really enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.",5,2014,10,04
121,A difficult review to write as very varied experience here!,"I stayed here with my sister and daughter in two rooms last month. The first room - a classic room was awful, dated décor and furniture, felt rundown and grubby, down the end of a long rundown corridor and overlooking a building site. We had asked for rooms on a high floor because of tube noise and were allocated 7th floor but we checked in really early and felt they tried to get rid of the worst hotel rooms first. Anyhow we complained, got moved to courtyard rooms on floors 3 & 4, one executive - refurbed and very nice, one classic suite - not refurbed and not so nice! Breakfast was good, you can order a la carte or buffett style. Drinks in the bar were expensive so we only had the one! We all felt that we were quite obviously not treated as well as the guests of Eastern origin staying at this hotel. We would not return despite the location being good.",2,2014,10,04
121,Our London home,"This is our second time at this hotel and we have loved it both times.  We were fortunate to get an upgrade to a wonderful room both times, very quiet and had all the amenities and more one could hope for in a 4 star hotel.  Frankly it deserves a 5 star rating as it certainly is much better than many 5 star establishments we stayed in during our recent month trip to UK and Ireland.  The room has everything you need to make your stay such a pleasure.  Everything we asked for, such as replacing the doona with a blanket, happened immediately with grace and amicable service.
The staff really make the hotel - very welcoming and kind and in one case very accommodating when our flight dates were adjusted.  The duty manager assisted in every way possible.  The buffet breakfast is one of the best we had in our travels and the greeting each morning at the Bistro 51 was so welcoming.
It's situated in an ideal location, an easy walk to many of the tourist attractions, bus and tube stations.  It really is one of the finest hotels in London. I rarely give a 5 star rating, unless it is well warranted.",5,2014,10,04
121,A bit closer to home......,"I'm usually reviewing hotels abroad visited for pleasure but mostly business, this time I'm adding some comments on my company's corporate hotel of choice close to our offices in London which we use if out on the town late.
The Taj was a Crown Plaza, which had become a bit tired, but with new decorated & upgraded rooms, plus great bars & catering (Bistro 51, Bank Bar, piano bar, etc), this really is a fine hotel now. I've used it twice on separate occasions this week and probably around once a month on average. Much prefer it over other hotels close by...Rubens (too touristy & ""twee""), St.Irmins (only ""OK"", even though I am a big Marriott group fan) - well done Taj Group!",5,2014,10,03
121,Great location to visit the Queen,"The St James hotel is on Buckingham gate, head left at Buckingham palace and its two minutes on the right hand side of the road.

We got there from green park tube, which is  a lovely 10 minute walk through the park, past the palace and you are there.

Rooms were comfortable and clean. The breakfast was great, its very hard to fault it at all. We would definitely stay there again.

Its a good location, 10 minutes and £12 later you can be at the savoy by taxi, or walk it in about 25 minutes.

Changing of the guard happens every two days at the palace and is a huge attraction, this hotel is brilliantly placed for this as you can be from room to the palace in 5 minutes.

Victoria station is also just around the corner.

All in all, a lovely hotel, that will not break the bank.

 ",5,2014,10,03
121,"Great location, great breakfast, best ever manager","We arrived at the Saint James Court at 8am after flying all night from Palm Springs, California - tired and ready for a shower. We went to registration and presented our hotel voucher and were told that our reservation had been cancelled and that the hotel was full. Lauren was sympathetic and called the duty manager, Rahul Nadkarni. He looked at all of the information and told us to take a seat in the lounge, offered us coffee and tea and refreshment and guaranteed us that he would take care of the problem. He spent two hours on the phone with American Airlines Vacations and, either he or Lauren came to reassure us often that it would be taken care of. Finally he told us that we had a room and took care of everything from there on. The room was spacious with lovely amenities, robes, hot water maker, large bathroom towels and overlooked a central atrium. Breakfast was included and was over the top better than we could ever imagine. Delicious hash browns, baked tomatoes, baked beans and eggs any way that you wanted. Juices, coffee, extra special service. We had a newspaper on our doorknob every morning. The doormen were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very near Victoria and St James tube stations, so easy access to the airport. A short walk to Buckingham palace, so right in the center of everything. We travel often and were both very impressed with the quality of this wonderful hotel and the extra service that we received when we arrived. Thank you again to Rahul and Lauren for making us feel important and making sure we had a roof over our heads.",5,2014,10,02
121,First stay here and was very good,"The hotel was very nice. The tea was very good.  easy access to the city so i was able to go few places while on a tight routine. anyway i tried to make most of it and took the time to review !
hope to visite again. (my company books all my stays around the world)",4,2014,09,30
121,PERFECT LOCATION TO STAY AND IMPECCABLE SERVICE,"After doing extensive research on hotels for over a month for our first trip to London, we chose this hotel for our 9 day stay. What a fabulous choice!!! The hotel is centrally located in the St. James Park area of central London and is top notch. I contacted the GM, Edward Riches, prior to our departure and he immediately answered the phone. I advised him of our desire for a nice room with a view of the garden area and on a higher floor so as to avoid the noise of the tube trains that some of the reviewers had complained about. He absolutely obliged and we were placed in room 432. It was perfect! The service at this hotel is nothing short of perfect in every way. From the time we checked in until we left, we were treated incredibly well. We are accustomed to staying in 4-5 star hotels as we are the type of travelers that like to enjoy very nice rooms and amenities whenever we travel (One & Only resorts is our favorite). The staff was very professional and absolutely well-trained in accommodating guests. Our room had recently been remodeled but we believe they ""forgot"" to place a new mattress in it, but that was immediately rectified once we brought the matter to the attention of the housekeeping staff. From Lauren at Reception check-in, to Fred the Concierge, to Beata the Housekeeping supervisor, the service at this hotel is 5 star. We are not partial to Indian food, so we did not visit their 2 main restaurants (Quinlon and Bank), but we did enjoy their extensive breakfast buffet almost every morning at the Bistro 51, which we included in our package deal through Expedia. We would not hesitate to stay at this wonderful hotel again when we return to London next year and absolutely recommend the St. James Court for anyone traveling to London and wishing to stay in a high class hotel. All modes of transportation were nearby as were local restaurants, a Starbucks, a Taylor Walker (the best) pub, a market, and souvenir shops. Hands down, this is the place to stay in London. We were able to walk to Buckingham Palace and several tube and bus stations were also within walking distance, thus we were able to avoid the more expensive taxi fares. Mr. Riches, the GM, is doing everything right, and it is confirmed by the great service we received during our stay. Book your stay here without any hesitation. You will be totally pleased.",5,2014,09,29
121,Disappointing,"After reading such great reviews of this place I was quite underwhelmed by it. The room was so small (I am guessing most of the other guests that wrote reviews must have had a suite, as no one mentioned the room size) and it looked as though it hasn't been decorated for a while, as the paint was coming off the walls and just didn't look anything like a 4 star hotel. I know people are paying for the location but the standard just isn't there for the price of a 4 star.",3,2014,09,29
121,Very good hotel with great breakfast,"We stay in London 3-4 times a year but this was our first stay at the St James Court .We normally stay at The Cavendish , The  Westbury , The Park Plaza Westminster or The Hilton Westminster .
On arrival we were greeted by a very helpful doorman who took my keys and parked the car for me on a single yellow line opposite the hotel , we were able to leave it there at no charge as we were staying Saturday and Sunday . This was a great help and saved £40.00 per night parking charge .We checked in on Saturday and returned at about 4.00 pm to find our case in our room .Our friends were not so lucky and their room was not ready at gone 4.00 which was a shame as we needed to be out by 4.45 to go to a pre theatre meal .
The hotel has a nice lobby area and attractive central courtyard over which our room looked (179) . Although a little tatty in some areas we very much liked the hotel and our room which had slippers , robes and tea / coffee making facilities .
Breakfast was excellent , one of the best we have had ,and our waitress Mamigh was very helpful , happy and made sure we had eveything we needed .
We hired Barclays Bikes from direct outside the hotel and had an excellent day on Sunday riding around central London , Regents Park and Camden Lock/Market.
We very much like the St James's Court and would stay again without hesitation .It compares very well with the other hotels we stay in and betters them in many departments .",4,2014,09,29
121,Overnight Stay,"We just stayed in St James Court on Saturday night. The location is fantastic, about 300m from the Palace. We arrived a little early for check in, so were given complimentary tea as we waited for our room to be prepared. After about 30 mins, I inquired at the desk if it would be ready soon, and was apologized to straight away for the wait (it was still only 3pm), and promptly given a complimentary upgrade to a junior Suite for the night. Incredible gesture of good will, especially when we were not even complaining, merely inquiring! The suite was lovely, good A/c, separate sitting room, all the channels, turn down service, walk in wardrobe, perfect for a night of relaxation. 

We ate in the Courtyard, beautiful evening and beautiful setting. The menu was a little selective, but we were both more than happy with the food we chose. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. We went down for Breakfast about 9.30am, and am delighted we did as there were huge queues waiting when we were leaving about 10am - so recommend heading early if you are able! Good fresh selection for breakfast.

Availed of the express checkout to avoid getting delayed. All in all would wholeheartly recommend this hotel, and would be delighted to stay here again. Really lovely staff and place!",4,2014,09,29
121,Why such high reviewes,"Stayed one night and paid £225 for a rabbit hutch with a double bed and no breakfast. I'm glad I wasn't staying here with the Mrs, there was absolutely no room in this room. London is such a rip off for hotels, permier inns are the best if you have just one night on business.  

I went to open the window and was surprised it didn't fall out as the woodwork all around it was rotten. 

I'm giving it a poor rating because of the cost for what you didn't get.",2,2014,09,29
121,Excellent stay,"Another fabulous stay,  as always.
This is without doubt our favourite hotel in London to date. Service was excellent from the moment we arrived. A big thank you to all the staff for always making it extra special.
Rooms are modern and extremely comfortable.
Lovely bar area with pianist playing Friday evening ( very good).
The location is perfect for anyone in London sightseeing or if just for a romantic weekend away. Close to underground station but just as easy to walk up the Mall  to the Trafalgar Square and The Strand or across Green Park to Piccadilly . 

 ",5,2014,09,29
121,"Good location, snobby staff","The hotel was close to Buckingham Palace and other attractions. My room was comfortable. On my three night stay I only seen one staff member smile. If I hadn't stayed at another London hotel on the days prior, I would have thought this was just the norm.  A smile or hello when one was given by myself would have been nice.",2,2014,09,27
121,Elegant and sopisticated,"Stayed for 2 nights last weekend for my wife's 50th birthday, tried to source a 5 star hotel in a central location and this one seemed to tick all the boxes. Had never heard of the Taj Hotel Group before but we're pleasantly surprised. Tucked in a small but fairly busy side street this truly is a hidden gem, there is a calm oasis as soon as you enter this hotel, we were lucky enough to be upgraded from our suite to the next level of suite on the 4th floor and the room was unusually shaped but immaculate and very comfortable, we did hear the nearby underground but this was so faint it was not an issue unlike some of the reviews. Great breakfast, very busy on the first morning so some guests were seated in lounge areas but again the surroundings are so relaxing this was not an issue. The courtyard was so pretty and a delight to sit back and relax with a g&t before we sampled the Restaurant attached to the hotel, this is a michelen starred restaurant and it did not disappoint, if you get the chance to book don't hesitate as the food and service were amazing, after we walked the few steps back to the hotel for a night cap in the lounge, and enjoyed a few more drinks whilst listening to Ed Bently on the piano, fantastic pianist could have listened to him all night. this hotel is a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and approx 20mins from some of the theaters, we had tickets for les mis so easy walking distance. the clientele at this hotel tend to be around he same age group as myself and my wife, we will definitely return as it was so relaxing and quiet whilst staying right in the centre of London, we didn't use the gym or spa as we didn't have time, but we did check out the facilities and this is a decent gym not your normally multi gym in a broom cupboard like some other hotels. Wouldn't recommend his hotel for teenagers as I think they maybe bored and wouldn't appreciate the hotel, but we loved it and will return",5,2014,09,27
121,Posh hotel near Buckingham Palace,"We chose the St. James Court Hotel as it is very close to Buckingham Palace and public transportation.  We were also impressed by the Trip adviser reviews we had read before our trip.  We took the Underground subway from Heathrow Airport to the St. James Park underground station.  It was less than a city block walk to our hotel.  The hotel was very nice and the staff were very professional.  The lobby was impressive with dark woods, a bar area and piano player.  Most people were wearing suits and expensive dresses.  Our room was on the other end of the property, so it was a bit of a walk.  The room was very nice with all the expected amenities including free WIFI.  The hotel's restaurants were a bit expensive, so we ate at the restaurants and cafes just down the street.  We walked to the end of the street and there was Buckingham Palace.  We had purchased our Palace tour tickets on line (with scheduled date and time) a few months before our trip.  No long wait, showed staff our tickets and we were admitted with our scheduled group.  You really must tour Buckingham Palace.  VERY IMPRESSIVE!   The next day we took the Underground to Victoria Station and made our way by train to Hampton Court Palace.  Buy the unlimited daily travel pass.  Much cheaper and you can use it on the trains, underground and buses.  Overall, I found the St. James Court Hotel very comfortable and centrally located for our purposes.",4,2014,09,26
121,Amazing...I'll be back!,"From the early check in, to the very comfortable, beautiful and intimate establishment everything was top notch. The building is lovely and nestled amongst many of London's most popular attractions (Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, 10 Downing & Trafalgar.) The staff was exceptionally polite and helpful, the breakfasts superb and amenities(spa & gym) better than I'd hoped. I can't wait to return!",5,2014,09,26
121,Remains The Only Place I Stay While Visiting London!,"I visit London regularly and have stayed at the same hotel for a number of years.  I was a little concerned when I learned that my regular hotel had recently changed ownership.  It is now the St James Court Hotel owned by Taj Resorts.  

After my recent visit, I learned quickly that my concerns were unnecessary.  In fact, the hotel itself and their guest services have improved from my past experiences.

The St James Court Hotel has recently undergone major renovations and they have done a very nice job in doing so. The location, near Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and a number of other attractions, is ideal for those traveling to see the sites.    

The management and staff at this hotel take pride in providing the best possible service. Everyone consistently goes out of their way to attend to your needs and make sure you are comfortable and that your inquiries are handled promptly.

As a regular traveler, I only return to hotels where the management and staff genuinely care about the guest and where that care is demonstrated through their 'actions'. That is the primary reason I have stayed at this hotel in the past and will now continue to do so in the future.

I would like to personally thank everyone at the St James Court for helping make my recent visit comfortable, productive and enjoyable.  Whether traveling on business or for leisure, I highly recommend the St James Court Hotel.  It remains my residence while visiting London and I am looking forward to returning soon.",5,2014,09,23
121,Not your typical Taj,"Aside from its small lobby and wonderful English exterior architecture, this hotel was just a notch above ordinary.  The rooms were small, and there was little of the ""Taj"" identity that I grew to enjoy.  The rooms are small are ordinary.  I was on the first floor and I could hear the rumble of the underground every ten minutes or less. That was a bummer.Well, maybe for $300 a night in London, you get this ordinary quality.  Service was good and friendly though and the location is stupendous:  close to Westminister, Buckingham, etc. but there is a shortage of good restos in the area.",3,2014,09,23
121,Beautiful and Grand,"Checked in early at 9am on a Sunday and was told our room will be ready by 11am which was a blessing.  Room and bathroom was adequate and furnishings were quite new. We had a comfortable stay although the bed was a queen bed and slightly too small for 2.  
Beautiful fountain and with al fresco dining outside which we didn't get to try as we stayed only one night. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the beautiful St James Park. 
Will stay again when we come back to London.",4,2014,09,23
121,A perfect oasis in London,"We stayed here for one night while in London to see a show and to celebrate a special birthday. The reception staff were very welcoming and check in was good. The hotel has several buildings and can be a bit of a maze. We had a long walk to our room but were rewarded with a large corner room with two windows overlooking the lovely courtyard. The bathroom was large and clean if a little dated. The courtyard is very much the centre piece and as the weather was exceptional for the time of the year, we enjoyed drinks out there both before dinner and late into the evening after our show. There are several restaurants in the hotel but as we needed to eat fairly early we chose the 'Bank' which is partly housed in a glass extension in part of the courtyard. We had a tasty and reasonably priced meal which was nicely served. Despite being on a busy road, this hotel is a quiet oasis and we found both the courtyard and our room to be peaceful. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice. All the staff were well trained and professional.",5,2014,09,23
121,"Good value, great location, rooms need updating","This hotel is in a excellent location, only a few minutes away from St James's Park tube station and within easy walking distance of Victoria. Though the lobby and bars were furnished to a high standard, our classic room was in need of refurbishment. That being said, for the price paid I would say that it was good value and quite a find for London- the room was a good size, it was clean, quiet and very comfortable. From what I understand, some of the rooms are being refurnished and once this is complete I think it will be wonderful.",4,2014,09,23
121,Very mixed,"This was a mixed experience. The staff were delightful and very responsive and the courtyard was delightful for drinks. Finding one's way to the room was a real challenge... a maze of corridors and the room was very small and dark. The bathroom was clean and good toiletries but the wallpaper in the room was badly marked and dirty. Little thought to things like plugs and mirrors... to use the hairdryer AND see in a mirror required standing in the clothes cupboard! Likewise no plus for using a laptop in bed without unplugging the bedside light!

The set menu in Bistro 51 was not expensive but very dull... the tian of prawns etc was basically a very bland prawn cocktail with the sort of prawns one might expect in a Tesco sandwich. Likewise the venison casserole might easily have been beef it was so tasteless... and with slimy ""dumpling"" lumps. 
The hotel has huge character and is redeemed by the staff but needs a major makeover and clean... particularly some of the staircases",3,2014,09,23
121,"GREAT HOTEL ,THE BEST LOCATION","From the moment we arrived we were made to feel most welcome ,  The food was great in the bar.  comes highly recommended . This is my second stay here this stay even better than the first Will book again next season .",5,2014,09,22
121,Perfect stay,"I stayed two nights during a business trip and walked away wondering how this is only a four-star hotel.  The staff went above and beyond, and the hotel -- from the lobby, to the courtyard, to my room -- was beautiful.  I had premium king room on the 7th Floor that was huge, immaculate and quiet.  I had a fews hours to myself at the end of my business meetings, and was grateful for the close proximity to both Westminster Abbey and Parliament in one direction, Buckingham Palace in the other.  The tube was c;lose and very convenient for getting to my various meetings.  

In case the hotel reads this, my only complaints were (1) the pillows were very hard -- feathers, please!!; and (2) the water pressure was pathetic.",5,2014,09,22
121,Great Location....noisy hotel,We stayed here for 3 nights last week. The location is very convenient. The doorman and concierge were excellent.  We were originally put on the 4th floor on the back side of the hotel. The room was the size of a shoebox and you could feel and hear the tube.  After the first night the front desk did a nice job moving us to the other side of the hotel that overlooked the courtyard. While this room was a big improvement....the walls were paper thin. The family next door decided to have a fight at 6:00 am and we heard everything. The hotel is in a great location but is not a 4-star property...3-star at best. The interior needs some touch-ups and updating.  The wi-fi is free but had to stand by a window to get service.,2,2014,09,22
121,Great location,"Booked the hotel for my husband's 50th birthday... we flew from Dublin on friday sept 12th & arrived at the hotel at 11 pm...to be told at reception that our booking had been cancelled by the agent we had booked through ..we booked online ..we had to book in for the night & the night manager told us the hotel was booked out for the Saturday night..I got absolutely no sleep Friday night, spending the night trying to find a hotel for Saturday. ...everywhere was unavailable :-( the weekend was already ruined at that stage....
We got up at 6.30am went down to breakfast & thank god we met Yunas !!! He was able to arrange the same room for us for that night..The relief...
Turns out when we spoke to the agent that the problem was on the hotels end & they had cancelled the booking .....The hotel honoured the original booking but I must have missed the apology. .
Loved the hotel & the location was excellent. .close to everything. ..
Then when we checked out the receptionist asked my husband did you enjoy your birthday cake ...the chocolate one we left in your room ...definitely wasn't in our room ...another boo boo ...",4,2014,09,21
121,Brilliant location,"Fantastic location very near to Buckingham Palace and in a quiet, lovely neighbourhood.  Nearby bakeries and cafes are handy for a snack or a drink, and close to two good tube stops.  The service, particularly the concierges and doormen, were top-notch.  We stayed in a king room, which was very spacious.  Only thing to avoid would be the spa if you're looking for a five-star experience (nothing particularly wrong with it, but felt much more like a 3-star place to me).  Quillon was an Indian dining experience worth doing once.",4,2014,09,21
121,"Good hotel, Good location","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and enjoyed all aspects.  We asked for a late check out which, although we had to pay for, was no problem.
The staff were friendly and helpful and the room, although slightly small, was clean and the bedding was fresh, clean and of good quality.
The food in the Bank restaurant was beautiful and the South African red wine was delightful.
The location of the hotel is ideal for sightseeing, a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben, Whitehall, Downing St etc.",4,2014,09,20
121,Would not recommend this hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel on the 13th & 14th August the staff was very friendly and professional . Our  first room which was a superior room on the first floor was right above the Tube wth a thundering noise every time a train went by. The airconditioning didn't work, nor did the shower. When we requested a different room, we were given a double room instead ( the only other room available that night).   We were still charged for superior room price.",2,2014,09,20
121,Good place to stay in London,"Stayed there for one night hotel is nice with very clean rooms and the breakfast delivered to my room was very good. The location was ideal and next to Buckingham palace and easy access from the subway.
Would recommend!",4,2014,09,19
121,Excellent location,"We've stayed in St. Jame's Court Hotel last October 2013 and we stayed there again for our visit to London this year.  Newly renovated rooms, and the staff appear just a bit more accommodating than when I remember itespecially Ms. Shivaani Puri.The location is perfect.  It's just minutes by foot to the Buckingham Palace, and a little further to the Parliament and the London Eye.  With the London subway system, you aren't far from anywhere.  The breakfast though isn't something to look forward to. I remembered when they had excellent upma.  Nothing of that sort this time around. A little variety would not harm.",4,2014,09,19
121,wonderful stay,"It was a short stay but the service is 5 star. So is the location. And the food.
Will always consider it a first choice. We were able to walk everywhere and had the Tube close by. It was very nice being able to just go around the corner to watch the changing of the guards and be within 5 blocks of Whitehall and Westminster and BigBen..etc.",4,2014,09,19
121,Distressing experience,"There are several very good aspects to this hotel. The lobby is pretty, Reception good and the bellman & Concierge desk excellent. However, it is a work in progress re: renovation. We did have a renovated room which itself was pleasant. However, it abutted a school yard with basketball hoops and soccer games and on the side two high rises were under construction, You could not sleep after 8am or before 5/6pm. I wrote a letter to the mgr and never heard from him in the 2.5 days that remained.I rec'd a quick follow up after their personal QA form w. the mgr saying he never rec'd the letter and they move clients who complain of the noise [which they are well aware of].Be certain to check your location.",2,2014,09,18
121,"Lovely, but . . .","This is an amazing hotel with beautiful rooms. The lobby bar is intimate but still conducive to socializing. WiFi signal was too weak to connect in our room on 7th floor, but another member of our group had to move from the 2nd floor to the 7th to escape the neverending train noise. The location is, in my opinion, the best in London! However, the staff in the attached restaurant couldn't seem to get our check right on any of the three breakfasts we had there. Also, we had crazy charges to our room. The front-desk clerk did handle all of the erroneous charges quickly, and was absolutely delightful, but I found it odd that so many mistakes could be made. Overall, I recommend, but be sure to check your bill at departure!",3,2014,09,18
121,Daughters 30th Birthday treat.,Spent 2 nights at St James Court what a lovely experience for my daughters 30h birthday treat.The room was on the 5th floor overlooking the courtyard so peaceful. Staff were excellent & we got a lovely cake sent to the room. great location for sightseeing would definatley stay again.,4,2014,09,17
121,Great Place to stay in London,"Stayed at the St. James Court Hotel with friends for 4 days at the end of August. Location is perfect for visiting the sights of London. Hotel is well maintained and the staff are pleasant and efficient. Especially enjoyed my morning chats with Ian the doorman and the concierge on duty. Eat breakfast in the dining room most mornings and ordered a la carte and the price was very reasonable. If you wish to step out and have a pub lunch try ""The Albert "" just down the road.",5,2014,09,17
121,Pricey but good,"Stayed here for a business trip.  Staff was responsive, friendly and helpful.  Food was great at both breakfast, dinner and for room service. Price - well it's a London Price, but for the relative good showing on quality, I have no reservation recommending the quality.",4,2014,09,16
121,"Not a great experience, unfortunately ","I know it's expensive to stay at a hotel with this kind of location, but for the money I paid, I kind of expected more.
The room we initially got was a major disappointment: not only was there loud construction work outside our window, we could also hear and feel the underground underneath our room.. So do be aware of staying at first floor, esp room 169..!
  We asked to change room, and we moved up one floor. Nothing wrong with the room itself, very comfortable bed but tv and changing of channels was a pretty tiresome experience.

Again, for the money I paid, I expected a great breakfast buffet with lots to choose from. It was pretty disappointing to find out that it was mainly a full English breakfast. I would have preferred for example more bread choices and better quality ham selection.

We expected wifi in our room but quickly realised that there was not network coverage, and therefore could only take advantage of wifi in the lobby. I did call reception to ask about the wifi and the person I talked to seemed completely surprised and informed me she had never heard about this problem before. But I could hardly be the only one complaining about the lack of wifi..?

The location is great and staff is generally very pleasant and helpful,  but unfortunately, that can not weigh up for all the issues above.

As I've stayed in many hotels in the world, I've come to realise there are a couple of things that I expect when staying in a hotel: 1. Quiet room and hallway 2. When it says free wifi on website, I expect wifi to work in hotel room and 3. A nice hotel breakfast.
We asked to change room the first night as we could hear and feel underground in our room (be aware of staying on 1st floor, esp room 169). There was no wifi in our room, very disappointing. And the breakfast buffe was very limiting, focusing mainly on full English breakfast.

121,In the middle of it all and beautiful,"Visited July 2013

After two weeks in Europe, my girlfriend and I had completed our circle back to London and needed a quick hotel near Westminster Abby. I got this as a last minute booking on the hotel tonight app just before we got on the Eurostar in Paris. 

This is probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. Located about 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace and another 3 blocks the other way to Westminster Abby, this hotel is nearest all the big things toward the river. Probably the best placed hotel in all of London (admittedly, I had considered booking this hotel for my ""London weekend"" but elected to stay in the British Library/Museum area). 

The only complaint about the hotel was the amount of time it took to check in. They definitely didn't have enough people working the front desk that particular day/time.

Other than that, this hotel does the little things that make a hotel luxurious. Live piano player, highly rated wines, my name personalized on my bedroom tv screen, high thread count robes, speakers in the bathroom so I can listen to the tv while showering in the all marble tile shower. 

I do wish that I could have experienced an upper room with a view. We were on the second floor with an interior view but other than that, this place was perfect.",5,2014,09,16
121,"Location, location","We had the pleasure of staying in this fantastic hotel that is situated in the right location to all the places you could wish to visit. Underground was short walk and old pubs are all about all you need to do is explore the surrounding streets.The staff were the best and the availability of quality eating places in the hotel and short distances made the venue just what we wanted. this is a good start for all things old as you visit London and when you sit outside enjoying a drink or two you can imagine how the other half lived 100 years ago.

friend we caught up with siad that this hotel was the lower end of the other Taj hotels, so I am going to book India as a destination in the futute as they could not stp raving about the other hotels in the chain.",5,2014,09,15
121,Well located,"We stayed here to get a good hotel near to Buckingham Palace, St James, Harrods and some other places. The Palace is 2 blocks away and if taking a taxi not expensive to the rest. Close enough to St Pancras station (20 min) and 1 km to Victoria Station.
It met all these requirements and was a nice hotel to stay in with small clean rooms. Nice staff although not all staff were english by nationality.
Middle stylish with a doorman as well.",4,2014,09,15
121,A real curate's egg,"A curate's egg - good in parts but sloppy and badly done in other parts. Check in was with a charming young lady who is not particularly fluent in English and who was in any case battling against the loud and, it has to be said, not very good pianist. The lifts are slow, a long wait us mandatory at check in time in the early evening. Room was small but there was an excellent bathroom. The TV, as ever in London hotels, was slightly out if focus, painfully slow to operate and in the end just irritating. Dinner was in the Zander bar - again the music dominates and necessitates shouting at your near neighbour. Why is that volume necessary? And the wooden floors don't help matters. The food was, well, good in parts. A moderately good steak with overdone chips but an excellent peppercorn sauce. A modest cheesecake but a very fine Chilean Merlot. Great service from Joe - an example of how to be an outstanding waiter without being overbearing, over-familiar or arrogant. I thought he was first class, as was the young lady at the desk. But overall there are too many areas in this hotel which were not just average but actually quite disappointing. Management hasn't really got a good enough grip of this place. It was better as a Crowne Plaza. The key question, as ever, is would I go back? If it gets to Crowne Plaza standards, then yes. As it is, only if I had to - but at least I could get a decent meal served by Joe. ",3,2014,09,15
121,Great location. Great hotel.,"This hotel is certainly a 4star hotel - very clean and a great location for all sites. Free wifi. There's a little convenience store, that sell wine and treats next store. A couple of restaurants across the street. Very close to the pick up for the hop on hop off bus. Right behind Buckingham Palace. Great place. Definitely recommend.",4,2014,09,15
121,Plenty of positives with a few niggles.,"I chose St James Court based on its reviews and proximity to Buckingham Palace and Palace of Westminster.  We stayed here for 2 nights and booked 2 superior double rooms through Late Rooms.  Our rooms were next to each other, as requested, and were a good size for London.  Although very dated and need of refurbishment, they were clean and comfortable, however to get to them involved quite a trek down long corridors. 
We ate in Bistro 51 on a number of occasions and we found the food and service to be excellent, with the 3 course menu particularly good value for money,  My dad is in a wheelchair and the staff, particularly Yunis, were extremely helpful and accommodating.  

Now for the areas that need improvement.

Rooms were not ready on arrival, which was fine as we arrived at about 13.00, so went for lunch in the Bistro.  I checked again after lunch and still not ready. The receptionist told me they would phone me when ready.  We had made other plans to visit The Imperial War museum, so left the hotel and returned at 6 ish.  At no point did anyone from reception phone me.  Why say you will phone and then not do so?

Although I told the hotel my dad was in a wheelchair, the rooms were located a long way away from reception and we encountered 2 steps in the corridor on the 3rd floor which meant we had to help him out to walk down them.  However, this would not have been suitable for someone who had with no mobility at all.

My main gripe was when we checked out.  One of the rooms was over charged for items from the mini bar which my dad had not even opened.  I was also billed for breakfast, which I note a previous reviewer had also experienced, when the deal we had booked through Late Rooms stated free breakfast for those booking 2 nights.  Although this did not spoil the stay, as we had  such a lovely weekend, it was disappointing that I had to spend time trying to sort it out.

Overall, not quite a 5 star, more like a 4 star but then I guess it depends what room you book?  We would return again and recommend it to others.  We also did not experience any problems with the underground noise as noted by others.",4,2014,09,15
121,Pretty good,"Stayed here for just one night on business. Bar and lounge are comfortable but very small. There's a nice courtyard if the weather's good. When I checked into my room I was struck by a cacophony of noise. The windows are single glazed and there is a huge amount of construction taking place at the rear (I think) of the property, as well as a school playground. Really noisy. I asked to be moved and this was accommodated without fuss (I think they must be used to it). My new room on the second floor overlooked the courtyard and was much much quieter. It was quite spacious for a London hotel room but was a bit shabby. Front desk, concierge and bar staff were all polite and efficient. It was pretty good really but like many old London hotels is in need of a bit of refurb investment. ",3,2014,09,15
121,Good Hotel - Potential to be great,"Hotel location is excellent. 2 minute walk from tube station, 5 minute walk from Buckingham Palace. Staff are attentive and very helpful, Doorman very good and made sure he got you a taxi right away. Rooms were good, but a few little things could be improved upon like the ironing board which didn't stand up as it was broken. There are slight vibrations from the tubes which run under the building, however not at night as they do not run - not sure why people complain so much about this. Overall a good stay in a great location. Would stay again.",4,2014,09,15
121,"Great hotel, but the noise and vibration cause by trains is serious","When I walked into the hotel,there was live music the evening adding so much to the charm in the hotel. Overall the deco are a little worn and needs replacement but the charm was there.
The room was clean. But the noise and vibration that reaps through the room was a serious issue. I slept through as I was really tired and didn't really complain as was only there for one night. I would have asked for room change or left the hotel had I booked myself for a longer time. 
My room was 255. 
Breakfast was ordinary. Staff were helpful. Location is great for tourists.

121,Beautiful,I stayed at the London st james for 2 nights. The hotel was amazing the staff could not have been more helpful & attentive with booking my sight seeing tours. My room was across the court yard it was quite large for a single very clean and spacious. Very close to Buckingham palace. I will definitely be back.,5,2014,09,14
121,A work in progress,"Great location, lots of shops, restaurants and bars really close by.  The hotel's buildings are Victorian and impressive but it has a LONG way to go yet before it lives up to the Taj brand.

Very nice staff on check in.  Our room was in a block across the outdoor courtyard - we were taken outside and then back inside, to the spa building where we took the elevator to the 8th floor to our room (what do they do if it's raining?).  The elevator (just the one) needs to replaced as soon as humanly possible - we got stuck twice - not in an alarming way, but we got to floor 3 and the doors didn't open, and we went back to the lobby.  The next day, we got to floor 6, the doors didn't open and we went back to the lobby.  I got out and walked.  8 floors.  Up.  It seemed safer.  The elevator is very old, the floor indicators don't work and it's not an experience that in any way makes you feel confident or safe.  The stairs have very shabby carpets which are old and worn and need to be replaced.  The lift lobby's are crying out for a refurb, with scruffy carpets and broken console tables.  I wouldn't have noticed except for the repeat trips up and down the stairs to avoid the dodgy elevator which meant I saw every floor.

Having said that, our room was OK but small even for London, twin single beds, older bathroom which definitely needs a major refurb.  The furniture and decor were old and not glamorous.  But the aircon was excellent and very new and the beds were very comfy if narrow.  We looked out over a massive building site (not uncommon in London but it would be nice if they provided earplugs) and there was noise both morning and evening - additional noise from the playground of the school opposite didn't make for a great wake up.  That said, we didn't ask to be moved so it was kind of our own fault, but if you find yourself in a similar room, ask for a change right away.   We also heard the tube trains and felt the vibrations which was unsettling when we were 8 stories away from ground level.  

Breakfast was excellent and included in the rate (£210 for the most basic room choice) but we were charged for it again on check out - it was removed but we were questioned about it which was not very courteous.  We had 2 coffees and 2 mineral waters in the courtyard cafe which is a lovely place to hang out - but at £16, it was really expensive.

It's OK but I won't stay again.",3,2014,09,12
121,Great Hotel with Excellent Service,"We were delighted with this hotel. It is very conveniently located in central London near Buckingham Palace, Saint James Park and the Victoria Station. The first room we were given had not been renovated as so many had been and we opted to upgrade to a superior double. It was well worth the difference in price. Be aware that some rooms have quite a lot of noise and vibration from the underground so be sure to request a quiet room.
I was particularly impressed with the staff at the hotel. All the employees we encountered were friendly and helpful but there are two people I would really like to commend. Alessia in reception was wonderful at finding us comfortable and quiet rooms. We were traveling as a family, but arriving at different times and days and she made every effort to get us the best rooms available. She was always cheerful and kind and patient. Our waiter in the bar was Alliston for three nights. We had a baby in our group and Alliston was so friendly, helpful and patient with all our needs and requests. We chose to have our meals here for three nights as it is not easy to eat out in restaurants in London with a baby and here we were welcomed, the food was excellent and Alliston was the best waiter, ever!",4,2014,09,11
121,"Good hotel, great location","We spent one of August's weekends there. Nice rooms, good service. Some parts of the hotel are stiil under the reconstruction. Good breakfast served in two restaurants. Nice bar. Some of the rooms needs updating. Location not to be beaten.",4,2014,09,11
121,Excellent location,"We stayed at this hotel for 7 days.  We arrived on a Thursday and attended a wedding at the Oriental Hyde Park Hotel on the Saturday... and visited with long time friends who also came to the hotel on Sunday thru Thursday.  the location is perfect... walk up the road to Buckingham Palace; east towards Big Ben and Westminster Abbey and the London EYE... also a boarding point for the river boats to the Tower of London and Greenwich. West to Hyde park and a cab to Picadilly Circus and the West End etc.  A great little breakfast place across the road (not the fancy new one) but the small one (crumpets advertised on the board outside!.)  lots of restaurants around.  the hotel restaurant is very good and the one next door (Bank) is also very good... the courtyard is great.  Service is good... room was also good... needs a bit of updating, needs new beds.  We were on the 7th floor - #770. overlooking the public school and the new building (which was not noisy!). Cabs were available 24/7 via the doorman outside . Recommend hat you take the 'hop-on-off' bus tour -24 hrs.  so get it in the afternoon and then you have half of the next day to use it also...includes a river cruise as many times as you like during the 24hr period.",4,2014,09,10
121,Very Satisfied,"We stayed 3 nights in July  great location, buffet breakfast  good , Room ok just had a  bit of trouble operating shower. Concierge very helpful, Value for money in central London. Court yard a great bonus .",4,2014,09,08
121,Extremely satisfied,"We stayed here for four nights in August. We were not happy with the first room we got on the third floor, the underground runs beneath the hotel.  We thought it would be ok but the trains run every few minutes and the entire room shook .  We asked to change and we're moved to a much nicer room on the 6 th floor. The room was very good , large bathroom and wardrobes .  We had a great stay .  St James tube is 2 mins walk.  The breakfast is great ( traditional English) .  There are several restaurants and bars in the hotel,  this is a great hotel in a great area of London.  Many great sites just minutes away.",4,2014,09,06
121,Great location & staff but shame about the regular hotel users,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip to the city.
Fantastic central location and a stunning hotel entrance & reception. 
Rooms were very nice, think I had an executive room and the breakfast was amazing quality,
Shame about the bar being so small but we didn't use it as there's plenty of other places to visit within walking distance.
Some of the more regular guests in this hotel were rather ignorant and rude and made it awkward at times such as at breakfast where me and my colleague were sat together and people kept on refusing to sit next to us in favour of sitting somewhere else.",4,2014,09,05
121,"Great location, great staff","Just had five nights at the St James Court. Location is great walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben and many other sites. Very close to St James station and good buses close at hand. 
Room was a little tired, but clean and good size no complaints very quiet, so easy to reset the time clock.
Staff were great, restaurants in house good, several other good spots to eat outside a very short walk.",4,2014,09,05
121,Best Location,"We stayed in London for two nights, and booked a classic king room. The room provided was a lot bigger than we thought. It's like a mini suite with seating area and all. The service was effective and friendly. The hotel has a very convenient location, within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, the Parliament, Westminster Abbey and many more. I would definitely come back if I have chance to go to London again.",4,2014,09,04
121,Location ... location ... location ... attentive staffing,"This hotel is located extremely well for sightseeing in London.  It's located on Buckingham Gate and just a five minute walk to Buckingham Palace, Royal Mews, city parks, St James underground, and the many shops and restaurants along Victoria Road (ten minute walk to Victoria Station and Victoria Coaches).   A ten minute walk in the other direction gets you to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Big Bend, and Thames River ... another five minutes gets you to 10 Downing and Trafalgar Square.  The staffing was attentive and responsive, especially the concierge desk.

Our room was on the seventh floor overlooking the courtyard (hotel has elevators).  Getting to the room is a long walk down a maze of hallways (warm and humid).  The room was large with AC and a venting window ... but bathroom on the small size.  Wifi and cell signal was adequate in the room.  The bathroom sink waste water would backup into the bathtub ... when asking staff about correcting the problem, staff said it was just the piping.  The lobby and ground floor areas are in keeping with a 4+ rating ... but the hallways are in need of carpet repair and upgrades, the rooms could use upgrades, along with exterior (especially the courtyard interior ... so that rating would be more of a 3+ ... and the hotel location is a 5 rating.  The hotel is higher priced, so upgrades throughout need to considered.",4,2014,09,03
121,Elegance in a perfect location,"5 minutes from Buckingam Palace and from the Circle/District underground, huge hotel, huge suite. Nice present: room service came in with a piece of cake 5 mins after we entered our room, with congrats for our honeymoon. Very efficient receptionists and concierge.",4,2014,09,02
121,A particular British quirkiness,"Business meeting and arrived early so i thought I would review what the meeting was about and sat near the bar in the reception area (very comfortable I might add)... hoping that I would be noticed  as i could do with something refreshing. 

Bartender looked at me and noticed me and a few others arrived too .... I waited and waited - in the end I decided I would go and order a drink ....

What is it with this country in some of the nicer Hotels even that engenders this apathy towards seeing if , as a guest, you have everything you need and maybe - just maybe - serve the guest and get a tip .......",4,2014,09,02
121,Wonderful,Stayed here for one night. Me and my mom had booked a regular double room. When we got there did we get told they were short on those rooms so we got a little upgrade....not that little once we saw the suite. It was a nice one. The staff....wonderful. We have no bad words about this place at all. Great location is a very big plus. No we will be back for sure! ,5,2014,09,01
121,It was the icing on the cake for my birthday stay in London,"Staying at the St James court hotel in London was fantastic.  The staff were polite, courteous and very attentive. Our room we could not fault and the decor was tastefully done. Will recommend to friends and will hopefully come and stay again. ",5,2014,09,01
121,"Frist time I stayed in Westminster From Columbus,Ohio","The hotel was very nice. The tea was very good. If you like Indian food you like this hotel because every restrunt servies  Indian food.

121,3 day break in an excellent hotel.,"As a 25th wedding anniversary treat myself and my wife took a three day break in London.We stayed in St James Court,A Taj hotel and from the moment we entered the hotel lobby you could tell that it was a special hotel.From the door man through to the cleaning people the service was faultless.Check in was a breeze .We were even upgraded to an executive room having booked a Classic King  room.A nice touch was the fact that a small cake wishing us a happy anniversary was left in our room.I had mentioned in booking the hotel the reason for our visit.The room we stayed in was on the fourth floor overlooking the courtyard and it was fabulous.The location of the hotel was great as it was a five minute walk to Victoria tube station,from which you had access to anywhere in London.Buckingham Palace was a five minute walk from the hotel,as was Westminster Abbey and The Houses of  Parliament .The only negative about the hotel would be the Quillon restaurant an establishment that specialised in South Indian dishes.We took dinner here during our stay and we're disappointed with our experience .The service in the restaurant was slow and the food was certainly not Michelin star quality.That said we may have just have been unlucky.",5,2014,08,30
121,Business Trip,"I stayed in the St James' Court on Bank Holiday.  I was very impressed with the character of the buildings.  We were met at the entrance of the hotel with a very courteous chap complete with umbrella - a typical Bank Holiday weekend for weather!

Check in took 5 minutes and found my room on the 6th floor with ease.  Well signposted throughout the hotel with enough staff to ask if you did get lost.  I only booked a single room as I was only there one night and on my own.  The room far exceeded my expectations.  The bed was double, the room very spacious, bathroom lovely and all very clean.  They had a vast room service menu which would have been wonderful if you were on your own; I met my sister for dinner so did not experience the service.

All in all a wonderful experience and should I ever head back to London on business or pleasure, this is the hotel I would chose.  I could find no fault - I have only seen one review which was not good; this chap must be really hard to please as I did not witness any of his so called faults.  Book it!  Its lovely!",5,2014,08,29
121,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed at the Taj for four nights in London and found it to be a great experience - very central to all attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Trafalga Sq, London eye, Big Ben etc etc - all within walking distance.  The service at the hotel was fantastic and had the best Indian food too - bonus that.  Highly recommend - we will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,08,28
121,Pamper Yourself,"My sister and I stayed for a week at this Taj property.  We were treated like royalty. We were made to feel welcome from reception on.  Those on the concierge desk were all extremely helpful as were the porters.  The waiters and waitresses were friendly and obliging.  Housekeeping went out of their way to be helpful.  There is a Business Centre with computers and other equipment for the regular person (me) or the businessman.  There are facilities for a spa or a massage.  Wish we'd had time for the latter.  There's an outdoor cafe which with the weather didn't permit most of the time, although some guests did sit out there.  The food was excellent both in the Bistro 51 where we enjoyed breakfast, the Hamptons Bar where we enjoyed dinner, or room service which we also needed after some of our days.  My only comment on the food is that it's a bit a pricey, but considering the quality of our stay, not outrageous.  Although we ate out especially for lunch, most of the time the food wasn't up St. James quality.  I did have some laundry done; wish I'd understood what he meant when he said 9 pounds.  I took it to mean per load.  He meant per piece.  It was washed and pressed and returned to our closet wrapped in plastic.  I prompted spilt chocolate on the first top I wore!   I choose my hotels in London based on the sights I plan to see.  St. James Court is ideally situated south of St. James Park where you can view the Changing of the Guard, an easy walk.  Buckingham Palace and the Mews are about a block away.  Westminster Cathedral is a few blocks away to your right as you come out of the hotel and right. Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament are several blocks to your left on Victoria Road as you come out of the hotel on your right.  There are a number a shops on Victoria Road to the right and left from Buckingham Gate.   Victoria Bus Coach and Train Station are in walking; I know I've done it.  This is the fourth hotel I've stayed at I've stayed at in London and the best so far,",5,2014,08,28
121,Do not stay here! The Tube noise is AWFUL,"I am a huge fan of Taj hotels. However, this is one of the worst hotels in which I have stayed...which is a strong comment considering a travel more than 100,000 miles a year.

We checked in at the designated check in time of 2p. We waited over two hours for our room by hearing ""It will only be 30 minutes"" 4 different times. We escalated to the hotel manager who assured us he would have our room ready in ""less than 30 mins"". This turned into 45 minutes. Keep in mind we were paying for their largest suite at over 400GBP a night and this was the service we received.

I had read on TripAdvisor to stay on a high level floor to avoid noise. We were located in a large, master suite on the 6th floor. The suite was large but in poor condition (marks all over walls, dirty bathroom, stains in carpet, old furniture, and awful bed linens). Within 1 minute of being in the suite, the room started shaking and a loud roaring was heard. It was the Underground (train). We thought maybe we would get used to it. After 10 minutes of shaking and roaring, we knew we would never be able to relax or sleep in this room. The train runs almost 24 hours.

We called downstairs and asked if there were any other quieter rooms. We were told this was their best room. I noted the loud Underground noise and they said they were UNAWARE OF ANY NOISE COMPLAINTS FOR THIS ROOM. Why lie? This only made me more upset.

I then spent time looking for another hotel close-by. We moved to another hotel. Of course we spent 2 hours waiting for the room, 45 minutes to find another hotel, and then 1 hour relocating. The afternoon was lost.

I CANNOT STATE STRONGLY ENOUGH THAT THIS HOTEL IS LOUD. Very loud noise from the train that runs right below the hotel. On top of the terrible noise, the hotel service was indifferent, uncaring, and what I would expect from a 1 star hotel. Keep in mind we were paying 400GBP a night.

Please enjoy your trip to London by staying at another hotel.",1,2014,08,27
121,A  really lovely hotel,"We stayed at the St James Court Hotel last Saturday night, the hotel is very attractive with a lovely courtyard area where we sat and drank possibly the best coffee I've ever had. We arrived early and as the room wasn't ready we went out sightseeing. When we returned our luggage had already been delivered to our room, we were on the 3rd floor overlooking the courtyard. The room was average size for a London hotel with a comfortable bed and the bathroom was large, very stylish and clean. The staff are friendly and extremely courteous and are the hotels greatest asset. They all worked hard to ensure their guests were happy. We ate at Bistro 51 and Quilon during our time at the hotel, both were very good and the food was delicious. On Sunday morning when it became obvious that the queue for breakfast was too long, we along with others were moved to a makeshift area near the bar which was set up with all the breakfast foods we would have had in the restaurant, this was a nice move and helped clear the queue quickly, Overall this is a really nice hotel in a good position for the London Eye, Big Ben etc.",4,2014,08,27
121,"Nice staff, uncomfortable rooms","My husband and I stayed here during a short working visit to London.  The staff at this hotel are very welcoming and helpful, and the hotel itself is beautiful.  I enjoyed the gym facilities, especially since it rained everyday!  My only complaint, which is a big one, is that the rooms were not comfortable.  The pillows were hard and cheap-feeling (like fake cotton filled) and very hot.  We tried to turn down the AC and open the windows, but nothing helped.  I haven't visited many hotels in London, but I wouldn't jump at the chance to go back here.",3,2014,08,27
121,Great location for London marathon,Walking distance from the finish which is what u need!! Hotel had been taken over by Taj after I'd booked it. Had few issues with room as it was a smoking and requested non. Waited an hour to get checked into a different room. Room was dated but ok. Request a refurb room when booking!! Service was ok and the long bar was awesome!!,5,2014,08,26
121,WONDERFUL HOTEL EXPERIENCE,"July 21-30, 2014:  I had called to confirm our reservation a week prior, & was told by the lady that I spoke with that we would be upgraded from a Classic King to an Executive King at no extra charge when I told her we would be arriving on our 40th wedding anniversary. It took a while for that to actually happen when we arrived, but the gentleman at the desk finally was able to move us to this type of room on the 5th floor from a room that had not been refurbished yet on the 2nd floor. We did not get the requested view of the courtyard, but we did not spend a lot of time looking out the window anyway.  We were quite pleased with his efforts. 

Our newly remodeled Room 505 was beautiful, & not far from the elevator. The bed & bedding were extremely comfortable.  The bathroom, with shower, was quite large, & even had a heated towel rack on the wall.  This luxury room was a good size, & not at all cramped. We were able to use the refrigerator in the room with no charge. 

Shortly after checking in, housekeeping brought us a converter for our USA electrical needs at no charge, which we greatly appreciated. This did not happen when we traveled to France & Italy.  

We were unable to get the Free WiFi to work  in our room on 8 of the 9 nights there.  It only worked in our room on one Saturday night.  Therefore, nightly, we would go down to the lovely lounge, and sit in 2 very unusual & large, stylish Dark Blue chairs to connect to WiFi to read our emails. There was a pianist that we greatly enjoyed listening to as we used our iPads. He played soothing 40s & 50s type of music, & was very talented.  It was quite relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Actually, had the WiFi worked in our room, we would have never discovered this entertainment.

We had breakfast in Bistro 51 one morning, and were very impressed with the food.  There were several other Pubs & restaurants close by also.

We looked forward to having coffee & hot chocolate with a Walker's Shortbread cookie that were provided in our room each morning. Both a bottle of Still & Sparkling water were provided daily as well. 

The nearest Tube station, St James Park, was 2.5 minutes away on Caxton St.  This hotel was about .2 mile from Buckingham Palace & Big Ben, and right in the heart of many attractions.  

All of the hotel's staff were very friendly and helpful.

I would DEFINITELY stay at the St James Court Hotel again. I would not even check out other places to stay.  We had a wonderful and memorable time in London celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary. I am wholeheartedly recommending the St James Court Hotel to everyone.  I honestly do not believe that you could get a better hotel for the price or a better location in all of London.",5,2014,08,25
121,Fabulous hotel,We stayed 4 nights in August and enjoyed every minute. The service was impeccable and the facilities excellent. The hotel was full and it was a weekend but we did not experience any delays at breakfast in the mornings. Our room was beautifully furnished although the bathroom was on the small size. The towels were luxurious and the toiletries were supplied in abundance. The location is excellent and very close to Buckingham palace and St James Park. Our room was quiet and looked out onto the walls of the building but I guess as we checked in late on a Friday evening we couldn't get one with a courtyard view. One thing I was not sure about was the service charge added to the bill at the restaurant. We tipped on top of that but later wondered whether we were tipping twice.  Service charges are not something we are familiar with and we did want to leave something for the waiter.,5,2014,08,25
121,Peaceful stay in a vibrant city,"After a long flight from Australia, we chose to travel to the hotel via train from Heathrow and found accessibility excellent, after one change to the District line it was a short walk from St James's Park station. The hotel foyer was beautifully appointed and our welcome on arrival extremely pleasant. We arrived 6 hours too early for check-in but our room was ready within 3 hours. The hotel is in a quiet area within easy walking distance to many places. We walked everywhere. We were amazed at the tranquility of our room (absolutely no street noise). The hotel restaurant served a lovely dinner although a touch expensive. Only negative, our room was a little small, no room for two people to sit. We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in London.",5,2014,08,25
121,Good location and staff!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay at the Taj. Arriving late on a Friday evening we were checked in swiftly and received an upgrade. Our room was newly refurbished and, although small, was lovely with everything we needed. The bathroom was beautiful! Breakfast was great and the choice plentiful, the only downside was the long queue on Sunday morning but we weren't in too much of a rush! The foyer of the hotel is beautiful but some of the corridors need some attention but I believe Taj hotels are attending to this as they have recently taken this establishment over. The location is excellent, only 10 minutes walk from Victoria station and less than that to Buckingham Palace, the underground station is also within a few minutes walk. A very enjoyable stay, we'll be back!",4,2014,08,25
121,Good quality hotel in a good location,"Stayed here for 2 nights in August with family. Booked 2 rooms through Gala Hotels, one twin on a room-only basis for the teens and one double on a bed-breakfast for self and fella. At checkin I made it clear that I needed a twin for the teens and a double for myself. The chap at reception was very nice and although at first couldn't guarantee a twin, he later said that in fact the booking made through the agent was for 2 twins, so he would change it to 1 twin and 1 double on the same floor. One room (my double) was ready at 1pm and the other room would be ready at 2pm. The first room was a good size and had clearly recently been refurbished with a great bathroom, plenty of storage in the bedroom, lots of power sockets and a full length mirror (v important). The bed was very comfy. I heard no noise from outside or the nearby tube trains. The second bedroom turned out to be a double, not a twin, but because it was a huge room with 4 windows, a couch and 2 armchairs, the teens loved the space so I didn't get it changed. It clearly needed refurbishing as the fixtures and soft furnishings seemed very dated compared to the other room. Another really poor feature, in my view, was that the stairs were some distance from the lift which did not correlate to the floor plan, and would have been really difficult to find in the event of an evacuation. One morning when the lifts were full we had to wander through the corridors on our fourth floor to find a doorway that looked like it could lead to a flight of stairs. Not good, and certainly did not make me feel very safe. Sunday morning for breakfast was very busy so an overflow area was arranged near the bar. This made it awkward to try and eat a plate of food whilst sitting at a low table, and the overflow area then because quite crowded with guests and staff. It was slightly chaotic. The hotel has another restaurant so why not just open it up so that guests can sit properly and enjoy their breakfast? Seeing a queue of people waiting to be seated at breakfast time is not good for a hotel of this standard. On the plus side, the lobby area is very welcoming with lots of comfy seats, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the overall location is great as it's so close to Victoria and St James tube stops and within a few minutes to Buck Palace and the parks. I'd stay here again if I got a really good room rate.",4,2014,08,24
121,Family stay at St. James Court Hotel,"We chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and its excellent location in central London (Westminster) With no prior experience with Taj Hotels, we reserved two Classic rooms (one double and one king on line and basically hoped for the best) through Booking.com.   

Our experience turned out to be fabulous: we were treated very well and courteously upon check-in, and the kids' room was ready early (9:00AM) which was great. However, it took a long time for our room to be ready, so the front desk upgraded us to a suite facing the courtyard still on the same floor as our kids, which was a very nice gesture and well worth the extra wait (this was around 4PM)   

There was a technical issue with our thermostat, however this was quickly fixed once I reported it to hotel staff. Nightly turn-down service was excellent, and we enjoyed the Courtyard bar immensely for drinks as well as a dinner at the Indian restaurant.  Throughout our entire stay service was excellent.  Our only complaint is that the wi-fi service was uneven in the hotel, however it was free so it was great for our socially-networked kids.  The subway rumble mentioned elsewhere on TripAdvisor is definitely there, but it did not bother us as it adds to the ambiance and was not loud enough to awaken us. We will return to this hotel next time we visit London.

121,A beautiful hotel,"The hotel has a charm about it… plush luxurious interiors, an understated facade, a tranquil courtyard, beautiful rooms and despite its closeness to London’s tourist attractions it is hidden to provide a level of discretion and peace, which is priceless.

The staff are super friendly, I get a slightly later check out (which I really needed), and they have such patience in my use of the business centre (I needed to attend to some urgent commercial matters) – this hotel knows service!

121,The best place in central London,"We were visiting London the first week of August and were thrilled with the service we recieved , the concierge was the best ever they went above and beyond our expectations . We have travelled the world and stayed at a few Taj hotels but this exceeded our expectations . The staff was very personable and attentive and made us feel like we were the only guests they have , they were prompt and receptive. 
The wait staff in the hotel was very accomodative of our children and food needs and the food was excellent too!!
We had 2 rooms and one seemed more recently decorated then the other.
I would strongly recommend it to all",4,2014,08,22
121,Quaint but average,"This is a quaint hotel if you like wandering around a rabbit warren of corridors to find your room, I felt hemmed in and unsafe, suffocated by the lack of air in the labyrinth. Clearly this is an old building and it is difficult to modernise. Bathroom was crammed. Bed was excellent but very short, staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel is located relatively close to the Thames.",3,2014,08,22
121,nice hotel but disturbing train noise,"Booked two rooms through booking.com, opulent reception area & court yard. But rooms didn't live up to expectation, first room very small tucked into a corner at the court yard ...could hardly see day light. The noise from the exractor/ air con was under the window, so the window had to stay closed. The rumble of the underground trains was disturbing they stopped about 1:30 &:started about 4:45! The second room was a much brighter room with two windows overlooking a hugh building site.. very noisy with builders working & lifts going all the time....so again the window's stayed closed. Then the rumble of trains shaking the windows ....felt like I was trying to sleep in the middle of the underground....shame really as the staff were very helpful & polite & the hotel was situation was perfect.",3,2014,08,21
121,It Got Better.,"We arrived at the Taj and our room was not ready so we availed ourselves of the spa services...great. When our room was ready it was totally filthy...carpet stained, coffee on the door of the minibar, walls marked and dirty...the linens and towels were clean. We went down to reception and explained our concerns and were told we could upgrade the next day at our own expense, which we did. The first day in the new room while my husband is in the shower the maintenance man arrives and says there is a leak in the room below and asks if we are letting water run onto the floor while we shower. My husband quickly finishes his shower and the maintenance man joins him in the shower and removes the drain to discover that there was no seal and tells us that we may be moved again as he may not have the part (and I'm thinking I will probably have to eat that cost too). We did not have to move again but by that time it felt like Murphy's Law had taken over our vacation. After that things were relatively okay but I will ever book
a Taj hotel again (it was the Crowne Plaza when we
booked). ",3,2014,08,20
121,Not exactly 4 stars..,The lobby was beautifully decorated and the dining room was stunning for breakfast but the room was very dated and looked like it was decorate a long time ago. The light in the bathroom was temperamental and would randomly go off though when I complained they did come and fix it. Over all a nice stay but just wish the rooms had the same quality as the rest of the hotel. Fab staff and very comfy bed! We stayed one night and it was just a little disappointing.,4,2014,08,19
121,Excellent Hotel in Central London,"My wife and I spent a week at the St James and had a wonderful king size room with air conditioning.  When we arrived the room was not quite ready, so they provided tea and soft drinks while we waited.  The room was well appointed and spacious with two wing back chairs and a love seat.  The bath had a large soaker tub with heated towel rack, bathrobes and slippers.  The room had a mini bar, safe and trouser press.  The only downside was our room was located on the backside of hotel and you had to navigate through several hallways between the elevator and the room.  Bed was extremely comfortable.  Hotel has an excellent afternoon tea. Located a short five minute walk south of Buckingham Palace.",5,2014,08,19
121,Mini break,"I have recently come back from a mini break with a friend at St James Court where we celebrating our 60th birthdays. The accommodation was booked along side a booking at The Victoria theatre to see the show Billy Elliott. From arriving to leaving the hotel the experience was fantastic. We were upgraded to a suite and also got an invite to the managers cocktail party which made us feel very special. The room was beautiful, very clean and lots of extra's like slippers gowns toiletries and very soft towels. All the staff were very friendly. Breakfast was very good everything you needed to set you up for the day. The hotel is very plush and also has a beautiful court yard where you can  have a drink or just relax in the sunshine. The theatre was just a short walk away which we managed quite easily. We also visited Buckingham Palace which is about 5 mins walk in the opposite direction and St James tube station is just across the road. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely book again when l next visit London",5,2014,08,19
121,Central Hotel,"My wife and I have just stayed 3 nights at this hotel. We were upgraded and offered other extra,s free of any further expense. I would say we enjoyed our stay, due to the room, which while quite small, was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Yes as others have said, the bathroom was small, but had all we needed and again was spotless. The air con wasn't as good as we would have liked, but I was quite easily able to sleep and also able to open the windows, air con in the best 5 star hotels can often be worse. Service at breakfast was excellent as was the food choice. Location is great for Buckingham Palace and nearby attractions. The cost for 3 nights was very reasonable for a Central London Hotel, (Well done The Taj) Overall a very nice experience, which I would definitely use again. Thank you for everything.",4,2014,08,19
121,great place to stay without breaking the bank,"Went up to London for the weekend and had problems finding a nice hotel at a sensible price we found the St James and booked a king executive room on the 7th floor. The room was big enough very clean and tidy. The bathroom was not large by any means but for a weekend it was fine. although one thing let it down and that was the shower modern equipment but very little water pressure you had to walk around to get wet that was a bit of a disappointment. but that was the only fault if you can call it that. The King size bed was so comfortable. its bigger than the normal king size i slept in before sleep quality was just right for us. The check in was smooth and very friendly all the staff were very helpful and wanted to take a few seconds for a chat. I drove up and with the road works all around i thought i would have trouble parking. The concierge was really helpful cot a couple of cars moved a bit and we parked right outside on the single yellow line all weekend. That was really helpful.
Breakfast was brilliant as much as you wanted. Eggs done to your liking, Fresh toast not from the usual stand and wait for half an hour machine. Ordered and in quick time on the table straight from the kitchen in a toast rack. No rush no fuss just nice well cooked food and served very quickly. Full marks for breakfast. 
overall this was a really nice place to stay for the weekend. That wont break the bank. the hotel is very quite with none of the usual background noise. A great weekend and we will stay here again next time we go up to London. 
This is a large hotel well worth a visit.",5,2014,08,19
121,Slightly Disapointed,"This hotel would have received a top rating, however room allocation let it down. We specifically booked this hotel since it has a lovely courtyard (rare outdoor space I'm London), and requested a room overlooking it. Since we had booked some time in advance we were disappointed on arrival to find no rooms available overlooking the courtyard. The hotel did give us a complementary upgrade and the room was newly refurbished to a high quality. However, if you are going to compensate your guests, please don't put them in small rooms next to linen cupboards facing nothing more than other rooms and looking down on a flat roof. 

Despite this disappointment this is a very good hotel with friendly staff. The lobby is a lovely well decorated area which gives a real luxury feel. The courtyard is a relaxing space where you can enjoy food and drink.   

The hotel is ideally placed for Buckingham Palace (5 minutes walk), the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abby, Scotland Yard and ST James's Park tube station (2 minutes walk). There are plenty of local restaurants, a shopping area and a couple of theatres close by. So really an ideal base for exploring London.

Breakfast was fairly average, and food and drink are the usual high hotel prices. However, despite a few drawbacks would recommend a stay, and we will be visiting again soon.",4,2014,08,19
121,Disappointed in  Room,"My wife and I stayed at the St James hotel for only one night and on arrival we both commented on how nice the lobby was set up and decorated.  We checked in and when we got to our room we were truly disappointed.  It looked to me as if the room should have been remodeled many years ago. The toilet seat had been replaced with a seat that didn't fit as it was way too small, and when you sat down, the seat shifted.  Navigation through the hallways was also a challenge.
On the bright side we did have a meal in our room and it was very tasty.  My wife was also able to make a pot of teat in he provided tea pot.  The service by the doorman was excellent and my bags were handled carefully and promptly.  The hotel is also located close to Buckingham Palace and is only a five minute walk.",3,2014,08,18
121,Lovely hotel but beds are too big for the rooms!,My daughter and I stayed in one of the refurbished rooms. It was lovely but if you have mobility problems I think the gap between the bottom of the bed and the chest with the television on it would be a problem. The bed was comfortable and huge but maybe wrong for the room? Location was amazing. ,4,2014,08,17
121,25th wedding anniversary,"Lovely hotel - polite staff - nice room. We were staying at the hotel to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. This was acknowledged at reception by the very polite receptionist but that was it. There was no acknowledgement in the room, not even a bottle of wine or a bowl of fruit. We were welcomed with 3 oranges on a plate and a standard letter about the hotel from the manager. Disappointed to think that a small gesture of congratulations was not in place, but then again it's such a big hotel we were just another booking.",3,2014,08,17
121,"Nice hotel, however some staff lack famous Taj hospitality","Had a two nights' stay here because of an Eid holiday London treat for my mother who truly liked the idea of a classic historic British hotel combined with a touch of Indian 'desiness'.

We had originally planned just to take my seven months old baby along and I had booked a 35 square meter double room with a baby's cot. A couple of days before our trip we decided to take my daughter (age 6) with us as well.

Upon arrival we were met by a sort of young up and coming front desk guy who for a while kept on insisting that this room was only booked for three people and was not suitable for four people. I pointed out that my baby of 7 months was not ""people"" but a baby in a cot. And my 6 year old daughter would easily fit in between my mom and me in a king bed as is common practice around major international hotel chains (kids stay free in existing bedding).

He kept arguing that this could not be done. I asked why. He said due to 'health reasons'. Well I thought for myself as a doctor (I am a GP with two years of previous postgrad clinical microbiology experience) that I would be willing to take that risk of staying in a 35 sqm room for two nights with my mom, a little child, and a baby.

At this point the tone was getting a little unfriendly as well. I argued that this was really the first time I had ever experienced such claims that a room of that particular size (35 sqm) could not have two adults, a baby and a small kid. After years of traveling and hotel experience with kids (just thinking of our recent trip to China in May where my husband and I stayed at Raffles, Sofitel, and the Westin with four small kids in rooms just slightly larger and were indeed very comfortable with a large twin bedded room and two cots).

I told the guy 'that we were world class travelers with quite some experience'. He replied 'I am sure you are but this is how we do it here'. (Did I detect a slight of mocking tone there?).

Finally I said 'My husband is an Innercircle member and we have previously stayed at several Taj properties before. Really we have never experienced something like this before.' (was this person trying to sell us an upgrade?)

Instantly everything was resolved. The guy didn't say a word. Just told me to wait in the lobby because the room would be ready for check in at 2 pm exactly.

The time was by then 1.30 pm. We were tired and rather put off because of this unexpected not welcoming behavior. Truly I was missing the always friendly staff from Taj Palace Dubai who knew us by names after so many stays there.

The baby was crying by now. Needed a change, a feed and a good nap. Finally a Mr. Naveen Sikka (I think his name was) took pity on us and a made a few phone calls and our room was ready instantly. After being welcomed in such an odd way I could not thank Mr. Sikka enough for restoring my faith in the wellknown Taj hospitality again. I really think that these youngsters at the front desk could learn a few things from the more senior members of the staff.

Breakfast staff also very lovely. The girls serving could just not do enough for us and we were asked several times if we needed anything. That was nice. Concierge and bellboy were also extremely helpful.

Rest of the stay was comfortable and we were well taken care of. However, my advice for the management is to emphasize to their front desk staff the importance of giving the first impression of the hotel and a bad reception can overshadow the whole stay for a guest. Luckily we managed to differentiate between one ill mannered person and the rest of the lovely staff.

For December we are planning our first Morocco trip and looking forward to try out the Taj hotel in Marrakech.",3,2014,08,15
121,"wonderful hotel, fantastic stay","we stayed here for one night having booked tickets to see Billy Elliot (theatre 5 minutes walk away). On arrival there was a slight hitch in check in as our reservation (through the theatre not the hotel direct) could not be found however this was courteously and swiftly sorted whist we were  treated to complimentary drinks in the wonderfully opulent lobby area. The result was a free upgrade in both the rooms we had booked (one a suite -quickly bagged by our daughter and friend!!- well the trip was a treat for her!!)
The rooms are bright, spacious, and wonderfully appointed. Attention to detail and no corners cut. Huge towels, loads of toiletries, well stocked drinks tray...etc etc.
Breakfast was a mix of waitress and self service everything was cooked perfectly and quality excellent...the scrambled eggs golden yellow, poached eggs cooked to perfection, and a fantastic selection of food to suit all tastes.
EVERY member of staff, whatever their role were courteous and all acknowledged us through out our visit.
The only couple of glitches, and something to be aware of is the fact that the hotel held £50 per person on our account for extras but failed to inform us of this...it takes 2 days for it to go back into your account...on phoning the hotel concerning this we were treated professionally and were given an apology for the lack of communication. 
Also when I was given the key to our second room my husband and I headed off and soon discovered the room was occupied...luckily we did not walk in on anyone but it could have been very embarrassing for everyone involved...our name was similar to the other occupier hence the mix up...soon sorted.
We have not been put off returning again one day ...we are left wondering if this is 4 star what does it need to do to be five star?!!
THank you for a lovely stay!",5,2014,08,14
121,Outstanding Value,Our family of five stayed for six days at the St James Court Taj Hotel in London.  We enjoyed every aspect of the hotel.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and we especially enjoyed tea and other times in the courtyard.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Just a short walk to Buckingham Palace and not too far to Parliament and the London Eye.  This is one of the overall best hotel experiences we have had as a family in our travels.  We plan to return again soon.,5,2014,08,13
121,ride London trip,"What a wonderful hotel. Fab décor, fab staff, they couldn't have been more helpful. The room was lovely, we had booked a double and the room was set up as a twin, I rang down to reception and it was changed to a double in no time at all. Really comfy bed, lovely bedding. Room had trouser press, mini bar, iron and ironing board, robes and slippers, tea, coffee and biscuits. Lovely table set with 2 bottles of water, ice bucket ( that u filled from the ice machine in the corridor) and chocs. The bathroom had a bath, overhead shower, phone, radio, washing line, anti steam magnifying mirror, the biggest towels I have had in any hotel I have ever stayed in, more toiletries than you would ever need. Complimentary newspaper in the morning. The breakfast was served in the Bistro lovely large windows great for people watching, lovely breakfast, the only complaint we had was after our cereal, we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast, when we returned to our table it had been completely cleared. The staff apologised and quickly reset it. We had dinner in the court yard, it was fab (surroundings), hotel has 5 restaurants, all looked lovely. Cant wait to go back. 5 mins from Victoria train station, 7 mins Buckingham palace.",5,2014,08,13
121,Excellent service and location,"As a frequent traveller (86 countries so far) you can imagine how many hotels I have stayed in but I have struggled to find a suitable London hotel that I can return to....until now. I am an Inner Circle member (Taj rewards scheme) and had the pleasure to stay at Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, quite possibly one of the top ten hotels in the world. While the Taj St James falls short of such an esteemed accolade, I can say my wife and I enjoyed our three night stay in a quiet room (577) which was quite a trek from he lobby and we hope to return late Feb 2015. The service was very good. Staff are courteous and friendly. The breakfast choice is superb, served very well by Bertold! The location couldn't be better. The negatives? I called for The Spa but they were too busy to talk to me, could I call back later? No thanks, I wanted to book two massages. The lobby bar is quite nice. Concerige very efficient and check in / check out was easy. Rooms were presented/serviced to a high standard and TV channels very good. We'll be back!",4,2014,08,12
121,"Perfect location, luxurious room.","Very much enjoyed staying here over my birthday weekend. Staff were very helpful, friendly and made us feel important. The decor was more interesting than the standard, with a lovely courtyard. Room was a good size with very comfortable bed. Great location too, staying so close to Buckingham palace but very quiet location also. I hope to stay again. ",5,2014,08,11
121,Outstanding,"We stayed here for one night having secured an excellent deal. On arrival we found we had been upgraded. Our room was spacious and of a very high standard. All staff were very courteous and helpful.
We dis not eat at the hotel - breakfast is £27.50 per person but there is a good Pret a Manger just over the street. St James Park tube station is only 5 minutes walk and Westminster about 15 minutes.",5,2014,08,11
121,Meh...,"OK locations I walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament. Good price, but you get what you pay for. Room was old and tired. Bathroom was anything but luxurious. Service was friendly and breakfast was very good. Will not be returning and will not recommend to friends and family.  ",3,2014,08,11
121,40th birthday celebrations,"Really felt like a queen when we checked into this fab hotel and received complimentary coffee upon arrival. Staff were very courteous and professional especially Marcella in Bistro51 who brought me out a fantastic desert for my birthday.
Food was fab in Bistro51 & Bank Restaurant. Cocktails spectacular in Hamptons.
Disappointed in bedroom as our view was off a building site where they started to work at 7am, i know the building site was not the hotels fault.",4,2014,08,11
121,Exceeded our expectations exponentially!,"Beautiful hotel. Incredibly helpful and caring staff - Reception, Concierge and Bistro employees included. Our room was very nice and quiet.  Bathroom was well stocked with plenty of towels and personal supplies. Front desk was very friendly and upbeat. Food in Bistro was excellent. Menu was extensive. Great location. Able to walk everywhere safely. Concierge gave great maps and directions.",5,2014,08,11
121,Great Hotel after website mix up,"My wife and I ventured into London for my birthday to stay at the Taj suites at 51 Buckingham Gate. Unfortunately, the website I booked with (hotels.com) had provided me with a hotel room on the 2nd November? Anyway, I'm assuming a glitch in the system. The unfortunate part of the saga was that the Taj Suites were fully booked; but they were kind enough to contact their sister hotel, St James' Court, to see if they had availability. Fortunately, they did and as it is a walk across a shared courtyard, we didn't have far to go.

They booked us into a suite on the 3rd floor and the room was great. Separate living, dining, shower and wardrobe area. The restaurant downstairs (bistro I think) was great and we had a wonderful lunch.

My wife went to the Spa the next morning and had an equally fantastic experience, all in all a joy.

I would highly recommend it to all and sundry.",5,2014,08,11
121,"Great location,disappointing customer service..","I had booked one night here as birthday treat for my husband,first impressions on arrival were great, staff very attentive,as we had checked in early our room wasn't ready but that was fine as we were off to see a show so in no hurry.. 
Where it all started to go a bit 'faulty towers' was at breakfast the next morning,we turned up around 930 to be told there was no room in the main restaurant so had to go to another room which upon arriving there was a function room that had been set up in a hurry to cope with the masses! Unfortunately the staff who we're serving us apart from one waiter really didn't have a clue ..one young waiter was walking around pouring coffee out, I asked for tea, he then came back with a teapot poured it into the cup,I thought it looked strong,and my husband went to take a drink and said it was coffee! I don't think he understood the difference between the two beverages !!? He had gone and put coffee into a teapot ,I asked for some hot water and then he came back with a glass of cold tap water!!aagh..this went on the whole time we were there, unbelievable, the toaster was constantly jamming up so lots of burnt toast! I cannot believe this is a luxury hotel! As someone else mentioned earlier, we went to check out, they had 2 staff on the desk and about 20 people waiting!! Really need to get there act together, for the prices they charge..",3,2014,08,11
121,Nice courtyard for outdoors cup of tea,"I love coming here for a cup of tea, with friends or clients. It is great to be outdoors in the courtyard, quiet, beautiful and close to Victoria station and St James tube and Theatre.

Tea is expensive at £4 a pot, but it's worth for the above reasons.",5,2014,08,11
121,Excellent location,Fantastic location being so close to everything. The room was clean and very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and the concierge was extremely helpful. The hotel is only 1 mile from Parliament Square and quarter of a mile to Buckingham Palace. Totally recommend this hotel.,5,2014,08,11
121,Wonderful gem in the middle of the city. ,"I stayed here with my fiancé for 4 nights. I can't think of anything that is wrong with the hotel. The location is just perfect. Anything that is worth visiting is within a walking distance. 

As far as the rooms are concerned, they are true to their claim of being quintessentially English. 

Highly recommend this hotel.

121,Excellent service.,"My Mum, 4year old daughter and I visited for a weekend. It was my daughters birthday and they made her feel so special. The concierge was so helpful and friendly. The rooms were beautiful and great value for such a great location in London. The room service breakfast was yummy and not too pricy.",5,2014,08,10
121,Great Hotel in a great location,"We stayed here last year for a short break in London after a friend recommended the hotel.  So we booked again for a 3 night stay last week.  We arrived at 11.00 am, too early for check in but Christina on reception took our details and assured us that our baggage would be in the room when we returned.  So we went back several hours later and were given our room key and were told that our request for a late check out when we left would be ok.  Up we went to the room to find we had been upgraded to a lovely suite overlooking the courtyard and with fantastic air conditioning (my wife does like to be cold!).  A few minutes later there was a knock on the door and some complimentary fruit arrived. A quiet room, a very comfortable bed and a great nights sleep. The whole hotel is in the process of being renovated.  Excellent buffet breakfast with very friendly and helpful waiters and waitresses in a pleasant dining room looking over the street. Then we were invited for canapes and cocktails with the Manager and his staff which was very enjoyable, the staff here really care about customer satisfaction and feedback.  All in all, a very enjoyable stay and we will definitely be returning next time we stay in London.",5,2014,08,10
121,Disappointing customer service,"A return trip to this hotel it a first since it was taken over by the Taj group.

On the surface everything looks the same, and the concierge staff remain fantastic.
However, not enough staff on check in so had to wait a while for our room. Room not ready but that was fine as we headed out shopping.

Back in the room later and shower not working properly and water not draining away. Also found ladies underwear left in the wardrobe!
Raised the shower issue with reception when we went out that evening & assured it would be fixed.

Drinks in the bar outside were fine, cocktails nice.

Came to check out in the morning and again, no where near enough staff...2 on the desk at 12.30....we'd come back as the queue was huge when we headed out for breakfast (£25 per person a bit steep....but cafe over road was fantastic & ½ the price)
On checking out we again raised the issue around the shower / plug and what had been found in the wardrobe..no apology, no nothing! Shower head had been sorted but nothing else. 

Really not a great response at all when you've paid £180 for a room!
Having stayed here on trips to London for many years, I'm not sure we'll be rushing back.",3,2014,08,10
121,Extremely disappointed....,"Despite being a member of Trip Advisor for some time I have never felt sufficiently impressed or disappointed to write a review. I think Celebrity Cruises rate among the best experiences I have had, and this rates among the worst. We arrived on Thursday 7th August 2014 and despite my booking receipt declaring that our room would have a view of either the hotel courtyard or of Westminster, we were shown to a room that overlooked a wall about 2 feet away. There was no natural light, in fact no view whatsoever other than a corrugated iron wall. After I protested we were moved to a better room, however the hotel had also forgotten to book our spa treatment for the next day, so this was hastily rearranged for that evening by a receptionist who made no attempt to disguise her irritation that I had the audacity to complain. Fortunately, the spa treatment was lovely and the staff very welcoming.
We were made to feel like such nuisances when we raised our concerns at reception, that when we arrived at our new room after our wonderful spa treatment, I decided against complaining again when the hair dryer fell to bits when I tried to use it and the bathroom blind broke. The room was dated and the bed was pushed right up against the wall, but at least this time we had natural light and a view of the courtyard. To top it all our room keys stopped working after 24 hours, despite us booking for a two day stay, very inconvenient when on the 7th floor and you have to trail back down to reception.  We were considering booking into the hotel restaurant, but the whole experience was so unwelcoming we decided to walk into town.
This is a beautiful hotel, but is growing shabby and the reception staff were unpleasant and unhelpful; I felt our two day stay was significantly less than good value and that the hotel staff couldn't care less. I was very disappointed but thankfully the rest of our trip to London was wonderful. 
I do not recommend this hotel at all and have had better stays in nearby 'budget' chains (apart from the Spa where the staff were lovely). It's such a shame as my husband and I were really looking forward to this break and had deliberately booked a spa hotel to make it special.",2,2014,08,09
121,Great choice!,"This hotel is in a great location and only a short stroll to Buckingham Palace and other tourist attractions. 

The hotel has great facilities and staff are really professional and friendly. 

Rooms are a decent size however are quite dated, particularly the bathroom.Hotel corridors need to be refurbished also as they look tired and are in need of a make over. There was also a bit of rubbish etc on the floor near the elevators (on our floor) that was a bit unprofessional. 

Buffet breakfast was nice and there was a great variety of food available.

The closest underground station is St James Park which is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel.

Another note; we had free wifi included in our hotel however it did not work.  

Otherwise, a great choice and would recommend to others.",4,2014,08,09
121,Sensational Hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights in this remarkable hotel. The design, the building the location, everything was fantastic.

The hotel is located just a stoll from the Buckingham Palace and BigBen, and also a ncie walk to London eye area and the West End. You do get treated really well here and everyone is so nice and friendly.

 I only had two negative experiences while there, one being at check in the receptionist could not find my reservation even though I had the booked confirmation print out with me, I had to go through when I reserved, how much I payed, was breakfast included etc. this was a birthday gift for my partner who was standing next to me, so giving over how the details of how much it costs was quite unpleasant.

Other negative being I found one waitress in the cocktail lounge rather pushy, we had a night cap and then another was suggested, my partner did not really want another but ended ordering another after a bit of ""go on go on go on"" we went up to the room with them and she poured it down the sink. For the price I was livid!ha.

But all in all its a fantastic hotel with really lovely people and service. The housekeeping team deserve a special mention, they are so nice, dicreet and professional You know you are in good hands, as are the concierge.",4,2014,08,08
121,30th Birthday Visit,"Overall fantastic hotel. Excellent service and the staff were all very pleasant and attentive. 
My fiancé and I stayed for 3 nights for his 30th birthday.  When we arrived our room was upgraded and there was a cake in the room with a Happy 30th Birthday message which was lovely....and tasted soooo good.
We ate in the bistro which was very nice and we recieved a free dessert as it was my fiancés birthday. Again another great touch to make to make us feel special.
The hotel itself is very grand and the decor, staff attentiveness and cleanliness of the hotel done to a high standard. 
The location also really makes this hotel worth while staying at with just a 5 minute walk you are outside Buckingham palace. 

We are both looking forward to staying at this hotel in the future and would definitely recommend to Friends and family.",5,2014,08,07
121,40th birthday treat,"Had a wonderful stay at the hotel, immaculate and very well presented. Room was lovely and received a complimentary sweet for my birthday was very happy, would recommend this hotel and a lovely walk to Buckingham palace",5,2014,08,05
121,Excellent location,"We booked this hotel for two nights (pre-Globus trip) when they were having a special rate many months before our trip.  It was an excellent location for walking to London sights.  We even walked to a McDonald's for breakfast each morning (and on one morning discovered from the locals where to wait to see the queen appear at a special event).  
Our room was located in the older building, which needed updating, but the amenities were good, and the room was neat and clean.  Our ceiling began to leak the first evening of our stay during a rain shower, but we were quickly relocated to another floor and another room in the same building. We have never had this experience in any other hotel in our travels. Employees were very helpful.",4,2014,08,05
121,Nice Hotel in good location,"My husband and I stayed at St James Court for 6 nights. It was a great hotel, but there are definitely some things to note.

First the positives:
Location. Like everyone says, the hotel is in a good spot, although it was a bit confusing to find from the tube at first. We used the St James tube station, as the Victoria one is under construction and in an unappealing area. It is situated steps away from Buckingham Palace, but is quiet and away from the throngs of tourists. 

The Staff. Everyone was very lovely and helpful. The concierge was able to help with directions several times. The maid service was also great. The room was always made up when we returned in the afternoon for a break in our day.

Courtyard. It was lovely to look out our room and watch events going on.

A few negatives:
We asked for a renovated room with a nice courtyard view and were told we had to pay for it even though we had booked a superior room (which was an option when it was still Crowne Plaza). It was 25 pounds extra per day which was about 43 US dollars daily. It was worth it, but honestly, don't expect an automatic upgrade like a lot of the reviews seem to lead you to believe. I also overheard several other people asking for a nice room and were told it could only be done for a hefty fee. Also, the room was not ready until around 3pm. After an overnight flight, it was a rough day since we just walked around until then. I know they were doing their best, but just be aware, if you want a nice room and are checking in early, you WILL have to wait. Our room was on the 5th floor and was quite nice and large, however. We were pleased with it at the end.
Second, the shower had horrible pressure, which so many people had mentioned before. I rolled my eyes at that initially, but its so true, its bad. If you are used to a US shower, be prepared. There were two temperatures, cold and luke warm. Not deal breaking, but be aware.
Finally, the hallways are certainly old and do not match the decor of the lobby. It really should not affect your stay, though, as you don't hang out in the halls!

All in all, it was a good stay and a decent hotel in the heart of London.",4,2014,08,05
121,Good weekend away,"We had a weekend away in London
over all the the hotel was very good
We had dinner and afternoon tea at the hotel both of which I can recommend

The room we had though on the top floor  was very small and very tired. The bathroom was tiny.",3,2014,08,04
121,Lovely hotel in great position,"We enjoyed our 2 night stay at St James Court very much.
Beautiful building/courtyard.
We had a recently refurbished room -level 3 overlooking the courtyard .
The room was very good-2 large windows.The bathroom was spacious and classy.
Great location-obviously close to Buckingham Palace and close to St James Park tube station and Victoria.
The courtyard was lovely for a late evening drink on a nice evening.
Service was first class in all areas.
As with some of the other reviews I would say that the breakfasts weren't 5 star quality but they were good,also the breakfast area was a bit cramped-they might want to look at this in the future.
Overall excellent and we would thoroughly recommend the hotel",5,2014,08,04
121,Excellent value for money,"We stayed here for three nights at the end of July and paid £410.

On entering the hotel, the concierge greeted us and took our suitcase. We were directed to the reception for check in. The duty manager checked us in and upgraded us to an executive suite. Although we arrived at the hotel just after 12pm, our room was ready which was very convenient. We were asked about wake up calls and were asked whether we wanted a complimentary newspaper delivered each morning (The Independent).

Our room was spacious and well presented. There was complimentary coffee, tea, bottled water etc. There was also robes, slippers, hair dryer, iron and ironing board and basic toiletries. There was also a note in the bathroom stating that if you had forgotten toiletries, contact reception and they would provide these on a complimentary basis. There was even a volume switch controlling sound in the bathroom for the television. 

Our view was looking towards a wall, but as we were busy enjoying the city, this was not a concern. Our suitcase was brought to our room within minutes. We slept well and were not disturbed at all. The room was cleaned to a good standard daily.

Location was excellent. If you go left as you leave the hotel and walk five minutes, you are outside Buckingham Palace. It was 10 minutes to the heart of Westminster and Big Ben, Downing Street, London Eye etc. An additional 10 minutes from Buckingham Palace was Trafalgar Square. We had a taxi to Leicester Square cost £7. During the day we used the open top buses and there was a stop just to the side of Buckingham Palace. 

Check out was efficient as check in.

To summarise, an excellent standard of hotel, in a perfect location. We would definitely return.",5,2014,08,03
121,Night in town without the children,"Spent a Saturday night in this central hotel. Booked a classic king-size room and were upgraded on arrival free to a superior room. Not sure what made it superior, decor good but not large and overlooked aircon units and a roof! Used the bars in the evening before and after eating elsewhere. Not cheap but service and quality great. Breakfast was busy but excellent food, one of of the best I have had with a great choice.",4,2014,08,03
121,Courtyard perfect for afternoon tea,"Booked afternoon tea for a catch up with a couple of good friends after visiting the wedding dress exhibit at the V&A.  Lovely shady courtyard setting was the perfect respite from a hot day with the breeze occasionally blowing a cooling spray from the fountain.  Tea was laid up with crisp white tablecloths and napkins.  We shared a delicious bottle of prosecco before being presented with tall silver stands full of sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream, champagne jellies and 4 cakes.  My only gripe and it,s a small one, I would,ve liked a pastry, choux bun or meringue in place of one of the cakes as they were mostly a variety of sponge!  Lots of teas to choose from but mine was accompanied by good old builders.  It was busy and the staff were mainly attentive although we had to send the bill back.  They,d charged us the price of (27.50) rather than the deal we had booked (20.50), but soon sorted.  Very pleasant way to spend an afternoon - prosecco, gossip with good friends and cake - what more could you ask for!",4,2014,08,02
121,Great location,"This was the second time I'd stayed at the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. The reception area is nice but the rooms could do with updating.

It's a great location with Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Houses of Parliament only a few minutes walk away. ",4,2014,08,02
121,Great value,"If you have been to London before, this is a fabulous choice.  You can get to most sights like Trafallgar in abou 20-30 minutes walking. Lovely service.  Great courtyard.  Close to inexpensive breakfasts restaurants.  Hotel is costly and not good.
Belgravia fine restaurants like Santini very close.  Rooms a bit tired but good value.",4,2014,08,02
121,5* at 3* Prices,"We stayed here after a recommendation from friends and we were not dissapointed, the hotel is excellent along with the extremely pleasant staff. The location for any visitor is perfect only a few minutes walk to the St James tube station and only a 5 minute walk to the front of Buckingham Palace.
The price we paid for this hotel compared to other hotels we have stayed in of a similar standard was excellent, our room was very large and had everything you could require.
The hotel seems to be going through a large refurbishment project at present but this did not effect us in any way.
For thise of you who do not wish to pay the excessive charges for Breakfast which all hotels seem to charge there are Cafe/Restaurants open from the early hours immediately accross the road serving breakfast for £5.
Overall an excellent hotel.",5,2014,08,02
121,Nice neighbourhood,"We stayed five nights at St James Court. The neighbourhood was quiet and seemed safe. The location was good with Buckingham palace and tube stops a short walk away. There was also a Pret-a-manger near by which was great for a quick, cheap and healthy breakfast.

The hotel rooms were clean and a good size and the hotel concierges were helpful with giving directions etc.

The only negatives were you could here the tube which ran from around 6am-midnight and aside from the hotel restaurants there was no where within walking distance to get dinner apart from local pubs which I would not recommend. 

",4,2014,08,01
121,No comparison of Taj and specially those who travel from India no other thought.,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 days. It is located at such a central location that you get aquatinted within short time with surroundings. 

Rooms are very well done. Internal courtyard is such a fantastic place you can spend your time very comfortably. 

Overall entrance lobby is very small. Due to hotel occupancy it was always crowded and by chance the Indian cricket team was also staying during this period. ",5,2014,07,31
121,"Nice hotel, ok location","The St James Court is a very nice old fashioned hotel. The picture do trick you a bit (like in some cases do) it is smaller that it looks online (the common areas and the bedroom). Service is excellent and it's very quiet. The location is ok, depending on the purpose of your visit to London. During the day the neighbourhood is very busy but at night it's extremely quiet, not many restaurants or bars around.",4,2014,07,31
121,Comfortable hotel in a fantastic location,"I was unable to decide initially  how I felt about this particular hotel. We received a lovely welcome when we were checking in to hotel. Our room was clean and comfortable but in definite need of some work / renovation. We stayed in room 660. The bed, however, was very very comfortable and the room overlooked the gorgeous courtyard. We ate in bistro in hotel on the first night. It was very good...but a bit expensive overall. We didn't have breakfast. Cost again was again main reason (very expensive if you dont eat a large breakfast)...but there a number of very good cafes in the immediate area offering breakfast at a fraction of hotel price. Going somewhere different each morning was a fun experience too. This hotel was not the most relaxed or welcoming I have stayed in. I actually felt a little uncomfortable at times..perhaps a bit too 'stuffy' / formal compared to what I would normally go for. However staff were pleasant and location (practically beside buckingham palace) is excellent for the normal sightseeing tours. All in all I would choose hotel again for this reason.",4,2014,07,30
121,Perfect location,"Perfect location 3 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and the Mews 
20 minute walk to Big Ben and the London eye.  Staff friendly and very helpful 
Rooms quite large and well looked after
Also convenient to subways",4,2014,07,30
121,"Perfect Location, perfect hotel","This was a very nice hotel. The room was nice, not too big and not too small. Nice bathroom with perfect water pressure, a big deal to me! There was no view from our window but I wasn't in London to look out my hotel window.  The hotel is walking distance from the majority of things to see and do.  From Buckingham Palace just down the street to Big Ben and the London Eye we walked everywhere. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,07,29
121,Fautless,"The hotel is set in a magnificent Victorian/Edwardian cluster of buildings and equipped with staff that mirror a bygone age of service. The room we had may have been at the top of the shop but was large, comfortable, clean, well appointed and with air conditioning that worked (I have lost count of the rooms I have been in where it doesnt1).
The bar made magnificent cocktails so I am informed by my wife. If there was one deficiency it was that I booked a double room and got twin beds. A problem if you are planning a romantic break (which this hotel would be great for in terms of location and luxury) but for old fogies like ourselves less of an issue.",5,2014,07,29
121,Fabulous customer service,"Enjoyed a lovely 3 day break in London with my daughter staying at this hotel.,presented with a glass of ice water on arrival 
Superb location, walking distance to restaurants,bars, shops,underground station, buses, key attractions
The hotel is lovely, pretty plants and courtyard although rooms  & bathrooms a little dated. Very clean with great customer service",4,2014,07,29
121,Well located,"We booked a classic room, but at check in we got upgraded to an executive room. The room was very spacious and nicely decorated. The bathroom was spacious as well. 

Our room was above the entrance to the hotel on the street side. Although there isn't much traffic during the night, having the window open is not an option. However, the room has air-conditioning. Usually we don't like having the aircon on during the night, but in this case it was no problem. It kept the room at a nice temperature.

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and a bit different to what you would expect. If you wanted something different from the scrambled egg on the buffet, it had to be ordered. The range of things to order was good. Coffee and tea were poured at the table. The breakfast room is divided into different sections which is nice, although sometimes it could get quite hot.

The only unfortunate thing was that we left our adaptor plug behind. I contacted the hotel through their contact form on the St James' Court website twice, but never got a response. Taking into account the high service we experienced while staying we were disappointed not to get any response to our enquiry.

Other then that, you can't fault this hotel which is a 5 minute walk from St James' Park Tube station, a 10 minute walk from Buckingham Palace and has a good restaurant (Royal Quarter) for both breakfast and lunch opposite.",5,2014,07,29
121,4 night stay at St James Court  Buckingham Gate London,From the moment we entered the door the staff were friendly and professional. All staff could not do enough to ensure we had a great stay. Our room was large compared to other London hotels standards. the hotel is ideally situated 2 minutes from Buckingham palace and a walk through the park took us to the main shopping centre. It was also a short walk to the Thames and associated attractions. the hotel bar and restaurant was great and the hotel is also close to supermarkets and cafes such as pretamanager. A big advantage is being in easy walking distance to Green Park station and the Piccadiily Line which goes direct to Heathrow airport. I would stay here again and have already recommended St James to my friends who are travelling to London next year.,5,2014,07,28
121,A centrally located wonderful hotel,"Very conveniently located,just behind Buckingham palace. close to the tube, excellent service, restaurants inside and in the courtyard Bistro 51. Rooms very spacious and well decorated. Bathrooms well stocked with all that is necessary.",5,2014,07,28
121,A class act,"Everything about this hotel hit top marks in our view.
Booked direct and got a weekend deal which included breakfast.
Our room was ready when we arrived, booking in took a few minutes and the room itself was enormous , with the most comfortable king bed we have slept in . Breakfast was easily the best we have experienced , the staff were great and so switched on , service was faultless and the food was very good.
In fact , all the staff were exceptional and made our stay so enjoyable , a big thank you to everyone .
Next time we are in London , this will be our choice , the best hotel we have stayed in for many a year.",5,2014,07,28
121,Overview Of The Hotel,"My wife and I had a short visit to this hotel, there is no doubt the location of the hotel is excellent. But there are hidden charges that people need to be aware of. For example the breakfast, I paid for two breakfasts in advance, £56, this is too expensive! but the sting in the tail came on the first morning, I requested poached eggs of the menu! this was a fatal mistake, I was charged another£28 because I requested this. BE VERY SURE NOT TO DO THIS,the breakfast is not value for money. We had dinner the first night in the hotel, this was for two fish & chips, two deserts and one vodka single with lemonade and one Gin + Tonic single. This came to £72! the meal was good, the surroundings were good, but this was not value for money.
The AC in the room would not work correctly, and the switch arrangement needs sorting out, but apart from that it was clean + comfortable.",4,2014,07,28
121,Couldn't be better,"We usually stay in three start hotels, but when we got the deal on St. James' Court, we couldn't resist.  Everything about the hotel exceeded our hopes.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  The food (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) was fantastic! Every single person at the hotel went out of his or her way to be courteous, friendly, and helpful.  But the location was beyond our wildest dreams.  Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square, and public transportation.  In addition to the fact that I would stay there again, I would recommend this hotel to all my fellow travelers, even those on a budget.",5,2014,07,27
121,Possibly the best hotel in central London.,"The St James Court hotel is one of the best large hotels in London. Possibly the best. It has everything you would normally expect, but it's the stunning courtyard that does it for me. Wonderful hotel, brilliant and helpful staff. Practically next door to Buckingham Palace and a short walk from Victoria. I would stay here every time I was in London if I could.",4,2014,07,27
121,Return visit,"We first visited in February of this year and have recently (12th July) visited, and what another wonderful experience.  The location of the hotel is ideal for all the tourist sites and we had the added bonus of seeing the Tour de Franc finish on the Mall.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff - from reception on checking in and the pleasant smiling faces of the staff at breakfast!!
We love the atmosphere of the Hamptons and again the staff are so friendly but professional at the same time.  We will be back !!",5,2014,07,27
121,"Great downstairs, less so upstairs!","Recent stay at Taj was very disappointing.  Reception area is very ornate, but that's where it ends.  Checked in at 4pm and no room ready! Had to wait at reception for around 20 mins and was told room would be upgraded. If the room was upgraded then the standard rooms must be very poor. 
My room was over the underground so every few minutes the noise from the trains was tremendous going on long into the evening.   There were holes in the net curtain and the main curtain didn't close so it was daylight in the room at 5am! 
Classic case of lovely reception and a tired upstairs!  Unlikely to stay there again, very expensive and definitely not worth it.",2,2014,07,26
121,Honeymoon Magic,We chose this hotel as our honeymoon destination. When the taxi pulled up we were overawed at the sheer beauty of the hotel. It was fantastic. The second we entered the hotel we were treated like royalty. The staff were friendly and efficient. The room was very clean and classically decorated. It was ideally located near Buckingham Palace and the city center. We walked past the palace and up through Green Park and into Leicester Square every evening of our stay. It was magical. The pianist in the bar in the evenings was a joy to listen to. My wife enjoyed the gym while I went for a cycle through the park in the evenings as there is a bike hire facility right outside the hotel. I can't reccommend this hotel highly enough. It was a 5 STAR experience.,5,2014,07,26
121,"“Good value for money, but I wouldn't use it for special occasion”","The reason we booked a room at the Taj St James' Court was because I had to attend a very early meeting in a location which is very close to the hotel. The hotel rate for London was reasonable. We only paid around £139 for the room, and for that price the room was not bad. Yes, it is dated like some other people on this website have mentioned. However, the room was clean and everything in the room worked fine. We had no problem with the room itself. With regard to the service, we experienced between good and slightly poor service. Here are some of our experiences:
-The chambermaid walked in to the room without knocking the door. I think she was unaware that we had already checked in. It seemed that she was not advised by her manager that we already checked in and she just came in to put towels and some other stuffs. It was not a big deal but at least she could have knocked on the door. 
-Light lunch at the Courtyard was good and it was a nice courtyard. Service was good too. 
-Dinner at the Bistro was excellent. Compliment to the chef. I had the Indian lamb (I think the name was ""rogan josh""). It was delicious. The service at the Bistro was excellent too. It was quite busy when we were there and we were happy sitting in the corner far away from all other guests. Even though our table was far away from other guests, waiters and waitresses did not forget us. They were really attentive and we left the Bistro happy. 
-We also had after-dinner drinks in the Lobby Bar and Lounge. The service was poor here. We waited for more than half an hour to be served. Eventually, my partner walked to the bar and asked someone to deliver drinks (he did it twice as nobody seems to be interested in taking drink order or serving us). The live music was lovely, but the ambiance in the lobby bar and lounge was not enhanced by a good service. Also that night, there was a big group in the lobby lounge who kept taking pictures (so annoying) and some people were eating pizza straight from the pizza hut box without plates, knives and forks. They made a mess in the lobby lounge. If they wanted to eat pizza from pizza hut, could they at least eat it discreetly in their rooms? I think it was such disrespect to the hotel, especially when the hotel like The Taj St James' has some good restaurants. The hotel has good potential, but would I go back? Maybe, if I just need a clean room and a place to sleep, but I would not choose it to celebrate special occasion or if I want a great ambiance.",3,2014,07,24
121,"Great hotel, excellent staff","Recently stayed at the Taj Hotel and was very pleased.  The location is great, great walking proximity to Buckingham palace or a quick cab to the London Eye.  Excellent staff, who made you feel really welcomed.  

Clean, good size rooms and would probably return unless I needed to on the other side of the city.",4,2014,07,23
121,Excellent Hotel in London,"This hotel is an excellent choice when staying in London.  It is located a block or two from Buckingham Palace and a 5 minute stroll to St James Underground stop.  The hotel has an older wing and a newer wing that has recently been refurbished and is very nice.  I would definitely ask for a room in the newly refurbished wing.  In the older wing, the air-conditioning blows right on your head when you are in bed but not in the newer wing.  The hotel has a very fine restaurant with good service and excellent food.  All the people throughout the hotel seem to genuinely like serving you.  Prices for hotels in London are very high, and I think this hotel represents a nice bargain.You won't be sorry that you picked this choice.",5,2014,07,23
121,Good Staff and great service.,"We had booked for two night stay in a family executive suite for two adults and two children.
The receptionist at the time of checkin was very helpful and also provided some coloring kit for our two children.
The room was very spacious and it had a separate living area with a separate TV and bathroom's were clean and newly done up.
In our package a special Taj afternoon tea was included 
which was served in the courtyard between the two properties of 51 and 54 Taj.
We availed the tea, and found it to be a special experience, with lots of things to eat , served free with the tea. The courtyard itself is a very relaxing place to sit 
and enjoy a cup of tea or breakfast , snacks or maybe just a glass of wine.
The breakfast was part  of the package and it was very 
elaborate and also had a bit of Indian food served. 
The hotel is within walking distance from the Buckingham 
palace and also from the Big Ben and the Thames river embankment . 
The prices of the rooms are a bit steep but I think they still 
Worth it.",5,2014,07,23
121,Gorgeous hotel in very central location,"My boyfriend and I spent two nights in this beautiful hotel in July. We were surprised and delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a room with a Courtyard view, which was very nice. The room itself was big, and although the bathroom was small, it served its purpose well (and the shower was great). The bed was huge and very comfortable. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of options to eat within a 2 minute walk of the hotel (we favoured a Pret just around the corner). The hotel is so close to Buckingham Palace that you could say you were staying next door to the Queen, and we did not use public transport the entire time we were there because we were so close to everything. The staff are lovely and I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,23
121,Great location yet out quiet with fantastic staff.,We booked a total of 5 rooms and we were all very happy with the hotel.  Firstly the hotel itself is lovely and charming.  Clean and renovated with beautiful bathrooms.  We even had towel warmers in our bathrooms.  But its the people that make it special.  Everyone we met bent over back wards to try and get us everything we needed.  One of our suitcases broke and the concierge ran around to find us duct tape.  When the breakfast dinning area was full they opened a new space for us to eat in and made sure we had everything we needed.  A great hotel close to Buckingham Palace.,5,2014,07,22
121,Luxurious,"We stayed at the Taj as part of a weekend city break. The concierge was very accommodating, and reception looked after us as well. The location is great and the courtyard is fantastic.
The room was comfortable and well appointed.
My only gripe is the £20 charge to use the TV system - at the rates charged here I was surprised this was not complimentary.",5,2014,07,21
121,"Excellent staff, great location, bedrooms of varied standard","I booked a classic king bed room . The hotel's website give the description of Classic Rooms  as having  ""a quintessential English character overlooking Westminster or the St. James’ Courtyard, the luxurious King Rooms are a spacious 35 sq mtrs. My room neither overlooked Westminster or the courtyard but some side alley and it was smaller than the descriptive size. Quintessential English it was not, I would describe it as dated  and in need of TLC It was obvious walking down the shabby corridor that these rooms were of a lower quality than the rest of the hotel. I was assigned  Room 164 which  is over the top of the district line underground, so that every 5 minutes or so  you could hear the trains, and the vibration through the furniture was enough to rattle glasses on the table. .I complained politely about the room and the hotel staff were very helpful and offered to move me to a room on the 7th floor at the same tariff. However, this room could not be accessed so I paid an extra £25 and got an executive room. The difference was dramatic. Nicely furnished and large bathroom, larger bedroom and very quiet. The staff are good but I would not describe the hotel as luxurious especially if you book a classic room. The location is great though.",3,2014,07,20
121,Not too shabby,"I'm being facetious - the hotel is very nice, indeed.  We had a large, deluxe King room.  However, don't stay on floors 6 and 7 - the ceilings slope.  The shower/tub combo was very cramped.  Housekeeping needs to have everything spelled out for them, like when we needed extra tissues and kept leaving notes until finally we did get an extra box.  Some day used cups were replaced, some days they were not.  But: breakfast (which was included) was sufficient and made to order, the fountain plaza in the courtyard is one of the best spots in this part of London, with good food and polished service, and the Bank restaurant on the premises is wonderful.  We did not dine there this time, but also on the premises (or at least right next door) is Quilon, a Michelin-starred Indian restaurant.  Can't wait to come back.",4,2014,07,20
121,loved it,lovely hotel with a great vibe. the Bisro  hamptons bar and the courtyard are all excellent. large rooms courteous staff. we had booked two rooms but the downside is we could hear the metro from one of them .,5,2014,07,19
121,Wow - nice hotel,"We thought we were at the wrong hotel -- with a doorman and a fantastic lobby, we questioned our online booking rate.

Our first room was fantastic; clean, luxurious, nicely furnished.

Staff were very helpful in understanding that we had misbooked and needed two beds.  They were able to move us to a different room -- smoking and that worked well for us.  The new room was just as nice with thermostat that adjusted below 19...quite a difference from other hotels.  Fully accessorized with iron, ironing board, shower robes, coffee/tea service, etc.  Plenty of electrical plugs, so that was helpful.

The room was clean, large, modern.  Great!

St. James underground was just a short walk away; Westminster Abbey was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.  

Great room at our booking price of 130 pounds (plus a 35 pound room upgrade charge for the twin-bedded room.)",5,2014,07,19
121,Good location but dated rooms,"I booked this very late and got an excellent price. As explained in other reviews, the rooms are undergoing refurbishment and I believe the 'classic rooms' are the ones which haven't yet been done. I stayed in a classic room on the first floor. Everything was very clean but very tired and dated, particularly the labyrinthian corridors. Very cosy bed. The free wi-fi is next to useless. Two electrical sockets in the room didn't work. It also has the very frustrating television system still used in some hotels where you have to navigate endless menus (trying to get you to pay for films and porn) just to watch TV (a choice of 5 channels). Not a big thing but annoying after a long day. The staff were very friendly. The ground floor communal areas as indeed luxurious and I imagine the rooms on higher floors are superb.",3,2014,07,19
121,"Good Location, Nice sized rooms, Carpets need cleaning","I would actually rate this hotel 3.5 not 4, but that is not an option, so I will error up. 

The pluses-location, location ,location. Walking distance to most major attractions in Westminster.  We had an executive king room that was huge by London standards, L-shaped with a king bed, 2 chairs, large sofa, writing desk, lots of storage, overlooking the courtyard. Very comfortable bed! 

I'm assuming we had a remodeled room, as the bed and furnishings all were in excellent condition- but not the carpet? Our room had lots of carpet stains and that just grosses me out. It  was a nice room,  except for that.

A few other minor negatives- you could always hear the underground trains, but that  did not bother us much and the very long hallways could use some sprucing up. 

We paid about $300 per night, which included a full breakfast and wireless, which for this size of room and location is fair.",4,2014,07,19
121,Luxury feelings,"We've booked this hotel last-minute at promotion price. 
We were happily surprised when we stepped in a very luxury environment.  
The staff is very friendly and the hotel is breathing a really nice atmosphere. 
We received a nice large room (25m2) which was very clean and cosy.
The bed really invites you to have sweet dreams. 
I 've eaten English breakfast every day which was very tasteful.
The tube is very nearby. In the neighbourhood of Victoria Station you find a few nice restaurants and shops. 
We've really had a nice stay!",5,2014,07,17
121,Just lovely,"We had a wonderful two days at the St. James, beautiful, sparkling clean room.   Fantastic customer service, food was very, very good and drinks done properly.  The garden courtyard is a marvel with a frieze of Shakespearean figures going around the top of the buildings walls all the way around.  Lovely fountain with seating around to have a meal or a drink.  Just loved it, concierge was fabulous and you are a couple blocks from Buckingham Palace.  I would highly recommend the St. James Court for a delightful stay when in London.",5,2014,07,16
121,Great location,I booked two rooms both of which were good although a bit dated. The location is brilliant. A short distance from Buckingham Palace and Victoria station; also convenient taxi ride to most tourist hotspots. Breakfast was sufficient. Courtyard bar area very nice on a pleasant evening. Concierge service was excellent and front counter staff very accommodating. ,4,2014,07,16
121,Fab hotel in great location,"We received a friendly welcome at this hotel by all staff, from the doorman and concierge to the very helpful reception staff. We arrived very early so did not expect to check in but our bags were taken care of and when we returned they had been placed in our room, which was lovely and overlooked the relaxing court yard area. After a very busy day in London and late lunch, we opted to stay in the hotel's cocktail/piano bar, especially when we saw the pianist. We spent a very lovely relaxing evening listening to music and enjoying our drinks, served by friendly helpful staff. Although we did not experience all that the hotel had to offer it is definitely worth another visit to explore some more. I would definitely stay here again and based on our room and experience, as well as the reasonable rate on-line, we would recommend to others.",5,2014,07,16
121,"Location,location maybe but not quite all it seems.","This Hotel has the name, the location, and the feel of a Hotel trying to be a 5 Star but not quite making it. Beware of ground floor rooms which are very tired, as are the corridors. If you were parachuted in, you would think it was just another anonymous London Hotel. The staff are pleasant and there is an understated ambience here, but I spent the night in a room which felt the vibrations of every passing underground train. Insist on level as 1 as a minimum and make sure you have a newly refurbished room. Otherwise this Hotel will fit the bill for a short break in a perfect position. ",4,2014,07,16
121,Make sure you get a renovated room,"We stayed at the St James Court for one night.

First impressions of the hotel were good: the entrance and lobby are both plush and welcoming.

However, the ‘classic’ room we were allocated bore little resemblance to the photos from the website which we had used to book.

Prospective guests should note that the hotel's own website (like the websites of the various hotel booking companies) shows pictures of rooms that have recently been renovated. However, the hotel clearly still has many un-renovated rooms, which appear tired.

Food was variable. We ordered steak from the room service menu. It was not medium-rare as requested but almost blue, probably having been cooked for only a matter of seconds on each side (neither was the fat rendered). The rest of the meal was presented well. Breakfast was perfectly acceptable.

The hotel’s location is excellent – situated in a nice area only a couple of minutes’ walk from Buckingham Palace.

We would recommend staying in the hotel only if you will be in a renovated room.",3,2014,07,14
121,Very nice hotel.,"The reception, public rooms and courtyard are simply beautiful. The liveried doorman and helpful concierge add to the ambience and it is well situated for the tube at St James. Our room was spacious and very clean and the reception staff were first class. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant and superb cocktails. The breakfast was slightly marred by the member of staff in charge but on the whole it was a pleasant visit and I wouldn't hesitate to book again.",5,2014,07,14
121,"Great hotel, great location","We spent 8 nights at St James Court, a Taj Hotel in June 2014.  The location was great, central to many tourist sites, pubs and restaurants.  If you like running was close to parks.  Hotel was excellent, delicious buffet breakfast, rooms clean, staff friendly.  Gas a good gym area with sauna.  We enjoyed our stay very much!",5,2014,07,13
121,Terrific hotel in Central London,"Stayed for a single night in July when attending a concert in Hyde Park. To be honest, we don't normally stop in hotels of this class in London due to their extreme high cost, but this was a last minute booking and the rate of £119, including breakfast was simply too good to be true. The hotel oozes class and sophistication. Check in was quick, all staff encountered were pleasant and helpful, the food was excellent and the room was terrific. Spotlessly clean and comfortable with a lovely bathroom and quality toiletries. The hotel was very quiet, and is ideally situated a short walk from both Victoria and St. James Park tube stations. The TAJ is easily the best hotel we've stayed at in London and we wouldn't hesitate to use it again.",5,2014,07,12
121,"Perfect location,comfortable rooms, good ambience!","Located at Buckingham Gate, close to 2 tube stations, one of the pickup points for day tours, this hotel is a good choice when staying in London beyond 3 nights. Its away from the high footfall areas of Picadilly yet close enough. The area is near the Palace so they have a good international vibe in and around the hotel. Rooms are comfortable and cosy & well-set out. The concierge service was excellent, especially Fred who helped us arrange our tours and transfers. He was efficient, professional and had finesse. The hotel went the extra mile to arrange a customised birthday cake for my husband. The cake was beautiful, delivered on time & extremely tasty. It really make the birthday special. Restaurant wise, I was not impressed by any meals. Neither cafe or Quilon, the Michelin Star restaurant is worth recommending. But I will definately return to stay again at the hotel.",5,2014,07,11
121,Perfect location!,"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in June.  It was her first time visiting London.  It could not have been a more perfect location and vibe for our stay.  We arrived at 9am from an overnight flight; we asked to get into our room early as we felt a nap would help give us a bit of energy.  No problem.  We had a bite of breakfast and then our very nice room was ready.  The angel at the desk knew we were exhausted.    I cannot say enough about how great the location is to almost everything that we wanted to do and see.  Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, to name a few.  Victoria Station was about a 12 minute walk, and we were able to walk back to the hotel after seeing Wicked at 11pm and did not feel unsafe.   The staff was very accommodating and helpful when needed.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,10
121,staying this time,"Work in Westminster so have eaten here several times and made use of the v excellent Bank bar..looking fwd to stay tomorrow. Hopefully room will be a newly refurbished one.booked through LateRooms today.

121,Can't wait to return,"Stayed at the St. James' Court for several days in May, 2014.  I have never before been moved to write a review, but I had to compliment this hotel.  The hotel itself is lovely and well-appointed.  Our room was comfortable and very quiet.  The restaurant was excellent. Location was convenient, near a tube station.  But over and above everything else, the staff was exceptional.  Everyone from the concierge to the housekeeping staff were friendly, helpful and sincerely dedicated to making our stay pleasant.  We Loved It!",5,2014,07,10
121,Stately hotel,"From the moment we arrived we found that the staff were magnificent, nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel at home. Assistance with onward travel (flight check in) was made easy by the concierge and we can recommend our stay in the hotel as one of our best.",5,2014,07,09
121,Excellent Luxurious Hotel,"We stay at The Taj Suites for 2 nights. 
The staff are extremely friendly.
The suites are fully equipped for all your needs. They are designed to a very high standard. 
The kitchen and bathroom are very well stocked. The TV in the bathroom is a very nice touch.
The bed is a delight.
To all the Taj staff well done!! ",5,2014,07,09
121,Faultless,"Faultless in every way, astounding location, and felt we were treated like royalty on our one night stay 30/06/014. Hotel was happy to store our luggage when we checked in early, and it was ready in our room when we arrived later..nice touch.",5,2014,07,09
121,"Great Hotel ,amazing location","We stayed at St James from the 25 the to the 27 th of June.
The Hotel is very well placed with a quick walk to Buckingham Palace and very close to the Tube.
When we arrived reception was busy , however we were quickly taken to a managers desk where we were signed straight in.
The room on the 7 th floor was newly renovated and a great space.
We found the staff very helpful especially the team at the Concierge desk.

Thank you for a very pleasant stay.",5,2014,07,09
121,Absolutely perfect in every way!!!,"We stayed from 6th to 8th July, came to London to watch Le Tour. The hotel was absolutely perfect, we received a free room upgrade and a complimentary birthday cake delivered to the room. The staff were amazing and really couldn't have been more helpful. The room was lovely, spacious and clean.
We will definitely return again.",5,2014,07,08
121,Nice visit,"Checked in with my child for one night so we could be in close proximity to the main attractions. Pleased with location, accommodation and attentive service of the hotel. Monica took great care of us during check-in and even had a kids pack of goodies on hand. Retired to our room for the night and a surprise tray included a hot chocolate and personalize cookie. Nice touch - brought a smile to my child. :) Buffet breakfast selection was great and staff were always checking to see if we were taken care of. View overlooking the courtyard from our room and was quiet. Bathroom a little small and a few minor chips in the porcelain. Beds were split into twins and had to move one to access the closet. You can't go wrong at all with 2 min walk to St James Park tube station which is the closest and Starbucks immediately opposite entrance. Pret-a-Manger, Greggs plus countless cafes nearby for grabbing 'picnic at the park' supplies. There is also a small shop on the corner, enroute to the Palace to stop and get your backpack beverages for the day. Would return to St James Court again.",4,2014,07,07
121,Fabulous weekend at St. James' court,"we stayed at St. James' Court Hotel 04/07/14 - 06/07/14. everything about this hotel was first class. from the moment we arrived and were received as old freinds, even though this was our fiirst visit, to when we had a late check out. the room was excellent, clean, fresh and well accomadated. even though there was a large wedding on Saturday afternoon and evening the layout of the hotel meant that guests were not disturbed and in fact even after midnight there was no noise from the wedding party's dancing etc. we used the hotels outside bar and also the Hampton bar and the Bistro, the food and service in the Bistro was very, very good and the equal of any accoladed restaurant in London. i was especially pleased with this as i usually do not eat in hotel restaurants with so many on offer very close by.  i have stayed in a number of Taj Hotels in India, the standard is extremely high and the St. James' court is their equal.
i would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for quality and service, most people believe such things are in the past, not at the St. James's Court Hotel, it is their normal standard. 
Barry Perks, Cheltenham UK",5,2014,07,07
121,GREAT STAY,"This centrally located hotel deserves all the attention of travellers; not only it's a luxury hotel but all the premises are gorgeous; our room was almost a suite and small attentions are waiting for the guests; the restaurant we tried was great too (Bistro 51), also a good option is delicious indian food; an afternoon tea was perfect in the garden, we really enjoyed our stay and would come back soon !",5,2014,07,07
121,Very Good but pricey,"Just stayed here for a four night break with work and have no concerns in recommending this hotel for a London Break.
The Location is fantastic, 150yrds away from Victoria station, 250yrds away from Buckingham Palace, 100yrd away from Westminster cathedral and 10mins walk from Westminster abbey and House of parliament so its ideal for tourists.

Bonus
Very good efficient and friendly staff, Great during the breakfast period (special thank you to Monika?) for a very good service each morning
Clean and spotless hotel

Negatives
The hotel is classed as a luxury hotel therefore not cheap to stay in ....doesn't need to be that costly.
The rooms are a bit tired and are in need for refurbishment.

I had a bit of an issue during the early hours in which the hotel managed well.

Yes I would stay there again if the price is right.",4,2014,07,06
121,Great hotel,Great hotel central location great service very happy. Close to all main tourist attractions. Close to good restaurants. Front desk staff very helpful and friendly. Would stay here again for sure. Rooms very clean and we'll serviced.,5,2014,07,05
121,Wonderful !,"My husband and I took our young grandson on his 1st trip to London, staying at St. James' Court for 7 nights in late June.  Although we have traveled from the USA to London many times, we tried this hotel because of my sister's recommendation.  She was right, it was a perfect week's experience for the 3 of us !  We stayed in a quiet Executive Family Room on the 4th floor which had a large seating/living area and a bedroom area which had 2 very comfortable Queen beds. The location, ambience, reception and service were really excellent. There are very easy transportation options with the St. James Underground station 5 minutes away, and easy walking to Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. The buffet breakfast every day and dinner at Bistro 51 were great, as was the Bank restaurant overlooking the gorgeous courtyard. A highlight of our trip was the special Wimbledon High Tea served in the Hampton Lounge. Our grandson loved it, especially the tennis-themed pastries. ( The hotel was wonderful to him, giving him a Taj soft backpack which he used every day.)  He had an ""awesome"" trip and we were able to experience all that London has to offer. All in all, I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone.  Having stayed at the Taj in Mumbai and the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, I just knew it would be wonderful  and it was !",5,2014,07,05
121,Superb hotel but The Bistro let it down!,"The hotel and staff were fantastic, delighted when we received a complementary upgrade. However The Bistro let it down, no one hosting on a Thursday night so we stood around waiting a lot. The menu wasn't exciting and the food a little bland. Would definitely stay again but perhaps dine out",4,2014,07,05
121,Taste of British Luxury at a Superb location,"St. James Court Hotel is located at a very convenient location with walking distance to Buckingham palace and is about a mile from London eye. It is a fine hotel as one can expect from Taj group. The staff is very helpful and stay is comfortable. As the building is old the rooms and corridors are small. The restaurants in the property are also very nice. Though I found the morning breakfast buffet limited in choice (as compared to other Taj properties). 
But the overall experience was excellent.",4,2014,07,04
121,Top classy hotel,"The greeting and the entrance, check in smooth and courteous, rooms are big for the location that the hotel is located, modern well furnished and has all the present day needs, well appointed bath rooms. The central court yard is a pleasure to sit out for afternoon tea and snacks or a cocktails in the evenings. The break fast is well laid out and has most what one would want for a wholesome offerings. I would surely recommend this premium property for the traveller looking for a pleasurable stay in London.",5,2014,07,04
121,First Trip to London,"We really enjoyed our first trip to London thanks greatly to the accommodation at St.James Court. We were upgraded on arrival and the lady at reception was very friendly. We had room service on four nights we were there due to the fact we were on the go the whole time and the food was so good, we had to try more. The service for breakfast each morning was also excellent.The hotel was also walking distance to everything you needed to see in London on a first trip. The only issue we found whatsoever was the fact that we could hear people talking in the adjoining room, and you could also hear people walking along the corridor. We would definitely go back again though.",5,2014,07,03
121,Nice hotel in a great location,"Stayed at the Taj St James Court for 4 nights.  Hotel is in a stately building with a pretty courtyard and lobby.  We booked when the hotel was still the Crowne Plaza St James.  No problems with the new chain honoring the reservation which was nice.  The rooms were decent with some features nicely renovated but some touches still seem dated.  We had problems with the tub draining very slowly and the tv not working, but the hotel fixed those issues pretty quickly.  The location is fantastic, about two blocks from Buckingham Palace and a block from the St James Park tube station.  Victoria station is also a short walk away.  Hopefully as the Taj finishes the transition, they'll update any remaining features that still need it.",4,2014,07,03
121,A fantastic Central London Hotel,"Firstly, I was going to rate this 4 out of 5 not 5 because we were allocated a room with another guests suitcase & clothes still in the wardrobe. However, after a call to reception the duty manager quickly appeared with another room key. That was quickly followed by a complimentary plate of apples and a sincere apology!
Anyway, we stayed in a basic double on the fourth floor which was very well appointed, very clean and modern. Very comfortable bed, good shower and large sink plus a decent sized TV and closet space. 
The staff were all excellent, simply excellent in every department.
Good location on Buckingham Gate very near to the a Palace, Westminster Square and the London Eye etc.
I can highly recommend this hotel but try to avoid (our first) room 212...very small and the worst view you could imagine!!",5,2014,07,01
121,Good and Bad,"There was good and bad here - Staff were very friendly and although the room  was tiny it was clean however it  just made a double but really large single. Looked straight into a wall and school playground. Hot water in bathroom far too hot, actually scalding hot reported this and was told previous customer asked for it to be hot. But no offer to turn it down only add cold. It was lucky there was no children in the room as I have grave concerns for safety. Room was very shabby and marks on walls and carpet very old. Mini bar was very empty but locked so not sure why this was the case as only had a few things in it. The noise from the playground was loud and ok if you wanted to get up early but if you are on a lea sure break then not much good. Maybe we were just unlucky however you got the feeling the hotel entrance and foyer were outstanding but the rooms were poor.",3,2014,07,01
121,Indian hospitality in London .,"Taj never let's you down . Weather it's service or food or quality you get it all at the St James court. We were booked for two nights in June and with two kids we had a family suite. 
The beds were two queen size and had a separate living room attached . 
The kids loved the goodies they were handed out at the checkin. And also the complimentary hot chocolate and cookies with their names on it , which was sent to the room in the evening . 
We ordered room service twice which was prompt and a good selection of Indian as well as international food .
The best part of the hotel besides the excellent service is the courtyard , where you can chill and have a drink or enjoy their scrumptious high teas . 
The hotel is walking distance to the Buckingham palace and the St James park. Also close by is the Westminster area and several attractions . 
We loved our stay there and would definitely return .",5,2014,07,01
121,"Beautiful hotel, only matched by it's service...","This is a beautiful, grand hotel, matched only by it's outstanding service.  I traveled alone to London for the weekend, and felt safe and well cared for, at every turn.  Breakfast is great (was included in my fare). Breakfast room experienced ""rush hour"" on Sunday morning.  A young gentleman came through the lobby offering fresh orange juice for those of us waiting for a table.  This is the kind of service to expect.  Only note-your room may or may not have an outlet near a mirror, so perhaps a hand-held mirror in your suitcase would be helpful.  
Location is so good.  Came on business, returning in October for pleasure. Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!",5,2014,07,01
121,A Somewhat mixed experience,"The St James Court Hotel used to be a lower end hotel and was taken over and is being renovated by Taj Hotels.  It did not live up to the experience I have had at other Taj Hotels.  My room was tiny as was my bathroom.  It had very old stained carpet and a small bathroom with a bad toilet seat.  It was on a floor that had not been renovated.  There was  daytime noise from the street and from construction.  That being said, I was comfortable enough and the amenities - the  very good restaurants and Spa and  the helpful concierges bode well for the future of this hotel when the rooms are updated.",4,2014,06,30
121,In need of refurbish,"The hotel is beautiful, in perfect location and  the staff are very accommodating, however our room on the first floor was in sore need of refurbishing, the decor was very tired and carpets stains and poor plumbing was not expected features. On a plus side it was comfortable and clean, but shabby. Also the breakfast at the weekend struggled to accommodate the numbers so try to arrive early As thepopulate 9-10 in the morning saw queues. However once in the food was excellent.",3,2014,06,30
121,A great hotel to be spoilt in,"We stayed for 2 nights in this wonderful hotel...The quiet location was brilliant! Where else could you walk safely in a few minutes walk to London's main attractions. Staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful . The personal touch by management of the hotel to make sure our stay was perfect really was evident  throughout our stay..
After 3 full days shopping we just could not wait to relax in the hotel. The Hampton area was great  for drinks ...the mid week piano player  whose  choice of music was fantastic was  a very pleasant surprise . The 2nd longest bar in London in the hotel added yet another change in our too short of stay. The quilon restaurant in  the hotel has great food and service....the vegetarian selection and quality of food is the best I have tested in the UK....when I return to London again this will be our hotel of choice",5,2014,06,30
121,Best Hotel I have stayed in..,"We booked this hotel as it was at the centre of London and close to a lot of restaurants and sites, as well as Buckingham Palace, that was only a Five min walk away, the London Eye was only 15 min walk, we booked it as a special weekend for our Daughter as she was 21, the Hotel even put a Special Birthday cake in each of our room, this I thought was a very nice thought, this Hotel was the best I have ever stayed in, I have stayed in many around the globe, and this is at the top of my list, could not recommend this any higher, also a wonderful court yard, the service was first class, and always looked after you.",5,2014,06,30
121,St James Court - Hotel,"If you want a luxurious experience & friendly, polite staff to make your stay so delightful, then look no further than the Taj @ St James Court.  I stayed with my wife for her 40th and would recommend this hotel to anyone.  A hotel in the heart of the city with your expectations totally at their desire.  Friendly, Beautiful and extremely well priced, A little gem",5,2014,06,30
121,A Grand Dame that needs a little updating,"First of all, the location of this hotel cannot be beat. It's tucked away down a quiet street but close to everything. Five minute walk gets you to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, the River Thames, Westminster Abbey a beautiful park and many other attractions. You enter into a gorgeous grand lobby and are greeted very warmly by professional well groomed staff. It instantly feels 5 star. Our room wasn't quite ready at 1pm but our bags were stowed with a promise to phone us when our room was ready. We never did get a call, but when we checked back at about 3 pm our room was ready. Unfortunately the lift that went to the 8th floor was broken , so we had to take the stairs from the 6th floor up. No big trouble for us, but for the poor porter, yikes!!! We were taken to room 879. I have to say that I was far from impressed ,given the beauty of the lobby, I felt like I was in a different hotel entirely. While the room was clean and more than spacious , it was very worn and tattered. Plaster chipped from corners and very worn carpet with an ""old musty"" smell. I did ask for a quiet room on a high floor....and that it was. Extremely quiet, didn't here a single house our entire stay, and that was wonderful. But honestly, I felt like maybe we were tucked away in the oldest section of this expansive hotel ? 
That said, I bathroom was spacious and very nice with marble counter and good shower. Nice toiletries and ample linens . Housekeeping was not good, left dirty coffee mugs on night stands and dirty utensils next to coffee supplies. 
They do leave plenty of coffee, tea, sweeteners and nice biscuits as well as complimentary bottled water. This was very nice to have in room. 
****** Here's what was most outstanding. They sent up a beautiful little chocolate cake for my sons 16th birthday. What a lovely thoughtful gesture!!!!! This is the type of thing that really elevates a hotel. 
Over all....the shared areas of the hotel and the AMAZINGLY beautiful courtyard",4,2014,06,29
121,Oasis of calm in the centre of London,"Our party had 3 rooms for 2 nights and what a wonderful stay we had. We were delighted with the elegance of the rooms and little extras like dressing gowns and slippers and range of toiletries in the opulent bathroom. There were tea/coffee making facilities and bottled water. 
We appreciated the central courtyard garden where we enjoyed refreshments in the sunshine in this quiet haven - a real bonus.
All the staff, from reception at check in, waiting staff, to those at the concierge desk, were most helpful and professional and made us not only welcome but we felt really spoilt and it made our stay a real pleasure. Well done to all.
We were attending an Investiture at Buckingham Palace so chose this hotel as it was just a short taxi ride away and very convenient for sightseeing as it was a short stroll from St. James underground station. Also, there were a number of cafes and pubs nearby so overall a great location.",5,2014,06,29
121,Business and Pleasure Combined,"Had a fantastic 2 night stay in the hotel. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was excellent and on eating in the bistro the second night we found wonderful food at a great price - cheaper than the places next door and a better quality.

Room was spacious and bed very comfortable.

Will stay again.",5,2014,06,29
121,"Classic room, excellent services, and nice Bistro","My mum and I stayed in St. James Court for five nights in June. Our room was a Classic King on level 4 with a slight view of the courtyard. I love the classic English architecture of the hotel. The design of the lobby is very appealing - a good mixture of classic, modern and chic. The room itself is very specious; the size of the bathroom is almost the size of a small hotel room in Paris. Furniture is classic red wood - love it

Strongly recommend Bistro 51, the food was awesome and we spent 4/5 nights having dinner there.",5,2014,06,28
121,Great location and service,"Great stay for 3 days before boarding a 10 day Celebrity cruise through the British Isles.  We are a family of 8, ages 7-84.  What a Wonderful start at the St James Taj in London, we enjoyed everything at the hotel while experiencing London and adapting to the time change from Florida.
The entire trip was Fantastic!!  I don't know how but we brought warm sunny weather the 14 day trip to England, Guernsey, Ireland, Scotland and Wales!!  We made Forever Memories together!!!",5,2014,06,27
121,a nice touch for a night in the city,"Found a real bargain for this hotel so booked a Sunday night stay when we went to a comedy club, Arrived just before check in time, but room was ready so went straight up, very proffessional desk staff, room was a standard room, large enough for two people, but on the back of the building (no nice view, building site next door) but as I said a greatly reduced room rate, so I was never going to get a top room, We don't sit in rooms anyway, we went straight down to the courtyard bistro.

Again top service, nice bottle of wine (not over priced) and a lovely snack sitting in the sun, we sampled the inside bar on our return around 11.30 for a quick night cap, again good service, but america were playing in the world cup, and another guest asked to have the game on, in the nice quiet room next to the one we were sitting in, which then wasn't so quiet .

We didn't check out until 11.30 the next day, didn't try breakfast, express check out is available.

all in all a very nice stay, would definatly return if I could find a deal on this hotel",5,2014,06,26
121,Average room,Stayed at this hotel and would advise against staying in room 165. Whilst the room was pleasant enough the noise from the underground every 2 minutes was deafening. I know london is noisy but that is ridiculous. Everytime a train went by bottles in the room shook. Thankfully only there one night,3,2014,06,26
121,"An excellent position and good hotel, marred by the ruling of tube trains","I did not eat at the hotel, but the accommodation was as expected, the outdoor areas, lobby and bar were all excellent.

Rooms were varying (we booked a few for out group) but the worst were still satisfactory. 

The layout is slightly reminiscent of a labyrinth, but this is hardly the end of the world in what is such an excellent location and such a lovely building. 

But then there were the tubes. 

Wherever you sleep you can hear and feel them. On the first floor (2nd floor in US parlance) this was bad enough that it woke me up throughout the night in all three nights. 

It is difficult, I want to be positive, but not sleeping rather destroys everything else I can say about the hotel. I would give this a great review, were it not for this, but as it is I would say nobody should stay here. 

",2,2014,06,26
121,"3 C's -- comfortable, convenient, courteous","Just got back from a trip to London and stayed here.  Very convenient to many things -- Buckingham Palace is very close, as is Hyde Park. Big Ben, Westminster Abbey are a bit further but walkable, even Harrod's is not too far away.  The double decker bus lines stop relatively close to this hotel.  There are many pubs in the immediate several block area, which was great for watching the World Cup games.  There is a bank/ATM close by.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Concierge services were great,  We didn't dine at the hotel, so I can't rate the food there. (if you don't want a big/expensive breakfast, there are several nice small restaurants across the street for breakfast and lunch).

In terms of value, this hotel scores well.  As all hotels in the area are quite expensive, this one was a good deal.  Not cheap of course (it's London, after all), but all things considered and relative to the area, it was a pretty good deal.

The room was very comfortable and quiet.  A bit of a maze trying to find it, though.  Follow the room number signs and hope for the best!

The room itself was spacious with a large bathroom.  It was comfortable in a slightly worn way.  I followed up with the hotel manager, who indicated some of the rooms were going through a refurb, but don't let this scare you.  Our room, while maybe in need of an update, was by no means bad or shabby.  I can't overemphasize how comfortable it was.  And very clean, of course.

The net of my review -- we enjoyed our stay and if we were back in London and wanting to stay some place in that area, I'd certainly consider staying there again.",4,2014,06,25
121,Exceptional service and a memorable stay,"I was delighted to find a great deal on a room here, as it's next to the apartment where I grew up. I wasn't disappointed in my trip down memory lane. I was offered an upgrade when I arrived, and had a lovely room overlooking the courtyard. The staff went out of their way to be friendly, helpful and efficient. Highly recommended, and I'll be back.",5,2014,06,25
121,"Central location, Quality Hotel","Professional staff in a very central hotel just (literally) less than 5 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace.  As others have said some of the rooms are slightly dated and not as impressive as the Reception or common areas but don't let that put you off, it is clean, presentable comfortable with a big flat screen TV in the room.  A slightly seasoned bedroom is a small price to pay for such a fantastic, central location.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,25
121,Super choice,"Stayed at this property for the first time with the family a week ago. We were a family of 4 in two Executive rooms and we had a great stay. I dont know what the property was like before it became a Taj property but we had a great stay - which lasted almost a week.
We were clear that we wanted a well located good hotel in central London and you will find fewer nicer locations than this location - less than 500 mts from Buckingham Palace, less than a Km from Big Ben, Westminster, etc. Close to St James Part stn and to Victoria stn (much larger). We were never a 10 pound Taxi ride away from Covent Garden, Oxford Street and less from Knightsbridge, etc.
This hotel has a nice long lobby and some good staff at checkin. The checkin process was good. The Executive rooms were largish by London standards and recently refurbished. All modern amenities including a good sized bathroom with shower and tub. About the only thing I can fault is that the TV was a little complicated to operate the first time. I must add that they were very generous with the water, tea/coffee supplies and you can always ask and they will happily bring more. The concierge is well staffed and always helpful. We happily got directions, names of restaurants, cafes, etc. The Hotel has a great central courtyard which is fabulous to sit in and enjoy a drink.... I happened to chat with the Hotel Mgr one evening and he was a very friendly and sociable soul. This property has a General Mgr overseeing both this and the 51, Buckingham Gate property and knowing him - am sure that the differences in standards will become even starkly superior over time.
We had Breakfast included and the choice was very good and the service always excellent. It took us about 5 mins to get a table the first morning but never had to wait after that. About the only thing I can fault is that after 4-5 days, the menu gets a bit boring and repetitive.
There are tons of restaurants/cafes nearby - a great place for sandwiches/cakes/coffees opposite, a Pizza Pizza Express, a great Pub (Albert) and tons of chic/smart restaurants in the nearby shopping and dining area (I am not able to remember the name). There is also a small conveneience store (well priced) on the adjacent building and a laundry/dry cleaner a little further away. 
I would say - go for it. Great service for London.",5,2014,06,25
121,Exactly what we hoped it would be,"Exceptional service from the outset and throughout our way too short visit in London. Having arrived before check-in time, our bags were immediately stored with easy access if we needed something from them. When we requested the best room they could find (at our price), we were given a handicap accessible room, which meant we had much more space than a regular room, which we loved! Plus, it was ready within an hour, well before the regular check-in time. We loved the location, with so many sights (and sites) nearby. We walked everywhere, from cafés to cathedrals to theatres. Hotel staff were gracious, accommodating, and friendly. Our chief disappointment was having to leave. 
",5,2014,06,25
121,Confusing stay,"We stayed here as a treat for our wedding anniversary.

We checked-in and was given a ""complimentary upgrade"".......""great"" we thought. Upon arriving at our room we were confronted with cacophony of red velour, swags, tails and prints. This was a little disappointing as we had booked a contemporary suite. A trip back to reception soon had us moved to the suite we booked - nice and modern! It wasn't really any hassle, but it is just annoying. OK, the ""upgrade"" was a little larger but is was also tired, tatty and old-fashioned - plus you could clearly hear the tube (not something I expect when paying almost £300/night).

We were moved to the suite on the 7th floor which was lovely and cool with modern décor and a wonderful bathroom. That said, I can't believe these hotels don't occasionally stay in their own rooms, this way they'd find out that the bath takes twenty-five minutes to fill, the bathroom speakers are blown and that you can still hear the damn tube even on the seventh floor (OK, it's not loud enough to keep you awake, but again, at £300/night they could afford some acoustic decoupling in the building).

Bar service was painfully slow. Room service breakfast was OK, but toast a pastries were stone cold.

Did it spoil our anniversary? No. Would we go back? No way - there are better value hotels in London than this one.",3,2014,06,24
121,Welcoming and professional staff,"Great location. Professional staff. Restaurants very good, nice variety. Rooms well appointed, but could use some updating. All in all, would return.  Good coffee shops across the street if you don't want large breakfast.",5,2014,06,23
121,"Excellent Hotel, super location, brilliant staff","5 Star lobby and reception, great welcome, room a little dated but very clean and comfortable, view a building site at the rear of the hotel, noisy during the day with no double glazing, but that is hardly the hotels fault - progress is progress. Some rumble fro the tube but not particularly invasive or disturbing  Excellent air conditioning in room that was very much appreciated. Supper location Buckingham palace and associated parks just minutes away by foot, Houses of Parliament, the Embankment and London Eye a short tube journey really great recommended location. Breakfast very reasonable but short of space for the volume of guests. Beautiful Courtyard area very pleasant to sit and relax with a drink. All of the Hotel staff were polite, courteous and very helpful at all times 10/10. Young Mo was very entertaining. A special thanks to the house keeping staff who located my forgotten hearing aids and posted them on to me, like I say 10/10. An excellent visit enhanced by the staff and surroundings, I would stay again when next in London",4,2014,06,23
121,Great hotel.,"We loved everything. 
The hotel´s staff was superb. Special thanks to the people at the breakfast area - each morning really attentive, nothing too much trouble. Must point that we never had to queue up for breakfast, there were always plenty tables to sit and a person helping us to find a most suitable one. The food was really tasty and included fresh fruits. 
Our room 403 was the renovated one, spotlessly clean with a comfortable bed. 
The location of the hotel is amazing too - basically next to the Buchingam Palace and St James´s Park. Lonon Eye and Big Ben in a walking distance.
Would recommend!",5,2014,06,23
121,"Great location, outstanding staff, great deal","We just finished a wonderful stay at the St. James/Taj London.  Very central location and a great deal on the room rate.  Most of all, we were very impressed by the extraordinarily professional staff at every turn.  The reception staff managed to accommodate our request for a courtyard view room to avoid the construction noise, and upgraded us in the process.  The concierge staff was among the most helpful and professional I have dealt with anywhere in the world.  Definitely on my go-back list.",5,2014,06,23
121,Great weekend break - Tony Hadlow,"Excellent location right in the heart of London. We stayed for a weekend, were upgraded on arrival and spent a very happy two nights here. The staff are excellent, nothing too much trouble and any and everything we asked for was produced/answered with a genuine feeling of, "" delighted to be of service"". We have now stayed here three times and will definitely be back again. There was a que for breakfast but it was a busy weekend.
Thank you.",5,2014,06,23
121,Not worth the money. Room stinks like smoke ,"We checked in at 1:45 pm. Was told  our room wouldn't be ready for another 15-20 minutes because check in is at 2pm. No problem, we had some high tea in the hamptons restaurant. Came back to reception at 2:50 pm and was told by another woman our room was still not ready and to please sit down and have some more tea! She scrambled to find us a room that was ready. Was told luggage would be in room. Luggage was not in room. Didn't arrive till 3:45. We needed our things to shower after a 10 hour flight. We were only in London for a day and they had wasted a good two hours of our time waiting for room and luggage. I had to call reception to remind them of our luggage. Glad I didn't book this hotel again for when we return in July. The Asian receptionist didn't even greet us and gave us a snooty last name? No hello nothing. Terrible service. 5 star hotel with 2 star service ",1,2014,06,23
121,A perfect hotel in London.... esp. if you stay in renovated SUITE,"We stayed in this hotel for a week in November 2013 and they upgraded us to a suite. The renovated suite was perfection, one of the largest we stayed at in Europe and absolutely the most comfortable.  Every part of the room was perfect.  Clean and spotless with wonderful and thoughtful housekeeping service.  The best lighting features I have ever seen in a hotel anywhere - so much thought seems to have gone into the lighting control- from levels, to switch placement, to the marvelous range of lighting types and tones.....  Beautiful furniture in the living room, wonderful luxurious beds with high-end linens and pillows, two flat screen TVs with every channel you can wish for.... the water pressure, bathroom amenities, and layout of bathroom were also great.   Staff at the desk downstairs were hit or miss.  A few wonderful and amazing people made us feel very welcome, while one or two were more rushed and distant.

The hotel is located a short walk from multiple tube stops and walking distance to many major attractions as well.  Quiet at night, busy during the day.

In general our best stay in London and one of the best rooms we had in Europe.",5,2014,06,23
121,Nice location,"We stayed for our first three nights in London, and the location was very good. In terms of value for money, I'd be inclined to find an alternative. This is a somewhat ""posh"" hotel, with prices to match. The hotel is very large, and somewhat disjointed - our room was at the very back of the hotel, and we had to walk a considerable distance from the elevators, through quite a few hallways, to get to our room. The room/bathroom was OK, but did not match the price we paid. We did not purchase the breakfast option - at 25 pounds/person, it's not worth it. We walked two blocks to a Pret a Manger and did very well for approximately 5-6 pounds/person. The hotel is convenient, however, to the St. James Park tube station.",3,2014,06,22
121,Good 4 star hotel.....,"We stayed here mid June 2014 for our Wedding Anniversary.  We know London quire well so had no problems finding the hotel.  A lovely walk through Green Park from the tube, pass Buckingham Palace and across the road - simple!  The reception area, bar, foyer were lovely and 5 star quality.  We were given our room number and set off an a long walk down winding corridors to our Room on the 6th Floor.  The Room was spacious, partial view of the court yard and had all the facilities you would expect from a good 4* hotel.  Forgive me, but the rooms just did not have the wow / boutique factor.  A little overtired and need a new deco???  As we had many things planned, we weren't in our room much so it didn't effect us.  The worse part / factor related to the occupies in the room next door, who enjoyed slamming doors and watching tv into the early hours of the morning.  Second night - a good bang on the wall at 1am did the trick, until their room phone rang at 5.30am for a wake up call.  Breakfast nice, although the second day we were ushered into a Reception Room due to the main room being full.  Here, the waiters were a little clueless to be honest.  Overal though, a good hotel and good location for touring.  We had booked meals at the Dorchester and Hilton, so we wanted a hotel on the west side of th city, so again St James ticked the boxes for this.  Would I stay again???? Not sure, our favourite hotel is The Cavendish to which would be my preference.  But for the price, i'd certainly recommend it.  Well done!",4,2014,06,22
121,"Location, Location, Location.","We stayed 3 nights in one of the renovated rooms. Front desk and concierge staff were terrific.
Breakfast was included and was of quality befitting this Taj hotel but we found the service experience to be somewhat cumbersome. Once the main breakfast cafe, because of its small size fills up quickly, guests are guided through a maze of hallways to another area on the second floor where the breakfast selection is smaller & any egg orders are brought up from main kitchen cold and delayed. Hopefully, this situation should be resolved once the renovations are complete. All that said, overall we enjoyed our stay here. ",4,2014,06,21
121,Lovely hotel; lovely neighborhood,"This is a terrific value for an upscale hotel.  The location is quite close to many major sites and yet the street is quiet and just slightly away from the madding crowds.  The underground, St. James Park, Picadilly, the National Museum, and many other attractions are a few minutes walk.
The room and the public spaces were comfortable and the staff went out of their way to be helpful.  I would certainly stay here again.",5,2014,06,21
121,A bit of an anomaly,"We stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights at the beginning of June. Good points and not so good points, and although I have given it a 3 rating this is based on our own experience of the room that we had and it may probably be nearer a 4. The location is very good if you are visiting London for sightseeing. The public areas - lobby, restaurants, bar and courtyard are all very nice as was the service that we received from check in and other staff. Unfortunately our room was not up to that standard. We were in Room 468 and the corridor to reach it was rather dull. the room itself was large but quite dated and overlooked a large building site. The building works did not bother us too much as they did not start working until 9 am then finished late afternoon. You could also feel quite a lot of vibration from the Underground trains.The bathroom was small, with a shower over the bath and not very good lighting. I am aware that the Taj group recently took over the hotel and are undertaking a progamme of re-furbishment so we were obviously unlucky with the room that we were allocated. 
The buffet breakfast was average. We ate in the Bankj Restaurant on our first evening and it was very good including the service from our waitress (Saska I think).
If staying at this hotel I think you need to be quite specific about where you want your room to be.",3,2014,06,21
121,Great Location,"We stayed at this hotel for just one night as we were embarking on a cruise out of Dover the next day. The best feature of this hotel is the location. It’s within walking distance to shopping, pubs, an Underground station, St James’ Park and Buckingham Palace. The room could have used some updating, but it was nice and clean as was the hotel itself. We didn’t arrive there until around three in the afternoon and were disappointed that our room wasn’t ready. We waited for about an hour and a half in the courtyard for our room to be ready.",4,2014,06,20
121,Courtyard glamour near Buckingham Palace,"Lovely hotel with a courtyard, certainly a rarity in London. Priced right considering London's over the top hotel prices. Loved the large multi-room fitness center and the helpful Jack, with whom I share a love of Spain, lol. Was upgraded to a renovated executive room upon check-in. Helpful staff, Micaela especially, at reception. Loved the nearby Zander bar and friendly Damiano bartender. (What can I say, New Yorkers love Italians!) Nice buffet breakfast was included. Buckingham Gate street  is quite nice if nothing special. A lot of construction nearby as real estate seems booming. Easy walk to palace, St.James Park, Houses of Parliament and Westminster Cathedral. Loved the Indian touches here and there at the hotel. The Taj has echoes of Raj comfort. Jolly good show!",5,2014,06,20
121,Wonderful staying in the city centre,"Have stayed in the hotel for four nights.
I'd like to emphasize next points:
+1. Location, Location, Location. Just 5 minutes to go to the Wesminster Abbey, but at the same time the area around the hotel is not overcrowded. St. James Park is in two minutes to go. Subway is nearby, Victoria station is in 5 minutes by taxi. Excellent.
+2. It is essential that the rooms are not small (taking in mind that this is London anyway), the public areas are spacious too.
+3. WFi at moderate speed is free of charge everywhere in the hotel, the speed is enough to see videos like on youtube, etc.
+4. Staff is friendly and attentive
+5. Have tried a dinner in the restaurant, it is perfect, and not overpriced, i.e. in the restaurants around pricings are similar.
So it is very recommended both for bussiness trips and for leisure. 

- the view to the internal hotel yard is poor.",5,2014,06,20
121,Favorite hotel in the world!,"I've been coming here since I was 6 years old, and every time is just as magical as the first. Everyone who works here is wonderfully helpful and attentive, the rooms are beautiful and quite generous for central London, and the overall experience is so elegant! The location is fabulous (a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and only slightly further to Big Ben/Parliament), and I always feel like I am ""home"" again when I arrive! It's old school charm and elegance (and location!) can't be beat.",5,2014,06,19
121,Comfortable & well appointed hotel,"I stayed at St James Court for 3 nights for business and found the hotel to be very comfortable and well appointed. 

It is well located and only 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and Victoria.  There are a few nice pubs nearby.  

My room was a standard room and for London was roomy enough with a very comfortable king size bed and nice bathroom.  Not much of a view but not too big a deal when in London as not there to hang out in your room.

Breakfast in the bistro was nice however recommend that you order a la carte rather than pay £28 for buffet which wasn't very exciting and when you order your eggs are fresh and you are not paying for things you do not want.

Service was great and if the weather is nice, sitting in the courtyard to have a drink and casual meal is a great experience.",4,2014,06,18
121,LUXURY AT IT'S FINEST,"Everything about this hotel says ""Time to be spoilt"" From the moment you step from your car to be greeted by the elegantly dressed doorman, followed by the concierge and then the check in staff you know you are going to enjoy your stay. The elevators are fast, the room a really good size considering the hundreds of rooms they have. The bed is comfortable, although only a double, good sized bathroom and a shower that uses only a mixer to operate which is rare in the UK, a desk with ample room for your computer a fridge, yahoo, the first one we have seen in a hotel or B & B in three weeks travelling the UK. The only downside, if you can call it that, are the prices in their restaurant and for breakfast (if you have not booked a room/breakfast package). Prices are ridiculous, to the extent, we did not even have breakfast at the hotel. There is a great cafe opposite which opens at 8am, perfect for breakfast and there are several pubs close by that service brilliant food at on third the cost of the hotel for you evening meal. The location is superb, you are only 500 metres from Buckingham Palace and a brisk 15 minute walk to Parliament, Big Ben and a 20 minute walk to Trafalgar Square. Overall, I would stay here again, but room only.",4,2014,06,18
121,Beautiful hotel great position,"This hotel is in a great position. Close to st James Park station . This hotel is a very luxurious hotel.. Very well fitted out in the rooms.. Delicious breakfast. Bank restaurant is also very good.
Staff very friendly and attentive.",5,2014,06,17
121,Classic old world charm,"The ambiance as you enter the hotel is one of hushed assignations. There are business deals going on over whiskey, and gossip going on over tea. The lobby is plush with small private areas. The room was lovely altho on the small side. However, the location is prime, being mere blocks away from Buckingham Palace. ",4,2014,06,17
121,"Haven't stayed yet, but impressed by service",I have reservations to stay at the St. James Court soon and needed to contact the concierge for assistance.  He went above and beyond the call of duty to help me in making arrangements to see a ticketed event at the Tower of London.,5,2014,06,17
121,Classic Rooms are a waste of money,"The 70's called they want their room back.  Not all the rooms are the nice renovated ones you see in the pictures.  Some have only gotten minor updates since the 70s: flatscreens, curtains, linens.  If your expecting Taj quality prepare to feel ripped off.  All of this would have been forgivable if the bed had been to Taj standards, fluffy and wonderful, instead it was hard and unsupportive.  Not the quality I am used to at Taj or Crown Plaza hotels.  Booked it for a good bed rather disappointed. Further disappointed by the level of wear and tear, carpet was so dirty I was glad for slippers.  Terrible shower head to go with nice grohe shower fittings.  Only 1 outlet by the desk and no mirror in sight so had to keep running back and forth to figure out what I was doing.   But does have Taj level customer service.  Also one of the quietest London hotels.  I bet my room would have been even quieter if it wasn't near a service closet.  Air conditioning works really well.",2,2014,06,16
121,Cardystours2000,"Booked two rooms to celebrate mothers birthday.  Hotel kindly upgraded one of the rooms to an executive room.  Mam received a chocolate cake and  a birthday card which was a lovely touch. Hotel is in a excellent location. The entrance is so welcoming, the furnishings in the lobby of the hotel are  new and classy.  Our rooms were immaculate and the beds extremely comfortable. Breakfast was fabulous with an extensive choice.  The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.  I would definitely return to this hotel",5,2014,06,16
121,There is better,"Location great but rooms are very tired.  Noisy surroundings with school, courtyard and construction.  Went of breakfast and waited 15 minutes for tea...omelette never arrived...gave up.  Lineup for restaurant :(. ",2,2014,06,16
121,"Pleasant, welcoming, quiet yet well located hotel.","We chose St James Court in a hurry on a booking website due to its proximity to a wedding reception we were attending nearby. (The hotels we usually use were fully booked) We had some reservations as the hotel seemed so reasonably priced, even cheap, compared to others on our preferred nights. We need not have worried, from the friendly welcome to the pleasant air-conditioned room and good housekeeping, the hotel was a delight. The hotel was quiet at night and yet a stones throw from Buckingham Palace, the park, cafes and two tube stations within 10 mins walk.

We spent one very pleasant evening in the open courtyard restaurant, where food and service were lovely with no sense of being rushed by staff, in fact quite the opposite even though they were having to turn diners away as it was busy. Although we were a couple who had escaped from our kids for a weekend we noted that the hotel was very welcoming to families. 

While we would not wish to pay the standard room rates at this hotel (as per most London hotels!) we would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. We stay in London on business regularly and St James will certainly now be on the 'preferred list'!",5,2014,06,16
121,Great stay at Executive Family room,"Since we have 2 small kids, I explored options such as suite or connecting rooms before booking an executive family room at St James Court and it turned out to be great! The room has a separate living area, bedroom with 2 double beds and decent size modern bathroom.
As for hotel facilities we made use of front desk and concierge services, their staff are very courteous and helpful. Concierge was able to suggest good restaurants and make reservations for us.
We ate breakfast each morning at Bistro. It is an elegant and charming contemporary restaurant which mostly serves an English breakfast. The spread is nice however this one being an Indian hotel (Taj group) we were expecting more Indian food options. Perhaps the hotel can include south Indian breakfast staples and make it more interesting.
The location is excellent as most popular attractions and restaurants in areas such as Mayfair, Covent Garden, etc. are short cab ride away.",4,2014,06,16
121,Great for family with kids,"Stayed here to celebrate my birthday. Hotel was so kind enough to upgrade my room to Classic Junior Suite. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel definitely make kids welcome. First there were goodie bag upon check-in. Then they deliver a drink with a cookie with my girl name on it. Later that night when we have dinner at the restaurant, they give my girl another goodie bag with coloring set in it.
The junior suite room consist of the bedroom and a living room which is perfect for my girl. She got plenty of rooms to run around. But I would say the bathroom is a bit small. And also I find the shower too low. I'm 5'11 and my head is touching the shower head and need to bend my head when taking shower. One thing nice about the bathroom is there is a small rack where you can pull out and hang cloths. It is perfect to hang your swimming stuff. The bed is not that soft but still give us a good night sleep.
The amenities includes ironing board and iron, hairdryer, trouser press and a minibar! Been to a few hotels that doesn't provide minibar. There are also ice making machine.
Had my dinner in one of the restaurant - Bistro 51. They have chef special where a 3 course meal cost £30. I think that is fairly reasonable for a hotel. The food was great. The next day breakfast is at the same place. I would say the breakfast is what you would expect from any 4* hotel, a standard English breakfast. 
The hotel is a short walk to Buckingham Palace. We were lucky enough that Trooping of Colour is on Saturday. We have the luxury of having breakfast and stroll to the Buckingham Palace to watch the parade without having to wake up early and travel there early to get a great view.
The hotel is very close to Victoria station and if you don't mind wondering around London by foot, Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square is not very far either.
I would definitely stay here again if I'm staying around this area.",5,2014,06,15
121,Visit to Chelsea Flower Show,"What a beautiful Hotel. When you arrive it has a very welcoming atmosphere (Bruno) with a bit of luxury in terms of the reception area. It was a great base for travelling to the Flower Show only one tube stop to Sloane Square. The room we had was clean and perhaps needed a little refurbishment but had all the amenities you could want, iron, trouser press, hairdryer, minibar fridge, complimentary tea,coffee and water, as well as bathrobe and slippers. It was also close to major sightseeing attractions such as Buckingham Palace. After our visit to the show we went back and had a few drinks in the bar. Staff were lovely and it was very relaxing after a long day of walking! Some updating needed but we thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at a very reasonable rate through Hotelpronto.",4,2014,06,15
121,Do not let the lobby fool you,"As you enter the hotel you may think that by the looks of the lobby it would be a wonderful room...but what a surprise it is, to go to your room and find out that is an old room with torn carpet, very old and ugly furniture with unused space, of course I asked the girl at the reception if I was given a nice room and she said that of course I was in fact given a very spacious room with a view of the courtyard.
If this was a nice room I realy don't want to see a not so nice room.",2,2014,06,15
121,Nice Hotel with Good Location but quite Pricey!,"I only chose the hotel for its close location to Buckinhgam Palace where my husband and I were to attend a Royal Garden Party held in honour of the British Red Cross.

I phoned the hotel a week before our scheduled arrival to make sure that we could get a ground floor room because of my disabled husband and an earlier than the normal check in time of 14:00  so that we could wash, change and get ready in plenty of time for the Garden Party. I was told that it should not be a problem – if our allotted room was not ready they would give us one that was.

We arrived by train at Waterloo Station just after 13:00 and a short taxi ride later we arrived at the hotel to be greeted by a very friendly doorman who took our case and showed us to the reception.  I was a bit miffed to be told by the receptionist that our room would not be ready until14:00 and so I asked her to check her notes as I had specifically rung ahead to ensure that this did not happen!

Having done so she apologised and said that there were indeed notes and that she would allocate a different room.  Unfortunately this turned out to be on the 1st floor and was one of the longest walks I have ever done through a maze of hotel passages.  Our room was the end but one on the corridor the furthest away from the lifts which made it and long uncomfortable walk for my husband

The room itself was comfortable but in need of decoration with old yellowing wallpaper and few electric sockets.  The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and the towels were very heavy cotton, soft and luxurious.  Bathrobes and slippers were also provided but we did not use them.
A hairdryer, ironing board and iron and a trouser press were all in the wardrobe to be used as needed. A fridge was also in the room with a small mini bar, but we did not use it.

Our room had a small balcony overlooking the inner courtyard which was set out in Italian style with a large fountain and looked very pretty and seemed popular with guests and visitors alike.

We did not use the restaurants at all as they seemed very expensive even for London - £9.50 for a starter of just soup??? I do not think so.  At £175 per night I would have expected a full English breakfast to have been included at that price and was disappointed that nothing at all was offered.

There are other small eateries close by although we did not use these either but they looked quite inviting and a lot more reasonably priced for food and refreshments. 

The prices did not seem to deter foreign visitors who seemed quite happy to pay these prices!!!

We both felt the hotel was profiteering – we did not feel we got value for money for what we paid.
The staff were very friendly although sometimes hard to understand with their foreign accents",3,2014,06,14
121,Best hotel I've stayed in by far,"I spent my first night in London which coincided with my birthday at this hotel and I have to say that without a shadow of a doubt this was the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world.  I have stayed at the Waldorf in NYC, suites at Bellagio & Wynn in Vegas and many other fine hotels and they cannot hold a candle to St. James Court and her magnificent staff. Everyone I dealt with from Martin at check in to Shivaani the guest services manager everyone made me feel so welcome.  The room was perfect and the food in the restaurants outstanding.  I will be back for sure.",5,2014,06,13
121,They need to renovate the entire hotel!,"I spent the last week at St James Court. The hotel itself is nice. I was told on the hop on hop off tour that it was actually used to house royals who visited the queen long ago, somewhat like overflow rooms.. (Fun fact), anyway, I was given an old room twice at checkin. I called from the 2nd room, and explained that I could not do this.. This meaning, old dirty furniture, small bathrooms, small balcony, that looked as though it was about to crumble. The last room I received was one of the renovated executive suites ( though small for a suite) it was good enough, because it was new. Everything was up to date in the last room, staff was friendly, and listened.

If the restaurants were fairly priced, and all the rooms were renovated this would be a great hotel.",3,2014,06,13
121,Understated luxury,"We stayed here for 4 nights while we toured the city of London and Westminster.  It was very clean and comfortable.  Our rooms were spotless and the maid service came early in the day which was nice when we returned in the afternoon to find everything in place.  Thick towels, nice soaps and robes and slippers.  There was a beautiful courtyard area to eat or have a drink.  We didn't go to the restaurants that were attached however the menus looked good but a little pricey.
Internet was easy to access and free.  Our package included breakfast which included a buffet as well as a la carte orders of omelettes.  It also included room service at no extra charge, although we didn't take advantage of that.  
Staff were friendly and helpful and eager to please.  We ran into a concierge that made us feel like we were bothering him, however I did speak to the admin. about it and they assured us that it would be addressed.  Another concierge person couldn't do enough for us, so perhaps we caught this one on a bad day.
Indulged myself at the spa, which was welcoming and again spotless clean and very sumptuous. I felt the prices were reasonable considering the service that was given.  
The hotel was minutes away from Buckingham Palace and Victoria bus and tube station so it was fairly easy to get around the city.
I would recommend this hotel to stay at and would definitely stay there again if I returned to London.",5,2014,06,12
121,Great experience at St. James Court.,"Excellent place to stay, close to Buckingham Palace. Warm, friendly staff, always helpful and responsive to your any need. Wonderful Restaurants and delightful courtyard  to relax in for a drink or some great food and service. Hampton Bar was excellent also as were all the services. 
Totally enjoyed our stay and would stay again  and recommend to our friends. thanks to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable",5,2014,06,11
121,London trip,"We went to London for a trip away and stayed in the St James Court.
The room was very clean bright and comfortable with a lovely view over the Courtyard 
The staff were very friendly and attentive, nothing was a problem to them \Very central Location handy for Victoria rail station .
Also walking distance to Westminster and Buckingham Palace 

We had a Lovely stay 
Throughly Recommend this Hotel 
5/5",5,2014,06,11
121,Great location for London sightseeing,"Stayed for 2 nights in June. Located about 5 minutes walk from St James tube station ( District and Circle line ) Buckingham Palace is at the top of the road. We walked from Piccadilly to the hotel one evening and it was a lovely walk , passing St James Park - Up The Mall - to Buckingham Palace. This took around 25 minutes at a steady pace. It is also about half hours steady walk though Westmister passed the Abbey and Big Ben across the bridge to The London Eye.

We had breakfast included in our room rate otherwise I think i would look at Deli's in the vicinity for breakfast at about £5. 

It was my birthday on the day of arrival and the hotel gave a lovely little chocolate cake as a surprise and we were also up graded to a larger room. 

A beautiful courtyard is loaded in the middle of the hotel ( it is outside ) where you can eat of just take in the beautiful architecture of the hotel with an afternoon tea. 

Staff are very pleasant. Little slow in some areas : kitchen for items cooked to order for breakfast especially to go with the buffet items already out - need to time it right. Also in the lobby bar area seemed to have to attract attention to get a drink where as in the Courtyard service was very good and very prompt. Reception and concierge staff very good.

Our room beautiful and clean and quiet. Not much of a view but then you aren't there to spend time in your room.

In all a lovely stay and a lovely hotel for sightseeing in London and could say being a neighbour to the queen.",4,2014,06,10
121,"Overall great, needs updating & is getting one currently","Stayed here for a few days last week with my partner. The lobby/bar/restaurant all beautiful and fabulous helpful staff. Also their spa is just across the back of their courtyard, not 10 min walk like it says on their website, more like 10 second walk! had a treatment and was fantastic, again staff we're fab! Once you go up to the rooms the corridors to the rooms is where it fails, though we could see a lot of work and painting going on so it's obviously getting done, though didn't seem the quickest but that's the joys of workmen! Room was ok. Clean neutral just a nice typical room. If you don't like noise (or hearing the underground shake your room every 10 mins) then request being a few floors up! Hotel fantastically located for Buckingham palace area. Overall I'd definitely stay again but probably wait a year till the update has finished. ",4,2014,06,10
121,Perfect Hotel Perfect Location,"Yes it is expensive but we felt we got our monies worth. Although on arrival at 5.30am from Brisbane we were met with the sourest grumpiest reception we have ever received no smile no welcome nothing. We had booked and paid for the previous night to enable us to go straight to our room. The room we were given was not the room we had booked but they did move us that afternoon which was good as we were there for 6 nights.
Overall the hotel is beautiful the lounge lobby bar was very relaxing after a long day out. Bistro 51 is really good great selection of meals reasonably priced and our waiter remembered each night the wine we had ordered the previous night (nice touch). We ate at the Bank restaurant once we had the lobster thermidor which was beautiful. Only 5mins walk to Buckingham palace 20 minute walk to Piccadilly, Trafalgar square, harrods, hyde park absolutely perfect location. Lots of cosy little pubs in the area, would stay here again with out a doubt.",5,2014,06,10
121,Absolutely Superb!!,"Booked through an online site and was excited by the apparent value for money. Wanted somewhere a little bit special for my mum's birthday but had a strict budget. 
Rang the hotel one week before arrival to make sure that the booking had gone through ok and the gentleman that dealt with my enquiries was polite, friendly and efficient. This was the case with every staff member that we encountered during our stay!!! The rooms were a very good size for a city hotel, beds were HUGE and very comfortable, bathrooms clean and hair dryer, ironing board, iron, safe, Tea/Coffee making facilities, mini bar and complimentary newspaper all went to ensure that we wanted for nothing.
Breakfast was excellent. Lots to choose from, there really was everything we could have wanted. 
Concierge staff were incredible and looked after us brilliantly. Great to be able to leave luggage today while we went sightseeing. 
Many, many thanks to everyone at St James' Court for helping to make my mother's birthday such a special occasion and an experience that she will never forget. 
We will be back!!! 😃",5,2014,06,09
121,Do better elsewhere,"For the price, there are much better places in London. Unless you absolutely must stay next to Buckingham Palace, which you really don't, the hotel does not live up to expectation. Rooms are ok. No turndown service. Concierge mediocre. A duty manager was outright obnoxious. Given the price, I would not stay here again. London has better options. ",2,2014,06,06
121,A Lovely Historic Hotel,"Stayed here with family and had a wonderful time. The rooms are spacious and very 
comfortable. The location is idea for walking to many of London's major attractions.The
staff was very friendly and accommodating. The historic building housing the hotel has the most amazing curb appeal.",5,2014,06,05
121,Loved the St. James' Court!,"I am really glad I stumbled across this hotel when looking for a well located room in London. The rate I found on an online site was so good, they must have made a typo! :) Service was great. Room was spacious, comfortable, and nicely appointed. The WiFi was throttled but free at that speed your entire visit, something I did not find in another London property on my trip. The staff was fantastic. Everyone I dealt with was very nice. I was able to arrive early the day I checked in and leave my bags. When I checked in later that night, the bags were waiting in my room. Similarly, when I left, I was able to easily store my luggage until I was ready to pick them up. The location is great. The hotel is not too far from the St. James Underground station or the Victoria train and Underground station. Bus access is readily available just down the street at Victoria Rd. You are only a short walk from Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews to the north and Westminster Cathedral on the south. If I am ever in London in the future, I would absolutely consider this property again!",5,2014,06,04
121,A five star stay!,"We stayed in this wonderful hotel on 28th may. We could not fault anything, the hotel is beautiful, the staff very professional and friendl. The location is very central, within 5 mins walking distance to Buckingham Palace. The food in Banks restaurant overlooking the hotel courtyard was to die for!.. 
A special thank you to Micky in reservations for the room upgrade to a beautiful suite..we were so thrilled!  
We will definately be stating here again.",5,2014,06,04
121,Great hotel at a great location,"St.James was recently bought by the India-based Taj Group and that prompted us to book our 4-day stay in London there for a dose of the famous English Hospitality mixed with an Indian flavour.  We were not disappointed.  Although it was a little difficult booking the room online since their online reservation system was a little quirky, but finally got it through.  The hotel is located a stone's throw from the iconic Buckingham Palace, and the royal atmosphere extends to the hotel as well. While its compact and not nearly as large as some of the grand properties of the Taj Group, its service was impeccable and the treatment regal.  Right from the time we checked in we felt at home. The daily breakfast was decidedly delicious and the restaurant service of top quality, although in-room dining can be a little on the expensive side. Staying in touch with business back home in India was a breeze thanks to the fast and complimentary wifi provided in the room. Will stay here again when in London without hesitation.",4,2014,06,03
121,a lovely experience in london,"A great location in a beautiful part of London within walking distance to Westminister,Big Ben,Buckingham Palace and convenient to Victoria Station
Our room was great ,clean and all our needs catered for and the bed was one of the best beds I slept in The room was quiet and I felt I was in a very safe environment which was important for me traveling with just myself and my daughter
Staff are professional and friendly
Had a lovely time and will be back again",5,2014,06,03
121,The St James Experience,"In spite of leaving the Crowne Plaza Franchise the St James is the best hotel in London for it's Westminster location near Buckingham Palace.Westminster Abbey,Victoria Station,SMMT ,BIS and Department of Transport as well as Churchill's War Rooms and the reopening,in July,War Rooms.
You are welcomed by a team of friendly and helpful concierges with friendly doormen and porters and very friendly reception staff
The Courtyard is a real bonus and the bar and restaurant staff serve great food and drink with a smile. Well appointed rooms with comfortable beds make the experience worth repeating and I will keep on returning to my second home. A M",5,2014,06,03
121,Upgrades have made a good hotel even better,"The Taj company now fully owns this hotel, which has resulted in a name change and numerous subtle upgrades to the service and the common areas. It was already a lovely place to stay -- with superb staff, a great location and a wonderfully comfortable (if pricey) bar. But now it is up a notch. New artwork lines the walls, with lovely sofas and tables. A few additional comforts greet returning guests. The concierge staff are remarkable. The food in the attached Bistro is still terrific. For the business traveler, the conference room services are attended to with great staff commitment, and if you order lunch in, you will be very pleasantly surprised. I always enjoy staying at this hotel and I know I will be back many more times.",5,2014,06,02
121,"Lovely hotel, excellent service","First time stay at this hotel. Excellent, friendly service. Great location within easy walking distance of centre and main sights. Nothing too much trouble. One small (constructive) criticism, room was a little tired and could do with redecoration but still very nice. Couple of tiny housekeeping issues in the bathroom, toothpaste on the mirror, just a little more attention to detail but that said, would not deter us from staying again.  ",5,2014,06,01
121,Excellent service,"You know there are some hotels where there are small things you may not like,the view or the time the lift takes to come down but all that gets overshadowed by the superb service and excellent staff.Good location. Loved the breakfast.The dinner at bistro was great too, with an Asian twist. Very near to cardinal place where you have nandos and some eateries. Some rooms are undergoing renovation but it' did not disturb us at all. Will  stay there again and recommend  to all my friends. The restraunt banks next door is lovely too.",5,2014,06,01
121,A great stay in a fantastic location,"What a lovely hotel, the service was great here, on arrival there was a birthday cake and card from the kind staff at the hotel which made all the difference after a day in the city. Transport is easy to and from here as it's between London Victoria tube station and Green Park.

Breakfast is great here too with plenty of choice and friendly staff.

Thanks to the staff at the hotel that made this a pleasant stay, I'll come again soon!",5,2014,06,01
121,Convenient for London,"Considering London hotels are extremely expensive, this hotel is a good choice. The location is convenient, the reception is nice and the people that works at the hotel very service minded and nice.
The room are small for normal standards, but ok for London, considering you are sleeping in a crazy priced city.",4,2014,06,01
121,Absolutely perfect!,"First time traveler to London and this hotel met our every need! Service was impeccable from the moment we stepped out of our taxi and were greeted at the door to every moment we walked through the lobby! The room was beautiful, large by a European standard. Very clean and well decorated. The only flaw in our stay was the in room safe battery died locking our valuables so safely it took quite some time to get them released. The hotels professionalism was fantastic and they handled the situation promptly. We didn't use any of hotels restaurants with exception to cocktail service in the courtyard on one beautiful London evening. The property is perfectly located. Easy access to tube stations and within walking distance to all the key tourist sites including Buckingham Palace. There is a Pret Manger and Starbucks nearby and well as some very nice pubs and restaurants. The neighborhood felt quite safe and we were comfortable walking around even after dark. Overall this property is excellent and will definitely be back.",5,2014,05,31
121,High standard and fantastic service,"We had a wonderful stay at St James Court. We were celebrating a birthday and our 10 year anniversary and as icing on that cake we were upgraded to an executive king room for our stay which was very nice indeed. The staff were very friendly and service minded, the lobby area is beautiful as are the other areas of the hotel that we saw. The breakfast is well stocked and tasty and the service here is very much up to standard for the hotel in general. We would happily recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,05,31
121,Fab for a short break,"This hotel is in a brilliant location and we found everywhere we wanted to see was within one or two tube stops.  The hotel staff could not be more welcoming and helpful - my 7 year old daughter even gave them higs and kisses when we left as they had made her feel so special.  The room we stayed in was brilliant. Very spacious, clean with all the amenities you could want.  Although I didn't think this hotel was particularly for children I found quite the opposite.  On arrival we received a kids London activity pack which contained a fantastic activity book, crayons, jotter pad, postcard etc - all lovely quality.  We had only been in our room a short while and my daughter had a lovely surprise. The hotel delivered to the room a pot of hot chocolate and a yummy personalised cookie - she loved it. The beds were very comfy to return to after long days out.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in London.",5,2014,05,30
121,Excellent stay,"Stayed at St James for a weekend trip with my Mum. I arranged it for her 50th.
The hotel inside was beautiful, and the staff could not do more for us. They arranged for a lovely desert send to our room wishing my Mum a happy birthday.
We got upgraded, and the room was fab, clean and peaceful. We were next to the lift but didn't hear a thing.
We ate outside in the courtyard, and it was delicious. We explained we had a show to catch for 7.30 and they made sure we were off on time with a taxi waiting. 
Location is perfect is you want to do a spot of sight seeing. It's  a 2 minute work to Buckingham palace.",5,2014,05,30
121,Excellent location,"A beautiful hotel, a lovely spacious room with a warm welcome. We stayed two nights. The room on arrival was spotless.

After coming back from a day of meetings at 16.00, we found that our room was not cleaned and bed had not been made. We had to phone twice to get this rectified. 
I also noted that our cups and glasses were washed in the bathroom sink!!! Whatever happened to dishwashers and hygiene.  The only reason for the average score is because of the cups and lack of timely cleaning. I do not expect this in a hotel of this quality and price. 

The meal was lovely and the service excellent.",3,2014,05,30
121,A touch of class,"A class hotel not far from Buckingham Palace. Large rooms for London. Nice people at the reception. Excellent restaurants close from the hotel. Depending where your room is, a long walking (i.e. room 178).",4,2014,05,30
121,Fabulous a great venue tucked away in victoria,"My third visit close to office and Victoria station, so an ideal location.  Selected an upgrade on standard room and received a warm welcome when checking in.

Beautiful room with a dressing room, superb quality very quiet but awful views over the courtyard which did not detract from the overall ambience.  A standard buffet breakfast of good quality, I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay.

The staff were superb and very friendly and welcoming.",5,2014,05,29
121,Love you TAJ,"Very pleasant stay. Hotel with outstanding location and ammenities. Just aside Saint James tube station Reception, bar, restaurant and fitness center which are the facilities that I have used were just perfect for my needs! Will return.",4,2014,05,29
121,Long weekend in London,"We have used this hotel twice previously and found it a good hotel, however this time the hotel had improved due to thr re-furbishment that is taking place. We had a room on floor seven which was spotless and had all aminities for a good weekend break the room was cleaned to a high standard daily. The hotel is close to St James Park tube station and a short walk to other attractions",5,2014,05,29
121,Perfect location,"This is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location within walking distance of London's main attractions and just a five minute walk from Victoria Station.  Rooms are spacious, comfortable and well maintained and service is excellent.",5,2014,05,29
121,A very pleasant stay in London,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at St. James Court last month.  Since this was our first trip to Europe we really appreciated all the amenities:  the very helpful concierge service, buffet breakfast each AM (learning about and enjoying an English breakfast), the bar and lounge where we enjoyed dessert or a drink and entertainment in the evenings.  All the staff were so accommodating and pleasant.  The hotel was in a great location, with transportation, shopping, restaurants, and the famous sites nearby.  Our room was spacious and comfortable (although it was a very long hallway). We had a wonderful stay in London.",5,2014,05,28
121,good place to stay,"The staff are very helpful, food is good location is the best. Close to Victoria Street station, the tube and all the attractions.....If you need anything ask Fred at the concierge desk .... very helpful...",4,2014,05,28
121,Good 4 stars hotel,"I have spent 3 nights in this hotel in May 2014. The staff was very professional, friendly and helpful, the room was nice and very clean, the lobby and the courtyard were stunning. Refurbishment works going on but no noise / issues with it. 

The only thing I have not liked was breakfast; for this category I was definitely expecting more in terms of choice and breakfast room's dimension. 

Overall very good stay. ",4,2014,05,28
121,Great find in Central London,"On a recent trip we participated in a package that utilized the St. James Court Hotel in Central London.  What a great hotel and great location.  Service was outstanding, rooms large and very clean.  Free wireless internet was also provided.  The Concierge was very helpful and the Tube station was only a block away.  Walking distance as well to Westminster, Parliment, Buckingham, and some great pubs along the way.  By London standards, price was very reasonable and a great value.",4,2014,05,28
121,Great base for London Trip,"Lovely hotel in excellent position for central London.
Great value with early booking price we got.
You can walk to many of sights if weather fine. If not plenty of buses which work out far better  value than taxis. We didn't need to use underground but stations nearly if you are going further afield.
We just stayed for two nights but would be good base for longer stays too.",5,2014,05,28
121,St James Court: shabby chic - location great.,"Obviously had an interesting past - 5 mins walk from Buckingham Palace & 30 mins from covent garden. Not much else around. Attractive lobby. Rooms quiet, but need updating. Had breakfast across road at Royal Quarter Cafe.",4,2014,05,28
121,Very good indeed,"Just a one night stopover but everything about the hotel was really great including the room, the service, the location and the price.  Nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommended for a stay right in the heart of London.",5,2014,05,28
121,Excellent in every way,"Stayed for three days last week and everything was perfect. Good quiet room, very friendly staff, great buffet breakfast included in the rate. I only post reviews about once a year but this was really exceptional.",5,2014,05,28
121,expected more,"We chose this hotel due to its great location and excellent Regis, on arrival we were warmly welcomed and checked in. The room was clean but again expected more in terms luxury. The decor in bedrooms looked very tired and our room was certainly in need of a refurbishment, the food was top class but the service was only average. Given the price we paid we expected much better quality.",3,2014,05,27
121,Amazing hotel for business and tourism,"The hotel is amazing. Great service, great finishes. Just request a room not too far from the lift, because the hotel is huge and it can take 4 minutes to walk to your room if you are not lucky like me.

When they tell you the breakfast in the room is free, don't believe them. They charge you 8GBP, which is a fair amount in a such good hotel, but would be better if the receptionist were more honest!",5,2014,05,27
121,Spot on!,Lovely friendly hotel. Great welcome from Michela on arrival. This is a very comfortable hotel and we got a lovely modern room. Staff were so helpful. It's the perfect location for being right in the heart of things. We didn't need to use any public transport once we were checked in. Breakfast a little pricey unless you have time to relax but very nice cafés within easy reach so no problem. We'll be back next year!,5,2014,05,27
121,Excellency Choice in London,"My wife and I recently spent 2 nights at the St James Court and thought that it was an excellent hotel. Our room was very large, the staff was very helpful, and the restaurants were top notch. The patio was beautiful. The location was great...it was within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben. We will stay there again on our next visit. ",5,2014,05,27
121,Top class,"Booked during a stay for our 25th Anniversary, helpful staff from the start, concierge was very nice and helpful, room was nice inside, very clean, view was disappointing, but I'm not sure there is one at this hotel, we had the rooftop view over looking netting.
It is a little way out if going to Leicester square, covet garden etc, but right on Buckingham Palace doorstep, just depends what you are doing, breakfast buffet as fine, but overcrowded when we went in. The wife loves the doorman whistling for cab. would recommend",5,2014,05,26
121,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed here for a family weekend in the capital and the hotel was lovely. Easy check in / out by friendly staff and a lovely room (332) on the corner of the third floor overlooking the courtyard, nice view and also very quiet at night. Hotel also gave us some cake as it was our 10th Wedding Anniversary which was a nice touch. Room had everything you could need but the only drawback was the poor water pressure in the shower which you would not expect in this quality of hotel. Would definitely stay here again as the location is great (only 10mins max down to Parliament Square). Thanks for a great stay St James' !!",5,2014,05,26
121,Far from luxury,"My wife and I recently stayed here for our second wedding anniversary and despite the previous good reviews I am disappointed with our stay at St James Court Hotel. 

On arrival we were greeted and made to feel quite welcome, we had a drink after a long journey whilst our baggage was taken to our room, my wife and I had a lot of promise that this would be the luxury break we were in need of. After a quick drink we headed to our ""superior double room or classic king room, with king bed"" turns out this actually means a twin room with the beds pushed together. I did raise this with the front desk who then said they would sort it whilst we were out for dinner. When we got back all that had been done was a big sheet had been put over the two separate mattresses.

The room itself (597) was also a disappointment, the wallpaper was peeling off, the picture frame above the bed was cracked, scuffs on the walls and there was even clearly visible dust on the walls!

It may be that we were shoved into the spare room as most of the reviews seem positive but had it not been for the friendly staff at this hotel I would have scored this establishment a one star.",2,2014,05,26
121,Comfortable stay,Asked for a quiet room and got a very nice corner room with balcony on the first floor. Quick and friendly check in and good nights sleep. Staff happily stored our baggage while we did the London 10000. Got a good rate and would definitely stay again if we wanted to be in the Victoria area. Great Italian restaurant just 50 metres away too!,4,2014,05,25
121,unspectacular,"We stayed here over he weekend, but i have expected more. Our room was located on the lower floor facing the courtyard (which was beautiful), but there wasnt enough light in the room and it was a bit depressing. The whole floor havent been renovated for a while, it felt old and unmodenised, whicht dont get me wrong can be charming, but this wanst. However the lobby looked very chic, but i guess this was only the facade. Generally if you book a hotel in London you know it is way overpriced, this was another example of it.",3,2014,05,25
121,great hotel,"we spent three nights in this hotel from may 13th until may 16th ,the rooms are bright and airy and spotlessly clean,the staff were some of the most helpful I have come across,nothing was too much trouble for them,i would strongly recommend this hotel  ,and will certainly go back,five well deserved stars from me!!",5,2014,05,24
121,24K Gold Afternoon Tea,"We received the most courteous and wonderful service when We had our 24k Afternoon Tea last Thursday. I had to admit i had it wrong when i showed up a week earlier, but they never turn us down, and still they gave us the most excellent service far much better than other famous and prestigious hotels. Thank you so much.",5,2014,05,24
121,Wonderfull hotel,"Took a chance on this hotel instead of our usual choices but did not regret it,a charming hotel
The staff are fantastic,big room with silent air con,could not fault it.taxi always on hand and close to tube station",4,2014,05,24
121,Great hotel,"We were in London at the end of April and stayed at the St. James Hotel.  The hotel is in a beautiful historic building, our room was great looking on to the peaceful courtyard.  The hotel location is perfect and close to the most beautiful parks of London.   The best part about the St. James Court were the welcoming staff. They went out of their way to look after us and take care of details. We really felt welcome here and will come visit again.",5,2014,05,23
121,"Very nice on some aspects, rooms disappointing","Stayed for a couple of nights as it was walking distance to the palace where we were attending a function.  The website promises much and indeed much is delivered but important aspects seem low on the list and ironically, these are the easy ones to address.

The upside - the staff at every and all levels are brilliant.  Attentive, polite & pleasant, so well done on that.  The entrance and lobby are beautiful, giving a really special feel.

I had requested a room that allowed smoking.  Yes, I know that puts me somewhere at the lowest end of the scale in today's nanny state, but the fact of the matter is if a hotel offers this facility then I will make use of it.

We had room 222 (should anyone else wish to tread the same path, at least avoid this one).  The first inkling was the fact that one needed only to be within a step of the door on the outside to know that this was smoking room.  The smell inside suggested that not only did previous guests indulge in the occasional cigarette but possibly they misunderstood and felt it compulsory to smoke non-stop.  

Had the air conditioning system worked with any sort of efficiency and if the extractor fan in the bathroom had worked at all, then at least the air would have been renewed, but as that wasn't the case, it didn't.  One window opened about 15cm but that didn't help in any way.

Yes I could have made a song and dance but it was a special trip, only two nights so live and learn.  Hopefully the hotel management will also learn that at the prices they charge, even pariahs deserve an appropriate level of consideration.

On pricing - rooms are expensive - some eye wateringly so - but as mentioned already, it has some aspects in its favour to make the prices acceptable.

Except for the breakfast.  Oh dear.  Years back, British Rail had the reputation as one of the most expensive places to buy breakfast.  St James' Court could teach BR a thing or two had it still existed.

One is presented with a few options for breakfast.  There are things along the lines of Continental, English and (I think) Healthy.  We opted for English.  One rasher of bacon.  One sausage. One tomato, etc.  Not exactly value for your money £24.99.  Worse still when hit with a 12% additional charge for having the meal served in your room.

Odd that the price of £24.99 is clearly printed on the card left to hang on your door handle to indicate what you want has words to the effect that this is for breakfast in your room.  The card has no other purpose.  You cannot even make a paper aeroplane from it as it has a big hole to hang itself on the door handle, so it wouldn't fly.  Yet at the bottom, in small print, it states that there will be an additional 12% levied because you chose to have the food delivered to your room.  From the room service menu.  So really it's £28.99.  Per person.  

For me that unfortunately falls into the category of greedy pricing and to a disproportionate degree, really annoys me.  I'm already paying top class prices for an average room (although I get there via a beautiful lobby after a man has opened the door for me) - it's just not necessary.

Nice lobby though.",3,2014,05,23
121,Classy hotel in a classy location,"I recently stayed at st James court hotel with my daughter and it was a fantastic experience from the superb location to the excellent friendly staff can't wait to go back, we stayed 2 nights and couldn't find a negative thing to say about this hotel",5,2014,05,21
121,Excellent stay,"I have just visited the hotel for a long weekend in May with some family. I have travelled a lot around the world, but rarely met such a welcoming staff as here. It was such a pleasure. They tried there very best to keep you happy and satisfied at all time. The decor and furnishing of the hotel was very impressive. We enjoyed the last drink of the day, in the bar at the lobby with nice piano play. The hotel is placed in nice safe and quiet surroundings, and almost just around the corner for some of the mayor sightseeing places. I would love to come and visit you again.",5,2014,05,20
121,Excellent Stay!,We had a really lovely stay at St James Court- the whole hotel is beautifully appointed and our room- a superior double was really lovely.  Breakfast was very good - plenty of choice and good quality items.  The service in general was very good also.,5,2014,05,20
121,Great Location,I stayed here for a business trip in Jan/Feb 2014 and thought the location was excellent.  It is close to all the famous attractions.  The breakfast is superb and the gym and fitness area was better than I expected which meant I was able to most exercises I normally do at the gym.  I was on the first floor so my room was a little dated but my colleagues were on the upper floors and their rooms were very nice.  Although a little dated my room had character and was a good size with high ceilings.  It was relatively cold out but the room was nice and warm.  Quiet too.  Overall I was glad I got the opportunity to stay at this hotel over some of the others in the area.,4,2014,05,19
121,Exceptional service,"My wife and I stayed at the St James Court Hotel for our wedding anniversary as we had booked to go the the theatre. We booked the hotel though one of the booking sites and were pleasantly suprised at the price we obtained. 
On arriving at the hotel, we could not have had a better welcome. The doorman arranged for us to park our car right outside the hotel (although they do offer valet parking) and our luggage was taken into reception and later delivered to our room. Reception was very efficient, welcoming and friendly.
When we returned from the theatre in the evening we had a drink in the bar and again the service was excellent. Breakfast was also very good, again with excellent friendly service with nothing too much trouble.
The decor throughout the ground floor of the hotel was very good.
One thing we learnt was that if you think your room rate is too good to be true then it probably is. We had booked a classic room which looked great on the booking site and the room was a very good size but the decor was very tired and in poor condition, and the bathroom was very small. The room was very clean and we had no complaints as you get what you pay for and we were more than satisfied with our overall stay and would certainly return to the hotel.",4,2014,05,19
121,A real find !,"I stayed in the St James Court ( old Crown Plaza) by sheer chance as my normal Club that I stay in was booked out. I was really impressed by the service of staff and the decor and furnishings of the Hotel. I stayed over 4 nights although did not get a chance to sample the culinary expertise on offer as I was meeting people elsewhere around the City. It is hard , if not impossible to get everythign 100% right in every respect , very slight observations ( not criticisms ) were the fact that since 100% of staff or close to it were from India ( Well it is a TAJ Hotel !) it can be difficult for Me to discern the accent and meant I had to ask for things to be repeated - this is not a fault - just an observation. I was delighted that the option was there to forego breakfast as at £27 (?) it was a little steep but I do appreciate it is a five star hotel. I went own the road to have a full English elsewhere for £4 with Builders crews working on a site ! A good contrast for the day ! The location is superb . I understand that this Hotel was the old Grand Plaza which was great to know. Taj seem to be an excellent outfit and extremely professional and I REALLY enjoyed my stay - as I said - it's hard to get everything 100% right for Everyone because we , the Customers , are all so different. The acid test for Me is whether I would go back and YES I WOULD. Take a bow St James Court - you are a great hotel and I am happy to say so !",5,2014,05,16
121,Excellent personal service,"This was my third or fourth stay at this hotel. Since becoming a Taj hotel nothing has been lost, in fact I think it has become even better.  From the moment you approach the hotel you are welcomed by very friendly staff. The reception staff were incredibly focused on delivering excellent service and they did an outstanding job. The location is fantastic, the hotel offers great value for money and the personal touches are fantastic.",5,2014,05,15
121,Fantastic hotel,"We loved this hotel!!! It was clean, rooms were a good size (for London), great location for Billy Elliot, which I also highly recommend! The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to take pictures for us etc. Didn't use the spa but the staff on the front desk and the atmosphere was as it should be. Breakfast was in a separate room as it was busy, the food was exactly the same, warm, delicious and we had great service. Definitely would stay again. Happy memories for my sister's 40th birthday celebrations.",5,2014,05,15
121,Good option with great potential,"I stayed here on business for 5 nights in early May 2014. The hotel has great potential, but it is not quite there yet. I had joined the Taj rewards program prior to my trip and had requested a quiet, refurbished, King room facing the courtyard. Upon check in, I was the only one of my colleagues who had a room available to check in at 1:30p post flight from Atlanta -- which was great. It was, however, a non-renovated queen room facing a construction site. It was clean, roomy, somewhat plain in decor, and relatively quiet, except when the tube was operational.

Pros: Attentive, helpful staff. Great location near some top sites and the St. James tube stop. Hotel with character. Top notch fitness equipment. Beautiful courtyard. Excellent service at breakfast from both the host and servers and food options were good. Enjoyed a latte at Bar Gusto across the street. Liked the Phoenix, and Cask and Ale pubs a few blocks away. Nice wines by the glass in the lobby bar. Lunch served at our business meeting on site was fantastic.Comfy bed.

Cons: Underground ran literally under my room (559). Nearby construction went past 11pm one night. The only in-room coffee was instant - a major bummer for a caffeine addict the first morning following a red eye. Staff was incredibly well intentioned, but many had thick accents that were quite difficult to understand. Room thermostats were impossible to operate resulting in a couple of uncomfortably warm nights (work colleagues also had similar experiences). Our meeting room was impossible to find causing many attendees to be late. Very few good restaurants nearby. Poor pillow selection -- all seemed old and hard. Weak wi-fi in room. Difficult to climb in and out of the shower/tub. Could do without the loud, piano music in the lobby at night.",4,2014,05,14
121,Central with huge rooms,"I loved my room with double king-size bed and small toiletries, even had a spray for better sleep. 
Perfect for business trips or town visits. Just next to Westminster palace. If you are sick of english breakfasts - there is a Starbucks just next to it.",5,2014,05,14
121,"Luxurious, comfortable and welcoming.","We stayed for the weekend to take part in the London Moonwalk. All the staff were really friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the magnificent courtyard. It was a lovely feeling knowing we had a beautiful hotel to return to after days out and particularly after the night walking 26 miles of the Moonwalk! 
Definitely my 'go to' hotel in London now. ",5,2014,05,14
121,"All good, generally","We stayed a night as part of a special offer with tickets to see Billy Elliot. Check in was fuss-free, but it would have been nice if the staff member could have pronounced my traditionally English name correctly. We did not use bars and restaurants at the hotel, although they looked nice - plenty of choice locally. 
We had a bit of trouble using the wifi, but wouldn't say it spoiled our stay. 
Slept well due to quiet room and comfy bed. 
Overall an enjoyable stay in comfortable surroundings with friendly, helpful staff. ",4,2014,05,13
121,"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel","I chose this hotel for a break of 4 days in London. A great 5* hotel near Buckingham Palace. Very close to London Eye, Big Ben and the most attractions of the city. Great staff, good food quality and great atmosphere. Good night in the bar with live music.",5,2014,05,13
121,Beautiful hotel for romantic occasion,"I booked a classic double room for 1 night for a very special event, I was going to propose to my girlfriend during dinner at the Shard. The staff at the hotel was always really nice to me during the booking the offered to show me around the hotel so that I could even decide which type of room to book. Then I placed my reservation and I was upgraded as a courtesy of the hotel. The hotel itself looks really nice and smart from the time you are opened the door to enter into the big classic reception lounge. the room was really beautiful, quite, confortable and clean. we got the breakfast served to our room as part of the services the hotel offers. We had a classic english breakfast which was delicious. The hotel is conveniently located around Westminster Abbey / Big Ben really near Victory station and St James Park which takes you with nice short walk to Buckingham palace, Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus.

We will definitely come back.",5,2014,05,13
121,"Good location, a couple of problems","This is a very good hotel in a great location but our visit was spoiled by a couple of problems. Firstly it was impossible to get consistent wi-fi connection in our room which when advertised as included I think is not good enough. They offered to move our room but the wi-fi in the foyer was also very poor so I could see no point.
The second problem was the bar fridge which was in the middle of the floor on arrival and after a phone call was removed and a new fridge fitted to it's correct location but no one had a key to open it. After three attempts by different people they gave up and we had no fridge for the duration of our stay.
This is a nice hotel in an unbeatable location but with the problems we had we would probably look for some where else next time.",4,2014,05,12
121,very good,"good service , just like the Taj in India . to be honest the hospitality of Taj is lacking here but it is much better than any other hotels I have stayed in London
I am a silver member so was upgraded to a nice room for free which was a nice gesture",4,2014,05,12
121,recommend,"Easy to access, close to everything, good accommodations and service very good. 1 block from St James's station, 5-6 blocks from Westminister Abbey. Close to great areas of town. Outstanding breakfast. ",5,2014,05,12
121,"Lovely hotel, terrific location","This hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to a lot of attractions, very close to tube stations, bus stops and some cute pubs.

The lobby and public areas are beautifully decorated.

We stayed in a newly renovated king room which was incredibly spacious by any standards and positively huge for a London hotel.  The bed was very comfortable, hard to get out of in the morning.

My only negative was the water pressure in the shower, which could have been better, especially when trying to wash hair.

The service is superb, everyone we encountered (especially reception staff and the doormen) was very helpful and friendly.  It's obvious that the hotel has put a lot of effort into providing exceptional customer service.

No decent London hotel is cheap, but I thought the St James Court provided great value for the price we paid.",5,2014,05,12
121,"Good Location,","I stayed three nights in this property in a standard room.  The rooms are a good size, although they are a bit tired. The property is in the process of being renovated, so I am sure that will change.  The staff were great, although I did experience one concierge with a snotty attitude.  I certainly would not hold that against the property or the concierge as we all have bad days!  Breakfast was included it was good and the location is great.  I ate dinner in two of restaurants on the property, both meals were okay but they are over priced and over rated.  I would stay there again although I am sure once the renovations are complete the rates will take a substantial jump.  If this is the case there are better options.",4,2014,05,11
121,Central location and great hospitality,"The exec familiy rooms and the junior suites are very nice. Indian hot plates at the coffee shop and the food at Quilon are outstanding! The entire team from the senior management, reservations, front office, F&B, concierge are very warm. Location is as central as it gets with practically everything within 1-2 miles. Prices are reasonable if booked well in advance and esp for the central London location. The  the team is gracious to meet special requests and upgrades.",5,2014,05,11
121,Not up to previous visits,We have stayed here for a number of years when in London. The room was on the second floor but you felt and heard all the tube trains running nearby. We tried to check in at the designated time of 14.00  but did not get into our room until 15.30. This hotel use to be a Crowne Plaza where I am a platinum member. I am normally upgraded accordingly but on this occasion was not. We complained at the time but got put off. However on check out the receptionist was alert and initiated two calls from the hotel management to put things right next time.,3,2014,05,10
121,AMAZING.,"I stayed here for 3 nights for my 21st and it was great. Couldnt fault a thing. We were upgraded to an executive junior suite on check in. Room was gorgesous cleaned daily and ice on an evening with chocolates.
Reception were really helpful. Courtyard at the back of the hotel was lovely to sit in if its nice weather. Definately using the hotel again when i return later this year.",5,2014,05,10
121,The Same But Different,"I'd been here before it was a Taj and loved the hotel, the concept, courtyard and location.  We had a few glitches in the beginning but a nice man name Naveen finally saved the day.  Front desk and reception were impressive.  The rooms were nice but being over the courtyard was the important thing historically for me.  Service was good, breakfast was good, check in was pleasant and the location is fabulous.  WiFi was not good, they tried to fix it but if you wanted to use the free one, the one in the pub on the corner is world's better.  You can upgrade for 10 pounds a day but everywhere else, it's free and strong.  All I wanted to do was confirm a plane seat for the next day and couldn't.  If you want to be in the center of things, this is a really good place.  Many attractions are walkable and the pub on the corner was pretty good!  We were there for two days and I would go back again but be sure to make any requests beforehand and followup.  Nothing in life is guaranteed but keep at it and you'll get your requests met.  Think this will get better as the management rehabs and gets the electronics together.",4,2014,05,09
121,Great Stay in May 2014,"My party had reservations for 3 twin rooms beginning May 3, 2014.  We had 2 rooms for 2 nights and the third room for 3 nights.  Check in was easy and quick as we arrived late afternoon/early evening.  Inga at the Reception counter was very welcoming, as was the porter Norbert who got our multiple heavy bags to our rooms quickly. 

Our rate included breakfast which is a large buffet with multiple choices (the scrambled eggs on the buffet line were a little runny, but you can request, and receive, your eggs cooked to order), and toast will be provided if you don't want the croisants or pastries on the buffet line.  We had completed a cruise prior to check in, and my brother-in-law thinks the breakfast the hotel offered was the best he'd had during our trip (he used the buffet on the ship for his breakfasts during the cruise).

The Concierges are very helpful with tips for local restaurants/pubs, and activities and directions.  They can provide tickets for some activities (we purchased tickets for the double decker bus tour ""See London By Night"" just an hour or so before the tour was scheduled to start).

Rooms are not ""cookie cutter"" - each room was unique in location and arrangement, but each was spacious, comfortable and quiet. Hair dryers are in the dresser drawer.  Hotel provided a power converter which accepted the American plugs for phone chargers and curling irons. If you have any physical limitations, let the hotel know in advance as some of the rooms are located in areas where quicker access is through the courtyard and spa, which requires climbing three steps without a handrail and the bath tub ledges are pretty high to step over into the tub (but my tub had plenty of grab bars I could use - I have a rod and screws holding one leg together so my mobility is a little restricted, but I was o.k. in Room 880).

Hotel location is great for walking to several tourist spots: Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews, the Queen's Gallery, Westminster Abbey, Downing Street, Horse Quards Museum, Horse Guards, Trafalgar Square, the London Eye, etc. 

Because we were only in London a few days and wanted to spend our time seeing sights, we didn't use public transportation (buses or underground) but used the taxis (we split the cost between the 5 of us so it wasn't too much per person) which were readily available at the hotel (doormen were great getting us taxis).

Overall excellent, pleasant stay.  We arrived via a bus tour from Southampton, and our bus driver described the hotel as ""posh"" which is not us by any means,  but we felt welcomed and comfortable throughout our stay.  Every staff member we encountered greeted us with a smile and were extremely profesional and courteous throughout our stay.",5,2014,05,09
121,Oasis of calm in a busy city,"Just returned home after a 5 night stay over the May bank holiday weekend. The hotel is ideally situated within a short walk from Victoria station and about a twenty minute stroll from theatre land in the west end. Check in was efficient and initial impressions of the reception area are extremely positive. As my initially allocated room wasn't available when I arrived at about 4 o'clock I was allocated room 479 instead. As previous reviews have pointed out some of the rooms are quite a walk from the lifts and 479 is no exception. The room itself however was spotlessly clean and  the bed very comfortable,I can honestly say that I had the best nights sleep in a London hotel in the St.james. 
Previous reviewers have also mentioned  (a) building work nearby and (b) the sound of underground trains running beneath the hotel. Both of these are valid comments but should not dissuade you from booking this hotel. The building work nearby was only a minor  irritant from my  room  location and finished at 6 pm anyway and the rumbling of the underground,you get used to it after a while. Wifi,while patchy,was free. Perfectly acceptable for checking email and Facebook but not for YouTube videos I' m afraid. 
The ideal location of the hotel in a quiet and safe part of the city,coupled with plenty of places to eat and drink nearby,makes it worth booking in my opinion. Staff are excellent and the hotel really is an oasis of calm in a very busy city. Underground/building work is only a minor annoyance. Would recommend.",4,2014,05,08
121,Lovely,"Visited London for a weekend and couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. The hotel combines lovely English hospitality with modern (Indian) design. Very close to the next underground station and located in a walk-able distance to the Buckingham Palace. If you are looking for a great ""London experience"" without long ways to sightseeing's and want to enjoy high English hospitality that´s the place to go.",5,2014,05,08
121,The right hotel,"Although my wife and I had stayed in the Westminster area before and found it very convenient with ready access to transport, it lacked the peace and quiet that we want after a busy day. It turns out we just needed to check out areas east of Victoria Station to find what we were looking for. The Crowne Plaza Hotel proved to be everything advertised with top quality lodgings, excellent breakfast, easy access to the tube and best of all a quiet enclave in central London. We both are walkers and enjoyed the surrounding neighborhood as well as access to two tubes stations and the shops along Victoria Street. The staff were highly responsive to all our requests including the location of the room and accommodating a request for early check-in. We have recommended the hotel to friends and will stay there again.",5,2014,05,06
121,Nice but too many issues,"Stayed for one night, had been travelling all day and wanted a nap however there was construction works right outside my room so decided to get a massage instead. Spa staff were excellent and service was great however there was more noise whilst I was getting the massage, the masseuse went to ask the workers to stop and the noise did stop for the rest of the massage. She was very apologetic and very good at her job. On returning back to my room, the construction noise was still ongoing, I didn't really mind too much for the afternoon but called to ask what time it would start the following morning as I didn't want to be woken up with it. Was also told breakfast wasn't included when it should have been. Was offered another room and was told I could move in the evening, however it stunk of smoke, and the breakfast situation still hadn't been sorted after 3 calls and an email forwarding my confirmation. At this point around 11pm I just wanted to get to sleep. I was eventually moved to a very nice, quiet and non smoking room and the breakfast situation was resolved. Staff were very helpful, it was just a shame that I had to spend so much time messing about with all the issues when I was only there for one night! Really from a 5* hotel I wouldn't expect so many problems. Final room was very nice and breakfast was great. All hotel facilities, especially the Spa were fantastic.",3,2014,05,06
121,Another excellent stay,"This was a spur of the moment decision to have an overnight stay in Central London. Feeling in need of an escape, we decided to return to the St James’ Court after having stayed before on several previous occasions. 

A friendly welcome as always – from arriving at the front door to checking in at reception (exceptionally pleasant and highly efficient receptionist). We took advantage of a reduced Sunday evening rate to opt for a studio-suite and were allocated instead a more spacious (and very comfortable) 6th floor junior suite - very quiet, which we liked, with a view across rooftops towards Big Ben. 

We like the location of the hotel very much, tucked away slightly off the beaten track but nearby to Westminster and busy Victoria Street, lovely St James’ Park and very good transport links.

On returning to the hotel after a busy afternoon and evening watching Chelsea v Norwich and dinner at a favourite Earl’s Court restaurant, we were soon asleep in our room (too tired on this occasion for a night-cap). Thanks to the supremely comfortable bed, we managed to sleep in much later than we intended (we were grateful for breakfast served until 11:00 a.m.).

We enjoyed lingering over the buffet breakfast, deciding on our plans for the day (a visit to the nearby Queen’s Gallery and then a walk around Mayfair exploring Georgian life and architecture). Breakfast was very good – wide range of choice from the well-stocked buffet (with some interesting spicy options) – attentive and friendly service throughout.

We were grateful to take advantage of the bag-storage facility so that we could make full use of our time in London.  

Overall another very enjoyable visit (every time we stay here we really do feel well looked after). We look forward to returning, hopefully later in 2014.",5,2014,05,06
121,A great place to stay!,"This hotel would normally exceed my budget but for a birthday treat for my partner. & after reading the many favourable revues i pushed the boat out a little. Certainly glad i did, this was a perfect choice!  
From the moment we arrived, even before entering we were greeted at our taxi by the doorman who took our luggage which arrived at our room before we did! We were Taken aside from a busy check in desk by an assistant manager to be personally checked in at her desk, & we were given a free upgrade to a suite & found a greeting card & cake for my partner awaiting us when we got there. We felt very well looked after by all the staff we encountered, nothing seemed to be to much trouble & although our wants were few we were assured any needs would be delivered if possible.
The room itself was very well presented, spacious with a queen sized double bed, spotlessly clean as was the bathroom & serviced on both days we stayed.
Breakfast was buffet styled & excellent too.
The overall feel was one of elegance, style & curtiousy & we loved it all & were sad to leave! A big thank you for making our stay so special.Hopefully we'll be back one day!!",5,2014,05,05
121,Great staff service and location,"We spent 5 nights in this hotel and were delighted with the service and amenity of the hotel. It is not modern in the current sense but despite its rambling layout it provides excellent service, breakfast and location. It also has an improving gym and spa facility and is competitively priced.",4,2014,05,05
121,A very comfortable stay,"This hotel was in a prime location for the Victoria line. The room was very comfortable as we had an executive room,332.the bathroom was spacious and clean, the bedroom was also very clean but the complimentary fruit was not so good. We had a good view over the courtyard which was in full bloom.
Normally this room would cost £500.00 which I think is a very steep but we managed to get a deal with which we were happy. Breakfast was very good, and omelettes were available on request !",4,2014,05,05
121,45th wedding anniversary,"We recommend this hotel on many fronts:
LOCATION.  You can't do better. We (senior citizens) walked to most of the sights in Central London during our 6-day stay. CLEAN AND ROOMY,  COMFORTABLE BED.  (Well, except our ""king bed"" was just two separately-made twins, mostly pushed together.)  ALWAYS HELPFUL STAFF.  They let us have access to our room several hours early. They sent us a delicious chocolate mousse anniversary cake! ONGOING REMODELING was absolutely not an issue.  Our room on the fifth floor was always quiet.  We'd hoped they would give us a newer remodeled room, since we stayed 6 nights and came from California and were celebrating a 45th wedding anniversary. They didn't, but we have no complaints, anyway.   Thank you to the staff of Saint James Court.",5,2014,05,04
121,GOOD,"I had a warm welcome and the staff were VERY helpfull... My suite was so comfortable, clean and good, otherwise my partners took a basic room and it was so dirty, old with a bad taste decoration.... SO TRY TO AVOID THE BASIC ROOMS! TRUST ME, THE NORMAL ROOMS ARE HORRIBLE BUT I WOULD GO BACK FOR SURE FOR A NICE SUITE.",4,2014,05,03
121,Brilliant,"We booked and paid in advance for a king room with breakfast included (would definitely recommended the buffet breakfast be included, it  was fantastic), checking in and checking out was a breeze.  We took the tube at Heathrow, changed once at Hammersmith and made our way straight to St. James Park tube station.  From there, the hotel is just a few blocks walking so extremely convenient.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we were greeted by a door man (very friendly) and a nice reception area with a helpful assistant who even helped us setup our WI-FI.  She also informed us that our room would be upgraded to an executive room at no cost.  The bathroom was huge.  The room was not extremely large, but well appointed.  All in all we had a very comfortable stay and would definitely stay again.  We recommend this hotel.",5,2014,05,03
121,perfect and very comfortable,"we had a wonderful welcome when we arrived after a long trip and could have our room already at 10.45 am. nice, comfortable and big room,which was very clean . the staff of all the hotel were very helpful at any time .... service at breakfast or in the restaurant, front-desk, or house-keeping.the hotel is very close to a lot of sights.it is a perfect place for a city trip to london. hope to come back soon !!",5,2014,05,02
121,Would go back,It was a nice hotel staff were helpfull without being too 'in your face' it's close to the main bus routes if you want to use the busses which we did! The room was comfortable and breakfast was nice with eggs cooked to order if you weren't keen on the scrambled egg on the buffet.  It even had a couple of indian dishes for breakfast I think spiced potato was available one morning.,4,2014,05,02
121,wonderful hotel !,"We had a most enjoyable stay at this very comfortable,friendly hotel.The room was spacious,clean and very comfortable. This hotel has a great location,very close to all the London sights We will definitely return, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",5,2014,05,01
121,Will definitely go back!,"Wow! What an amazing stay we had! We stayed here for a week and the service never faltered. The staff were so knowledgeable and friendly, which really made our stay amazing. As well as having a few restaurants and bars attached this hotel had it all. As we were so far from home it was so great to be able to use their free internet service and computers so we could keep our families up to date. I cannot wait to go back to London and will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,05,01
121,What a difference a year makes,"It's like a newly built hotel compared to its previous state.  I have an executive studio which has a great separate sitting and work area from the bedroom.  Great sized bathroom, nicely appointed. I'm looking forward to breakfast.  Dinner in Bistro 51 is very nice, attentive staff, food arrives in good time and nicely spiced.",5,2014,04,30
121,My second stay was just as nice!,"My second stay here was just a nice as the first.  This hotel is in such a perfect location for seeing London.  The room is so comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, everyone was so helpful. I could not ask for more from a hotel.",5,2014,04,29
121,Best service ever!,"Hotel location is excellent! Meals were terrific!Room was spotless! But more importantly all the staff we met during our stay were extremely helpful. Nothing was too hard for them! They looked after us so well, we really felt like family! Definitely recommend St. James' Court to all.",5,2014,04,28
121,"Nice stay, good location","My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of April 2014. We were met by the doorman who was very polite and helpful. We checked in and the receptionist was also very kind and interested in our stay. It was a special occasion for us and we were advised we had been moved to an upgraded room which was very kind. The room was clean and accommodated our needs. The bathroom in particular was very nice. We stayed in room 630. The lobby was lovely and looked very posh. The hotel is a stones throw away from Buckingham palace and is in a great location. The breakfast was very pricey however. Although the hotel is excellent with very friendly staff I do feel it is over priced, although in line with London prices I'm sure. Overall a great stay and I would recommend. ",5,2014,04,27
121,"Location, great food, dated room","Location was excellent - The hotel was situated really nicely near Victoria station, and St James Underground. Buckingham Palace was near, only 10 minutes walk away. 

Food - Hotel breakfast was good, there were foods for vegetarian and for meat lover. Service at breakfast was very good. At hotel there is Michelin star restaurant Quilon. Highly recommended! Lunch menus had an excellent value for money. 

Room - Our room at the hotel was on second floor. Room decoration was stlylish. However rug, walls, textiles and chairs were a bit worn. There used to be safety latch on the door, but it had been ripped off. Also on the desk in the room there was drilled hole. These little things made the room feel not-so-top-notch. Still we were able to have good night's sleep.",3,2014,04,26
121,Another excellent stay,"Third stay in this hotel and once again we had a brilliant time. The hotel itself and staff are marvellous. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a luxurious London hotel and only three minutes walk to
the Queen and Prince Phillip 👑

",5,2014,04,26
121,Great location and good service,"We booked this hotel via the internet, and were very satisfied with our choice. The location is central to much of London, with Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park just a 10 minute walk away. St James tube station is just a block away.
The hotel room was a decent size, the bed was comfy and it was generally quiet, although we could often hear the trains rolling through the underground at night.
Our room price included breakfast, which was one of the better buffets we have experienced - a great way to start the day.",4,2014,04,26
121,Personalized Service,"The staff at this hotel went out of their way to make me comfortable during my week-long stay. They were kind, efficient and knowledgeable. The hotel has undergone renovation. When I needed help getting the shower to work, they came immediately. When I requested peanut butter at breakfast, they went out to get some immediately. The hotel bar had a lovely piano player, delicious tea and was filled with lively, content travelers. I was there to run the London Marathon and they offered a pasta pre-race dinner and discounts on massages.",5,2014,04,25
121,Short and sweet,"Had a a 1 night stay for business recently and had never stayed here, Got an excellent rate for midweek, Staff were very helpful and whilst room was smaller than expected it was very clean and modern. Wifi was free and great signal which was important to me but what made my stay worthwhile was the food. Haven't seen such a nice room service menu for quire some time.  Will be back!  Great location for tourists looking to get close to the Palace and lots more, Nice part of London.",4,2014,04,25
121,Superb hotel,"We stayed at St. James' Court for two nights. The staff were extremely friendly, attentive and helpful. The reception area is beautiful and a pianist played each night in the bar area. The room was excellent and much bigger than we expected. In terms of location, this hotel is hard to beat. It is a short walk from Buckingham Palace in one direction, and Westminster Abbey in the other. It is also a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station, which is convenient if you are flying out of Gatwick, as the Gatwick Express runs from Victoria. It is two minutes walk from St.James Underground Station, which is on the Circle and District line. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,04,25
121,Theatre Break,"Booked a night here for a theatre break in London. 

The location is really good for theatres in the Victoria area (we were seeing Wicked).

The room was a really good size and the bathroom was pretty amazing.  All amenities were recently renewed and the beds a exceptionally comfortable. 

Didn't use any of the hotels other services, though I can imagine that the courtyard is particularly good in the summer.  We didn't have the breakfast as like most hotels, it was overpriced.  There is a decent Pret just around the corner.",5,2014,04,24
121,Weekend visit,"A fantastic 2 days stay. From the minute we arrived the service, staff and quality of the public area impressed. Room was clean, well decorated and well equipped. All requests to staff were dealt with quickly and politely. Great express checkout. No queues. Located in central london near many tourist spots. Considering the high standard of hotel, great value",5,2014,04,23
121,"Great location, friendly staff & modern hotel.","Stayed here from April 18th - 20th with my partner to celebrate a birthday occasion.  Emailed the hotel previously to ask for one of the recently refurbished rooms facing the courtyard if possible and stated it was a birthday occasion - I received a friendly email back stating my request has been noted and they would arrange complimentary cake for our arrival.  We arrived at 9am due to our early morning flight and couldn't check in until later but was told our room had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise!  We left our bags with the friendly concierge, booked a restaurant request with him for dinner and returned later in the afternoon to our room ready to go to and our restaurant request booked.  Nearest tube station St James' Park only a 5 minute walk away.  Location is absolutely superb - 5 minute walk also from Buckingham Palace.  Plenty pubs and cafe restaurants nearby - recommend the Italian ristorante on the corner opposite the hotel, full english breakfast for £5.. modern looking restaurant next door was £6 for 2 teas and 2 croissants!  The room was beautiful and very modern.  Comfy beds, great view, modern facilities, good choice of tv channels - speakers in the bathroom connecting to the tv which was great for listening to music in the shower!  Complimentary chocolate coffee birthday cake was waiting for us in the room which was a lovely touch.
Staff were extremely friendly and courteous at all times, always saying hello and welcoming you to and from the hotel.  Great value for money also.  Could write so much more commending the hotel on all the positive aspects - there is too much to say!  Had an excellent stay and would love to return in the future.  Only slight downside was that the shower was not as powerful as I had hoped but this really wasn't a big problem!  Also couldn't find any book or guide in the room describing the facilities of the hotel which is usually found hidden in a drawer somewhere - would be nice to have this explaining how to use the facilities, particularly the shower which some people may find confusing to begin with.  Everything else amazing though - thank you to all the staff who made such an impression on us!",5,2014,04,22
121,Fur coat and no panties...,"I  booked this hotel due to its 4 minute walk from our central offices.  I was looking forward to trialing the hotel as a new location and possibly a future home for our Leeds team visiting the city.

I walked in and the hotel seemed very warm and glamourous as it had represented its self on the website and was pleased.

I checked in and was allocated room 259. I arrived on my floor which is initially decorated to a high standard but this deteriorated as I got closer to my room and it felt like I stepped back 20 years...

I opened the door and was so shocked but I needed to attend a meeting so took a number of pictures and went straight back down to reception to show them, advise of my upset and she advised she would reallocate me and apoligised.  It was particulary unclean and also I had seen this hotel online and felt it wasnt reflective of the standard they seemed to be portraying.

She advised she would move me to room 258, gave me a new card and I left it in her hands to arrange for my things to be moved.

On return I found I had been moved to the same level of room but slightly larger and this one didnt overlook a building site!

It has very old decor and I felt very disappointed that my upset had resulted in them chosing to move me to more of the same, marked carpets, broken window frames, dead flies...

I was just very tired so decided to stay in this room as clearly I had got no where on my first visit to reception,

I stay in a range of hotels from budget to exclusive but this one is giving rooms that dont represent what they are trying to portray.  Just even little things like someone's milk and yoghurt is left in the fridge!  The red wine is also in there...

Also a chap knocked on my door to replace the fitting as there is a window handle missing of one of the windows!!!

So I am guessing I have been sold a 2nd class room but we paid full rate and so I feel that this hotel is being very unfair not offering these rooms at a lesser rate as I would rather stay at a cleaner more modern budget place.

I have attached photos so you can see what I mean...",2,2014,04,22
121,Outstanding,"Perfect from start to finish. Prior to our arrival I had a conversation with the official Twitter account for the hotel where I jokingly said I look forward to receiving an Easter egg in our room as we stayed on Good Friday; upon arrival not only did I find an Easter egg in our room but we were also upgraded too. What a brilliant start to our stay in London. 

The room was brilliant; spacious, king-size bed, lovely bathroom and TV with multiple channels (even had Sky Sports and BT Sport). The quality of sleep was great, the only interruption I incurred was my toothache but little the hotel can do about that!!

The hotel itself is situated a 5-10 minute walk from Victoria Station, we walked to the hotel from here, and 3 minutes from St. James' tube station. At the top of the road is Buckingham Palace too. 

I made good use of the gym facility too which had a range of equipment and facilities to undertake my regular workout. 

The customer service from all staff encountered was second to none. 

I stayed in this hotel previously and the standards remain exceptional. I will certainly return in August after a little trip to Paris.",5,2014,04,22
121,Fantastic Location,"The location of the hotel is truly wonderful, we were able to walk everywhere. The entrance and foyer is very impressive and the staff gave us a very warm welcome. The only downside was our room was very dated and tired looking, but have to say it was extremely clean. The Breakfast was wonderful with everything you could wish for. Throughout our stay the staff were very helpful, professional and friendly. Enjoyed going back in the evening after a busy day and relaxing with a nice bottle of wine while listening to the pianist twinkle on the ivories. Can highly recommend, look forward to a return visit and hopefully get one of the recently refurbished rooms.",4,2014,04,20
121,Comfortable stay,"Some friends and I stayed for four nights in early April.  All of us were very comfortable with our rooms and the hotel amenities. The room I had was clean, elegant, and well-maintained.  The concierge and front desk staff were courteous and helpful.  I also enjoyed the buffet breakfast and dinner at Bistro 51.  The hotel was well-located for our tourist activities.  Would highly recommend.",5,2014,04,19
121,Wonderful,"It is a great hotel. We were a group of seven people (teenagers included) and we all enjoyed our staying there. Big and clean rooms and really friendly staff. Breakfast was excellent. Great location too, we walked everywhere. We will definitely repeat when visiting London again.",5,2014,04,18
121,Mary Poppins - Practically perfect in every way!!!!,"Attended last weekend as my brother was completing marathon, had been concerned about a previous  trip advisor review citing noise so contacted the hotel prior to visit. Location was amazing and the atmosphere really positive. They really looked after the runners, providing food / beverages and offers for massage in the well being centre. 
The experience from start to finish was first class. The lady who checked us in was charming (herself a trainee) nothing too much trouble. Both rooms were upgraded free of charge, experienced none of the concerns cited by others on here. The Bank restaurant does not open sunday so as brother was recovering had food offer in the bar area - duck hoisin wraps and chicken tikka plate both excellent presentation and taste. There is still improvement work being done ( I was intrigued by the 2 elephants and rolls of carpet next to the courtyard), but this is publicised by the elevators and I feel that anyone who experiences any issues should raise them at the time and I have every confidence they will be resolved.  I really wanted the weekend to be perfect and it was, we had so much fun that we managed to leave an item in the room.
We contacted housekeeping and they are posting it to us another example of them going that extra mile. The whole team are working really hard to make this hotel fantastic - how many other hotels  take the time to reply to all the reviews??? 
Give it a go - its not the cheapest - I had to save up for the 2 night stay but I was made to feel so special that it was good value, only regret is that I did not have time to experience the michelin restaurant which looked superb
Many thanks guys for a fabulous weekend",5,2014,04,17
121,Very very nice!,First class hotel with outstanding service. Will defiinitly stay there again when visiting London. Walking distance to most everything. Very close to Westminster Abby. Great breakfast. Extremely nice people. Outstanding Indian Resturant two doors down. Ask for room facing courtyard if available and away from construction. We did and it was very quite. Wish we could have spent more time in our room. ,5,2014,04,15
121,Good location - a little pricy,Took the Bus #24 from the Euston Tube Station - easiest and most cost effective way to get there - attended London for the Marathon - and attended through Marathon tours --was a fair bit pricey - that may be the hotel or the tour company - I suspect was a little of both -  check in was smooth and did get in a little earlier than check in time - room a little small - and in a separate building with a lift that would hold only two people with a suitcase - so the 8 floors could take a while if folks were waiting -- bathroom had larger tub which was great - water pressure was pretty good so showers were fine - bed - not comfortable and the pillows were horrendous -- the room was clean and tidy - the staff very polite and professional - breakfast was included in our tour and had both cold options and hot  -  eggs cooked to order -- Buckingham palace just a 3 minute walk away -- when leaving London had to travel to Kings Cross/ St Pancreas - best bet from that location is the 10 min walk to Green Park and take the Piccadilly line -- no stairs only so was good for luggage -- also if you are planning any travel seriously consider getting an oyster card for the tube and don't forget to get your 5 pound deposit back at Kings Cross before you go -- am thinking perhaps just got a bad bed with the  room -- otherwise if costs were down a bit would stay there again  but not at the rate I paid,3,2014,04,15
121,"""Great location""",This was a great location for our visit to London.  Close to many historical sites.  Also short walk to Buckingham palace.  Beautiful courtyard. Staff very helpful and friendly.   Food was good. Our room was spacious and comfortable beds.  Sitting area with a great view. Would definitely book this hotel again.  Was a very good value.,5,2014,04,14
121,Average hotel and bit overpriced,"Nice hotel near many companies.  Rooms are small and A/C does not work well, but that could have been due to the weather changing.
Staff offered internet package with Exec Floor, but at Checkout it was on the bill.  The manager addressed it, but be aware.
Overall nice hotel.",3,2014,04,13
121,A regal stay in London,"I had stayed here before this  was a Taj Hotel and was afraid the quality had changed. It did change... for better!
 The hotel is beautiful, with a very British entrance and the room was very good on the top floor with a king bed, marvellous pillows (you even have the pillow menu if you need a special one), robe, slippers, coffee and tea with biscuits available. Free wifi, a large bathroom with nice toiletries and a good black out curtain made this stay even better than last year. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful Being welcomed by Cristina at the front desk upon our arrival made us feel treated like royalty. 
The hotel is near Buckingham and you can walk everywhere or if you prefer you can take the underground from St.James or Victoria station.
English breakfast is very good and not just the typical buffet. They bring you orange juice, tea or coffee and toast at your table. And you can order a different kind of eggs or fruit than those displayed in the buffet.
I will certainly return again.",5,2014,04,13
121,Comfortable and convenient,Well located and really comfortable. Rooms were small but very well appointed and more than adequate for a short stay. A special deal made the hotel good value for money. It was easy to relax in the bar late into the evening post theatre. Staff very accommodating. Only criticism is that breakfast was overpriced and not worth the £24 charge.,4,2014,04,12
121,The only place we stay in London,"We've stayed here three times, all before and after Princess cruises.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else. It's all about location, location, location, convenience, and great service and staff.  We travel light and carry or roll our luggage, so we can take the bus or train in from the airport and walk from Victoria Station (about 10 minutes).  There are lots of convenient, inexpensive places - cafes, pubs and takeouts - in the area for meals, transit is convenient, or we walk everywhere.  We save a lot of money that way.  There's a great pub on the corner and, when my husband needed a minor medical consultation, the helpful concierge referred us to a National Health clinic just down the street.  We felt comfortable going out for walks in the evening around the neighbourhood.",5,2014,04,11
121,Location and comfort in the heart of London,"Stayed her for seven days in March, ideal location for exploring London, easy access to public transport, very friendly and helpful staff.
The room was comfortable, service excellent and bars convivial and breakfast in the restaurant very good.
Good eateries close by. Very convenient for the Queen Elizabeth Convention Centre.",5,2014,04,10
121,In need of a makeover...,"Both my partner and I stayed here on Monday 7th April for the one night. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very happy doorman - who offered to take our bag, but we politely declined. The foyer was beautiful, breathtaking infact. We were then greeted by a very well dressed, incredibly friendly lady, who took us over to a seated area to get checked in. After we had checked in and been given our room key we made our way to the lifts (all good so far).
 Leaving the lift was like walking through a time warp - the hotel is badly in need of an update, the carpets seemed dull, as did the walls, and the walkways in general. The hotel room was no better (room 580), parts of the wallpaper was lifting in places, the carpet seemed dirty, the lampshades looked as if they had been knocked (were at a tilt), and the bathroom didn't seem as clean as could have been.

Overall - The customer service was 2nd to none, the lady who checked us in was fantastic. However, the hotel could do with a makeover, as it definitely is in need! All in all we were disappointed with this hotel, had we have paid the full price listed through Booking.com I would have been mortified (£495) , however, we paid £119, whcih for a bog standard hotel in London is ok (although this is meant to be 4*).",2,2014,04,10
121,Great facilities but rooms very underwhelming,"The location is great and near the palace so very accesible to the Royal Parks and shopping of Oxford Street and Knightsbridge. 

Communal areas very plushly laid out on the ground floor but once you go up in the lifts decor and rooms are very drab and in desparate need of updating.  Very disapointing.  

Try and avoid the 1st floor also as the tube line runs directly above and every 2 mins it felt like there was an earthquake in the room with the room rattling!  Not great for a good nights sleep.

Would i stay again?  No, there are far more better, cheaper 4 & 5* hotels in London.",3,2014,04,09
121,Thin veneer of opulence like dodgy laminate over rotting floor,"I hate writing bad reviews, I really do. But there is very little good to say about this hotel beyond its impressive lobby, with gilt and marble and lots of concierges (not that that, either, is necessarily a good thing, but it is remarkable).

We had booked two rooms, simultaneously, on the one booking, paying once, on one credit card with one confirmation (you get the idea...). So it was a little odd to be asked ""do you want to have the rooms near each other?"" and then when we said yes please to be told ""well that's not really possible. We didn't know you were coming together"". Eh?? After much agonising by the receptionist one of our rooms was moved so we were at least on the same floor, which was nice. Unfortunately the room we were moved to was already occupied with someone else's belongings (an American couple, judging by the flight tags). No bother, said the reception desk, they would be removed post-haste by one of the many concierges I mentioned earlier. 40 minutes later, fed up with waiting, we went out. If that was my luggage, left in the custody of strangers I would have been livid.

The room was small but perfectly adequate. I didn't really appreciate the mouldy, peeling wallpaper (see photo) or the permanently out of order air conditioning, but to be honest I couldn't face another failed room move. It had a bed, and some sort of shower (minimal water, mostly boiling. It may be fair to say my judgement was a little clouded by this point).

We were offered a complimentary paper. I'm hoping the American couple got it with their luggage, as we certainty didn't. This is a little petty to say the least, as I wouldn't have asked for a paper usually, but having been offered it just seemed to highlight the disorganisation of the place.

Breakfast was shocking. For the price you would expect something vaguely edible. In fact, even it was free I'd have expected better. The 'hot' food was not, at all, and I doubt very much that the sausages bear much relation to actual pork. Tasteless, dry and cold. Yummy. I've had better food in a Little Chef, for slightly less money.

The saving grace of the place (dragging the hotel into ""poor"" rather than ""terrible"") were the breakfast staff, who were polite and attentive, and a chap (possibly called Manuel?) at checkout who was very helpful.

It irritates me that hotels in London think they can charge a fortune just because they're in London. The hotel is brilliantly situated, but you couldn't get me to stay here again if you paid me. Sorry.",2,2014,04,08
121,Wonderful Experience,"We booked this hotel as it was near to the Victoria Theatre and what a wonderful find, from the moment we arrived until we left all members of staff were helpful.
We got out of our taxi to be greeted by a porter who took our bags and gave us a tag, we checked in at reception early, our room was not ready which we did not expect anyway, the tag we had been given was put our booking form so that our bag would be put in our room while we were at the theatre.
Whilst checking in the receptionist asked was it a special visit and we said that it was a treat for my birthday (which was that day) to find when we went to our room after an afternoon at the theatre I had a card and chocolates from the management what a wonderful surprise.
Breakfast was wonderful so much to choose from and on checking out again we were asked if we wished to leave  our bags for collection later without having to ask if we could.
We will definitely go back to this hotel and I would recommend it.",5,2014,04,08
121,Great Overnight In Central London," My husband and I enjoyed a lovely overnight stay at St. James Court. We arrived on an early morning, overnight flight and were grateful that our room was ready on check-in. I would recommend requesting an internal-facing room. Ours was at the back of the hotel adjacent to some loud construction work. Enjoyable experience overall!  ",5,2014,04,08
121,Fabulous Hotel!,"We stayed at the St James Court for 5 nights and it was a wonderful experience - the staff was friendly and responsive, the rooms were fresh and clean, and the location was absolutely perfect for tourists visitng London.  It is a quick walk to the St James Park Underground as well as short walk to Victoria Station.  Located just round the corner from Buckingham Palace, and we could see the spires of Westminster Abbey as well as Big Ben from our window!  Easy walk to the heart of all things tourist about London!  This trip was our 16-yr old grand daughter's 16th birthday celebration during spring break week - our suite easily accomodated the 3 of us, with a separate sleeping area for her.  Several restraurants very close to the hotel offered good variety - and Starbucks just down the street opposite the St James Park Underground station - how convenient!  This hotel is worth every cent it costs to stay - we will return here again if we ever get a chance!",5,2014,04,08
121,"Wonderful welcome, fantastic staff, great hotel","Thank you for a wonderful, stress free stay, your hospitality from the moment we arrived was outstanding, your reception staff could not have been more helpful and curtious, our room was upgraded free of charge as a simple good will gesture and the stay was a very comfortable enjoyable one.. We rate you and your hotel highly, thank you and we will return.. Dispite the obvious construction, but hey these things need to happen in order to maintain the standard.",5,2014,04,07
121,First impressions!!,"Upon arrival at the hotel i thought yep really nice looking hotel and also thought the same in the lobby to book in.
The staff were very polite and courteous.
Basically upon entering our room it was not at all good.
Size of room ok but the decor was dated the carpet was worn out and also where they had taken the bedside lamps from the wall they had covered the holes over with a bit of filler.Nice!!
Probably should have complained as soon as i got there but was to busy to do so.
Complained in there morning and was told they can't seem to be able to refurbish rooms all at one time.
Anyway if you are staying avoid room 573.also a bit of a hike to get to your room.
Would have marked this hotel higher but for the tired and worn out room.",3,2014,04,07
121,Beautiful hotel. Tired room !!,Great service through start to finish. We only stayed one night and our deal included breakfast only to be told it didnt. Not sure if this was the hotels fault or the company we booked through. We stayed on the 7th floor at the rear of the hotel and must say that felt a tad disappointed as the room looked in need of updating and the coridoor areas look tired too. The bed was comfy though and the shower worked like a dream. The location of this hotel was great too,4,2014,04,07
121,Great!,"My Mum & I stayed here as a special treat before my wedding. I'd thoroughly recommend the hotel, service was good and we were given a complimentary upgrade on check in to an Executive Suite which was a great room - plenty of space and a lovely view of the courtyard.

The hotel is in a fabulous location close to Buckingham Palace & St James Park but also within a 5 minute walk of St James Park tube station if you want to travel further afield.

Unfortunately there was an issue with a leak in our room (completely out of the hotels control!) but it was dealt with very well (and quickly!) and we were able to move to an alternative room with no hassle at all.

All in all, a beautiful hotel which was perfect for our weekend away!",5,2014,04,07
121,GREAT LOOKING HOTEL TILL YOU GET TO THE ROOM!,"Ok, so just because we manage to get a cheap offer for this hotel at £127, does that mean we get put into a small pokey tired room?  That's what we had.  Apart from that, the hotel is great.  Attentive staff, friendly, good ambiance.
Would only go back because of location.",4,2014,04,06
121,"Highly recommend this lovely hotel in great, central location.","I booked this hotel when it was still a Crowne Plaza property. It has changed hands and is now a Taj Hotel. Can't compare what it was like before but can only say that I am loving this place. A lovely, relaxing lobby to have cocktails or coffee with friends. Great, friendly service from front desk and concierge. Spacious, clean rooms with nice amenities. And you are within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminister Abbey and the Embankment. St James tube station about a block away and a short walk to Victoria Station. I would highly recommend. ",5,2014,04,06
121,Excellent service and at a sensible price for London!,"We stayed overnight here on my Wife's birthday and from start to finish were very impressed. The staff were all very friendly and efficient and upgraded us because of my Wife's birthday. We also received a complimentary cake in the room. The hotel was very clean and the bar area really nice. An excellent location as well, close to Buckingham Palace etc.",5,2014,04,04
121,Huge improvement in the hotel in the last 2 years,"The emphasis is on the ""huge"". Most hotel rooms in London tend to be pokey and small (tends to go with the heritage status) and you almost expect Jeeves to pop out any moment ! However, this property has improved tremendously after a refurbishment. Rooms seem bigger and brighter (the bigger may have been an optical illusion, but I doubt it). When you can do a push up without knocking tables or banging your head, you know it is the correct size.The reception looks contemporary (with a large Paresh Maity painting, to boot) and the property looks more professional. The breakfast room also seems cheerier. My only other meal was a box lunch (I was at a conference in the hotel) about which the less said the better. Most of you will not face the same ordeal. Of course, the views are of such interesting sights as the plumbing and spiral staircases. I could write a book about British pumbing thanks to the great views from hotel rooms  in the past but we will leave that for another time. I would say that this property now represents great value given its location and quality of the experience.",4,2014,04,03
121,A Hotel of Two Halves,"This is a good choice for a London stay if you can get it around the £160 a night mark. 

positives:- lots of in house dining and drinking options. An interesting area of central London, with lots of major sights walkable but not too many other hotels nearby. Pleasant service. Adequate room. Notably nice boutique with reasonably priced Indian clothes, fabrics, trinkets, etc.

Negatives:- Poor soundproofing, despite double glazing. The hotel bar is basically in a corridor with a constant of flow of people passing in an out through an exterior door ( not nice on a chilly evening). The receptionist did not have an adequate command of English, leading to a mix up over the room. Rumble in the room from the District line Underground passing below. 

Be aware that, while the front rooms of the hotel seem to have been recently refurbished, the rear ones haven't, making them look rather tired by comparison.",4,2014,04,02
121,lovely place,"My husband and I found a great deal for the St. James Court Hotel on Expedia and enjoyed our stay from start to finish.  Claudio at the desk gave us a warm welcome and, even though we arrived a bit before check in time, gave us keys to an executive room (an upgrade) that was all ready for us.  
The room was elegant, fresh and clean.  Kind of strange aside, but it smelled really nice, too.  I think that was the bath products.  The bed was comfy.  We had free wifi, plus U.S. outlets.  
The courtyard is beautiful; if it hadn't been cold and rainy during our visit, it would have been a great spot for happy hour.  We had breakfast included in our package.  It was very good, served in one of their restaurants (I think there are 3 or 4, including a Michelin-starred one).  Lots of stuff to choose from.
The location of the hotel is great, right near Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace, within walking distance of: Victoria Station, Parliament, the Churchill War Rooms, Trafalgar Square, Fortnum & Mason, and Westminster Abbey.  
I don't know whether we could have afforded our stay here without the Expedia deal, but we definitely recommend it.",5,2014,03,31
121,A wondeful short break at the St James Court,"We stayed here for a weekend break in London. It's perfectly situated for sightseeing being around the corner from Buckingham Palace. The lobby is stunning and the staff attentive without being too intrusive. The piano bar with a cocktail is a great way to spend and evening and the Quilon restaurant is a must.
We were upgraded on arrival which was a great plus (many thanks to the hotel for doing that). Our rooms was modern and spacious. The bed was luxurious and we both slept soundly. Our bathroom was large and again modern and well finished.
This would be my first choice when staying in london again",5,2014,03,31
121,Shame for a luxury brand,"I stayed just one night during march. As many of the other reviews have pointed, the lobby is quite a very nice, stylished and charming area of the hotel, but it stars and ends just there. And it started with the wrong foot for me, since when I arrived at the hotel and asked about my room at the front desk, they could not find any reservation under my name beacause in their system it was booked for the same day but one month later (I had to show my printed confirmation, and still they tried to make me wait for my room beacause of their problem with their reservation system).
The hotel itself is a massive victorian construction with lots of rooms, spread in different wings, with very old windy, irregular and weird corridors. I was given a room which was situated in one of the old and not updated wings of the hotel. Really really dissapointed. The room was just next to a maintenance room so I was bother by different noices during the night, really awful. I have to do justice to the bed that was the nice soft and proper touch for this ""classy"" hotel, but nevertheless bathroom flooded after take a shower, furniture almost aching (because of the lack of proper renovation), and the list may continue. Breakfast was not great for the hotel level, it was not really varied in choices (fruits, cold cuts, pastries, etc). Location good, but not for a memorable stay in London (If it's your first time in the city, you can save time being in the area, close to major attractions).
Really dissapointing and a shame for a brand like Taj Hotels. I habe to recognized the care and consideration of its staff, after complained for the bad experience I think was the front desk manager, who appologized for this and put 60 pounds of credit on my credit card. 
I would only recommend the renovated rooms, only if they are what the brand published on their web site, but I truly think that nothing at the hotel works in a level of excellence.",2,2014,03,29
121,Amazing!!,"Booked this hotel for my wife's 30th Birthday, we were early to arrive so just checked our bags in so we could go and enjoy London. Upon our return we found we had been upgraded to an amazing room and even had a birthday cake waiting for us which was a lovely touch! Every member of staff we came across couldn't do enough for us. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer! ",5,2014,03,29
121,"Glad to have stayed at London's newest luxe hotel, by Taj!","Glad to have checked-in today at London's newest luxe hotel !! The St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, is a Great London Luxe Biz hotel !! It has great Location, Fabulous Service, Delicious food in breakfast, lunch, evening snacks & drinks, and dinner ! It offers free Internet access, super-quick laundry & shoe-shine, very good and comfortable rooms with enough & more electrical sockets/pins for multiple devices, and a great Spa + Gym ! 

The valets, housekeeping & front-desk staff, bell-boys, concierges, and all else are great, led by a very competent GM - Mr. Digvijay Sinh ! 

Loved the 5-night stay ! We got an upgrade too !",5,2014,03,28
121,"Nice hotel, great location, smallish room","The hotel was very nice in a fantastic location. The closest tube station is Green Park, but Victoria is walkable. The hotel itself is beautiful. For the price, however, I found my double room to be small and minimalistic. I realise that this is London, but the price point was such that a larger room would have been expected. Or, a reduced price would be appropriate for the smaller rooms. The breakfast buffet was fine though the rapidity of service for beverages was lacking. All in all, I would stay here again for the location, if the price were right.",4,2014,03,27
121,Superb position,"The hotel has friendly and efficient staff, it has a peaceful atmosphere (despite refurbishment going on!) and is spotlessly clean.  It is a great base to explore London from, 5 minutes stroll to Buckingham Palace and St James' Park, very near Westminster, Piccadilly etc etc..",5,2014,03,27
121,Great location but not a great hotel.,"
Please be aware that there is currently extensive refurbishment taking place at this hotel that doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.
My wife and I stayed in room 577 at the St James Court hotel overnight, Saturday 22nd to Sunday 23rd March 2014. This was to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday.
Overall the stay was acceptable, however I was not happy with having to walk through a building site on the 5th floor every time we left the room. It was only on the Sunday that a member of staff gave us directions to a very small lift at the rear of the hotel which took us down to the gym and spa area, therefore by passing the building area.
Also, we were awoken at 6am on the Sunday morning by water pouring through the ceiling of the bathroom in our room. The water was coming through a light fitting and an air vent - which seems quite dangerous to me.
This lasted for some two hours - by which time there was a lot of dirty water in the bath. I reported this to the hotel and somebody from maintenance did attend briefly before leaving to investigate the source of the water. He did not return and we were never informed of the cause of the problem.
I did mention the problem to the receptionist as we were leaving, however they seemed to be completely unaware of any problem.
Both of these problems did take the shine off our 'special' weekend - and the hotel did not live up to  our expectations.
",2,2014,03,27
121,"Great location, service, and value!","We booked a room through Expedia and could not have been happier with the hotel. The location was great. It is just a few blocks from the St. James Park tube station, which made it easy to get around and to/from the airport. The room was a good size for Europe, staff was very friendly, and the breakfast was good. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2014,03,27
121,"Great Location, Great Staff","Stayed here for one night as my daughter was receiving an award in St James Palace. Excellent location, short walk to both palaces in one direction, pleasant stroll to Westminster and the Thames in the other. The hotel reception area is very impressive. Our room was well equipped and a good size, bathroom was very clean and modern, beds very comfy. What makes this hotel is the staff, from reception to Spa, all the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. The concierge staff were brilliant, especially Fred Suaiso, who went out of his way to help. Would definitely recommend this hotel for business and pleasure.",5,2014,03,26
121,Impressive,I have been in this hotel for a fam trip and it was great! The staff is really really friendly and the breakfast buffet was delicious. You should definitely check out the restaurant Quilon which belongs to the Hotel. High class Indian food! The hotel and the restaurant are both a place to visit again!,5,2014,03,25
121,Pleasant stay,"Stayed for 2 nights at the Taj St James last weekend. Not a good start as we were given room 823( which doesn't exist according to sign as you get out of lift) it is as far away from the lift as you could possibly  be. When we eventually found the room it wasn't a king sized bed as booked it was a twin. A long walk back to reception and we had to wait in the queue again at reception. I asked the concierge if they could help and we were asked to speak to reception. We were then approached by a lovely guy from concierge don't know his name but he had a lighter beige suite on and had just started working at the hotel. He asked us how he could help and asked us to go back to the room and he would contact us. Long long walk back to room but he then called us and had arranged another room upgraded to  a refurbished room on a lower floor. After this initial problem our stay was great. Very good location and the new room was very nice. Breakfast on first day in the restaurant on the ground floor was busy but adequate, there are a lot of tables squashed together. On the Sunday due to a lot of guests all arriving for breakfast at the same time we were taken to another restaurant on the first floor which was a much nicer and relaxing  experience. Overall we enjoyed our stay and thoroughly enjoyed having drinks in the hotel in the bar near to reception. Bar staff deserve a mention as they were very friendly and provided an excellent service.",4,2014,03,25
121,Great Location In A Quiet Neighborhood,"We were impressed from our  cheek in with your Front Of House Mgr. Mr.Sikka . He made us feel so welcomed. They also have an excellent Concierge Staff headed  by Binoy Nair. We had trouble with our cell phone so he made reservatuions found us tickets,and he would send a confermation too our room. One night we needed a restaurant near Ronnie Scotts Jazz Club.  So Binoy really made our evening. He made reservations at The Criterion Restaurant. This restaurant will take you back in time with gold and marble alongside mosaics, mirrors and plaques. Ahd too our surprise he had them send us a complimentry glass of Champagne.The food and service were outstanding. Binoy goes above and beyond in guest service. The room we had was a king overlooking a court yard. Also this hotel is in a gerat neighborhood.No noise from lots of traffic. You are several minutes from the tube and about ten to fifteen to walk to Westminster. Would like to say kudos to the entire staff",5,2014,03,24
121,weekend treat,"Booked a 2 night stay on room only. location was very good, just a few minutes from Buck House, reception looked impressive, very warm welcome, room was fairly small but that was the only issue, we were made to feel very welcome and would recommend this hotel.",4,2014,03,24
121,Fantastic Hotel,"We booked in this hotel as part of a 2 night theatre break.  The location is superb especially for the theatres in Victoria (5 minute walk), a short stroll to Westminster one way and Buckingham Palace the other.  We were upgraded to a recently refurbished room on the 7th floor, very comfortable with quality fittings.  The staff were fantastic from the doorman, reception and waiting staff - all extremely friendly and polite - we have not experienced friendlier staff anywhere.  Superb breakfast great choice buffet and eggs, etc. to order.  Would definitely visit again",5,2014,03,24
121,CLAUDIO :),"We arrived at this stunning hotel,greeted with a warm welcome from reception, we went to one of our rooms booked as my mother and cousin were staying aswell,unfortunately there was a problem with the room and Claudio on the reception desk sorted it out very efficently and very quickly, nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded - we were both moved so we could have rooms near each other, the rooms we were given were beautiful, very comfortable and had everything which we needed, very clean and very comfortable beds and very quiet when sleeping . there was even a fresh flower in the bathroom which was a very special touch . Thankyou Claudio you made it very special for us .",5,2014,03,24
121,Comfortable hotel in good location,"We stayed here in March 2014 for two nights but know the hotel well. It has recently been taken over by the Taj group but it is still the luxurious hotel it was under Intercontinental. Ideally situated just off Victoria St, close to St James underground and within walking distance of Victoria station it is a very comfortable, well appointed hotel. The staff are very helpful and eager to please.  Bedrooms are spacious, very clean with all the amenities you would expect. We have stayed in a number of different rooms and found them all to be the same good standard. The concierge service is excellent. Did not use the spa or pool.",5,2014,03,24
121,Totally Disappointed,I booked this hotel for my parents who are seniors mainly because of the free wifi in the rooms. My parents just arrived today and i was informed there is no wifi in the rooms!!! I even booked them a classic king room to make their stay comfortable. I tried contacting reservations prior to their stay but got no reply after my first inquiry. I should have known this hotel would suck in service. False advertisement. Wifi only in lobby area. How do you expect seniors to keep on staying at your lobby since your hotel doesnt provide wifi in the rooms. You must at least have a wifi router installed in the rooms if you advertise there is wifi in your rooms! ,1,2014,03,23
121,perfect,when we arived to the hotel at the reception we met inga.the best and the nicest girl in the hotel.she gave us a very nice room with new fernitures.we stay 4 nights and for sure we'll come back soon as possible.the room are clean.the location is perfect.200 m' from the palace and the underground.the staff was very helpful and friendly.,5,2014,03,23
121,Great location and rooms,"This is a really good hotel with a great location in a distinguished British building. Walking distance to Victoria station- 10min.
Rooms are clean, spacious, modern and comfortable. Only disappointment: poor breakfast in a small room at the back of the lobby!",4,2014,03,23
121,Enjoyable stay,"Another pleasant stay at the St James Court.
The hotel is very convenient for visiting London and within easy walking distance of many of the favourite landmarks. It is also close to 3 tube stations and a mainline station,
The hotel is modern and contemporary and suited for business or pleasure.
There is a good selection of restaurants within the hotel and if you want something special the Quilon is a few yards away.
The hotel is very has very comfortable and relaxing public areas.
The rooms are well furnished and the beds are very comfortable. My roomm was aslo very quiet although the hotel is in the centre of London.
Highly recommended.",4,2014,03,22
121,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"Stayed for a couple of nights on a short visit to go to a couple of shows and was very impressed. We were upgraded to a lovely big corner room which was well-appointed and very comfortable. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. Courtyard of the hotel is stunning and I would love to go again in warmer weather when I could make more use of it.",5,2014,03,22
121,Central London,"Great location for an overnight in London. Nice bar area, friendly staff.
There will be a little noise from the underground trains but not really a problem unless you are a very light sleeper. Ask for a room up the building maybe!",4,2014,03,21
121,Disappointing for a Taj,"At first glance, the St.James is stunning. Unfortunately, the visual does not carry through to the service. When we checked in, I was pleasantly greeted and checked in. My colleague, however, was told they couldn't find his reservation (which had been made with mine). I showed the receptionist the confirmation from the booking agency and the confirmation numbers from the St James hotel itself. She told me I had to call the booking agency to sort it out. I told her this was unacceptable since I had confirmed everything even getting their confirmation numbers. She went into a back room and when she returned she indicated she would reinstate the reservation. Since I had the written proof, I don't know why she continued to refuse to accommodate us. Poor! They then tried to charge my colleague again for the prepaid room. Very aggravating. I did call the booking agency and they called the hotel directly to confirm my information as being correct. I've never gotten this type of attitude from a high end hotel. The next morning at checkout, they again tried to charge my colleague and that charge is still pending. 
I got a good rate which may be due to a renovation in progress. I had booked a ""Classic King Room"" and got two twin bed moved together and overlooking construction. Bistro Restaurant a gem. All others were very pleasant and helpful. The men's spa was substandard for a luxury hotel. Good thing I was only there for one night. Not up to the reputation of Taj hotels.",2,2014,03,19
121,A delightful base for a long weekend,"We were fortunate indeed to discover this superb hotel - a 'grand old lady' that has recently been transformed and metamorphosed into a contemporary establishment ideally suited for business or pleasure purposes. Although situated close to some of the busiest areas of the West End the hotel enjoys a relatively peaceful location yet remains within easy walking distance of many of the main tourist places of interest including Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Horseguards, St James Park, Green Park. Transport links are excellent.
From the moment we passed through the main portal we were immediately impressed by the standard of the staff who were all courteous, immaculately presented and eager to assist at all times. Our room offered all the features, and more, expected in a modern hotel and in our experience there can be few better oases to which one would want to retire after a busy day of work or sightseeing.
When next returning to London this will be our first port of call.",5,2014,03,19
121,lovely few nights stay!,"Came here for 2 nights, it was lovely!
Check in was ok, at first the receptionist said we was not booked in then eventually found us on the system.
We was not happy with our room as the veiw was building work and really noicey!
My boyfriend phoned down and asked if we could maybe change rooms they said they would ring back and let us know, we waited a hour for a phone call so my boyfriend phoned back down and they said they will phone us back so we waited a other half a hour then decided to unpack as we had a meal booked.
As we was going out a porter came to come to take our suitcases.. But we was not informed anything and this was 2 hours later!
Apart from that the room was lovely with a lovely bathroom!
The breakfast was nice with a choice of food.. You get served with tea/coffee and toast.
The staff was lovely but no english staff!!
The morning we was going home we ordered breakfast to the room.. It was amazing and everything we asked for.. There was no butter for the toast I rang down and they brought some up straight away!
We was'nt in the hotel much as we was site seeing & went to see shows in the evening but we would deffo return here but for a longer stay!!",4,2014,03,18
121,Lovely weekend,"We stayed at St James Court Hotel Friday to Sunday last weekend and from being met by the Concierge and being wished a safe journey home again our stay was lovely.  The location of the hotel is ideal for sightseeing, theatres, parks and shopping and underground stations nearby.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to stay again in the not too distant future.",5,2014,03,18
121,Birthday present,"We were welcomed by the concierge who opened the door and took our bags instantly. We have stayed in the hotel for two nights to rediscover London. Ideal situated with the Big Ben, Buckingham palace and the metro on walking distance. A spacious, clean and comfortable room which overlooked the courtyard, which was a pleasant surprise when you opened up your curtains in the morning. Very friendly helpful staff.",5,2014,03,18
121,Not really a luxury hotel,"Hotel extremely well located very close to many London's attractions and well served by the St James tube station. The staff is very nice and the breakfast is ok. In any event this Hotel cannot be considered a luxury one as the state in their website. I stayed in a comfort room, which was quite small with an extremely little and unconfortable bathroom. The prices are, as for any Hotel in London, definitely on the high side.",3,2014,03,18
121,Beautiful hotel however building work will wake you up!,"My boyfriend booked this as a 21st birthday treat for me and got a deal through booking theatre tickets so the price for our room was very good for a 4 star hotel in a great location of London. I was very pleased to find that we were only a 5/10 minute walk from the theatre and a short walk to nearby restaurants so thought this was such a great location. 
We arrived at 2pm to check in however our room wasn't ready so staff commented how they'd upgraded us which we thought was very kind of them. However we didn't know what we'd been upgraded to as we hadn't seen our previous room! 
Our room was lovely and clean (room 320) - the only downside was of our view into someone else's room! Everything about the room was great apart from being woken up Sunday morning from building work happening outside! 

Overall a great hotel - superb staff and distance from local attractions such as theatres and Buckingham Palace. Just be sure to ask for a room away from the building work if you like your sleep.",4,2014,03,17
121,"Wonderful old fashion building, with all modern luxury","I stayed for 2 nights, in a room overlooking the lovely courtyard, on the 2nd floor. Everything was to my expectations, clean, comfortable and nice bathroom with good amenities 
I must admit that the staff was absolutely superb, very professional, polite and at the same time friendly, both the ones from reception and the bar. 
Location is perfect, quiet area, 5 minutes’ walk to St. James Park tube, and Victoria Station also not far away.
I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,17
121,Thank A Taj will see you again real soon!,"Al most everything, the felicities of the hotel the staff and their making sure you have plenty of refills of orange juice and tea at breakfast each morning, the selection of breakfast was so great. The bathroom and bed were on the wrong side of the room, it was unsettling. It was the rooms structure really, having saying that, the view outside the room was of the garden, which had an unrivaled beauty :-) Thank A Taj will see you again real soon ha ha",4,2014,03,17
121,50th birthday,"Stopped 3 nights at hotel celebrating husband's 50th.
Stopped in room 705 which was nice size room.
Shower however was a big let down.  I  presume it was the water pressure.

I also originally booked 2 nights through booking.com
But decided to stay an extra night at a higher rate.

I received the invoice this morning nd was billed separately for breakfast.   Unfortunately I had no email before trip to prove when extra night booked I was told breakfast included.   I did attempt to sort with reception before I checked out but as their was no    email to prove I could not get reimbursed.

121,Love the Hotel but customer service falls short,"After problems with my previous two bookings, including room not being ready until nearly 4pm, no dvd player or late checkout as previously arranged & then being charged twice, I had been promised an upgrade on my next visit.  So despite e-mailing ahead, far from being upgraded, I was allocated 370 which was a very small room. Again, no dvd player as requested so had to wait for two visits from an engineer before I could relax. A very pleasant Stephanie booked me in & took my calls to reception but, despite repeatedly saying she hoped I would enjoy my stay, I did not feel listened to.   Despite confirming later checkout when booking & again by phone from my room we were still woken by housekeeping say we should have checked out by now!  So clearly I was right!!

I love the Hotel, it's beautiful & a perfect location needed for frequent visits by myself & partner. 
It is such a shame that the options that are offered on the website for someone like myself to organise personal touches to a stay are not adhered to....",4,2014,03,15
121,Value for money,"I stayed for 3 nights in a very good rate. I booked it from Agoda. Location is perfect, right next to Buckingham palace and very close to Victoria underground station.  There is free wifi connection, although is not good everywhere in the hotel area. Rooms are very clean and there is complementary water and tea in room.  
The are some things i would like to note though. Food quality in breakfast was not good at all. Although there are many renovated rooms in the hotel, we were given a non renovated room which was small. I suppose that this happened because we booked through Agoda in a low rate. We gave an amount for guarantee and during check out they did not return it back. 
Staff is very friendly and polite. 
I would stay there once more but i would assure the renovated room first. ",4,2014,03,15
121,"Beautiful hotel, great service and location","We stayed here as a couple in early January 2014 for 4 nights. It was a 10 minute walk from the Victoria station. Upon arriving, hotel staff were welcoming and the concierge gave us a room upgrade at no cost. Very nice! I think the city is less busy with tourists at this time of year. We had a lovely time having a drink and snack at the lobby bar. I had the squash soup and it was the best soup I've ever had. In fact, I ordered it twice more (room service) before leaving! All in all, a beautiful luxury hotel just a short walk from Buckingham Palace, as well as Westminster Abbey and Parliament, and Trafalgar is a few minutes further from there. There isn't a whole lot going on in the area surrounding the hotel, however. We would stay here again.",5,2014,03,14
121,Fantastic stay,"My Husband and i have stayed at this hotel several times but this is the first time since the hotel was taken over by the Taj group.
I have to say that from the moment we arrived the service was excellent. From the  reception desk to room service it was first class.
We had a suite, room 401 which was extremely spacious and modern. There was a very slight noise from the lift but it did not worry us at all.
We had breakfast in our room. It arrived promptly at 10am, as requested,  and was delicious and hot , which can be a trick for some hotels. 
I can't praise this hotel enough and look forward to visiting again very soon.",5,2014,03,14
121,relaxed attentive Excellent Hotel!,We had a one night stay here on 10/03/2014 a group of 5 of us and having used 5* hotels in the past we were all very pleased with this choice from arrival to check out and beyond the staff were diligent attentive friendly and helpful the rooms/suites were exactly right for us clean roomy and smart. All in all our stay was relaxing and leisurely and the staff went the extra mile! We will be recommending and staying again in the future. Well done and thank you to the management and staff that make this a far superior hotel.,5,2014,03,13
121,Smashing,"We had a really nice experience at this hotel. The staff were excellent, the facilities great and the room was very comfortable for the price in the centre of London. Tubes within 5 minutes to get you around London and within walking distance of many great sites.",5,2014,03,13
121,ok - but some points to mention,"Great are: the location (closest tube just some minutes of walk away), the staff (very friendly, attentive, professional), the atmosphere of the place in general, the rooms (but you'd expect that for this price category).
The gym is kind of average (i have seen better versions at hotels in a lower category). The ""spa"" does not really deserve the term ""spa"" according to my opinion. The sauna and steam bath are really small and in need of renovation. I definitely expected more in this regard.
The breakfast was average (very narrow space, choice could be improved).
Overall impression is still very good - the food (lunch, dinner) at bar and restaurants are tasty and good quality.",4,2014,03,12
121,Getting ready to go!,"I have booked this hotel for four years and will do so again at the end of the month. I trust it will be as friendly and comfortable as it has in the past, despite the name change. From your reviews, I expect it to be so.",5,2014,03,12
121,Run! Don't walk to get away from this hotel,"Unpleasant from the moment of check-in which took 10 minutes just to get to someone. Turns out that the hotel has construction work in the courtyard so the assigned room was subject to noise and disturbances from 8am and throughout the day. Management did try to accommodate but frankly the hotel portion, the old Crowne Plaza, is in dire need of renovation. So many better choices are available so don't waste your time in such an unpleasant choice, at least at this time.",1,2014,03,12
121,What a Great Hotel,"I stay in London quite a lot, say 20 times a year, my employer is mean and I have to work very hard, and usually add money to get a decent hotel, so a reasonably priced (£150) nice hotel is a real find. 
The lobby is imposing, the check in staff courteous, the room enormous (largest simple double I have stayed in in London) the furnishings nice, bathroom good, excellent toiletries and a large selection of premium TV channels, amazing at the price. Food, in the lobby cocktail bar was excellent too.
Needs the extractor fixing in the bathroom, and couldn't find hotel info book in the room (416) but otherwise just a great stay.
Didn't have breakfast, v expensive at around £25, but plenty of cafes nearby.",5,2014,03,12
121,A Perfect Hotel,"I stayed in St. James’s Court Hotel, for 9 nights, and I have nothing to complain about it. The location is perfect, near Victoria Station. The rooms are well tidy and very clean, as it is the hotel in general. The ordinary internet is free (if you need to check your e-mails, read news, etc. the speed is ok), but you may have access to a faster speed for a fee (10 pounds a day or 25 pounds for 3 days). What did I like the most? The staff. Although everybody is very friendly, Monica, a Swiss-Italian girl who works as a trainee in the reception and Izabel, a New-Zealander girl who works in the breakfast are outstanding. I will come back.",5,2014,03,12
121,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights & enjoyed our stay-hotel was lovely & affordable with excellent facilities. Staff were all very courteous whilst  not being intrusive. We had an upgrade to an executive room which was lovely-huge room with all necessary facilities- no view from window but we did not go to London to look out bedroom window. 
Restaurant food was excellent-we ate twice in Bistro 51 & once in Quilon & in the restaurant next door Bank & Zander . We always look for good eating places in London but happy to say the food was so good we remained in hotel for all evening meals- yes- expensive but this is the heart of London so to be expected.
We will definately stay at this hotel again if the price is right & have recommended it to family & friends..",5,2014,03,11
121,St James's Court: outstanding.,"I booked a room at the St James's Court for my girlfriend's birthday, and we were very excited to arrive at the hotel. We were upgraded to a suite on the second floor, which was beautiful - I couldn't really fault this place on facilities. The style is classically luxurious and comfortable from the decor down to the bedding.  The food on room service was excellent and the staff were friendly. Everything was done with a light touch. The lobby has a grand piano which is a very nice feature and adds to the ambience. There was a newspaper on Sunday morning, breakfast in the room and an express checkout. Location is good and the city centre is at your fingertips. Value for money was excellent for the luxury we were afforded and I'd heartily recommend this place and its staff for a short break or a special occasion.",5,2014,03,10
121,At last I have found descent sized quality bedrooms in London!,"Had the pleasure of staying at the St James Taj hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the room size.
Unlike many hotels that I have stayed at in London, the Taj St James offers plenty of space, tastefully furnished, clean and comfortable.
Good quality beds and fabrics and very pleasant professional reception staff. 
My only small negative was the constant buzz from the extractor fan outside the window, however for London and by comparison this was a peaceful hotel, with no other noise interference.
I am more than happy to recommend this property",4,2014,03,10
121,Superb service from friendly staff.,"I recently stayed at this hotel withy sister who was celebrating a special birthday. The service from start to finish was exceptional and probably the best I have had in a London hotel (and I've stayed in many). The hotel itself is lovely, with a beautiful inner courtyard and our room was clean and comfortable. So many London hotels are bland and characterless but this hotel blends beautiful architectural features with modern conveniences. Small details like the cards on the bed at night detailing the weather for the next day were a thoughtful finishing touch. However it is the staff that make this hotel as special as it is, especially the lovely Guest Engagement Manager, Shivaani Puri who made our stay truly special. Thank you St James' Court Taj Hotel, we will definitely return.",5,2014,03,09
121,Much better than expected!,"The hotel was booked by my business travel agency .... When I got the link to the site, I thought it was an average London hotel with a bit better decor. Having been a business traveller for many many years, I have often booked hotels based on nice websites and my arrival would prove me wrong.... This is what I thought of this hotel.... Yes I was wrong. It was perfect! 
- Perfect room
- Perfect location
- Perfect service
- Perfect price
- Perfect choice

I will definitely choose this hotel again!!",5,2014,03,08
121,Every single detail means a lot for the hotel directors.,"Small details that make the difference for who travell a lot. The amazing (and expensive) decor, the ammenities, the room. For me, the best room in London. Much better than the top 5 stars rooms. 4 restaurants, one of them Michelin awarded with the best indian ever. It has been a perfect experience. It could be galatic if I went in hollidays and not for work!",5,2014,03,07
121,So good I'd like to keep it a secret!,We had a fabulous two night stay in this hotel last week. The staff exemplify customer service and the surroundings are restful. Minutes from Victoria Station and St James underground it was easy to travel around London. Delightful walks throughout the nearby parks take you very quickly to key sights and great shopping. Would love to stay at this hotel again very soon.,5,2014,03,07
121,Really helpful! ,Nothing was too much trouble ! The hotel had upgraded us as it was my birthday and my daughter was receiving her D of E gold award too! They had left a birthday cake also . The staff were very friendly and helped us make a last minute theatre reservation . Location excellent for the sights so all in all a lovely stay ! ,4,2014,03,06
121,Lovely night away,"We were booked into this hotel as part of a gift package Christmas present.  We were very pleasantly surprised at its upmarket location - less than 5 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and St James' Park and ten minutes from Westminster Abbey. From the moment we walked through the door the service was excellent - an attentive and interested receptionist who was efficient and helpful, a helpful concierge, smart doormen.  The room was one of the basic, or as they call it, classic, rooms in a slightly less swish wing of the hotel but was cosy, comfortable, clean and very well appointed with iron and ironing board, complimentary bottled water, fridge and bathroom telephone besides all the basics you would expect. My husband was a little disturbed by the hum of motors overnight, but they didn't keep either of us awake. Good service at breakfast and plenty of choice. Would definitely recommend this to others, especially if it was available at an offer price.",5,2014,03,06
121,Great location and staff,"This is the first time I have stayed at the St.James and it will not be my last.  The hotel is in a great location i.e. 5 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, 15 minutes to Victoria Station, Westminister Abbey, Big Ben etc.

The room was very large in comparison with normal London rooms but best of all was the staff - very customer focussed and everyone we spoke to only eager to assist.  We enjoyed the breakfast as well.

This hotel is hard to beat for location, size of the room and customer service.  Nothing was a problem including late checkout.",5,2014,03,06
121,Wonderful hotel in an excellent location with outstanding service.,"I enjoyed a wonderful four night break staying at the newly refurbished and luxurious St. James Court Hotel.  There is a lot of building work in the surrounding area at present and the first morning I was awoken by noisy builders in the adjacent building.  I told reception and was moved to an upgraded room on the 7th floor overlooking the central courtyard of the hotel and it was very peaceful, spacious and comfortable.   The full english breakfast was excellent with plenty of  choice.  The Hamptons Bar served a selection of very tasty cocktails and the bar staff were very helpful with their recommendations. The last night we dined at the Michelin Star rated Quilon Restaurant and had a scrumptious South-west Indian meal.  It was a real treat for one's taste buds trying so many different and unusual flavours at the Chef's recommendation.  The hotel staff were all helpful and friendly and bent over backwards to be of service.  I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to have the opportunity to stay there again.",5,2014,03,05
121,A lovely birthday treat!,"We spent a long weekend at the hotel to celebrate my birthday in London. 
The room we had was well equipped and spotlessly clean. Everything you could wish for and more was provided. Our room was to the rear of the courtyard on the first floor and was pleasantly quiet at night.
The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble for them. In particular the young lady in the Bistro on Feb 20th deserves a mention, she went out of her way to bring our wine and a birthday cake to our room when I had to leave the restaurant before finishing my meal.
We enjoyed the food in the restaurants and breakfast was also very good.
The location is ideal too, a short walk from Buckingham Palace, Westminster etc and we were able to walk to the Victoria Theatre to see Billy Elliott. (Also highly recommended!!)
I would recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future.",5,2014,03,04
121,Perfect,"This was booked as part of a birthday treat for me along with watching wicked in the apollo theatre. It's a 10 minute walk from there and also a 10 minute walk the other way to bin ben and southbank so the London eye and other attractions too. Our room was upgraded for no reason to a suite :) it was a lovely room, huge bed, big bathroom and was absolutely spotless. The service was first class and the staff couldnt do enough to help you. We would visit again and definitely recommend this hotel. I was extremely impressed and its one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in (and we do travel alot) 10/10 excellent",5,2014,03,02
121,Expecting more,"St James' Court is a Taj hotel, but if you expect the same standard and service as at other Taj hotel you will be disappointed. The hotel has a great location, between Belgravia, Hyde park, Knightsbridge and Mayfair. It's almost the same distance everywhere and there is a bike stand right outside the hotel. And London is great for biking around! The foyer and courtyard are very nice, although there is a renovation going on right now on the courtyard and at parts of the front of the hotel. The room was clean but dated as the whole hotel except for the ground floor. It is a big old house so the corridors are long and winding. On the plus side is the size of the hotel rooms which are quite big for London. The staff was attentive and helpful. There is very good restaurants at the hotel and in Belgravia. ",4,2014,02,26
121,Fantastic hotel,This was our first stay at the St. James' Court hotel and it certainly won't be our last.  Both front of house and housekeeping staff were extremely courteous and polite and nothing was too much trouble.  The bar areas and restaurant are extremely pleasant and welcoming.,5,2014,02,26
121,Fantastic cannot fault it brilliant,So very clean staff unbelievably polite and helpful can't do enough for you best hotel we have ever stayed in by far will definitely go back great location great area everything you need rooms brilliant superb breakfasts ,5,2014,02,26
121,Best hotel i have ever stayed in,"This was the best hotel I ever stayed in. Perfect location, clean, comfortable, great staff. We were 5 minutes from Victoria station... main station from Gatwick. Buckingham palace was at the end of the street. Safe location and we felt comfortable walking late at night. close to Big Ben, Westminster. You should def stay here!!",5,2014,02,24
121,Very hospitable,Having just arrived back refreshed after the weekend staying here thanks to the Manager Edward Riches who made our  stay exceptional this time . The room on the first floor more than met our requirements and easily accessible .,5,2014,02,24
121,"Good location, nice room, little noisy","We stayed for 4 nights that time still Crowne Plaza but under Indian management. 
Endless breakfast queues on the weekend up to 45 minutes are not acceptable. The quality of breakfast and varieties are good. The staff by a complete fully booked hotel not organised very well. Central location, 10 min walking distance to Buckingham palace, Tower and tube are perfect. Due to position upon the tube a high floor is recommendable. Rooms are renovated and good. 4* service needs improvements. ",3,2014,02,24
121,Outstanding service & Hotel,"I was treated to a theatre trip recently, this hotel was superb, very grand looking, lovely friendly staff. Very clean and in a good quiet location. Drinks and the food were superb, breakfast was outstanding with a clean environment throughout. 
I could not have asked for a better stay, very helpful staff even ordering taxis and helping to organise the smooth running of my trip.",5,2014,02,24
121,Excellent stay!!,"We stayed for one night and did not spend a great amount of time at the hotel, however we were made to feel very welcome when checking in and the room was pleasant and clean, it had all the things you would expect to find in a higher end hotel room. The corridors are in need of some tlc but this does not detract from the charm of this hotel. The bar was nice to sit and have a drink at the end of a busy day while listening to the grand piano.",4,2014,02,23
121,Good?,"The hotel was okay. The room was big enough. The hotel was very Indian inspired, well because it is a Taj hotel. The location however, was not very convenient. There are taxis outside the hotel, but London taxis are always a bit too pricey. The staff service was delightful, the breakfasts were good, there was a lot of choices, but the buffet stays the same everyday; they also do serve à la carte in the morning too. One thing is that the sound proofing isn't the best because of the construction site directly in front of the hotel. Well it is understandable and cannot be controlled, but it always felt like the windows of the hotel are paper thin. In general the hotel is suitable for business trips, instead of holidays. We stayed in this hotel, because we were on a transfer flight to Dubai.",4,2014,02,23
121,Yeah OK  But,"Good location, easy access to west end via 24 bus  room wasn't ready by 1730 so were offered coffee and a (ha ha) upgrade. Would question what our original room was like since 514 was not especially brilliant but at least remote from the lifts.  Staff were good especially those in the restaurant tho the early buffet breakfast was cold.  Good for people watching",3,2014,02,22
121,"Good location, friendly staff.","Stayed 2 nights 18-20 February. Although our booking was confirmed twice by Hotelsdirect we were told on arrival that we were booked in from 20th. It took a long time (20 mins) to sort out their mistake. We were offered free (soft) drinks during our wait. Eventually we were given a room overlooking the attractive courtyard. There was some construction work going on which started at 8am, but no too noisy. 

Our room was large and in a reasonable standard of maintenance except the bathroom which needed some TLC and looked tired. Loose tap, grouting etc etc.

It is in a good location, short walk to buck palace and other tourist attractions.

We were told that as the hotel had changed owners we couldn't use our IHG loyalty card, afterwards we see that some guests had.

We had a good deal and therefore would stay again.",4,2014,02,22
121,Gorgeous hotel in a quiet but accessible area of London,"Stayed for 2 nights with a friend and our daughters aged 11  What a fantastic hotel that were very welcoming to the children. The decor was beautiful, our rooms were light, clean and well furnished and we were delighted with everything.  Great access to St James Park tube station to get around London and lovely restaurants and cafés nearby.  Two tube stops to get to the Embankment for a lovely evening stroll.",5,2014,02,22
121,The Girl Needed to Unwind! - And Unwind She Did!!!,"An unwind she did!!! -  From entering this hotel - you are wrapped in creature comforts!!!  -  It was like going home to Mumma!  -  The door is opened to you and the words 'Can I help you Madam' are what you hear from beginning to end.  Nothing is too much trouble for this hotel, they treat everyone as an individual which makes you feel really looked after!

Our stay was to celebrate Valentines - The Girl was being Treated!  - Wine, dined she was to an excellent hig standard!!! 

A really lovely touch in their Bar Area is some gentleman playing a piano - which the following evening he was accompanied by a Base Player, really enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere - with a bottle of Prosecco or two!!

The bedroom was of good size, the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom clean and well equipment.  All water supply worked as it should!! - (some hotels do not!)

Great location, just around the corner from Tube, but who needed a tube? - when the door is opened to you as you leave, you hear 'Madam can I order you a taxi' - so Madam went everywhere in a Taxi - tubes not for this girl!

Well done to my Fiance!!!  -  you picked a GEM here......really looking forward to our next visit!!!",5,2014,02,20
121,Couldn't fault it,"Stayed here (again) for a couple of nights for a conference.  Since my last visit it has become a ""Taj"" hotel - and all the changes have been improvements.   (They even took my frequent user card from before it changed chains and upgraded my room - there's customer service for you!)  It's noticeable that the new owners are steadily spending money on refreshing the decor and the rooms.  Ambience has become subtly more oriental, which lifts it above the run-of-the mill anonymous London hotel. Now has free basic wi-fi (I moaned about being charged last time) and you can get high speed if you really need it.   Big pat on the back for whoever trains the staff - and to the staff themselves.  Everybody is smiley, friendly and helpful - not just the front-of-house people (which you would expect) - but everybody you meet seems pleased to be working there and goes out of their way to help.  Definitely one to go back to.",5,2014,02,19
121,Charming room,"Stayed here for 6 nights.  Loved our room--spacious for London.  They had a nice gym with tea and overall just a pleasant place. In-room tea and fridge.  Great ocation - just a couple minutes from the St. James' tube station and an easy walk to Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace and St. James' Park.   Sufficient water pressure in shower/bath combo, although toilet water pressure tended to be low but OK.  Piano musician evenings in bar/lobby area.  The hotel just changed hands so it's likely to be updated and in fact they started doing some construction a few days before we left so I would ask for a room away from  construction.  (Our room overlooked the garden and we had windows that opened which was really nice).  I would definitely stay there again.",4,2014,02,17
121,Excellent Hotel.,"Not cheap but good value for London. Some reviews are unhappy with certain things, but do not understand why. Yes, there are building works nearby, but they do not start early nor finish late. The Reception area of the hotel is beautiful and bedroom 432 was large, clean and very comfortable, with an excellent bathroom. Only problem I had, was finding out how the TV worked and there was no Teletext available ! The smoke detector on the ceiling flashed every seven seconds, which was a bit disturbing at night, but soon got used to it. My two small faults take nothing away from the total experience of the hotel. Breakfasts were superb, which meant lunches were not required while touring the West End. One piece of advice for those not too proud - use buses while in London. The cost of Taxis has gone through the roof. Just watch the meter while sitting in the traffic jams ! Buses are frequent and easy to work out with the pocket guide. Numbers 11 and 24 will take you from close to the Hotel to the Trafalgar Square area.",4,2014,02,17
121,Comfortable friendly hotel,"Stayed for one night. The reception area was fabulous & as I reached the 5th floor I was a little disappointed to see frayed carpets and damaged decor. Fortunately this did not carry on into the room which was spacious and comfortable with an lovely bathroom. 
The wifi was free but ended up using a dongle as too slow. Didn't stay for £24 breakfast too expensive. 
Excellent location, 10 minute walk to Big Ben, in need of a little renovation although I assume that's why the builders we there decided to work in a cafe due to the noise & poor wifi. 
Staff extremely friendly & helpful, would recommend. ",4,2014,02,17
121,Great location,"Stayed for 2 nights on business and got a great deal on a well known site for late deals. Centre of London for £120 a night has to be great value. Staff were excellent & all was well presented downstairs. Rooms were a little on the small side, but no complaints, was clean, tidy and the bathroom was very good. Only complaint is shower curtain over the bath, I would rather a screen or just a shower and no bath, but that's me. I wish there was a choice if space is a premium.
If you can get a deal I would definitely recommend this for a base to explore all the sites. Good for business also. View from room was not inspiring, but in the city you take what you can get.
Would I go back? Sure, but not at rack rate prices.",4,2014,02,17
121,Romantic rendezvous,"We stayed here on Friday 14th February for joint anniversary and Valentine's day treat. From the word go the hotel staff were courteous and helpful. My travel plans were disrupted due to the bad weather that evening but I rang to let them know that we were running late and also had a table booked at Bistro 51, which would need to be rearranged. Reception staff offered to phone the restaurant and let them know this, which was great as that meant we didn't feel rushed. There was also a gorgeous little chocolate mousse cake in our room when we arrived, with 'Happy Anniversary' written on the plate in chocolate. The next morning we needed somewhere to store our luggage as were off to The Royal Albert Hall to see Quidam and the concierge on duty was kind enough to phone a hotel (Crowne Park Plaza on Cromwell Road) to leave it there so we weren't dragging it around all day! All in all an extremely memorable stay and we would love to come back some day. Thank you",5,2014,02,17
121,An excellent hotel in a perfect location,"We stayed in the hotel for a long weekend for leisure purposes. We were upgraded to a junior suite (room 361) overlooking the courtyard. The room was clean, spacious, airy and the bed (though two single beds zipped together) was extremely comfortable with a large duvet. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful and could not be faulted in any way. The hotel facilities were fantastic for a city centre hotel and the location being 10 minutes from Buckingham Palace and not much further from Victoria Station. There is a Barclays (Boris) bike hire station directly across the road.
We had three very comfortable and peaceful nights' stay and the breakfasts in Bistro 51 were superb. We had breakfast included in our deal so I cannot comment on the price but the quality of fresh fruit, yoghurt, bread, Indian and cooked food was excellent.
We will definitely consider this hotel again when visiting London",5,2014,02,14
121,weekend in london,"This hotel made our weekend really special. Very helpful on reservations. Changed our booking to a family room. Beautiful very spacious room with 2 extremely comfortable queen beds & a nice entrance with a lounge (sofas) and desk. Very clean and modern. All the staff were very polite & helpful. Had a great lunch at the bistro 51, the indian food on the menu was very good.
And to top it all a birthday cake, sent  up by management which was delicious!
The location is perfect. 10 min walk to victoria tube & rail. 15 min walk to Big Ben & Westminster Abbey.  Picadilly Circus, 8min by taxi (easy to get outside hotel). A great hotel to stay in london.",5,2014,02,14
121,Second stay not so good,"The first time we stayed at the Taj we liked it so much we came again, but this time the experience wasn't so great. Bad points: We had a smaller room (although same class of room we'd booked before) and due to the renovation work the builders were making a noise outside our window from 8am on Saturday morning, something we weren't told about. The ensuite was the smallest I'd ever encountered and the basin so large that getting in and out of the bathroom was a mission. It was impossible to use the shaving mirror due to its position. The hairdryer was a cheap old model and again impossible to use because there wasn't a mirror positioned anywhere near the power sockets. We were promised a complimentary paper in the morning but did not get one. The reception staff were very pleasant and made a point of saying that the wi-fi was free, but when I tried to access it on my phone I was only offered the £10 per hour pay-menu. This was fixed but only after a 15 minute phone conversation with an IT person. Breakfast is a massive £24 per person! We saved our money and ended up having a fantastic brunch out.
Good points: very quiet generally, being off the street (apart from builders next day), good air conditioning that actually worked (a miracle in London!), great lounge bar entertainment (pianist). Nice friendly staff.",3,2014,02,12
121,"A very good hotel with very helpful, friendly staff","A very good hotel with very helpful and friendly staff in a good location. 
The rooms are a little tired (Nothing drastic, just a few scuffs on the walls) and would benefit from refurbishment but they are very clean and comfortable. I had 7 rooms booked and all my colleague's were very happy with the hotel. I believe Taj Hotel's took over the hotel in January 2014 so refurbishment may be on the cards.",5,2014,02,11
121,So disappointed.,"This was going to be only my third ever 5 star review of a hotel. On check-in (28th Jan), the hotel immediately upgraded me to a suite (room 463), the best move a hotel can make to impress newcomers and I dearly wish all hotels would follow suit.
Being a fan of No.51 next door, I liked St James Court more as although it's not quite as luxurious - it's considerably more affordable. That counts for a lot when you have to visit the capital five or six times per year.
Both are the old fashioned type of establishment with character and service, that's exactly how I like it.
I loved the suite, it was extremely spacious and the bathroom alone was bigger than my kitchen at home. There was everything you might need. The decor/furniture etc  might be considered dated, but it fits the style of the establishment and was immaculately clean. All staff without exception were very sweet, not that I ever require anything anyway.
Much like next door, breakfast was unrealistically expensive so I never bothered with it, there are two Pret a Mangers within two minutes walk and the whole area is teeming with little cafes and restaurants.
Unfortunately by 6pm I realised I was freezing cold and went to switch the heating on, only to discover it didn't work. I called the desk and the maintenance engineer appeared within ten minutes, he said he'd have to go to the roof and reboot the whole system. Upon his return, he switched on the aircon in both rooms and it now worked. The temp was 19 degrees at this point. By 7pm it had dropped to 16 degrees and I realised the aircon was only blowing out cold air! The engineer returned and conceded this, telling me it had affected the whole block and the aircon company were required to make a major call-out the following day. For the moment, he left me two small heaters, one in each room. I was so cold I hardly slept that night, it's an old building and the secondary double glazing is virtually ineffective - you could feel freezing air blowing in through the sides of every window.
The next morning I almost shot out of my skin at 8.30am when the most horrendous noise started outside. I looked through the bedroom window and saw that major building work was happening just across from my window. And I do mean MAJOR - the skeleton of a skyscraper was on it's way up and they were currently at the 14th floor, there were dozens of builders, machinery and God knows what. The noise was horrific.
I pitied the hotel, assuming it must quite badly affect their business and anybody else's in the immediate vicinity.
On returning to the hotel two or three times during the second day, I asked various staff if the aircon (heating) had been repaired in our block yet, but none of them even knew it was broken. Luckily the building work stopped at around 6 each day. That second night I discovered for myself that the heating was still not working, so put both the small heaters on full blast in the bedroom and used an extra blanket, it made it liveable.
Upon check-out on the third day (30th Jan), a lovely young lady called Caroline asked about my stay. I told her about the non-existent heating and the horrendous noise. She said that I could have had another suite on the inside of the building overlooking the inner courtyard which was pretty much shielded from the noise. I'm afraid this is no use whatsoever to someone when they're checking out! If anybody at any time had come and knocked on my door and offered me a suite overlooking the courtyard, this would have probably been a 5 star review. It would have been common sense.
As it stands, even a complimentary breakfast would have helped, or a reduction on the bill, but there was nothing.
I've sadly gone with 3 stars because although I really like this hotel, it is totally unacceptable to allow guests to sleep in unheated rooms in January and with massive structural building work happening outside the window.",3,2014,02,11
121,Return Visit,"We stayed at the then Crowne Plaza last year for my husband's birthday and decided to return again. We do not make a habit of staying at the same place twice, so this in itself is a measure of how much we enjoyed ourselves. From making the booking (many thanks to manager Ed Riches), to checking in (especially Shivaani Puri and, I think, Yanina)  and onwards, the whole weekend was superb. The rooms are well furnished, really comfy bed and lovely fluffy towels in the excellent bathroom. Everything works and does not need a degree in engineering to fathom it out. There were many extra touches for my husband's celebration and we were made to feel like VIPs. As others have commented, it is in a great location for all the main sights without the noise of being on a main road.
Cannot fault the St James Court and would recommend it heartily.",5,2014,02,10
121,Disappointed,"It was unfortunate that we stayed during what appear to be quite extensive updating works. Our room (454) was looking extremely tired with poor quality decoration, a rotting bath panel, discoloured grout and temperamental lighting. If a white glove test was carried out the room would fail instantly with layers of dust apparent throughout. Considering we spent what to us was a considerable amount of money we expected more from a 4* London hotel. The images portrayed on the website show large comfortable beds and whilst ours was indeed comfortable it certainly was not large. Despite being on the 4th floor we were constantly aware of the tube trains rumbling beneath us, and whilst we appreciate this not to be the fault of the hotel, it did not provide a perfect nights sleep. The staff at the hotel were superb with nothing too much trouble. They were abundant in every area meaning there were no delays in any aspect of checking in, attending the bar areas, or negotiating breakfast. The only negative in the breakfast area was the temperature of the hot food. It seemed to have been standing for a long time and most was only luke warm by the time we returned to our table. The coffee too was lacking in any heat. Any issues we had were rectified immediately by the staff however this should not have been required in the first place. As we were in London celebrating a combination of my wife's birthday, Valentines and our 1st wedding anniversary, I was a little disappointed with the hotel and our room. We certainly can't afford this type of trip very often and when we do we like it to be special. Overall our trip to London was magical, taking in the Eye and The Emirates Stadium, and a fantastic performance of Billy Elliott. The icing on the cake would have been the hotel, however on this occasion we have been left a little deflated. Maybe next time we shall do a bit more research and read a few more reviews, and maybe not go for the ""Hidden Gem"" option.",3,2014,02,09
121,Very Nice,"We stayed at this hotel last Sept (2013). We had stayed here for 2 days before we were taking a cruise out of Dover (about 1 1/2 hour train ride away). we have never been in London before so we did not know what to ecpect in terms of getting around etc. We took the subway from the airport to downtown London (as a side note, the folks at the subway station were very friendly and helpful with any questions on what trains to take etc). The stop that we got off at was about a 10 to 15 min walk to our hotel. Once at the hotel we figured since it was so early in the morning (9am) that we would have to check our luggage in and wait for our room, not so. They had our room ready to go and it was much needed and appreciated after a long day of travelling. We were a little concerned about what the size of the room was going to be like as we have heard that the rooms in London were guite small compared to North American standards, this was not to be true at all in regards to our room. We had emailed the manager in advance requesting a room that was overlooking the center garden on a higher floor. We had recieved exactly what we had asked for. The room was very spacious with a great view and very clean and up to date ( even had a heated towel drying rack in the bathroom). The room really did exceed our expectations. We did eat at one of the restaurants at the hotel, I can't remember the name off hand but it was the one that served oriental food, the food was excellent here and the service was very good as well. The meal cost around 80 pounds which I thought was very reasonable considering it had a very nice atmosphere and we also had wine with our meal. The location of the hotel was also a great bonus because everything was either within walking distance or a short bus ride or subway ride away.  In closing I just wanted to say that the staff were also very freindly at this hotel and we had no complaints about anything. We would definetely recomend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Londan and we will definetely stay here again when going back to London ourselves.",5,2014,02,08
121,Good sized room at a great price,"Recently stayed at the Taj Court having stayed at the Crowne Plaza St James previously and I have to say the refinements made have definitely been an improvement.

The room size for central London was excellent and cannot fault the other amenities. Great location and will stay here on future visits.",5,2014,02,08
121,Excellent Customer Delight ,"We booked this hotel just because of the confidence we had on TAJ. And it proved just right. Straight from the front office manager Mr. Manuel to the Guest Relations Manager Ms. Shivanee Puri to the Concierge Mr. Fred, all were so wonderful. The word Customer Delight was always on their mind. They were (as if) just there for us all the time. Ms. Shivanee gave us all the information to fill up my 4 days on London. Mr. Fred ( an employee working there for the last 16 years) arranged the entry passes for Madame Tussauds and Tower of London, with an assurance that we can return the passes in case if we decide not to visit either places. The hotel is just 5 mins walk from The Buckingham Palace and about 15 mins walk from Big Ben and The London Eye. The breakfast was great. But kudos to the excellent staff, I would always stay with them whenever I visit London. Thanks St. James Court (A Taj Hotel)     ",5,2014,02,06
121,"Fine hotel, not as nice as expected","My husband and I stayed here three nights, originally booked as a Crown Plaza but recently changed to a Taj.  The staff were very helpful and friendly, no complaints there.  Lovely lobby as well.  The room though was just ok.  It was a good size but the walls were dirty and the carpet was old.  We used a ton of miles to book this place and specifically were booking what we thought would be a very nice room but it just was not that nice.  Bathroom was also in need of updates and there were water spots all over the floor and sink.  I think they are redoing parts of this hotel, but I definitly think we were in an older room.  A bit disappointing.  Breakfast each day was very good.  Location was also excellent.  A fine hotel if you are not looking for a spectacular room.  (Or perhaps ask for one of the newly renovated rooms?)",3,2014,02,05
121,little gem of london,"We found this hotel by chance when looking for somewhere to stay for our weekend away in London. we got a very good deal and didnt really know what  to expect, what a surprise we got. The double room was lovely, nice decor and a lovely view of the courtyard. The location is just perfect. We will choose this hotel when we visit London again.",5,2014,02,04
121,An excellent weekend stay,My wife and I came down to London for a weekend of shopping and dining.  We had stayed here once before when it was the Crowne Plaza - St. James and gave it a very good review.  This time I have to give our stay an excellent review.  From check in to check out everything was perfect.  We were upgraded to a suite with a bed that was bigger than the state of Texas!  The suite was quiet and I slept like a baby every night.  For breakfast you had a choice of eggs made up in the kitchen or you could partake from the buffet.  Not sure what type of orange juice was being served but it was delicious.  Service throughout our stay from every department was excellent.  And getting a late check out was the icing on the cake. Thank you!,5,2014,02,04
121,A very dated and tired hotel once you get past the glitz of the front desk.,"What a shame. The 1st 2 minutes were perfect. We were welcomed by a very happy door man, the check in was quick and in high quality surroundings but as soon as we got out of the lift and started walking to our room we were dissapointed. It was as if the lift was a time portal taking us back to 1970. Wall paper was starting to flake off the walls (we were on the 7th floor room 756) and the carpet was very dated. When we got to our room is was worse. The decor stayed the same with paper flaking and stains on the carpet which looked like bleech. 

The only positives about the hotel are:-

- The location is great for Buckingham Palcace and Westminster
- The Reception area is great quality

Im sorry Taj but you have a lot of work to do here to get this old hotel to your usual high standards.",1,2014,02,04
121,Even better than before - almost perfect.,"We've stayed at this hotel a number of times previously, in its former guise as the Crowne Plaza St James', but this was our first visit since it has become a member of the Taj Group - as we were down in London for a friend's birthday.

The location is, of course, excellent. A gentle 2 minute stroll from Buck House in one direction and Westminster Abbey 5 minutes the other direction, its quiet at night, but only 10 minutes walk from the pubs and bars of Victoria. 

We were lucky to be upgraded to one of the newly refurbished Executive Rooms on the 5th floor, and it was spacious with chairs, a sofa, an office console area with all data and VGA connection points and a large King Size bed. Both the ""suite"" and the bathroom were spotless.

This hotel, and its rooms, have everything a luxury hotel requires but there were a couple of minor niggles. Firstly, check-in was slow. I must point out that it didn't appear to be the fault of any individual in particular as the girl that checked us in was very courteous. I think it was a question of timing - too many people checking in at once, with too few staff on reception to cope. We were told our room was not quire ready, but that we would be contacted very shortly when it was, so we decided to have a coffee in the lobby. An hour later, and after queuing at reception for 20 minutes, I asked the receptionist if our room was ready which it was. Not a major gripe, but if you are told you would be contacted as soon as your room is ready, this didn't happen. But then again, the reception staff were flat out.

Whilst waiting to check in, my second minor gripe surfaced. The ""free WiFi"" (which all hotels with 3 or more staff should provide these days) is insufferably slow. I store my books and music in the cloud, and subscribe to the Times' electronic (ipad and tablet) editions. I could not download anything, not even open a regular, attachment-free email on the free Wifi. My wife's iPhone actually crashed completely when attempting to browse! There is a high speed WiFi which the hotel also offers, but this is £10 per day. In my opinion, the high speed WiFi should be included in the price of the room.

Also, I'm glad we didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there appeared to be a long queue for service in the morning too. We ate breakfast at one of the local bistros nearby which was more than adequate.

I hope that these two issues are resolved, as this hotel is totally fabulous in every other way. It's good to see the refurbishments have overhauled areas of the hotel that had become a little tired over time. The Hampton's bar is perfect for a late evening, post-meal, drink and the service and ambience is great. 

Nice little touches - we came back after dining out at the brilliant Quilon to find our ice bucket filled and a weather forecast card on the pillow. No turn down service, but then I find this a little intrusive as a rule anyway, so no complaints from me about this.

We love this hotel, and it is easily our first choice hotel in London. Hopefully the WiFi and the check-in issues will be resolved in the near future.",5,2014,02,03
121,Excellent by any account!,"We stayed at this hotel formerly Crowne Plaza St James. It´s a perfect hotel - so it was a perfect stay! Excellent service, beautiful rooms, perfect location! We will choose this hotel again - that´s for sure!",5,2014,02,03
121,Excellent!,"Just returned from a 3 night stay in this beautiful hotel. My daughter and I were impressed from the minute we arrived until we reluctantly departed! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff from doormen, concierge, reception, in room dining staff (yes - we used this service a few times!)
Hotel location is only 5 minute walk from St James tube station. 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. A quiet area at night but a few pubs dotted around. 
Our classic twin room was on the 5th floor and was a really good size. Decor was in keeping with the elegant style of the hotel. Noticed a few ""scuff"" marks here and there and some paintwork needing refreshed but these are minor details and I'm sure they will be addressed by the new owners, Taj hotels.
Overall a lovely experience and would definitely stay again!",5,2014,02,03
121,Birthday splurge,"We stayed at this hotel formerly Crowne Plaza St James for 11 nights to celebrate my daughters and my birthdays in London. After a long 27 hour flight from Australia we were warmly welcomed bythe doorman. Check in was quick and efficient. We had an executive twin room on the 3rd floor as we are IHG Gold Priority club members. A very nice spacious refurbished room with a large modern ensure. We loved the robes, chocolates & complimentary bottled water every day. Breakfast was delicious with great staff. The breakfast manager, Frederic I think is professional yet friendly, offering us tips of what to see each day. The concierge was wonderful in advising of chemist close by when my daughter fell ill and even stopped me to ask how she was the next day. We did have a small issue of smelling cigarette smoke in our hallway for 3 days. We mentioned it to housekeeping & reception but it took 3 days to be resolved. All in all we loved our stay and the convenience of St James tube station 5 minutes walk away and we will definitely return in the future. ",5,2014,01,31
121,Second stay just as great as the first,"Stayed here a year ago and grabbed the opportunity to return for a meeting this year. The hotel is simply stunning, enhanced by the friendly and helpful team - I can't imagine anything being too much trouble for them. Check in quick and professional. Had a room on the 5th floor - lovely sized room and bathroom, both really clean and well stocked. The location of the hotel is great - just a few minutes walk from the tube and a nice leisurely walk into the city centre via Buckingham Palace and the Mall - who could ask for more? Walked back in the evening too so no need to worry if you don't like the tube - it doesn't seem to ever get quiet on the Mall! Breakfast next morning was a mix of continental and cooked. Really like the attentive service - plates are removed quickly when finished with and you hardly notice them being taken! This hotel will always be my first choice when visiting London.",5,2014,01,31
121,"Great ""home"" in London","After having a disastrous experience renting a flat for a two-week stay in London whilst taking a course, I came, finally to the St James/Taj hotel. Perfectly located a block from Buckingham Palace and within easy walking distance of several tube stops and beautiful parks, it was an oasis of calm, wonderful room and very friendly and helpful staff. I will definitely come again. Great value also, considering the price of London hotels.",5,2014,01,31
121,What a lovely surprise!,"I was looking for a lovely hotel in a great location and booked  3 rooms with Crowne Plaza for a girls weekend away. Just before we travelled I discovered the hotel was no longer part of the IHC group so I was a bit apprehensive , no need... From the moment we arrived late in the evening we knew we'd made a great choice. The hotel is stunning inside and out. Reception staff were welcoming and very efficient . We had 3 beautiful rooms , each one different.  The location is perfect , 5 minutes walk to St  James underground or Buckingham Palace. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a special hotel in a great city. I will definitely return as we didn't have time to use all the facilities the hotel had to offer .",4,2014,01,31
121,Sheer luxury!!!!,Last weekend I visited the Hotel with 5 friends.   Our rooms were 'fab' and our stay was fantastic!!  Hotel was beautifully furnished and very clean!! We were walking distance to Buckingham Palace and handy for St.James tube station. Will certainly return!!!,5,2014,01,30
121,"Excellent location and very helpful staff, wonderful experience","This hotel is definitely one of the best I have ever stayed in.  The new decor is beautiful, the lounge areas expansive and tastefully decorated and the rooms comfortable and clean.   Check in is smooth and quick experience.  We just stayed one night but our room was ready early so we could go into it just after midday which was a bonus.   The staff are without exception courteous and well trained.     It was very relaxing to sit in the bar and listen to the pianist on the grand piano.   Our room overlooked the beautiful courtyard with its Shakespeare frieze and historic fountain.  A very peaceful area.   I made use of the seamstress service and her repair was just perfect..  Breakfast was varied and tasty and the service spot on.   May I commend the management on continuing to deliver a very high standard of service at this wonderful hotel.  I am very much looking forward to my next visit.",5,2014,01,30
121,Lovely hotel,I stayed at this hotel with my mother in December and can highly recommend it. The staff were polite and friendly. The hotel itself was clean and of a high standard. Will definitely be staying again in the future.,5,2014,01,29
121,Weekend in London,The weekend was a special treat for my birthday.  We arrived on Friday evening and was at once given full personal attention by the staff making us feel very special.  The next day we went sightseeing in London followed by going to the theatre to watch Billy Elliot.  The hotel is in a prime position for seeing the attractions of London. The service was 1st class and the décor very tastefully designed and relaxing.,5,2014,01,29
121,Fantastic time at St James,"Our group of 4 women wanted a weekend away to celebrate a 45th birthday and we were fortunate enough to find the St. James Court hotel. Very classy, elegant ambience without being intimidating. Loved the lobby. Check-in was quite long and did not result in ""adjoining"" rooms as promised/discussed prior to and during check-in. Our 2 rooms were in fact not only not adjoining, they were also not adjacent. When we called down to explain the need to remedy, we spoke to a lovely reservations manager (Michaela if I remember correctly) and she fixed the situation... with a free upgrade! Having seen both basic rooms and the suites, both types are well worth their price. Every employee we had the pleasure of dealing with was gracious and helpful without being obtrusive. Take the time to ask for the walking shortcut to the shopping area nearby (also quickest way to Victoria Station). Don't miss the fantastic gastropub The Phoenix nearby as well (perhaps reservations?). We had a fantastic time!! Highly recommend.Thank you St. James Court.",5,2014,01,27
121,WEEKEND IN LONDON JANUARY 2014,"Having just got home from a great weeked in London with 5 freinds from Scotland we all thought it was a Beautiful hotel in great spot for central London short walk from St James Tube station or even better £16 in cab to or from Euston - (A bargain for 6 people plus luggage and saves going up and down in the underground)!  We reserved 3 double rooms for the two night stay. All rooms had their own character and were different sizes. One room had no bath but a HUGE shower. Our stay was value for money for central London. Check in was swift, seamless and friendly. All staff I came across were lovely and helpful- anything you wanted you got. Would love to stay there again.

We didnt have breakfast but can recommend a lovely Cafe/Coffee Shop for breakfast directly opposite. Clean and friendly

Hotel was formerly Crowne Plaza - The Courtyard was beautiful and must be even more so in the summer or at night when it is lit up.",5,2014,01,26
121,A weekend Away.,"My husband and myself have just spent a wonderful weekend at this hotel.  The location was perfect.  The room was perfect.  The hotel team could not more helpful.  
Thank you for the little touches that will ensure that we won't stay anywhere else, when in London.",5,2014,01,26
121,Good if you can get a deal,"Stayed 2 nights in January.  Originally booked through Crowne Plaza on their Christmas Sale and got a great deal for two nights.  No family rooms so had to book 2 rooms which we request to be next to each other and they were.
Very impressive reception/lobby but once you get past that the rooms were quite dated, although a good size and very clean.  Our room faced onto a school playground and obviously at the weekend it was really quiet.
As already mentioned its in a great location approx 5-10 mins from Victoria station.  A good selection of shops (House of Fraser/Topshop/Monsoon) nearby and the usual eating places (Leon/Mcdonalds/Pret A Manger).
One plus which I liked is that you can actually open the windows as I find hotel rooms can be a bid hot even in winter.
Would return if on a deal but would have been a bit disappointed if I had paid full price.
I do realise that its now a Taj hotel but Crowne Plazas and Holiday Inns do have family rooms which does cut down on the cost.",4,2014,01,26
121,Lovely Hotel," Received an upgrade on check-in.  Room large and beautiful, tea and coffee making facilities on hand. All staff well mannered and so attentive at all times. Breakfast was delicious with everything you could want on a buffet and you could request different types of eggs. Would certainly consider staying at this hotel again.",4,2014,01,26
121,2nd visit and will return,"This is a lovely hotel, perfect area, had an exec room which was great - all staff from concierge to reception to house keeping to bar staff and breakfast were amazing. Quilon restaurant definitely worth a visit - excellent. Will be going back - more importantly this hotel has a fantastic manager who is very keen to please his guests.",5,2014,01,26
121,Week end shopping with friends!,"Very historical building, public areas are very nice and the location is quite good! Service and staff very good although the room i was in was quite old, the mini bar made a terrible noise so I had to call the maintenance service who was very efficient and fast!  The bathtube was not working so Icould not take a bath to relax. The room smelt transpiration. I had to walk through several corridors to get to my room. My friends complained about the room which was terrible indeed, the staff put them in other room which was much better and which corresponds more to a luxury hotel! General opinion is the staff offers what people expect from a 5 stars hotel but the rooms on the high floors need a serious renovation! The room is quite and the bed very good!",3,2014,01,26
121,smoky room,"Stayed here with work. on entering the room, i found housekeeping spraying the room.At the time, this seemed a nice touch. when i returned back later on that night, the reason became apparant as the room stank of smoke.
 Clearly this was a known issue and they still went ahead and allocated the room. The breakfast was great, and the decor good, but these dont make up for the poor housekeeping. Wont be back.",2,2014,01,25
121,Good for Asians' looking for Asian fod,"The rooms are goods.
The food is good.
As a Vegetarian that to without eggs, etc) this place is good as it able to cater to the requirements including bread without eggs.
The spread is O.K.
The veg food is good 
The packed lunch is good as a veg need to take it.",4,2014,01,25
121,Regal but Run Down,"This is a majestic hotel at a great location... (Buckingham Gate). The property speaks of its regal charm with a very Kitschy Lobby ... but the regal charm almost ends here. The entire hotel appears to be in need of repair and better maintenance. Corridors smell of paint, but walls near the lifts are still run down. In the room, I was appalled to see the Coffee Maker shelf coming off...phew. The chair at the work desk can easily be sent to Christie's for an auction. Worst part was the below average pressure in the shower. All in all... Not a Taj standard in any way.
Best experience though was the food at Quilon !",3,2014,01,25
121,Wonderful stay!,"This was my first trip to the UK. I was working outside of London for 2 weeks and took the train into the city.   From the moment the doorman opened the taxi door until the moment he hailed a cab to take me back to Waterloo station, my visit was perfect. I extended my stay by one night because I didn't want to leave. It was a relaxing interlude in a hectic trip. Great location, too. Next time I'm in the area I'll be staying again.",5,2014,01,24
121,Service was perfect,"Great stay at the St. James Court hotel.. I needed to mail a physical hotel key back to Cologne, and Fred, the concierge got it done for me, that was really impressive.. somehow I had an unknown charge from the lobby bar, it was immediately removed when I told them it was not my bill, great location right in the middle of Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace... this is the place to stay in London.. Cheerio!",5,2014,01,23
121,Ideally located and a good hotel,"This was recently the Crowne Plaza with whom we actually booked. Clearly then it will take time for the new owners to develop their own style and refurbish. We got a very good deal for two nights and for the money we paid we can not really complain about anything. Having said that had I been paying the rack rate I would have said that the room we had was a little claustrophobic, the small window was opaque so their was no outside view and it was also very hot (even with no heating on). We were with friends and we requested and got adjoining rooms which was a bonus. The staff were all friendly and efficient. The hotel is perfect for a tourist trip to London, just round the corner from Buckingham Palace and is a 'nice' place to stay. Top tip though, for breakfast try the small cafe near the hotel on Petty France, full English for a fiver including tea!",4,2014,01,23
121,Excellent Stay,"Stayed here for one night for a special occasion. Was blown away by the hotel and its staff. Would definitely recommend! Reception team and concierge team was excellent, nothing was too much trouble and enjoy the bank restaurant and zanders bar. 
      
      ",5,2014,01,23
121,Impressed,"Stayed here for one night during a company trip to the capital.
Very efficient and friendly check in , the lobby looks the business and clearly all of the team are very customer friendly.
My room was on floor 3 , a bit of a maze to find your way through.
Good size , had everything you could need although as I was travelling light I missed some of the additional touches eg hair conditioner, lotions, etc
A good night's sleep only interrupted by the rumbling of the tube, but hey you have to expect that. Bed comfy , pillows way too hard for me.
Breakfast was efficient , tasty with a good choice.
I would come back here , and location wise very central you could walk to most of the main sites , a good choice.",4,2014,01,22
121,Another fantastic stay,"Stayed for the weekend with friends.  This was my second visit to the hotel, previously staying in August 2013.  Yet again we were treated brilliantly ,our rooms were upgraded upon arrival, the hotel staff (a special mention to Evelyn who looked after us in the bar) were fantastic and made our stay very enjoyable, great reception and bar areas. It was too cold to sit out in the courtyard area though, which was a pity. Hoping to return here again in April when we are back on London.
Would I recommend the hotel.....without a doubt, yes.",5,2014,01,22
121,"Big, Bold, And Not Enough","This is a nitpick review.  If I were reading this I'd say to myself, “the guys a complainer.”  Okay I am.  But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.  Give me a second.  You see the problem I have is that The St James, A Taj Hotel joins two big names and big continues from start to finish. The hotel competes with the “big boys”.  It aspires to grandeur.  It seeps opulence.  It makes a statement -come here and live like royalty, I mean look at the address: Buckingham Gate. And in my view this sets the standard.  If you play in the Premier League (Serie A, Major League Baseball, Ryder Cup) then that's what you should be judged on.  That's the basis for this review.

And here's the point: Does size matter? 

On first approach the classic Victorian-Edwardian Building with flags waving and elephants (Wood? Plaster?) down the driveway won me over.  The address suggested royalty -Buckingham Gate.   The St James has enough staff to support a small city.  Three or four staff in every category.  A gaggle of doormen at the front entrance.  Three behind the concierge desk.  Four bellhops.  Three people in uniform that milled around the lobby with no apparent job title other than smile and bow.  Marble stretched from front steps to the cafe at the rear, half the length of a football field.  The place teamed with staff.  I felt inadequate for not needing assistance, not knowing what to ask for.

And then I did.  It was a Sunday noon in January.  I approached the 50 foot reception bar with 4 receptionists behind and long lines (ques?) in front. What happened?  Lots of guests that weekend and everyone checking out the same time? A tour group?  A twenty minute wait and I was served.  Only no room was available and check-in wasn't until 2pm –same as most places, except the other places always had a room available.  Come back in two hours.  Fine. But my request for a walk-in shower and a room with a window facing the street was beyond the hotel's capability, never mind it boasts 338 rooms and a front that stretches from one side of the world to the other.  Nope. No rooms.  Couldn't be done. But they did upgrade me for a walk-in shower and a window that half-faced the street.  Only the room was interior courtyard with a tiny window.

Upgrade?  I must have dodged a bullet for not getting my original Classic.  Here again the emphasis was on big space and small value.  The twin beds were pulled apart from the standard classic double.  Not my idea of an upgrade or superior quality.  Plenty of closet space and the room was good enough for a mini-court which made it a surprise to have a 28inch TV that was 15 feet from the bed.  I should have packed opera glasses.  And TV quality?  I thought it was snowing.  And this was with cable too.  Would have been nice to recognize the teams on the fields. 

The hotel has conquered “Big” and now they need to work on “Better.” 

But that's me.  I'm a nit-picker for quality when quality is what's on offer and reflected in the bill.  I hope future reviewers can prove me an anomaly.  I want this to be a destination hotel in my future.  Why?  First, two very good local restaurants –try the nearby Bon Gusto Italian restaurant and the Royal Quarter Cafe with all-day  breakfast.  Another is that in the Spring and Summer this is a delightful walk  to St James Park.  Bus service on Victoria Street a plus as it avoids Tube-walking, if you know what I mean.

My suggestion: Go the whole hog, opt for the executive suite  --and let us know the value for money ratio.",3,2014,01,22
121,Excellent hotel with fantastic staff ,"Stayed for two nights with 5 friends and found here a great hotel with staff who could not do enough for us. Warm welcome on arrival that continued throughout our stay. Rooms of a very high standard and very comfy beds. Great facilities, bars and restaurants. Would love to return in the summer to sit in the beautiful courtyard. Excellent place. ",5,2014,01,21
121,London Value,"It's a very nice to change to stay at a decent London hotel and find good value and good service. And this was exactly my recent experience at the Crowne Plaza, St James, (Now renamed the St James's Court Tag). The hotel boasts good sized bedrooms, a great bar and lobby and good restaurants. Staff are efficient and friendly and, of course, many great London sites and amenities are close to hand. The hotel is, in fact, a minor miracle by London standards.    ",4,2014,01,21
121,What a fabulous stay!,"The best London hotel we have had the pleasure of staying in, so far. The staff are so friendly and courteous, helpful and polite. It seemed that nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was fantastic and had so many choices it was impossible to not like something. They also offered to cook fresh anything that wasn't in the buffet, which my wife took advantage of bith mornings. The lobby is very sumptious and classy, with the doormen greeting you with a smile on every entry or exit. We had drinks in both the lobby bar and the Zander bar and both were staffed by very polite and helpful people. We will definately stay again when in London. Our room was plenty large enough and well furnished. It was very quiet during the night with no noise from adjacent rooms or the hall. Our room was also very clean and the King bed was huge. All in all, a perfect stay!",5,2014,01,21
121,Great hotel in a great location,A second visit for us and just as good as before. Location great for London tourists. Hotel is comfortable and smart. We had a room overlooking the courtyard which made it nice and quiet. Check in time (2pm) and checkout time (noon) generous in comparison to some other similar hotels.,5,2014,01,21
121,Good location. Decent Hotel,"Booked this stay with Crowne Plaza at offer rate - which was honoured by the new Taj owners. Great bargain at the price - but looking at full price here, I think I would have been disappointed to pay so much more! Very convenient location for tourist attractions. Wonderful Courtyard. Good staff. Our room had a 'bijou' bathroom, but adequate. Very quiet. Free Wi-fi was poor service. Enjoyed our stay and would return at right price!",4,2014,01,21
121,"Good location, great lobby but dated rooms","This hotel has a nice location close to Buckingham palace. The exterior, lobby and restaurant are nicely decorated and you feel very welcomed. Unfortunately my room was quite small and rather dated, although in comparison to other hotels in London, it was good.
Beds were very comfortable and i sleept well and had a nice breakfast.",4,2014,01,20
121,Great location,"Stayed a couple of nights at this hotel, the room was plenty big enough and breakfast was very good, specially the Indian hot option.  My only gripe was that the bed was very very hard and the pillows were like bricks.  Check in was quick and we used the express check out which I would recommend.",4,2014,01,20
121,"Great location, gorgeous lobby, comfortable but dated rooms","Stayed here in the early part of June 2013. We paid for superior rooms. Received a spacious room toward the front of the hotel on the fourth floor. Beautiful view of the interior courtyard. Old rickety windows.  Drapes were worn and did not fully close to keep light out at night. Our room was clean and comfortable but the bedding and furniture looked old and worn. We received very nice aromatherapy toiletries and daily chocolates and shortbread cookies. The tea and coffee in the room was poor quality but the tea and coffee downstairs was excellent. We enjoyed high tea with sandwiches and snacks during our stay. This was a highlight to our stay. It was not cheap but became a beautiful memory. The hotel appears to be multiple buildings attached. The floors in the halls are uneven and the carpet is old, dirty and worn. I ventured throughout the hotel during my stay. The back of the hotel is not as desirable as the front. In desperate need of updating. The steam room in the basement was more like a tiny closet with a single bench for one. Yuck. The spa area did not look inviting. We had breakfasts included in our stay at Bistro 51. I can't say enough good things about this lovely little restaurant. The full breakfast daily was filled with many choices of foods.  It was delicious. I was very impressed. The dining areas are sunny, well lit and beautifully appointed.  The staff was personable and attentive. Everything was clean. This is a must see if you are in the St. James area. Very close to Victoria Station. Buckingham Palace is at the end of the block. Maybe a 7-10 min walk. Charming residential area in an historic area. I would stay here again. The concierge was a bit arrogant but helpful.",4,2014,01,19
121,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"I booked this when it was a Crowne Plaza and was pleasantly surprised that they honoured my Platinum status with a nice upgraded room.  The hotel is minutes away from Buckingham Palace and Westminster and is in a beautiful building.  

Check-In was quick and friendly and my room was upgraded to a Suite.  The room was very modern and had an extra room which had a wardrobe in it and a nice modern bathroom.  The pillows were a bit uncomfortable and the room had zero soundproofing - I could hear conversations in rooms above me and at the side which was not great.

The hotel has many restaurants and bars to choose from.  All pleasant and with a great choice of food.  Perfect for someone who likes to remain in the hotel after a day of walking!

It is a shame this hotel is no longer part of IHG as I would have made tiny regular - I am glad I have experienced it though and may be tempted back!",4,2014,01,19
121,Chic and elegant,"We 4 ladies celebrated a birthday weekend in London and at the last minute switched from nearby (staid) Ruben's at the Palace to St James Court.  We LOVED the St James Court - we could have sat in the chic and fabulous lobby for hours, enjoying the décor as well as the chic bar.  It is well-located, about 10 min from Victoria Station by foot, on a quiet street near shopping and restaurants.  Our booking had promised us ""adjoining rooms"", which proved to be not only NOT 'adjoining', but also not even 'adjacent', but after insistent discussion with the hotel reception, a manager kindly upgraded us to a fabulous suite straight across from an executive room, at the end of a hall where we had a private door leading to our 2 rooms.  We couldn't have been happier.  The staff was very attentive to our needs - moving luggage, bringing us ice / scissors / whatever else we could dream up, and overall we just had a LOT of fun.  The hotel's chic décor and attention to detail made it a big hit with all of us.  No question , we will be back.",5,2014,01,19
121,Excellent Taj experience,"The room was booked when this was a Crowne Plaza hotel. Though a change to the Taj brand my IHG status was recognised and I was upgraded to a recently refurbished executive room. 

Spacious for a London hotel with a very comfortable bed and bedding, useful desk and nice bathroom with good towels. 

All the staff encountered were friendly and had a desire to give an excellent experience.

And I do like this location. Convenient for the West End and other tourist sites and with some good value for money local pubs and cafes.

Recommended.",5,2014,01,18
121,A BIT OF ADDED TAJ CLASS?,"I've been staying here for a few years - when it was Crowne Plaza - and it's always good. Lovely clean room, excellent service, nice buffet breakfast. No complaints - and obviously, for tourists, a great location. I think Taj will make this an even better hotel.",5,2014,01,17
121,We'll be back!,"I thought the location good for us, closest tube St James Park. Room had all the required items for a two night stay and room 279 was quiet and comfortable. Breakfast not taken at the hotel, as at £20.50+ I didn't this good value. Nor was Royal Quarter opposite. However, my favourite Le Pain Quotidien did a great de-tox breakfast at a great price. Google it!",5,2014,01,17
121,Great Location,"Within easy walking distance of Victoria tube/railway and St James tube. Buckingham Palace/Green Park/St James Park nearby. Service first rate from all hotel staff. Very good breakfast, but did not get around to dinner/lunch unfortunately as we run out of time!The room was very comfortable, clean, quiet and ours was actually pretty big for a city hotel. Would not hesitate to come back.",5,2014,01,14
121,"Last review for the Crowne Plaza St James and first for St James Court, a Taj Hotel. What next for this old favourite?","This perfect gem of a hotel has been owned by the Tata group of companies for some years but run as a Crowns Plaza. However, on my last visit I learned that it will cease to be a Crowne Plaza Hotel and member of the IHG brand and will become a Taj Hotel on 6th January 2014. In fact, the signage has already changed and observant guests will notice the new plaques which announce the hotel as ‘St James Court, a Taj Hotel’. 

In my opinion, all members of staff at this hotel have always displayed a level of care and attention to their client’s needs, which is way above the norm, this couldn’t happen in China, or in most other hotels, worldwide. It is the little things which make this hotel exceptional, like moving one to a different breakfast room when the restaurant is overcrowded and one is in a hurry because of work commitments; the concierge finding theatre seats for a sold-out show, where none exist! Looking after a son’s bicycle, storing cases, parking cars and guarding precious dogs. A hotel that cares about its guests is a successful hotel because those guests become loyal adherents to the establishment and never go anywhere else. Long may this level of service continue under the Taj banner.

Binoy, the deputy head concierge is a fitting replacement for Mr David Burner, who served the hotel as head concierge for over thirty years. His will be a hard act to follow and all regular guests will miss him sorely but I am sure that the team will continue to serve to the very best of their abilities; I wish Binoy all the best in his new position.

I wait with bated breath, as the dear old St. James Hotel takes this next step in its long and successful history. I shall be back in the New Year and wish the St. James Court Hotel under the Taj logo all the very best and hopefully, we can look forward to a new era in hotel management excellence. Watch this space for further reviews.",5,2014,01,14
121,Great Location,"Arrived at the hotel around noon. We were able to check in ready for our room when it became available at 2pm. I found the check-in staff to be slow, surly and unhelpful.
The hotel was in a great location, within walking distance of Victoria station and underground.
Our room was relaxing and clean. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom spotless with a good selection of toiletries etc. Everything at hand in the room e.g. tea, coffee etc.
Upon leaving we had a fast and easy check-out which was far better.
Highly recommend this hotel for the location alone.",4,2014,01,12
121,Brilliant Location,"Excellent, safe location within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, St James tube station, the Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, The Eye etc. Lovely room with free wifi! A great English pub up the road plus a handy convenience store a couple of doors down.",4,2014,01,12
121,Good location,"We booked this hotel as it was within walking distance of the theatre so the location was excellent - also well placed for other attractions such as Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey etc.

All the staff are very friendly and helpful and we like the car parking valet arrangment.

The reception area is lovely but unfortunately as soon as we got out of the lift for our floor, it struck us as very shabby and badly in need of redecoratiing etc.  We had booked a king room but the bed was just a normal double.  The windows were very old and grubby and in need of a few coats of paint - no double glazing - so as we overlooked a building site - it was very noisy - but the work did stop about 7pm.  The good thing about the old sash window was that we could open it during the night as the ac was not very efficient!

The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet - just that compared with other hotels in this class - it was disappointing.  Also, the breakfast was not included which incurred another £40 to our bill.

But having said all that - the hotel is in an excellent location and the staff from the reception to the ladies changing the rooms are all first class.",3,2014,01,11
121,Fantastic experience !,"We enjoyed this hotel a lot, the staff was gentle and helpful, luxurious atmosphere, many facilities : fitness centre, Bistro 51 (breakfast buffet was awesome), the Bank restaurant is great.. We loved the Hamptons bar, high class design in the hotel hall..we will definitely visit it again  :) ",5,2014,01,09
121,Charming hotel for India lovers!,"Excellent reception by Bell captain, nice reception.
Wonderfully restored buildings, quite winding with romantic courtyard.
Room was spacious with perfect air conditioning and also the bathroom was perfect.
Bed very nice with soft pillows.
Unfortunately, the spa does not meet the hotel standard: Flooring extremely slippery, service absent, insufficient hygiene in the pool (foreign management?)",5,2024,10,07
121,Location and attention,"It is a hotel of an excellent Indian chain, with a very good location: the metro station is 5-7 minutes away, a small grocery store right next door, and on Victoria Street only 4-5 minutes away there are shops, pharmacies, money exchange, restaurants, etc.
The hotel offers a spa, hairdresser, fitness center, and has 3 restaurants.
Breakfast is varied and hearty.
The hotel is perhaps over-decorated, but the rooms are sober and spotless. Of course, it is huge so you have to try to order rooms near the main building.
Its staff is first class, friendly, polite, solicitous....",5,2024,09,24
121,Group hotel,This hotel is not an individual hotel but aimed at Indian groups. The rooms totally outdated- toilet calcified. A single lift for an entire hotel - you wait until 10/25. Minutes. Breakfast place totally crowded- Food geared towards Indian guests. Totally disappointing for us.,2,2024,08,19
121,Bad experience,"Bad rooms, old, inadequate reception. I had to change the room. Untrained staff, carpeting in the room, old furniture and room overlooking an inner courtyard and above a roof so I couldn't even open the window. I had dinner at the hotel, asked to stay in the inner courtyard outside but was denied. Horrible burger. Not recommended!",1,2024,08,12
121,Hotel with atmosphere,"Nice hotel located in Westminster. Courteous staff. Good service. Excellent breakfast. We also had a very good dinner at the restaurant. Prices normal. The only flaw is the third added bed which is not a bed but a camp bed not suitable for an adult, definitely not in line with the standard of the hotel.",4,2024,04,10
121,"Great hotel, great service, perfect starting point","Very nice hotel. The staff is very accommodating. Typical Indian hospitality. The rooms are clean and there are all amenities from free water to Molton Brown shower gel and shampoo. 
We had a beautifully renovated room with a view of the school. The ambience of the inner courtyard is spectacular. Be sure to look at it in the evening under the lights. We ate at The51 one evening. The food was very good and Indian spicy. 
The hotel is in a great location for walking to all the top spots in London. 
The only downside is that you can't have breakfast in the hotel. It's completely fine to wait for your seat, but the coffee took so long that we were usually finished with breakfast before it arrived.",5,2024,03,10
121,Visiting friends,"Our third visit to a hotel in the TAJ group. Everything is just perfect! Attentive and always friendly staff, beautiful rooms and an outstanding breakfast. On future trips we will check whether there is a TAJ hotel nearby!",5,2024,02,06
121,Excellent hotel in central London,"Excellent hotel in a very central area. Beautiful common areas and garden. Spacious and comfortable room. We also tried the hotel spa, very nice.
Excellent breakfast, very varied.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
The price is certainly not too cheap but highly recommended.
",5,2024,01,07
121,Very good experience,"Excellent location of the hotel, excellent rooms, efficient and pleasant staff.
The only thing that isn't up to par, in my opinion, is the breakfast. Long waiting times and product quality... so-so.",4,2024,01,04
121,Very nice and centrally located hotel,"Very nice and centrally located hotel. Large and clean room, very quiet. The spa area is very clean. The breakfast offers a lot of choice and everything is delicious. The staff are all friendly and helpful. We felt comfortable there.",5,2023,10,10
121,Short stay 5-day trip,"Highly recommended hotel with excellent service, outstanding facilities and a great breakfast. Very central location, all the important sights are within walking distance. The rooms are of the latest standard, the inner courtyard is decorated with beautiful flowers and is very well maintained. Feeling good is the order of the day here.",5,2023,09,22
121,Good but could be improved on care and cleaning.,"Hotel that appears almost luxury. Some gems are notable. Room recently refreshed, shame about the carpet. Cleanliness is the real problem: the cups and glasses in the room were dirty and sticky. I asked for a replacement and the new ones were a little better but not perfect. The fruit plate was accompanied by a knife that was not changed for 3 days, even though I used it. The staff was always very kind. A little more effort and we would have an excellent rating, also because the room was paid for more than 400 pounds per night.",4,2023,09,17
121,Luxurious hotel in a prime location,"The hotel is in a great location, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, etc. are within walking distance. The subway station is also close by.
The hotel is in the luxury segment and the service wasn't good enough for me. Reception was good, but not yet well-coordinated, and we weren't served very courteously at breakfast. Otherwise everything was good and clean.",3,2023,09,10
121,Stay in London,"Very attentive staff, we asked for a room change because the teenagers did not want to sleep in the same bed and without problems. The rooms are very comfortable and the pillows and mattress are fantastic. Everything was very clean and after intense days, when you arrived at the hotel you had a great gym and a spa that wasn't bad at all to end the day. The location of the hotel is unbeatable! I would definitely repeat the experience.",4,2023,08,16
121,Family trip to London,"We stayed for 4 days in this hotel, with the whole family: so much courtesy, attention and cleanliness. A varied and abundant breakfast. Very kind and professional staff.
The hotel is a convenient area of London for walking in the parks, seeing attractions and well served by public transport.",5,2023,08,06
121,tutto fantastico: accoglienza in primis!,"Consciergie, reception, ristorante e personale delle camere fantastico: accoglienti, gentili, disponibili.
Hotel per posizione, arredamento davvero bello. 
Unico aspetto negativo: terzo letto nella camera doppia troppo piccolo e sconfortevole per ragazzi di 13 (camera 429) e 15 (camera 416) anni. 
Scirvete più chiaramente che la piscina non è accessibile agli under 18!
Costo camera colazione adatto, invece troppo caro ristorante per cena, in particolare i piatti semplici come hamburger e toast.
",5,2023,04,22
121,Excelente opción!,"Excelente ubicación (muy cerca de Buckingham palace y estación de metro),  habitación impecable, personal muy servicial, desayuno con variedad y gran calidad. Sin duda volveríamos a hospedarlos en St Jame´s court",5,2023,04,20
121,Tolles Hotel in der Nähe des Buckingham Palastes,"Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Alles, angefangen beim super freundlichen Personal bis zum tollen Frühstück, war perfekt.
In 5 Minuten ist man am Buckingham Palast und auch Victoria Station ist nur 8 Minuten Gehzeit entfernt.
Wir können dieses Hotel sehr empfehlen.
P.S. Wir hatten ein Upgrade auf ein neu renoviertes Zimmer bekommen, welches sehr schön war.",5,2023,03,08
121,Wir kommen gerne wieder!,"Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich. Das Zimmer ist zwar etwas älter aber sehr geräumig und sauber.
Frühstück ist spitze. Die Lage ist außerdem perfekt. Sehr viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß erreichbar. Hotel kann man nur weiter empfehlen.",5,2023,03,04
121,Muy mejorable habitacion para minusvalidos,"Habitacion muy descuidada en mantenimiento y antigua. Focos fundidos y parecia que fuera una habitacion para minusvalidos, lejos de lo que esperaba para pasar con mi mujer San Valentin. Me gustó mucho el Hall del hotel y el desayuno. No me gustó el acabado de la habitación pero si su tamaño.",3,2023,02,17
121,Musik- und Filmwochenende in London,"Wir haben ein Executive King Room gebucht. Grosszügiges Zimmer, Bad eher klein aber renoviert. 
Es gab alles was man an Ausstattung benötigt, Sonderwünsche wurden vor Anreise bereitgestellt. Die Matratzen könnten in nächster Zeit ausgewechselt werden da ziemlich durchgelegen. Das Frühstück war ausgezeichnet, der Staff war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend vom Check-In über Aufenthalt (Concierge) bis zum Check-Out. 
Ein Minuspunkt: Schlecht erzogene, arrogante und unfreundliche indische Hotelgäste welche meinten, das Hotel und der Service sei exklusiv für sie da. Das Personal gibt sein Bestes, freundlich und zuvorkommend. Auf keinen Fall trotz kundenorientiertem Business würde ich mit mir so sprechen lassen. Das ist einfach schade.",5,2023,02,06
121,Molto classico ma bello,Camera molto carina in quanto come prima volta mi hanno fatto l’upgrade alle camere ristrutturate nella nuova ala con parquet. La mia collega invece aveva una camera più vecchiotta e non era molto bella. L’hotel è molto classico e grande. Colazione eccezionale e super fornita. A me piacciono hotel più moderni ma non posso non dare un buon punteggio.,4,2023,01,22
121,Non Capisco..,"Non sono certo che questa recensione verrà pubblicata MA ritengo giusto che gli avventori vengano messi al corrente anche del comportamento prima dell’eventuale soggiorno da parte della struttura.
Per essere brevi:
Io ho sempre alloggiato al 51 Buckingham Gate e 1 volta al St. James, dove mi sono sempre trovato benissimo. Prima del COVID, ho alloggiato con la mia ragazza in quest’ultimo! La recensione che ho scritto ne è la prova a tutti gli effetti.
In quella occasione scrissi che il direttore si raccomandò tanto affinché noi tornassimo  dopo che ci piovve in faccia durante la notte a causa di una grave infiltrazione!
Passato il covid, mando una mail al direttore per poter usufruire di uno sconto importante proposto da lui stesso proprio dovuto dalla pessima esperienza ( pagata per intera) vissuta.
Alle mie DUE email, NESSUNO ha mai risposto.
Non mi interessa tanto dello sconto, ma del comportamento poco professionale da parte di una struttura a 5 Stelle.
Anche queste sono esperienze.
La Morale? A Capodanno sarò in un altro albergo che mi ha accolto proponendomi un Upgrade gratuito.",2,2022,12,04
121,"Schade, dass eine durchgelegene Mulde im Bett den Schlaf raubte und dass trotz Reklamation nichts unternommen wurde.","Ein Hotel mit tollen Mitarbeitern aber dem schlechtesten Bett, das man regelrecht erleiden muss. Total und tief durchgelegen. Trotzt Reklamation an der Reception wurde nichts unternommen.
Während viertägigem Aufenthalt fuhren von zwei Liften nur einer was enorme Wartezeiten und übervollen Lift zur Folge hatte.
Es gab auch viel Gutes in dem Hotel. Das Essen ist, wenn auch nicht erstklassig, gut und vielfältig. 
Am besten gefallen hat uns das Personal. Auffallend freundlich!",3,2022,11,21
121,Justo lo que quería  ,"Excelente ubicación  a unos metros del palacio de Buckingham, el personal muy atento y servicial en especial Diego el concierge es un muy buen guía en lo personal nos ayudo con reservar restaurantes; Bashir de recepción igualmente muy atento y de gran ayuda ",5,2022,09,13
121,Ottimo soggiorno,"Ottimo soggiorno , Federica alla reception ci ha coccolato in maniera professionale ed umana . 
Ci ha risolto ogni problema soprattutto il giorno dello sciopero 
L’hotel è situato vicino alla metropolitana e situato in prossimità di attrazioni",5,2022,08,23
121,Great spot,"Gran Lugar
El hotel está súper buen ubicado! Las habitaciones son muy cómodas y el desayuno muy bien servido y con muchas opciones! Recomiendo que busquen habitaciones con el mismo incluido ya que si vale la pena! Desde el hotel puedes caminar muy fácil a los puntos importantes de la ciudad!",5,2022,08,06
121,Estadia en Londres,"Muy amables, siempre listos a atender, pedimos un cuarto con mejor vista y lo hicieron, fueron muy queridos y se acordaban que habiamos estado un  tiempo atras.  Hay un colombiano muy amable que siempre esta dispuesto a ayudar en todo, y muy servicial",5,2022,08,01
121,Bene ma non ottimo,"Bellissimo hotel, le zone comuni come la colazione sono eccellenti. La camera che mi è stata riservata però non era assolutamente all’altezza dell’hotel e del prezzo pagato.
Nell’armadio c’era una finestra per ispezionare il cavedio degli impianti, completamente a vista….la parte in legno che doveva coprire era completamente staccata. Il bagno veramente piccolo era accettabile, ma bisognevole di qualche intervento.
La cosa peggiore, dal mio punto di vista, la finestra con vetri offuscati e non apribile. Infine, non ho capito cosa fosse, ma di notte proprio dalla finestra giungevano strani rumori che, in più di un’occasione, hanno rovinato il sonno.",3,2022,07,23
121,Hotel elegante in zona elegante,"Ottimo hotel in prossimità di buckingham palace , in tranquillissima ed elegante zona.   Camere molto pulite e bagni nuovi.  Colazione in bel cortile interno. Personale molto gentile e visto il gran caldo acqua minerale ogni giorno in camera.  Consigliato",5,2022,07,20
121,Unverhofft stuck in London - gerne wieder,"Sehr komfortables Hotel in bester Lage, sehr modern und sauber, super Atmosphäre, sehr guter und aufmerksamer Service, netter Check-in Check-out Prozess, obwohl beides mitten in der Nacht stattfand.

121,Platinum Jubilee,"la scelta di quetso hotel è stata dettata  dalla vicinanza ai luoghi dove si sarebbero svolti i principali eventi del giubileo. La partecipazione agli eventi si sentiva anche senza essere materialmente presenti sul luogo. Buono il ristorante. Camere con qualche pecca fortunatamente risolta. Personale cortese. Ma è soprattutto la presenza della receptionist Federica che con la sua disponibilità, i suoi preziosi consigli ed il suo aiuto ha reso il nostro soggiorno veramente piacevole. Dvvero piacevole ed inaspettata è stata la tortina che Federica ci ha fatto trovare in camera per il mio compleanno. Davvero impagabile.",5,2022,06,06
121,Da ist noch Luft nach oben.,"Ein sehr schönes Gebäude mit einem tollen Innenhof, wo man auch sitzen und ein Glas trinken kann. So toll die Fassade ist, der Inhalt hat noch Luft nach oben. 

Nach dem Entree und der Lobby, die dem Standard angemessen waren, wurden wir sehr freundlich begrüßt. Da das Zimmer noch nicht fertig war, sind wir nochmals in die Stadt gegangen. Die Lage des Hotels ist nämlich super, um Sightseeing (Buckingham Palace etc.) und Shopping zu betreiben. Wir würden auch angerufen werden, sobald das Zimmer fertig sei.

Der Anruf blieb leider aus und als wir zurück kamen, standen unserer Koffer immer noch da. Die (neue) Rezeptionistin wusste dann auch nicht, dass wir schon eingecheckt hätten sein sollen. Also alles nochmal von vorne.

Das Zimmer war ok, aber etwas oll. Nicht im Sinne von Noblesse und altmodisch. Kaffeemaschine, Kekse etc. versöhnten uns dann wieder etwas. 

Das Bad ist ok, könnte aber auch modernisiert werden.",3,2022,05,28
121,In visita con amici,"Non tornerò mai più in questo albergo, molto costoso e non all’altezza del prezzo. 
Non sono state fatte le pulizie nella stanza nonostante 3 solleciti e l’attesa di un ora (dalle 18.09 alle 19.00) fuori dalla stanza (al bar) per permettergli le pulizie al nostro rientro in camera non era successo niente, siamo usciti alle 20.15 sollecitando nuovamente ed al nostro ritorno la nostra stanza era sempre in disordine, senza asciugamani puliti, acqua e quant’altro 
Ho pagato anticipatamente al mio arrivo in struttura la colazione e per entrambe le mattine ho avuto da discutere perché non risultava il prenotazione. Inammissibile in un albergo che vuol essere 4 stelle lusso

121,"Lage Top, Zimmer Flop","Top Lage und nur wenige Minuten von vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten entfernt und gutes Frühstück. Zimmer waren ein Flop (eher wir ein  2 Sterne Standard), da fühlt man sich nicht richtig wohl und das bei dem Preis. Lange Wartezeiten am Fahrstuhl, 1 Tag ging ein Fahrstuhl nicht und keiner hat sich gekümmert. Frage nach einer zweiten Decke hat 12 Stunden gebraucht und 3 Anläufe bis es erledigt war. Inneneinrichtung in die Jahre gekommen zB gehen die Zimmertelefone nicht, in einem der 4 Zimmer hatten wir am ersten Tag kein Strom. Insgesamt hatten wir aber eine tolle Reise da wir viele coole Sachen gesehen haben und man eh nicht so viel auf dem Zimmer ist. Nächster London Trip würde ich wieder die Ecke nehmen aber das 4-5 Sterne Hotel gegenüber, das sah deutlich  edler aus.",3,2022,04,23
121,In zentraler Lage mit hervorragendem Frühstück ,"Zwischen Buckingham Palace und Big Ben gelegen, ist das Hotel perfekt für Stadtbesichtigungen geeignet. Die Zimmer sind in Ordnung, wenn auch nicht überwältigend. Dafür kann das exzellente Frühstück a la carte umso mehr begeistern. Hier unbedingt früh hingehen, ansonsten kann es Wartezeiten geben. Dabei bietet sich auch eine Besichtigung des schönen Innenhofs an. Der sehr gute Service rundet einen schönen Aufenthalt ab.",5,2022,04,18

121,Ein mega tolles Hôtel,"Wir waren als Familie hier mit unserem 8 monatigen Kind. Wir hatten in der 7. Etage unser Zimmer und es  war vollkommen ruhig. Die Fenster gingen zum Hinterhof raus. Ein Babybett war trotz Buchung nicht im Zimmer vorhanden aber wurde sofort nach unserer Ankunft nach gerüstet. Wir hatten sehr viel Platz und ein Queensize Bett (in Deutschland ca. 180x200 cm) aber dies haben wir alles so gebucht, damit wir mit Kind auch den nötigen Platz haben, was natürlich nicht ganz so günstig war. Das Zimmer war sauber und es wurde täglich gereinigt. Das Bad war mit einer Badewanne ausgestattet in der man duschen konnte. Einziges Manko war das wir keine Toilettenbürste hatten aber dies scheint in den Hotels Standard zu sein. War natürlich etwas unangenehm aber wenn es normal ist, dann ist es eben so. Auf unseren Zimmer hatten wir eine Kaffeepadmaschine und einen Wasserkocher mit verschiedenen Teesorten. Wir hatten nur mit Frühstück gebucht, weil wir den ganzen Tag unterwegs sein wollten und überall konnte man sich was zu Essen kaufen. Das Frühstück war zum Teil europäisch und zum größten Teil britisch. Da es zu einer indischen Kette gehört waren auch indische Speisen zum Frühstück vorhanden. Das Personal war immer freundlich und zuvorkommend, wir haben dadurch uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Wir können dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen.",5,2022,04,04
121,Estancia muy buena,"La habitación estaba bien, muy limpia las camas y almohadas perfectas para diferentes gustos.  El cafe de cortesia te lo reponen solicitandolo sin cargo. El spa de libre utilización correcto. Volveriamos al mismo hotel",5,2022,03,15

121,Reise in die Vergangenheit,"Es war schön da anzukommen. Vor über 35 Jahren begann meine Laufbahn in der Hotellerie im St. James Court - best place to stay near Buckingham Palace. Damals als Minibar-Attendend. Meine Aufgabe Ende der 1980er war es dort Minibars aufzufüllen. Und natürlich war ich aufgeregt, dort nach so langer Zeit als Gast zu logieren. Das Gebäude hat den Charme nach wie vor erhalten. Der Service ist immer noch unglaublich gut. Unser Zimmer im Neubau war allerdings eine Enttäuschung. Alles war ordentlich und ok, doch wenig einladend. Die Heizung im Zimmer funktionierte ein bisschen, die im Bad so gar nicht. Eine Toilettenbürste gab es nur nach Nachfrage. Diese wurde ohne Auffangbehälter auf den Schank unter dem Waschbecken gelegt. Auch am zweiten Tag war es kalt. Schade! Das Frühstück loben wir wirklich!  Täglich wechselnde Auswahl kalt-warmer-Gerichte. Pandemie-Bedingt war die Bar geschlossen. Für fast 1.100 EUR für 2 Nächte hatten wir etwas mehr erwartet.",3,2022,02,05
121,Exzellent !,"Wir reisten vom 7.-9. September 2020 nach London und entschieden uns für das St. James' Court. 
Das war die beste Entscheidung, die wir treffen konnten. Das Hotel hat wirklich alles getan, um uns den Aufenthalt so schön wie nur möglich zu machen. Exzellenter Service, Zimmer-Upgrade und immer super freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal ! So macht London spaß !",5,2020,09,10

121,Mein Pied à terre in London,"Wenn ich in London bin (und ich bin oft dort!), logiere ich entweder bei Freunden oder im St. James' Court. Ich kehre immer wieder gerne in dieses Hotel zurück. Gute Lage, angenehme Zimmer, umfassender, professioneller und freundlicher Service, gute Restaurants und Bars.",5,2020,03,11
121,Bellissima vacanza,"Ho soggiornato in questo bellissimo hotel e mi sono trovata benissimo.
Personale attento ad ogni richiesta e preparato, gentilissimi tutti.
La stanza dove ho dormito era grande e spaziosa, (peccato solo per la moquette che a me personalmente non piace e la trovo un po’ antica).
Il bagno  con vasca grande e pulito  come il resto della camera, (la pulizia di tutto l’hotel mi ha lasciata molto soddisfatta). In più , una bellissima SPA con piscina , sauna e bagno turco ti permette di rilassarti dopo una lunga giornata a giro per la stupenda Londra! 
Se dovessi tornar a Londra sicuramente soggiornerei ancora qui.",5,2020,03,01
121,Perfetto!!!!,Zona tranquilla vicino alla metropolitana e Buckingham palace e alle principali località ed attrazioni/musei; stanza molto pulita e silenziosa. Personale gentile e professionale (il migliore Roberto) reception con molti italiani.,5,2020,02,16
121,Excelente opción!,"Hermoso hotel, nos quedamos 4 noches y nos tocó una habitación bastante amplia, ya que estaba acondicionada para personas con discapacidad. Mucha atención en los detalles, como agua de cortesía todos los días, un chocolate, pantuflas, etc. 
Cuando llegamos nos recibió Nicolás, que es español y nos facilitó bastante las cosas,  explicándonos todo muy amablemente.
El único inconveniente que tuvimos fue con la calefacción, que la revisaron y nos dijeron que funcionaba bien, pero nunca llegó a levantar la temperatura, así que al salir de la cama sentíamos un poco de frío.
Ubicación ideal, cerca de todo! Sin dudas volvería a elegirlo!",5,2020,02,14
121,Un piacevole soggiorno,"All’inizio di gennaio di ogni anno, facciamo un viaggio a Londra. Siamo stati in molti hotel nel centro di Londra e questo è sicuramente uno dei migliori. Oltre ad essere molto bello, ha delle belle camere, buona pulizia e personale efficiente. In particolare IRENE, alla reception, che con la sua cortesia ci ha assistito per tutta la nostra permanenza (è stato molto comodo aver potuto parlare in italiano) ed EROL, nella sala colazione, che si è assicurato che tutto fosse perfetto. Ci torneremo sicuramente.",5,2020,02,02
121,Hotel fantastico ... peccato per l’ospitalità!,"Hotel fantastico... vicinissimo alle attrazioni più importanti, giri L angolo e ti trovi a Buckingham Palace o Big ben! Metropolitana a due minuti a piedi,diversamente a 5 minuti ti trovi alla fermata Victoria della metro dove arrivano anche i treni per L aereoporto! 
Colazione fantastica , camera standard pulitissima e accogliente! Diciamo che L hotel è fantastico !!! 
Peccato però che al mio arrivò, alle h02.30 di notte, volevano che pagassi il saldo della camera. 
Avevo un problema con la carta bancomat che non mi faceva pagare e avendo con me solo euro ho chiesto se potevo pagarla il giorno seguente dopo aver cambiato i soldi.
A quel punto La mattina dopo sono uscita e sono andata a cambiare i soldi, però essendo li per visitare la città ho pensato di non rientrare in albergo subito e di tornare direttamente il pomeriggio per non perdere tempo. Al mio rientro passo in reception e saldo subito la camera. 
Quando arrivò in camera trovò una lettera dove mi chiedevano di passare dalla reception per il saldo!!!! Che cosa sgradevole!!! Mica scappavo !!! Questo non è stato di certo una bel gesto ... per i resto tutto ok !!!",4,2020,01,28
121,Deluso... ,"Dopo più di 1 anno, il mio secondo soggiorno, la mia seconda volta (assolutamente soddisfacente la prima) presso il bello, affascinante, St James Court, mi ha deluso... Dunque arrivo in serata, check in, entro in camera e, sorpresa... NON ci stanno le tovaglie e asciugamani (ne per mani, ne per viso, ne per il corpo) nel bagno...GRAVE, gravissimo...
Dopo aver parlato alla reception, ovvio dopo un po di tempo arriva ciò che manca. Ma fate il controllo delle camere prima di assegnale ai clienti? Ci sta una housekeeping?... un responsabile delle camere? Non è stato bello, e cose così assolutamente non devono accadere in alberghi di un certo livello...
Posso capire se si sa fa un check in piuttosto presto verso mezzogiorno o poco più tardi, ma non alla sera... Non è gradevole entrare in camera e vedere il bagno completamente sprovvisto di asciugamani e tovaglie per la propria igiene...
Cattivo odore tipo muffa in bagno... ",3,2020,01,07
121,Wundervoll - Service der Extraklasse,"Wir haben das Hotel aufgrund seiner hervorragenden geographischen Lage ausgewählt. Es ist nur einen Katzensprung von so ziemlich allem entfernt, was man bei einem Aufenthalt in London sehen möchte. 
Fußläufig zu erreichen: 
Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Hyde Park, Big Ben, London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Regent Street, Oxford Street..... von Victoria Station 5 Gehminuten. 
Ja das Hotel ist ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen, aber das tut dem ganzen keinen Abbruch. Der Service ist erstklassig, man kümmert sich sofort um alle Anliegen des Gastes. Am ersten Tag kamen wir vor dem eigentlichen Check-In an und es war leider kein Zimmer bezugsfähig, uns wurde angeboten die Koffer einlagern zu lassen, damit wir sofort starten könnten - was wir dann auch getan haben. Die Koffer wurden weit vor unserer Rückkehr ins Hotel auf unser Zimmer gebracht, wo diese auf uns gewartet haben. Wir haben nach der ersten Nacht das Zimmer getauscht, da wir ein größeres Bett benötigt haben. Das Queen-Size Bett war für zwei großgewachsene Personen dann doch etwas zu klein. Wir wurden nach dem Wechsel zwei Mal angerufen um sich zu erkundigen, ob wir mit dem neuen Zimmer zufrieden sind. Auch der gesamte Umzug klappte dank des sehr zuverlässigen Personals prima. Die Zimmer sind groß und geräumig, zwar etwas älter aber stilvoll und gemütlich eingerichtet. 
Das einzige Manko ist die Prozedur rund um das Frühstück. Der Raum ist viel zu klein für die Masse an Hotelgästen und darüber hinaus viel zu eng bestuhlt. Man wartet in der Lobby stehend erst auf einen Tisch, dann auf den zugewiesenen Kellner und anschließend auf die bestellten Eierspeisen. Wir waren nur zu zweit und deshalb war es zeitlich gerade noch so erträglich. Für Familien oder Gruppen ist mit erheblichen Wartezeiten zu rechnen. Die Frühstücksauswahl war klassisch und geschmacklich sehr gut, es wird immer nachgefüllt (sehr aufmerksam).
Man kann natürlich überall auf die Suche nach kleinen Fehlern gehen, diese Fallen hier jedoch nicht ins Gewicht und sind deshalb nicht Wert erwähnt zu werden.",5,2020,01,06

121,Hotel di fascino ma con qualcosa da rivedere,"Perfetta posizione, spazi comuni esterni ed interni molto suggestivi, ottima la colazione, ampia scelta di prodotti freschi dolci e salati (compresa qualche pietanza indiana, insolita per noi a colazione, e invece sorprendentemente buona). Attenzione alle ore di punta perché si rischia di aspettare in coda che si liberi un tavolo. Le camere sono piuttosto eterogenee: la prima stanza assegnataci aveva un bagno piccolissimo in cui a mala pena si riusciva ad aprire la porta, la seconda stanza ne aveva uno gigantesco, completo di bidet (rarità!) e vasca e doccia separate. Alcune camere sono in stile ""classico"" ma  avrebbero bisogno di una decisa rinfrescata, altre sono completamente rinnovate,  con arredo moderno. Le dotazioni in camera (caffè, tisane, biscottini, cioccolatini e bottigliette d'acqua gratuite) e in bagno (shampoo, balsamo, dentifricio, spazzolino, kit barba...) sono abbondanti e di qualità.
Il servizio è stato cortese ma un po' approssimativo: abbiamo dovuto avvisare due volte di preparare il divano letto, e abbiamo dovuto insistere perché
ci consentissero di  aspettare che si liberasse un tavolo un po' più accogliente di quello che ci avevano proposto (attaccato alla porta d'ingresso della sala colazioni e in piena corrente d'aria). Tra l'altro stavamo festeggiavamo un compleanno, circostanza della quale erano al corrente, avendolo  notato loro stessi al momento del check in... in compenso, portiere e concierge impeccabili!  Spa e ristorante non provati. Complessivamente il giudizio è più che positivo e l'albergo è da consigliare",4,2019,10,16
121,Es un engaño,"este Hotel se vende como 5 estrellas y es como de 2 estrellas.

se supone que en la suite con dos noches o mas recibes trato especial lo cual no es cierto.

La location è perfetta, puoi raggiungere a piedi o in taxi molte delle mete più attraenti di Londra. Le camere nuove sono top in tutto, la SPA è completa e ben gestita, la reception efficiente, il giardino interno bellissimo. Forse l’unico appunto è per il bar Hamptons che è ottimo , ben gestito, al sabato sera c’è bella musica live, ma è un po’ piccolo e da rinnovare.",5,2019,10,06
121,Valido ma un po’ datato ,Siamo stati per 2 notti. La struttura andrebbe rinnovata. Le tende fanno passare molta luce perché non adeguatamente montate. Per il resto la posizione è al top e l’hotel è molto bello e di gran lusso. Buona la colazione,4,2019,09,28

Non abbiamo avuto modo di visitare la Spa avendo sfruttato i nostri giorni a Londra per visitare la città con deviazioni a Stonehenge e agli Studios di Harry Potter (eravamo con nostro figlio). Menzione speciale per la colazione: in tanti anni di viaggi e di una discreta esperienza di hotel, non ho mai trovato una colazione tanto ricca e di qualità così elevata. Complimenti davvero.

Otra cosa que me ha llamado la atención es que siempre conseguían tener la habitación arreglada, si descansábamos por la tarde, al volver teníamos cama hecha, otra vez, y toallas cambiadas.
Las habitaciones eran estupendas, el desayuno también tanto en surtido como en sitio (en la planta baja con cristaleras mirando al patio). La ubicación también muy conveniente, muy cerca de la estación Victoria, Westminster, Big ben, Buckingam palace, Saint James Park

Camere adeguate allo standard, pur essendo a Londra, alcune rinnovate di recente ma anche quelle non rinnovate sono in ottimo stato di manutenzione.",5,2019,04,23

121,Elegantes Hotel neben dem Buckingham Palace,"Das St James's Park liegt direkt bei Buckingham Palace und Westminster Abbey in einem wunderbaren alten Gebäude. Der Empfang an der Rezeption ist sehr freundlich, die Executive Zimmer geräumig, elegant, mit großem Badezimmer. Das Frühstück im Bistro überzeugt durch schöne Präsentation und Qualität, auf Wunsch werden frische Eierspeisen serviert. Der Service ist immer aufmerksam und freundlich. Insgesamt ist das St James's Park ein wunderbares Hotel für einen Besuch in Englands Hauptstadt. ",5,2019,03,28

121,Buen hotel en el centro de Londres,"Hotel muy bonito en el centro de Londres, a 2 minutos de Victoria St. Habitación no demasiado pequeña para ser Londres, aunque las ventanas daban a un patio interior donde se encontraban los aparatos de aire acondicionado. Nada que ver con el patio interior de las fotografías. Cama estupenda, toallas magníficas.
Relación calidad-precio regular, los hoteles en Londres son extremadamente caros.",4,2019,03,24
121,A Girls Weekend,"Kurztrip mit meiner Tochter nach London. Sehr schönes Hotel im old englischen Stil. Unbedingt einen Zimmer-Upgrade vornehmen. Der neue Teil ist wunderschön renoviert. Sehr freundliches Personal, gutes Frühstücksbuffet, sehr gute Lage.",4,2019,03,18
121,Schön und zentral,"Das Hotel hat eine gute zentrale Lage.
Der Service am Empfang und beim Concierge war sehr gut! Sehr freundliches Personal.
Die Zimmer sind soweit in Ordnung (Classic Room) und für London recht großzügig.
Das Bad war klein, aber ausreichend.
Die Sauberkeit war sehr gut. Ausstattung der Zimmer soweit ok - aber nicht herausragend und schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen.
Trotz guter Verglasung war das Zimmer nicht ganz leise (bin aber auch empfindlich).
Frühstück und Restaurant kann ich nicht bewerten - da nicht genutzt.

121,"Prolijidad, atención y clase","Un hotel muy bueno, excelente atención. Todos atentos y amables, nos regalaron de cortesía un osito para mi hija. Buena ubicación, cerca de estación de subte, se puede ir caminando a la abadía. El desayuno es variado y de muy buena calidad, te ubican en una mesa, debiendo esperar  en algunos horarios. Al atardecer y la noche tocan el piano o violoncello en vivo. La limpieza es muy buena. La habitación es cómoda. Buena calefacción y wifi. La televisión no me resultó demasiado pero no es fundamental a mi criterio. El estilo es de clase y tradicional. Volvería sin dudas y lo recomiendo. ",4,2019,02,23
121,CENTRICO Y AGRADABLE,"El  magnifico Hotel St James Court  esta muy centricamente ubicado, cerca del Palacio de Buckingham  de Westminster Abbey y del Parlamento.Ademas muy cerca de la estacion del tren ( Underground) y en los alrededores hay bastantes lugares para desayunar o almorzar,asi como algunos Pubs
Desde nuestra llegada al Hotel la acogida por su personal fue calida y profesional tanto por los empleados que ayudan con las maletas ,como por el muy agradable y atento personal del Lobby entre ellos Duane y Nihitha.
El Hotel esta agradablemente decorado y nuestro cuarto tenia un buen tamano de acuerdo al standard europeo.
La habitacion contaba con una mesa equipada para cafe y te y un minibar.Tambien tenia caja de seguridad,un escritorio y proveia zapatillas y batas de bano para el comfort de los huespedes.
El bano estaba muy limpio y bien equipado con accesorios de bano,secadora de pelo y un colgador de toallas que las mantienen tibias para hacer mas agradable el uso de ellas.
Nuestra reservacion incluia desayuno y fue muy conveniente pues mi esposo y yo saliamos muy temprano a disfrutar la Ciudad.El  desayuno era muy surtido con variedad de jugos,yogurts y panes,asi como muffins y huevos al gusto que el personal traia a la mesa.
Los empleados que atienden el desayuno son  muy atentos incluyendo su Supervisor Yonus Bozbek el cual cada manana hacia nuestro desayuno agradable y rapido.

Ci ha proposto a 25 sterline in più al giorno una camera più grande con letto King size.  Abbiamo accettato e abbiamo fatto bene perché la camera era veramente grande con un letto comodissimo. Una sera abbiamo anche cenato in hotel ed era tutto buonissimo.  Colazione anche con tanta scelta. Uniche note negative: freddo in camera nonostante andassimo la temperatura e la moquette che sicuramente era piena di polvere.",4,2019,02,08

121,Gran hotel al cual volveré,"Estuve 3 noches a principios de Enero y luego volví por 1 noche antes de volver a mi país. En Marzo voy de nuevo y me quedare en este mismo hotel. Las 4 noches estuve en una habitación Executive, la cual es muy confortable y de buen tamaño. La primera vez en la habitación 303, con vista a un patio no muy lindo. Pero la segunda vez estuve en la habitación 430 con vista hacia los jardines y terraza del hotel. Muy bonito.En ambas ocasiones solicite late check out y me lo dieron sin cargo hasta las 13 horas. Podría haber sido un poco mas, pero estuvo bien.Los desayunos son muy buenos y con muy buen servicio. Quiero agradecer especialmente a Irene por su calidad de atención durante el check in y el check out. Por todas sus explicaciones y por el ascenso de habitaciones que me dio la segunda vez. Y también a Diego que me ayudo con mis maletas. Ambos me hicieron sentir como en casa.El hotel esta muy cerca de 2 estaciones de metro. St James Park y Victoria. Esta ultima es genial para llegar a Oxford Street directamente. En Marzo voy a volver con mi marido y mi hija. Tengo ganas de probar una habitación Premium, pues necesito 2 habitaciones conectadas. Recomiendo este hotel de todas maneras.",5,2019,01,12

Sehr sehr nettes Personal, Man half uns bei einem gesundheitlichem Problem schnell und unkompliziert mit dem ""Haus""arzt weiter. Zimmer war neu, schön eingerichtet und sauber. Frühstück lies keine Wünsche offen. Wir kommen wieder! ",5,2019,01,06
121,Gute Lage,"Ich war für 5 Tage dort und war im großen und ganzen sehr zufrieden. Laut den Angaben hätte ich ab 14 Uhr einchecken können, angekommen bin ich um 14.30 und dann musste ich noch 45 Minuten warten bis ich auf das Zimmer durfte. Das war etwas ärgerlich daher ich komplett verschwitzt vom Flug war uns später noch einen Termin hatte - aber halb so wild. Vom Zimmer war ich wirklich sehr positiv überrascht. Sehr sauber, sehr groß - alles perfekt. Es wurde jeden Tag gereinig.
Ich habe mich für dieses Hotel entschieden weil die Lage einfach perfekt ist. Die Metro ist ziemlich teuer in London darum gehe ich gerne viel zu Fuß und bei dieser Lage bietet sich das wirklich gut an. Und auch die vielen Restaurants und Pub‘s in der Nähe sind sehr reizvoll.
Leider wurde der Spa-Bereich gerade saniert als ich dort war, zumindest wollte an der Rezeption keiner mit mir darüber sprechen.
Das Frühstück ist auch sehr gut und läuft bis 11 Uhr mit einer ziemlich gutes Auswahl. Allerdings ist der Platz beschränkt, es kann also sein dass man ein paar Minuten warten muss bis man dran kommt.",4,2019,01,04

121,Albergo bello e centralissimo,"Ho prenotato in questo albergo tramite Expedia, per me, mio marito e le mie due bimbe.
Premetto che a Londra ho sempre prenotato in un 5 stelle vicino Piccadilly, ma questa volta volevo cercare un'alternativa. Devo dire che prima di partire le recensioni contrastanti mi avevano un po' fatto pentire di questa scelta. Invece......appena arrivati ci rendiamo conto che l'albergo e' centralissimo, a due passi dalla stazione della metro di St. James Court. Alla reception ci ha accolti una signorina gentilissima che ha fatto  alle mie bimbe un regalo di benvenuto: due orsetti vestiti da guardie della Regina, gesto molto apprezzato. Ci ha accompagnati in camera: una Premium Double Room appena ristrutturata, con una zona giorno con divano letto e un bagno, e una camera con letto matrimoniale e bagno. Il giorno dopo, al nostro rientro, verso le 18 abbiamo trovato in camera 2 frullati e 2 cookie con i nomi delle bambine...veramente molto gentili e carini. Camere nuovissime, con affaccio sul cortile della scuola adiacente, silenziose e calde. Personale disponibile e celere a soddisfare le richieste.
Altra nota positiva la vicinanza a Saint James Park, bellissimo per passeggiare nel verde, con gli scoiattoli che si avvicinano per prendere le noccioline!
Unica pecca la colazione eccessivamente cara, sia per gli adulti che per i bambini. Ma si puo' ovviare facilmente andando da Starbucks o Pret a Manger, a due passi dall'albergo.
Penso proprio di aver trovato l'alternativa al 5 stelle di Piccadilly.....",5,2018,11,05
121,Deludente ,"Sul sito era presentato come un lussuoso cinque stelle nel cuore di Londra, con camere eleganti e confortevoli e una SPA.
Purtroppo la realtà è stata diversa: la stanza era vecchia e poco pulita; la TV restava sempre accesa, anche di notte; il bagno aveva la rubinetteria guasta; c'era la antigienica moquette dappertutto. Il room service è stato molto costoso e il Wi-Fi non funzionava bene. Non ho potuto testare il bar ed il ristorante; la SPA era sotto ristrutturazione e quindi offriva solo massaggi e trattamenti estetici, ma non piscina o sauna - e questo il sito non lo ha specificato. Tutto sommato non ne è valsa la pena, anche se gli hotel di Londra sono sempre inferiori agli standard europei.",3,2018,10,13
121,ESTANCIA MARAVILLOSA Y TRATO EXQUISITO!,"The stay has been wonderful. The rooms are newly reformed and full of details. Great location, a few minutes to Buckinghan Palace.

121,Albergo affascinante ,"Il st james court appartiene al prestigioso gruppo indiano ""Taj"" che in India sono alberghi favolosi, meravigliosi, da sogno. Pur non essendo ai livelli dei taj indiani, questo londinese è comunque sicuramente affascinante e ricorda un po il fascino e la magia d'India. Bella ed elegante lobby, personale cortese e disponibile, bellissimo e fiabesco cortile e tanto altro...La camera che ho avuto è stata davvero molto spaziosa ed elegante, una standard, ma quasi una suite. Assolutamente consiglio il St James Court a Londra per tutto: la bellezza dell'albergo , la cortesia del personale, i ristoranti (da provare l'indiano), le camere , la prima colazione, il bellissimo giardino, ecc.... La posizione poi è tra le migliori, perché vicinissimo alla bella Victoria station, ed in zona Buckingham Palace. Cosa si può volere di più? Anche il costo del pernotto non è molto caro considerando il livello dell'albergo, i costi a Londra, e la posizione... Spero, anzi credo di tornarci... ",5,2018,09,17
121,Para repetir,"Nos alojamos en este hotel del 6 al 10 de septiembre, un adulto y dos menores (12+9). 
Solamente puedo decir cosas positivas del hotel. Si bien es cierto, que quizás no está enfocado para viajar con niños, el trato fue genial. Solamente llegar para hacer el check in, les regalaron dos bolsas con colores, muñecos, etc... ellas encantadas. 
Todo el staff del hotel es muy amable, sobretodo el concierge (Justin) que te ayuda en todo lo que pueda (reserva de atracciones, indicaciones, etc...). Los horarios de desayuno funcionan a la perfección.
La habitación es amplia y con una cama muy confortable. 
La ubicación es inmejorable; muy cerca de Buckingham Palace y de Victoria Station. 
Por poner un “pero” sería la comida, aunque nada achacable al hotel, simplemente que la comida británica no es muy de mi gusto (opinión personal); mantequilla con sal, porridge, etc... Pero salvando los gustos culinarios, volvería a este hotel sin lugar a dudas. Tiene un encanto especial.",5,2018,09,12

121,Schönes Hotel mit sehr freundlichem Personal,"Es ist ein klassisches englisches Hotel, auch wenn es einer indischen Gesellschaft gehört. Es liegt wenige Gehminuten vom Buckingham Palace entfernt und auch U-Bahn und Bus sind in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen. Wir hatten ein sehr schönes, für Londoner Verhältnisse großes Zimmer mit einem großen Bett. Die Zimmer sind erst vor kurzem renoviert worden und deshalb in sehr gutem Zustand. Insbesondere wurde auch die Technik der aktuellen Zeit angepasst. So befanden sich in unserem Zimmer ein USB Anschluss zum Laden von Handy und Tablett und auch eine „normale“ kontinentaleuropäische Steckdose. Die Klimaanlage ist leise und auch bei Außentemperaturen von über 30 Grad sehr gut wirksam. Unser Zimmer war lediglich etwas dunkel, da es zu einem Hinterhof hinaus lag. Das Bad war gut eingerichtet, so gab es z.B. einen beheizten Handtuchhalter und einen beleuchteten Rasierspiegel. Alles war sehr sauber. Der Service in dem Hotel ist insgesamt sehr gut. So wurde das Gepäck aufs Zimmer gebracht und die Einrichtungen des Zimmers erläutert. Außerdem wurde uns die kostenlose Zurverfügungstellung eines Adapters für die Steckdose angeboten. Allerdings gab es auch kleine Schwächen im Service, wenn man beachtet, dass es sich nach dem Anspruch des Hotels um ein Luxushotel handelt. So gab es keinen abendlichen Abdeckservice und auch das Betthupferl gab es bei einem viertägigen Aufenthalt nur an zwei Tagen und eine Tageszeitung nur an einem Tag. Außerdem wurde an einem Tag das Zimmer erst nach 14 Uhr gemacht. Das ist allerdings Jammern auf hohem Niveau. Positiv hervorzuheben ist, dass das Personal sehr freundlich und jederzeit sehr hilfsbereit ist. Sehr gut ist das Frühstücksbuffet, bei dem eine große Auswahl von kalten und warmen Speisen vorhanden war. Den indischen Eigentümer geschuldet ist der Umstand, dass es auch jeden Tag indische Speisen gab. Zusätzlich zum Buffet bestand die Möglichkeit, verschiedene Eierspeisen frisch zubereitet zu bekommen, wobei die Qualität sehr gut und die Wartezeiten kurz waren. Die Getränke wurden auf Bestellung von der Bedienung an den Tisch gebracht, wobei der Service immer sehr aufmerksam und freundlich war. Hervorzuheben ist der sehr schöne Innenhof, wo man insbesondere an schönen Sommerabenden sehr nett sitzen und etwas essen und trinken kann. Empfehlenswert ist der Alice in Wonderland Afternoon Tea, der mit 40 Pfund zwar recht teuer ist, jedoch auf Grund seiner Qualität und Präsentation m.E. durchaus sein Geld wert ist.",5,2018,08,26
121,Beschwerden werden ignoriert,"Bei der Ankunft haben wir alte Kaffeekapseln in der Kaffeemaschine vorgefunden. Neue Kapseln waren keine mehr da. In der Minibar stand ein altes Kaffeekännchen, ein halbvolles Glas mit wasauchimmer darin und von sauber keine Spur.
Die Rezeption wurde informiert und es wurde zugesagt dies umgehend zu beheben. Später am Abend vom Essen zurückgekommen und das gleiche Spiel. Nun wieder am Abend, Zimmer ist gemacht aber der Kühlschrank immer noch voll Müll. Einmal kann das passieren (sollte natürlich nicht) ein notwendiger zweiten Hinweis ist schon  grenzgängig aber dreimaliges Bemängeln ist ein Armutszeugnis. Die Suite ist OK aber der Service in diesem Haus ist mangelhaft.",2,2018,08,25

121,Posizione ottima,"Ho soggiornato con i miei due figli dal 5 all’11 agosto. Confermo che la posizione è ottima tra Buckingham Palace e il Big Ben. Camera pulita e dotata di ogni confort come bollitore,phon e ferro da stiro.abbiamo apprezzato molto le bottigliette d’acqua e cioccolatini lasciati ogni giorno e la cura nel riordino della camera. Non abbiamo fatto colazione ne pranzato o cenato perché i prezzi li ho trovati esorbitanti, ma del resto si sa che Londra non è a buon mercato.",3,2018,08,12

Cuando llegamos teníamos reservado y pagado una habitación con vista (with view) por lo que se nos cobró vía agencia 35 dólares por persona por día. Alegremente nos dijeron (sra Ruta) que no había disponibilidad. Y nos dieron una habitación más barata sin reconocernos la diferencia. Una vergüenza. Eso si. Son tan caraduras que nos piden una tarjeta de crédito por GARANTÍA??!!!! Hipócritas. O sea. Uno paga antes. No recibe lo que pago y encima te piden una tarjeta? Qué garantía me dieron elllos? Ladrones. ,1,2018,07,20

121,"Struttura datata, posizione ottima","L’hotel è molto grande, la posizione ottima, ma gli interni sicuramente da migliorare. Le camere sono spaziose ma vecchie, i bagni lasciano a desiderare e gli optional pochi per un hotel di questo livello e costo. Dalla finestra vedevamo solamente una piccola porzione di cielo. La colazione non molto buona, anche se varia. La seconda mattina non c’era la possibilità di avere un caffè perché la macchina era rotta. ",3,2018,05,22
121,Buena opción en Londres ,"Dentro de la oferta hotelera de Londres, este hotel me ha parecido una buena opción en cuanto a relación calidad/precio. Está en una zona relativamente tranquila en Westminster y muy bien comunicado por bus y metro; incluso a través de St. James Park se puede llegar en unos 15 minutos a Regent o Picadilly. 

La habitación no era grande, pero desde luego era cómoda (como la cama). Al ser de las clásicas (el hotel está en fase de renovación) necesitaba ya una puesta al día, pero no se puede decir que fuera vieja y en cualquier caso muy bien mantenida; la única pega es que, siendo una habitación de no fumadores, olía bastante a tabaco. 

El personal muy amable y eficaz, y ello pese a que al ser un hotel muy grande en algunas ocasiones se pueden formar colas en recepción al hacer el check-in. Por cierto, tienen personal que habla español. 

Lo recomiendo claramente para una visita a Londres. ",4,2018,05,21

121,Sempre il mio preferito,"Anche quest’anno per la mia piccola vacanza a Londra ho scelto questo hotel che amo particolarmente.La posizione è ottima (dietro Saint James Park) e a piedi o con la metro in poco si raggiungono i posti più interessanti.Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile e anche se non hanno personale che parla Italiano,cercano di aiutarti al meglio.Quest’anno ci hanno offerto una camera di livello superiore.L’hotel è molto elegante e accogliente e quando rientri nella bellissima Hall ti senti a casa.Una pecca però’ quest’anno l’ho trovata:la colazione.Non l’ho trovata all’altezza degli anni passati ,buffet ricchissimo,ma i piatti caldi (uova,pancetta,salsiccine)erano sempre freddi.Ma io non sono una fissata della colazione e non ci faccio caso,ma chi era con me,si.Sicuramente è cambiato qualcosa in cucina.Ma per me rimane sempre il numero 1",5,2018,05,09
121,"Desagradable estancia, tengan cuidado","Conjuntamente con mi pareja nos alojamos en el hotel por tres noches (20-23 de abril) en un paquete organizado para la maratón de Londrés.

Voy a resumir los puntos pricipales sobre los que las personas que se alojen en este hotel deberían fijarse bien:

1. Asegurense desde un principio que su habitación corresponde con lo contratado.
2. No vayan a desayunar nunca a la Sala del primer piso, es un engaño.
3. Si algo parece que no funciona bien, llamen inmediatamente, pues se trata de un error de mantenimiento.
4. Si necesitan hacer una reclamación, háganla en la recepción y no por teléfono, pues no les devolverán la llamada.

Hicimos el check-in el viernes. La habitación contratada era una Executive King con desayuno y ya cuando entramos en nuestra habitación nos pareció que la cama ni la cama ni la habitación eran especialmente grandes. No obstante, supusimos que los estándares del hotel eran distintos a otros, especialmente los de USA, a los que estamos más acostumbrados, y no le dimos mayor importancia, pues queríamos ir a recoger los dorsales y caminar por la ciudad sin perder tiempo.

Al día siguiente, cuando fuimos a desayunar, nos encontramos con una larga cola en la sala principal, y un miembro del personal nos indicó que subiéramos al primer piso, donde había otra sala de desayuno. Cuando llegamos a esta sala nos encontramos con que no había casi comida y la variedad era muy escasa. Preguntamos a un camarero si el desayuno en esa sala era el mismo que en la principal, y después de insistir nos dijo que era “almost the same”. Los días siguientes pudimos comprobar que tanto la variedad como el servicio del desayuno de la sala principal era mucho mejor que en el del primer piso. La dirección del hotel debería avergonzarse de no mantener mínimamente los estándares, pues todos los huéspedes pagan lo mismo por su desayuno, independientemente de si desayunan en la sala principal o en el primer piso. En mi opinión es un engaño que envíen a personas al primer piso cuando saben que el desayuno que se sirve no es el mismo.

Pasado el día nos retiramos pronto para poder descansar. Fueron días especialmente calurosos en Londres, y habíamos dejado el aire acondicionado encendido para poder descansar bien. No obstante, notamos bastante calor en la habitación, y pensamos que tal vez no habíamos encendido bien el aire acondicionado. En todo caso, nos acostamos pronto pensando en el esfuerzo de la maratón del día siguiente, aunque la temperatura de la habitación no nos permitió descansar bien esa noche.

Tras la maratón, ya el domingo a la tarde nos fuimos a dar un paseo y volvimos a dejar el aire acondicionado encendido (fue la maratón de Londres más calurosa de la historia, unos días especialmente calurosos en Inglaterra). Cuando volvimos después de cenar notamos que la habitación no se había refrescado, por lo que, una vez más, pensamos que habíamos encendido mal el aire y llamamos a recepción para que mandara a alguien a encenderlo adecuadamente. Cuando vino el técnico rápidamente nos pidió permiso para entrar en el baño, donde abrió el aparato de aire acondicionado, extrajo el filtro y comprobó que estaba lleno de polvo. Si él sabía perfectamente que el problema venía del filtro, no entiendo cómo no realizan mantenimiento rutinario para tener los filtros limpios y que el aire funcione adecuadamente sin que los huéspedes tengan que molestarse en ello o pensar que están haciendo algo mal.

Ya bastante enfadado con la situación, le pregunté al técnico qué tipo de habitación era en la que estábamos, y él me respondió que en una Doble Executive, y no en una King Executive. Cuando se fue llamé por teléfono a recepción para quejarme porque la habitación que teníamos reservada era una King Executive y no una Double. Me dijeron que me iban a hacer comprobaciones y me llamarían. Nadie llamó para darnos explicaciones, y como estábamos cansados tras la maratón decidimos dejar el asunto para el próximo día.

Al día siguiente –día del check-out- después de desayunar (por cierto, en la sala principal nos sugirieron que fuéramos al primer piso, a lo que respondimos que preferíamos esperar) nos dirigimos a recepción para exponer nuestra queja sobre la habitación que nos habían asignado para nuestra estancia. La persona de recepción nos dijo que esperáramos, a lo que respondimos que ya llevábamos esperando desde la llamada de teléfono del día anterior. Subimos a nuestra habitación a por nuestras maletas y cuando hicimos el check-out nos dijeron que la encargada de relaciones con los clientes quería hablar con nosotros.

La verdad es que nos sentimos felices de que alguien, al fin, nos hiciera caso. Pero la respuesta de esta persona no fue en absoluto lo que esperábamos: sin decirnos porqué nadie respondió nuestra queja del día anterior, nos dijo que había sido un fallo informático y que nos devolvería 100 libras por la diferencia del tipo de habitación. Además, cuando le indicamos que deberían mejorar el desayuno en el primer piso nos dijo, sin más, que nos devolvía 25 libras más por las molestias.

Sintiéndolo mucho esta persona no entendió nada: habíamos pagado unas 3000 libras por el paquete de viaje de la maratón, la cuestión no era que nos devolviera la diferencia. Es incomprensible cómo en un hotel de las característica del Taj pueden pasar cosas como éstas, y me temo que si suceden es porque no se toman lo suficientemente en serio los inconvenientes e incomodidades que pueden generar a las personas que, como nosotros, lo único que quieren es disfrutar de una estancia agradable en Londres en un fin de semana especial como es el del maratón.",1,2018,05,07
121,Algo antiguo pero merece la pena,"Por ubicación y excelente servicio lo recomiendo. Las habitaciones están bien mantenidas pero se ven anticuadas así como el cuarto de baño. El personal es increible, servicio de habitaciones y servicio tecnico muy rapido, recepcion y concierge estupendos. Cama comoda y el espacio amplio en una classic suite. Desayuno muy bueno aunque algo ineficiente. Probamos el afternoon tea “Alice in Wonderland” y merece la pena",4,2018,05,05
121,Excelente Lugar,"Ubicado en un lugar donde esta cerca de todo, San James Park, Bukinham Palace y westminister, increible , estaciones del metro cercanas, buen servicio, la gente super amable y muy atenta, seguro es una buena opcion en cuestion precio beneficio",4,2018,04,30
121,"Bello, centrale....un po' datato","Sono appena rientrato da un breve soggiorno con famiglia presso questo albergo. Nulla da eccepire,  personale cortese,  lobby molto bella, posizione centralissima.  Tutti fattori positivi che mi farebbero protendere per il giudizio massimo se non fosse per le stanze un po deludenti.  La mia addirittura aveva due finestre che davano su muri e non si riusciva a vedere il cielo. L arredamento poi andrebbe un po svecchiato e i corridoi sono stretti e un po labirindici.  Altra pecca poi è il prezzo della colazione, circa €25 a persona anche se devo ammettere che offre ampia scelta ed è abbondante. Comunque nel complesso una buona soluzione per chi cerca un hotel comodo al centro.",4,2018,04,30
121,"Ubicacion y servicio, pero anticuado","El hotel nos ha gustado. Es cómodo, céntrico y el trato dispensado no podría ser mejor. Repetiría sin duda pero me aseguraría que la habitación está renovada. Entraba frío por las ventanas y aunque poniamos la calefacción a tope no se notaba. El baño pide a gritos una reforma. El desayuno es estupendo y el te de la tarde tambien. Los sabados por la noche hay un trio de jazz en vivo en el bar. Recomendable. ",4,2018,04,29
121,"Buena ubicación, precioso","Estuvimos cuatro noches aprovechando el Maratón. Hotel precioso, muy bien ubicado. Antiguo, pero reformado y cómodo. Al lado de Buckingham, cerca de la estación Victoria, muy cerca de la Abadía de Westmister caminando.... buen desayuno, si está incluido, si no, cerca muchos sitios estupendos. Personal muy atento. Volveríamos otra vez.",4,2018,04,25

Sehr schönes altes Gebäude mit wunderschönem Innenhof. Alles gut erhalten und gepflegt. Man spürt noch den Hauch des British Empire. Personal an Reception, Bistro, Concierge und Zimmerservice extrem bemüht und freundlich, an der Bar auch freundlich aber etwas träge. Zimmer (Studio) geräumig, stilvoll, sauber. Im Bad ebenfalls genug Platz, aber nur Badewanne mit Duschvorhang !!!(zwar picobello sauber, aber trotzdem...). Britische Steckdosen, also Adapter nicht vergessen, sonst an der Rezeption erhältlich. Frühstück hervorragend, sowohl was Auswahl, Ambiente und Personal betrifft. Also mit Ausnahme des Duschvorhangs alles perfekt.",5,2018,04,21

U-Bahn Station ""St. James Park"" ist nur 5 Minuten entfernt, so dass auch die weiter entfernt liegenden Sehenswürdigkeiten gut und bequem zu erreichen sind.
Unser Zimmer war sehr schön und sauber und für unsere Tochter lag sogar eine tolle Aufmerksamkeit bereit. In unmittelbarer Nähe gibt es auch Pub´s und Frühstückslokale, sowie kleine Einkaufsläden. Für uns war es das perfekte Hotel!",5,2018,04,16
121,"Schönes Hotel, aber etwas in die Jahre gekommen","Das Hotel ist für einen Stadttrip wunderbar. Die Lage ist sehr zentral, in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Buckingham Palace. 
Wir hatten eine kleine Suite mit 2 Zimmern. Der Ausblick war trotzdem sehr unschön, zwar in den kleinen Garten, aber man starrt doch Wände anliegender Häuser an. Die Einrichtung ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen und man hört die Stadt, was für Stadtmenschen aber nicht weiter auffällt. Die Zimmer sind aber sehr sauber und es gibt eine Auswahl an Kaffee und Tee im Zimmer. 
Das Frühstück ist ok. Eben doch typisch englisch und es gibt keine große Auswahl. 
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.",4,2018,04,12

- Hervorragendes Personal und freundlich
- Zimmer sind sauber
- Preis und Leistung stimmig
- Schöne Einrichtungen und Lobby
- Super Lager zwischen Buckingham und Westminster
- Schöner Garten
- U Bahn nur ca. 3 Minuten entfernt

Kontra:
- Zimmer etwas klein, vor allem das Bad",5,2018,04,05
121,Posizione strategica e tanta cortesia,"La posizione di questo hotel è uno dei suoi punti di forza: è a 5 minuti a piedi da Bukingham Palace ed a 7-8 minuti dall'Abbazia di Westminster, Houses of Parliament e Big Ben. Fermata più vicina St. James Park (3 min a piedi) ma anche Victoria (5-6 min. a piedi).
Il personale è cortesissimo: sono venuti incontro a tutte le nostre richieste e ci hanno aiutato persino a risolvere un piccolo inconveniente accaduto nei pressi dell'hotel.
La colazione è ottima e abbondante. E' possibile ordinare anche piatti espressi dalla cucina, come omlette o altro ed il cappuccino è ottimo, come quello di hotel italiani della stessa categoria.
Abbiamo alloggiato in un executive studio, molto spazioso e pulito. Letto matrimoniale king size, molto comodo, e letto aggiunto per il bambino di nove anni.
Check in ed out velocissimo e senza alcun problema. Possibilità di lasciare i bagagli per tutta al giornata dopo il check out.",5,2018,04,04
121,Confort che accoglie,"Scegliere questo hotel rappresenta una soluzione mirata per chi vuole garantirsi il confort giusto. Colazione variegata e adatta per tutte le esigenze. Pulizia ed efficienza nei servizi attribuiscono al St James, livelli di assoluto rilievo. 
",5,2018,04,03
121,"Schönes Hotel, mit Potenzial","Wir waren mit mehreren Freunden in London und hatten Executive Zimmer gebucht, da diese als ""deutlich größer"" als vergleichbare Zimmer in London verkauft wurden. Erst beim Lesen der Bettgröße (Queen-Size) war klar, das Bett ist max. 1,30x2m groß. Also buchten wir ein Upgrade auf ein Bett mit 2x2m; hier sollte das Zimmer auch 32m² groß sein - ist es aber nur wenn man das große Bad und den langen Flur miteinrechnet. Das neue Bad hatte den Mangel, dass die Haltestange zu weit in den Duschbereich reinragt. Aber vielleicht sollte man auch gar nicht duschen, den die Handtücher stanken nach dem Gebrauch derart nach alten Socken, dass die Hygiene echt anzuzweifeln ist! Auch der Austausch durch neue war nicht wirklich besser. Der Service war sehr bemüht, den Mangel auszugleichen, aber eigentlich hätten wir das Hotel wechseln sollen, wenn wir nicht mehrere gewesen wären. Es reichte nur zu einer Entschuldigung - schade!! Dennoch gibt es auch viele Pluspunkte, die für das Hotel sprechen: sehr gutes Frühstück, sehr, nette und zuvorkommende Bedienung. Da das Hotel umgebaut wird, ist es momentan sehr kalt und zugig.",4,2018,04,03
121,La perfezione !!!!,"Ho soggiornato alcuni giorni con il mio compagno in questo hotel che si è rivelato una magnifica sorpresa in tutto.
Appena arrivati ci hanno trasferito dalla camera matrimoniale da noi prenotata a un'altra superiore con bagno, camera è un enorme salotto dalla cui finestra si poteva vedere l'abbazia di Westminster ( il tutto ovviamente senza aggiunta di un centesimo). Camera pulitissima, phon, asse da stiro e ferro, accappatoi, pantofole, macchina del caffè in camera e bollitore con ogni tipo di te in salotto. Possibilità di ordinare il giornale. Acqua e cioccolatini sul comodino. Colazione molto ricca, per tutti i gusti. L'unica pecca forse è la possibilità di pagare il conto solo in sterline ( se si vuole saldare in contanti) per il cui cambio la commissione applicata dall'hotel è un po' alta ma, vista l'onesta' e la gentilezza con cui il personale ci ha restituito dei soldi dati erroneamente in più, credo che gli si possa perdonare questo piccolo particolare. Complimenti a tutto lo staff!!",5,2018,03,29
121,Fantastico ,"Hotel favoloso, a due passi dalla metro di st James park ma anche dalla Victoria station, tutto perfettamente centrale 
Un soggiorno che ha superato le mie aspettative

121,Ottima scelta ,"Hotel molto bello,situato nel centro di Londra,a due passi dalla metro st.james.
Camera pulita anche se la moquette avrebbe bisogno di una rinfrescata.
Il personale gentilissimo e sorridente.
Complimenti a tutti!",5,2018,03,23
121,A perfect place to stay.,"Siamo state servite da Ioana al nostro arrivo ed è stata di una simpatia e di una squisitezza unica. La camera non ha deluso le nostre aspettative e la tv (col piccolo messaggio di benvenuto) aveva anche qualche canale in italiano per i nostalgici. Materasso avvolgente,camera perfettamente pulita ed Hotel in forma quasi impeccabile. Sono certa che al termine dei lavori di ristrutturazione ,l'edificio sarà al meglio della forma. Camere ampie e posizione talmente centrale che la vostra oyster card potrà solo rimanere nel cassetto. Giornale lasciato alla porta ogni mattina e piccola coccola cioccolatosa ogni volta che ci ripulivano la camera.Tornerò. The hotel is very impressive and i really recommend it because of his greatness. The room was big and perfectly cleaned (thanks to the staff) the bed was SQUISHY AF (forgive me ) and the position of the hotel...well,if you're going to stay by them,leave your oyster card into the wallet because you can go everywhere without using the metro or the bus. Next time we'll be in London ,obviusly, we'll choose you again.

Gli infissi lasciano entrare qualche spiffero di troppo,soprattutto nel bagno.Personalmente non sono stata infastidita da questa cosa ma chi era con me non era della stessa idea..",5,2018,03,23
121,Ubicación excelente,"Lo mejor es la ubicación, cerca de la estación Victoria de trenes y del metro. Buena zona, tranquila y segura. 
Los empleados todos muy educados y amables.
Hotel muy grande, señorial, que en su día sería todo un lujo pero ya no tanto. La habitación está anticuada, las ventanas no cierran bien y se cuela  frío , el baño está muy anticuado y necesita urgente una reforma.",3,2018,03,08
121,Zentral St James Court,"Absolut Zentral. 5 gehminuten vom Buckingham Palace entfernt. Viele Sehenswürdigkeit sind Fußläufig zu erreichen. Ein sehr familienfreundliches Hotel. Auch wenn die Zimmer nicht besonders groß sind, wurden wir, auf kosten des Hauses upgegrated.
Ein service Orientiertes Hotel mit freundlichem Personal. 
Wir kommen wieder!",4,2018,03,05
121,Venite tutti qui!,"Ebbene sì, invito i vacanzieri a venire in questo Hotel!
I motivi sono molteplici a partire dalla cordialità del personale h24 fino ad arrivare ad un gesto da noi apprezzato a tale punto che mi sono quasi sorpreso:
Stanza 663 ( Master suite Classic).
Intanto c’è da dire che la stanza è enorme con un bagno gigantesco! Ogni confort è presente all’interno.
Abbiamo trascorso 3 notti.
L’episodio è il seguente: sabato mattina sentiamo, dopo aver fatto colazione nel salone, dei rumori di acqua sopra le nostre teste.
Pensavamo fosse qualche altro ospite che stesse facendo la doccia, quindi abbiamo continuato la nostra ricca è pazzesca breakfast.
Tornando in camera per preparaci noto che il soffitto era tutto bagnato nonché il letto era parzialmente zuppo. Faccio presente il fatto al personale, il quale, in 2 minuti, mi cambia la stanza mandandomi alla 163 ( spettacolare).
Sono cose che possono succedere anche perché a Londra ha nevicato pesantemente quindi qualche tubo si è gelato.
Non mi sono affatto arrabbiato perché non ha colpa nessuno.
Ho apprezzato tanto un biglietto di scuse dalla Manager accompagnato da dei cioccolatini ( vedi foto).
Abbiamo avuto anche la possibilità di lasciare la stanza con 3 ore di ritardo senza dover pagare nulla, grazie di cuore.
Ero cliente fisso del 51 Buckingham Gate ma, da oggi, sarete il mio albergo di riferimento a Londra.
Grazie davvero di tutto.

121,Tolle Woche in London,"Zentral gelegen - überaus freundliches und kompetentes Personal! Sehr ruhiges Zimmer - absolut sauber - diskreter und guter Zimmerservice! Da unser Zimmer bei Ankunft noch nicht bezugsbereit war, wurde uns sofort ein kostenloser Upgrade angeboten, den wir sehr gerne angenommen haben!",5,2018,02,14
121,Zentrales Hotel mit ausgesprochen guten Mitarbeitern,"Wie hier viele schon schrieben, liegt das Hotel günstig und hat eine wunderschöne Fassade, ebenso ist die Lobby wirklich toll. Aber im Grunde genommen sieht man das ja auch schon auf den Bildern. 

Was man nicht sieht und was aber meines Erachtens sehr wichtig ist, sind die Mitarbeiter des Hotels. Diese sind nämlich ausgesprochen freundlich und vor allem hilfsbereit und empathisch, was in unserem Fall sehr wichtig war. 

Das Gebäude selber ist eben ""original alt"" und birgt dementsprechende Problematiken. 
Bei Ankuft erhielten wir ein Zimmer am Ende eines extrem langen und verwinkelten Flures (das ist schon skurril). Schon beim Entreten war es dort leicht dunkel, so dass selbst am Morgen dort Licht brannte. Das Fenster ließ sich (wie die anderen auch) nur etwa zwei handbreit öffnen. Durch die Lage des Zimmers am Ende in einer Art Spitzwinkel sah man direkt auf eine gewellte dunkel Wand, die ungefähr zwei Meter entfernt war. Direkt unter dem Zimmer lag die Klimaanlage bzw. die Umlüftung, welche entsprechend sehr laut war. 
Das Badezimmer hatte sicherlich keine 2 qm und zwischen Wand und Waschbecken quetschte man sich zur Toilette. Mein persönliches Highlight war aber das Metallschild, welches von innen an die Badezimmertüre angebracht war. Darauf stand, dass man doch bitte beim Duschen die Türe geschlossen halten sollte, damit der Duschdampf keinen Feueralarm im Zimmer auslöst. 
Die Toilette war nach der ersten Nutzung verstopft. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt klopfte es bereits und eine nette Dame fragte, ob denn alles ok mit unserem Zimmer sei. Wir äuerten unsere Enttäuschung und sie sagte, wir sollten auf jeden Fall dies bei der Lobby angeben. 
Dies taten wir auch und erhielten umgehend ein anderes Zimmer eine Etage tiefer. Dies war viel größer und gut ausgestattet. Man muss auch hier allerdings Abstriche machen, was Möbel und allgemeinen Zustand des Bades etc. angeht. Ich denke, dass durch den hohen Durchlauf an Gästen auch einfach vieles leidet. 
Allerdings muss ich auch sagen, dass ich diesen alten kolonialen Stil des Zimmers mag, weil es auch mit den Einbauten der Schränke wirklich sehr britisch ist. 
Abends ging dann noch ein Anruf auf dem Zimmer ein, in dem man uns fragte, ob dies Zimmer nun besser sei bzw. ob wir zufrieden wären. Und genau hier zeigt sich, was ich oben meinte. Es interessiert die Mitarbeiter, wie und ob man zufrieden ist und falls nicht, ist man sehr bemüht, dies zu verbessern. 
Man sagte uns, dass man dabei wäre, die ersten 100 Zimmer zu renovieren. Dies soll im Mai abgeschlossen sein. 
Wir würden dementsprechend das Haus empfehlen und auch wieder buchen.",4,2018,02,07
121,Fast perfekt für ein Wochenende,"Das Hotel hat eine perfekte Lage zwischen Victoria Station und Buckingham Palast. Somit sind sehr viele interessante Orte fussläufig erreichbar. Die Zimmer sind sauber und bequem, das Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Toll ist am Abend die Bar mit Livemusik. Einzig die Bäder und die Klimaanlagen bedürfen mal einer Erneuerung. Dies ist jedoch in Planung soweit ich es beurteilen kann.",4,2018,01,30
121,Il migliore albergo di Londra,"Siamo appena tornati da una breve vacanza di 4 giorni, hotel stupendo, tutto molto elegante, molto curato, tutti molto carini molto gentili nel fornirci tutte le informazioni possibili per aiutarci a soggiornare nel miglior modo possibile.. grazie ad andrea che e’ stato da subito molto gentile con noi aiutandoci in quanto completamenti a digiuno di inglese!
Avevamo prenotato una classica ma io avevo fatto richiesta di una camera piano alto e ci hanno fatto soggiornare in una superior 6 piano! Una camera bellissima con vista sul cortile dove la sera la fontana illuminata e il silenzio ne fanno quasi un sogno!
All’interno della stanza c’era di tutto: pantofoline, accappatoio, asse da stiro, bustine monouso, phon... davvero di tutto!
Carino il fatto che ogni giorno ti fanno trovare la bottiglina d’ acqua minerale e naturale sui comodini!
Tv con canali sky italiani.
Posizione ottimale a westminster a 4 minuti dalla metro di st james park.
Grazie per averci fatto vivere una piccola favola!

121,Ottimo ma.....,Ottima la posizione di questo splendido hotel in stile coloniale che permette la visita a piedi del centro di Londra . Il ma.... è riferito alla camera che risulta essere un po’ vecchiotta e anche piccola. La nostra addirittura aveva solo una finestra con vetri “appannati” in quanto dava sul retro con un muro a un metro. Mi aspetto di più da un hotel di questo livello ancor più se la prenotazione è fatta da oltre due mesi. Nel complesso il personale è cortese e disponibile . Visto il prezzo della camera ...esperienza da non ripetere.,4,2017,12,30
121,Empfehlenswertes Hotel,"Es handelt sich um ein recht gutes Hotel, das zentral gelegen ist (Haltestelle St James Park in 5 min zu Fuß erreichbar). Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und versucht es den Gästen so komfortabel wie möglich zu machen. Ein hervorragendes Frühstück wird angeboten sowie eine reichhaltige Auswahl im Bistro für ein Abendessen. Leider funktionierte während unseres Aufenthaltes meistens nur 1 Lift, deswegen 1 Punkt Abzug. Das Warten vor dem Aufzug war sehr lästig. Trotzdem würde ich das Hotel sofort wieder buchen. ",4,2017,12,21
121,"Teuer, aber es lohnt sich ","Es ist zwar nun schon etwas länger her, dass wir dort waren, aber dennoch möchte ich auch hier bei TripAdvisor meine im Grunde durchweg positiven Erfahrungen zu diesem Hotel äußern.

Eines vorweg: Natürlich ist es nicht günstig dort, das ist es zwar in London generell eher weniger, aber man bekommt für diesen Preis auch ein 5-Sterne Haus.

Allerdings ist das kein Garant für bessere Qualität, denn im Grunde gibt es nicht viel auszusetzen am St. James' Court. 
Das Hotel an sich ist sehr schön und in den öffentlichen Bereichen (Lobby, Innenhof etc.) architektonisch definitiv ein Highlight, kann man sagen. Die Mitarbeiter haben wir als überaus höflich und zurückhaltend freundlich empfunden - so, wie man es aus England im Grunde kennt. 
Das Zimmer an sich lässt auch nicht wirklich Raum zum Tadeln: Zwei große, an Schlafkomfort kaum zu überbietende Betten, für drei Personen mit abgetrenntem Wohnbereich und großem Schreibtisch mehr als komfortabel - etwas schade war nur die beschränkte Aussicht. 
Die Lage des Hauses ist super: Im tollen Stadtteil London St. James unweit des Buckingham Palace. 
Frühstück haben wir nicht in Anspruch genommen, sondern waren meist im Café gegenüber - das muss jeder selbst wissen, ob der recht hohe Preis es ihm wert ist.

Ingesamt ein wirklich tolles Hotel - typisch englisch und sehr elegant, aber trotzdem zum Wohlfühlen kann man sagen. Der Preis dafür ist hoch, aber für London gewissermaßen gerechtfertigt.  ",4,2017,11,11

121,Excelente,"La ubicación es buenísima. La habitación, un estudio, tenía muy buena amplitud con dos ambientes bien diseñados y era totalmente silenciosa, a pesar de que había mucha gente en el hotel. El baño está muy bien y te acercan cualquier cosa que hayas olvidado. El servicio de desayuno a la habitación es puntual y muy variado. Check in y check out son rapidísimos y el almacenamiento de valijas es muy cómodo. Si el tiempo ayuda, tomar algo en el jardín es hermoso. Recomendable en todo.",5,2017,05,09
121,BIEN SITUADO. ANTIGUO POR DENTRO,"El hotel se encuentra en una magnifica ubicación. muy cerca de Buckhingam Palace (en la zona de St James´s. En cuanto a las instalaciones, las habitaciones necesitan una reforma. El baño es antiguo y bastante incomodo. El desayuno es bastante completo y surtido.
Tienen un restaurante ganador de estrella Michelin de comida hindú.

Bajo mi punto de vista y después de comer en muchos hindúes por el mundo entero, tampoco era algo sublime. Precio bastante caro.",4,2017,05,03
121,Posizione strategica per la citta',"Da Victoria Station a piedi con trolley in dieci minuti, dall' hotel a Westmister qundici minuti, venti fino a Trafalgar. All' arrivo alle 14 pero' le camere non sono pronte nonostante il check in fosse previsto dalle 12, aspettiamo nella hall circa un'ora e ci offrono del caffe. Aspetto dell' albergo elegante , quasi lussuoso, ma le camere almeno le nostre sono gradevoli, suffiecentemente accoglienti ma non particolarmente curate. Colazione soprattutto Britannica molto curata, quella continentale piu' povera. L' addetta alla reception con la quale ci congediamo e' Italiana ed e' particolarmente gentile ed efficiente.In sintesi molto comodo, gradevole,con qualche neo , ma ci torneremmo quasi sicuramente.

121,Schönes Hotel in toller Lage,Ein schönes Hotel mit zuvorkommenden Mitarbeitern. Das Essen und die Auswahl ist sehr gut. Alles sehr sauber und die Zimmer sind großzügig. Die nächste U-Bahn Station in 3 min. erreichbar. Idealer Ausgangspunkt zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten. Einziger Verbesserungsvorschlag: mehr Räumlichkeiten zur Frühstückszeit einrichten um Wartezeiten zu vermeiden.,5,2017,05,02
121,Perfekte Lage,Wir waren für 3 Nächte in diesem Hotel. Wir können gar nichts negatives sagen. Für das Frühstück hat es zwei Räume. Wenn das eigentliche Bistro voll ist wird ein Teil der Bar geöffnet mit gleichem Angebot. Das Angebot ist vollkommen genügend. Das beste am Hotel ist die Lage. In 10 min zu Fuss ist man beim Big Ben oder der Victoria Station. Nur 5 min sind die nächste U-Bahn und der Buckingham Palace entfernt. Die Zimmer sind älter aber trotz allem sauber und gemütlich. Wir würden dieses Hotel jederzeit wieder buchen. ,5,2017,04,30

121,Wundervoll,"Wir waren im Dezember 2016 zu Gast in dem Hotel.
Der Kontakt im voraus per Email war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, was sich auch direkt bei der Anreise nochmal persönlich erwies. 
Das Hotel liegt nicht weit von der Victoria Station oder der Station St. Jame's Park entfernt und ist zu Fuss sehr gut erreichbar. Bereits am Eingang wird man sehr sehr freundlich begrüsst, das gepäck wird abgenommen, so wie man es von solch einem Hotel erwartet. 
Der Check in verlief einwandfrei, wir wurden freundlich in Empfang genommen und in die Welt des St. Jame's Court entführt. 
Das Zimmer war ein Traum, sehr gross, zum Innenhof gelegen aber dennoch sehr ruhig und sehr sehr sauber. So müsste es überall sein :)
Die Sehenswürdigkeiten sind sehr nah gelegen, wir haben fast alles zu Fuss erledigt, selbst die Tower Bridge (war etwas weiter, aber dennoch machbar).
Der Concirge Service war ebenso einmalig, kaum angefragt, schon wurden die Wünsche erfüllt. Vielen Dank dafür an Mr Binoy.
Zum Essen: Das Frühstücksbuffet war reichhaltig, man hat alles gefunden was man braucht. Es hätte natürlich noch mehr sein dürfen. Einmal sassen wir im Restaurant, am anderen Tag im Bankettbereich, da der Frühstücksraum sehr überfüllt war. Dies störte uns aber ganz und gar nicht, so konnten wir in aller Ruhe unser Frühstück geniessen und hatten dennoch das komplette Buffet wie auch im Restaurant zur Verfügung.
Rommservice lief auch einwandfrei, es gibt auch hier vieles zur Auswahl, und die Speisen waren sehr lecker.
Was auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen ist sind die Afternoon Teas im Hotel!!! Einmalig und super super lecker! Für zwei Personen, zwei verschiedene Afternoon Teas bestellt. Man kann so viel Tee trinken wie man möchte und die Canapes etc machen wirklich satt. Zwei Tage später haben wir nochmal für einen Afternoon Tea reserviert und wurden aufs neue überrascht, einfach ein Traum.
Das einzige was ich schade fand, wir hatten im Voraus angegeben, dass einer von uns Geburtstag hat, mir wurde versichert, dass eine Kleinigkeit bei Anreise auf dem Zimmer sein wird. Dies war leider nicht so. Aber halb so wild, der Aufenthalt hat uns dennoch unglaublich gut gefallen und wir werden bestimmt wieder kommen :)
Danke an das gesamte Team.",5,2017,04,25
121,Unser 3. Besuch im St. James Court,Gerne kamen wir wieder zurück ins St. James Court in London. Das Personal ist konstant sehr gut und freundlich. Für die sehr gute Lage und die Preise in London ist das Hotel ein Schnäppchen. Das Hotel ist zentral und doch sehr ruhig. Schön ist auch immer wieder am Abend ein Besuch in der Hotelbar. Die Zimmer und das Hotel selber waren sehr sauber. Freuen uns schon auf den nächsten Besuch.,4,2017,04,24

Excelente ubicación en la ciudad. Paseo, metro o taxi, todo perfecto para comunicar con lo mejor de Londres. Recomendable 100% por comida, atención y habitaciones. Una sorpresa en esta ciudad que, como todas las grandes, puedes llevarte una sorpresa desagradable.
Precio, como siempre algo mejorable pero, un perfecto recuerdo.",5,2017,04,19

",5,2017,04,19
121,No es lo que esperaba,"El hotel esta muy bien, y el personal es muy atento y amable. La ubicación es perfecta, puedes ir andando a un montón de sitios.
Lo que hace que no puntúe mejor este hotel, es que con un mes de antelación pedimos una habitación habitación tranquila y en una planta alta. Tengo que decir que nos avisaron que harían lo posible, claro no te aseguran nunca nada, pero lo que nunca me había pasado es que después de pedir esto, nos den justo todo lo contrario. 
Nos dieron una habitación en la segunda planta, en la que al descorrer las cortinas, el cristal de la mitad inferior de la ventana es biselado, ya que lo que te encuentras al abrirla son varios aparatos de aire acondicionado justo delante. Ésta ventana creo que daba a un patio interior, pero no lo podría asegurar ya que con los aparatos de aire acondicionado no se ve absolutamente nada, solo el cielo cuando miras hacia arriba y algunas ventanas de las plantas superiores.
Y lo de la tranquilidad.... nada mas lejos de la realidad, las puertas de las habitaciones dan unos golpes muy fuertes al cerrarse que hacían que la puerta de nuestra habitación también diese golpe por las corrientes de aire que hay. El cabecero de la cama, esta en la pared del pasillo por donde pasa todo el mundo a sus habitaciones, en fin.... tranquilo? para nada.
Y ésto ultimo como dato informativo; reserva para dos adultos y una niña de 9 años; ponen cama king size, si, a lo mejor es una cama de 1,80 pero con un niño de esa edad ya, no es nada cómodo.
Ah¡¡¡ También puedes elegir desayunar en la primera planta o en la planta baja, yo recomiendo la planta baja, aunque te dicen que es el mismo buffet, es prácticamente igual, pero hay detalles que lo diferencian, por algo se llena antes.
Para otra ocasión iremos a otro hotel seguro.",3,2017,04,19
121,Sehr sauber auf hohem Niveau,"Super Lage und sehr zentral gelegen, hohes Niveau im Hotel aber Service teilweise etwas überfordert mit Anzahl der Gäste; Zimmer sehr ruhig und sehr sauer; Frühstück super aber in der Nähe gibt es viele günstige Alternativen; 3 Minuten bis zur nächsten Underground Station (Victoria oder St. James); viele Parks in kürzester Umgebung",4,2017,04,16
121,Perfect!!,"Das Hotel war wunderschön. Die Mitarbeiter waren sehr freundlich, zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber und wurden immer zur besten Zufriedenheit aufgeräumt.

Frühstück hatten wir inklusive - besteht aus full english breakfast aber auch vielen anderen Speisen. jedenfalls ausreichend. Hotel kann empfohlen werden.",5,2017,03,28
121,Excelente Todo !!,"Nos alojamos con mi esposa por dos noches. La ubicación impecable, a solo tres cuadras directo al Palacio de Buckingham.

Camera molto confortevole di discrete dimensioni con un bel bagno. Tutto molto pulito, ordinato funzionante. Ottima la colazione, che avevo compresa nel prezzo, sia per varietà che per qualità, con una particolare attenzione ai bimbi, al mio hanno tutte le mattine chiesto se voleva qualcosa extra buffet, quando abbiamo detto di si, ci hanno portato i waffles con sciroppo acero, una ciotolina di fragole e l'immancabile nutella.

121,Bellissimo!,"Se non fosse per qualche piccolo particolare da sistemare nella camera e nella sala colazione, sarebbe tutto perfetto. In generale l'hotel è bellissimo, pulito, servizi ottimi, disponibilità e gentilezza del personale eccellente (grazie ad Arianna alla reception per averci accolto meravigliosamente). La camera era piccola ma pulita e accessoriata di tutto. La colazione è varia e buona. L'hotel è a 5 minuti a piedi da Buckingham Palace e 10 minuti dalla stazione di Victoria. ",5,2017,03,15
121,"Nuestro punto de partida, muy cerca de Buckingham Palace","El hotel está situado a escasos 8 minutos andando de Buckingham Palace, con lo que tiene cerca Green Park, the Mall y a un bonito paseo del Big Ben por ejemplo. Tiene dos estaciones de metro, St. James' Park a 5 minutos andando, y Victoria Station a 10 minutos, con lo que da posibilidades para desplazarse a cualquier parte de Londres muy facilmente. Yo aproveché para salir un par de días a correr que es mi afición, una vez hacia el río y otra hacia el maravilloso Hyde Park. 
La habitación que tuvimos fue grande, enmoquetada y acogedora. El baño algo pequeño y anticuado quizás, pero con todo lo necesario menos el bidet (claro). 
Teníamos el desayuno incluido, de manera que cada mañana salíamos con fuerzas a pasear lo mucho que hay que ver en Londres. Es tipo buffet y todo estaba muy bien, el espacio es mediano y casi siempre podíamos escoger mesa, excepto el sábado que se llenó y esperamos un poco a ser atendidos.
El personal de recepción y del comedor muy amables, a diferencia de otras experiencias que tuvimos en otras visitas a Londres.

Dall'albergo si raggiunge, sempre a piedi e in pochissimo tempo, Buckingham Palace, St. James's Park e Westminster. Il quartiere poi è tranquillissimo e in zona ci sono ottimi locali per una buona cena (uno su tutti il Quilon, ristorante indiano stellato Michelin che si trova nello stesso palazzo).

Ottima poi la colazione.",4,2017,03,08

121,Wow,"L'hotel è segnalato come un 4 stelle, ma secondo me è molto di più, stanza stupenda e pulita, i prodotti da bagno ottimi, personale gentilissimo, merita il costo che sembra eccessivo ma vista la vicinanza alla stazione e a Buckingham Palace non è poi esagerato.",5,2017,02,15

121,Excelente servicio e instalaciones,"muy grata experiencia durante mi estancia de 7 días en el hotel, todo lo que necesitas para tu vida diaria a la mano, el personal con mucha actitud de servicio. tal vez el único detalle fue el concierge que no pudo darnos una buena orientación en una cena de fin de año, pero nada delicado. el servicio de bar y restaurant muy recomendable",5,2017,01,16
121,Tutto perfetto!,"Hotel veramente bello sia all interno che all esterno. Camere molto carine e accoglienti. La nostra era anche molto silenziosa. Personale gentilissimo e ambiente sempre molto pulito e profumato. Posizione ottima per visitare tutta la città poiché è situato a pochi passi da buckingham palace e vicinissimo alla stazione della metro San james park. 
Non abbiamo fatto colazione all interno dell hotel ma abbiamo provato e il cibo è veramente buono...la consiglio! Il prezzo della cena è un po' alto ma nella media se si considera che comunque siamo nel centro di Londra.
Unica nota negativa è stata sul prezzo: avendo prenotato tramite Booking dovevamo pagare 375 sterline. Una volta tornati in Italia ci siamo accorti che ne hanno prese 397 sterline nonostante il cambio fosse stato il solito. Purtroppo ce ne siamo accorti quando eravamo già in Italia e non abbiamo potuto contestare.
Nel complesso comunque lo consiglio assolutamente e ci tornerei sicuramente!",4,2017,01,15
121,Soggiorno ,"Abbiamo soggiornato presso questo hotel 4 giorni 

Personale scadente per essere un 4 stelle

Nemmeno una spiegazione per i monumenti principali .

121,"Top Hotel, Top Lage!","Wir haben uns in  St. James´ Court, a Taj Hotel, London 3-Nächte aufenthaltet und können es wärmstens weietrempfehlen. Die Lage des Hotels ist für eine Städtereise geeignet. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit erreicht man zu Fuss den Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, London Eye, etc.

Das Frühstück ist teuer; deshalb empfehle ich: das Geld für das Frühstück sparen und direkt gegenüber morgens im Pret a Manger frühstücken.

121,"Posizione eccellente, hotel ottimo","Io e la mia ragazza abbiamo scelto il Taj per la sua posizione perfetta, a due passi da Buckingham Palace e in una zona tranquilla di Londra, e non ci siamo ricreduti durante il soggiorno: abbiamo apprezzato grandemente la possibilità di camminare giorno e notte in una zona serena, a due passi da Piccadilly e dalle maggiori attrazioni e senza il cruccio della metro. Va detto che l'hotel è fornitissimo, la fermata di St Jame's Park è distante solo 1 minuto dall'ingresso dell'albergo e la location è equidistante dal Big Ben e da Piccadilly, distanti 10 minuti a piedi entrambi. Le strade alla sera sono isolate e abbastanza buie in quanto la zona è tipicamente ""reale"" vista la vicinanza di Buckingham Palace, ma sono assolutamente tranquille. La vicinanza dei due parchi è inoltre un vantaggio, a mio avviso, perchè diversifica le possibilità. Prima dell'arrivo, ho a lungo dialogato via mail con il personale trovando grande disponibilità: ci hanno prenotato il trasferimento in auto dall'albergo (cosa fatta anche al ritorno). L'Hotel di per sé è molto curato nella hall, di ottimo livello e sempre viva anche di notte per via dei check in dai voli indiani, e si fa apprezzare la cortesia del personale che è sempre vigile e disponibile. Avevamo prenotato una classic queen per due, ma prima della partenza ho effettuato un upgrade di camera per una executive king, a seguito di una serie di recensioni non perfette rispetto alla qualità delle camere standard e tenuto conto della lunghezza del soggiorno, di 7 notti. La qualità della camera era ovviamente elevata, con ampi spazi che ci hanno consentito di sentirci a casa: interamente ristrutturata di recente, aveva anche un bagno di ottimo livello, in cui però va detto mancava totalmente l'acqua calda. Le nostre docce, infatti, erano tutte tiepide o fredde. La vista interna sul piccolo ma bel giardino era un surplus del quale siamo stati felici. Il prezzo, per la zona e per la qualità delle camere, è comunque a ribasso rispetto a quanto ci si aspetterebbe (circa 1500 euro per 7 notti upgrade incluso) e il nostro soggiorno è stato piacevole, senza alcun intoppo e sempre con grande silenzio e discrezione da parte del personale dell'albergo. Lo consiglio alle famiglie, nonché a chi ha voglia di fare due passi per muoversi in giro per Londra!",5,2016,09,25

121,"Superlage, sauber, technische Mängel","Das Hotel hat Flair, liegt sehr zentral und ist sehr sauber. Allerdings ist es schon ziemlich abgewohnt. Ich hatte zwar ein angeblich renoviertes Exekutive-Zimmer, das Bett war aber nicht sehr komfortabel (billige Matratze) Das Zimmer lag im obersten (7.) Stock zu einem kleinen Innenhof, dadurch war es sehr ruhig, man konnte bei offenem Fenster schlafen. Weiter unten ist es in Zimmern zu diesem Hof wahrscheinlich ziemlich düster.
Größtes Problem: bei der Dusche (Badewanne) kam fast kein Wasser! Es war sehr mühsam, das Shampoo aus den Haaren zu spülen.
Die Zimmertür schloß nicht dicht und verursachte durch den Luftzug enervierende Geräusche - ich hatte ständig das Gefühl, jemand wolle die Tür öffnen.
Das Frühstück ist für den Preis (18 Pfund) weder von der Vielfalt noch von der Qualität entsprechend. Eierspeisen müssen mit Ausnahme des ungenießbaren Rühreis extra bezahlt werden. Der Frühstücksraum ist eng und überlaufen; wenn man das ""Glück"" hat, dass mehrere asiatische Clans neben einem frühstücken, wird es sehr turbulent und laut.

121,Hotel elegante in buona posizione,"L’appartenenza ad una catena che è garanzia di lusso ed eleganza è meritata. Buona la posizione: tranquilla ma comoda per spostarsi all’interno della città. Le camere sono spaziose e pulite anche se alcune forse avrebbero bisogno di un po’ di manutenzione. La colazione risulta completa. Il fatto di occupare vari edifici d'epoca (molto suggestivo il cortile interno) rende la sistemazione labirintica e per raggiungere la lobby o il ristorante da alcune camere occorre un po' di senso dell’orientamento!
Il prezzo è in linea con altre sistemazioni simili di Londra.",4,2016,07,22
121,Una pésima decepcionante experiencia,"Llegamos a este hotel, luego de una estupenda estadía en Estambul, en un día típicamente londinense, es decir frío y algo lluvioso. El edificio, es simplemente impactante y está bastante bien ubicado (cerca del Palacio de Buckingham, St. James's Park y Victoria Street) convenientemente próximo a algunas de las atracciones de la ciudad y del London Underground.
Tras atravesar el elegante lobby, fuimos recibidos muy amablemente por un joven de nombre David, quien luego de contestar cortesmente algunas inquietudes y de realizar los tramites de rigor, nos asignó una habitación a la cual accedimos tras sortear un interminable laberinto de corredores.
Al franquear la puerta de nuestra habitación, llegó la primera desilusión, por expresarlo de alguna manera. Considero que, no se debe confundir entre una decoración clásica y una sencillamente anticuada. Si bien reconozco que tenía un equipamiento aceptable y que estuvo siempre limpia; las cortinas de tartán rojo bastante decoloradas, la alfombra de motivos florales rosa y los muebles desgastados, amén de un baño que parecía arrancado de fines de la década del 80; no están a la altura de un hotel de esta categoría y mucho menos de uno by Taj!!!!
En fin, llámenlo cansancio o conformismo, pero decidimos quedarnos a pesar de que no era lo que esperábamos, conscientes de que era solo una cuestión de ""estilo"" muy personal. Tras desempacar lo necesario y atentos a que ya era algo tarde para hacer algo mas, decidimos salir un momento para recorrer algo de los alrededores y tras cenar algo muy ligero volvimos a nuestra habitación con la esperanza de darnos una ducha y acostarnos temprano para encarar el siguiente día que se presentaba bastante movido. Desafortunadamente solo uno de nosotros pudo ducharse esa noche, ya que la bañera no desagotaba en lo absoluto y cuando llamamos para quejarnos al respecto nos informaron, que en ese momento, no tenían otras habitaciones disponibles y que tampoco podían asegurarnos que tuvieran al otro día; de lo que si nos daban certeza, era de que ni bien fuera posible, enviarían a alguien de mantenimiento para solucionarlo, lo cual efectivamente sucedió al día siguiente.
EL desayuno es bueno y bastante variado, los productos son frescos y bien elaborados. El personal, si bien no siempre está atento a las necesidades de cada comensal, atiende amablemente a cada requerimiento o solicitud.
Ahora bien, el verdadero PROBLEMA con este hotel, lo realmente GRAVE, no sucedió si no hasta la tercer y ante última noche de nuestra estadía. Tras un largo día de recorrida en la ciudad que hasta incluyó una visita al teatro, llegamos relativamente tarde al hotel. Ni bien entramos a la habitación, notamos que faltaba una de nuestras valijas, al principio no nos preocupamos porque supusimos que había sido movida por el personal de limpieza. Luego de recorrer toda la habitación y revisarla por completo entendimos con horror que la valija simplemente no estaba.
Inmediatamente bajamos a la recepción presas del pánico y le explicamos la situación a la empleada que en ese momento estaba en el front desk, quien luego de algunas cavilaciones decidió consultar a su supervisor, a quien tuvimos que explicarle nuevamente que estaba ocurriendo. El supervisor en cuestión nos pidió que esperáramos al jefe de seguridad, para que se hiciera cargo de los acontecimientos y una vez que éste se hizo presente, otra vez debimos relatar los hechos.
El responsable de seguridad, que o no terminaba de entender lo que sucedía o tal vez no daba crédito de lo que estaba pasando, nos pidió que siguiéramos esperando hasta que pudiera chequear algunas cosas y nos sugirió que regresáramos a nuestra habitación a lo que nosotros no estábamos dispuestos hasta que no nos dieran una respuesta. El caballero se retiró nuevamente y volvió para preguntar si deseábamos hacer la denuncia policial a lo que respondimos que afirmativamente y tras ausentarse nuevamente volvió acompañado por otra persona que no se identificó y a quien debimos repetir por enésima vez qué había pasado y darle las señas de nuestra valija.
Luego de lo que a nosotros nos pareció una eternidad, el personal de seguridad volvió a presentarse, esta vez para informarnos que en unos de sus depósitos había una valija con las características de la nuestra y nos pidieron que los acompañáramos para verla. Efectivamente se trataba de nuestro equipaje y luego de constatar que era la nuestra finalmente la recuperamos.
La única explicación que pudieron darnos es que se trató de un error por parte de alguien del personal que confundido con los números de habitación se llevó nuestra valija, en lugar de hacerlo con la de la persona que se retiraba.
Si bien se deshicieron en disculpas todavía nadie pudo explicarnos efectivamente que sucedió. Ni el personal de seguridad, ni la amable asistente del gerente pudieron explicar como alguien pudo sacar solo una valija de una habitación estando junto a otras; o como no constató el nombre que figuraba en la etiqueta mas allá del número de cuarto que le habían dado; o por que nadie supervisó su trabajo.
En fin, a pesar de haberme hospedado en otros hoteles de la cadena Taj, no puedo menos que enfatizar lo mal que lo pasamos en este hotel y creo que está de mas decir que a pesar de algunos puntos a favor (muy pocos) NUNCA REGRESARÍAMOS A  ESTE HOTEL Y DE NINGUNA MANERA LO RECOMENDARÍA.",2,2016,07,15

I corridoi in alcuni punti erano molto stretti. La camera, #579, intesa come lo spazio con i letti, era molto grande, all'angolo dell'edificio, e quindi molto luminosa, ma comunque silenziosa. Da una delle finestre si vedeva il bel giardino. Il bagno invece era proprio piccolo e vecchio, sarebbe proprio da rifare (ho aggiunto una foto).

In anderen Worten: Für das Geld, was hier verlangt wird, gibt es bessere Hotels. Auch in Westminster.",1,2015,12,12
121,A DUE PASSI DA Buckingham Palace,"Bellissimo 4 stelle in una zona bellissima (abbiamo raggiunto a piedi in pochissimi minuti Buckingham Palace e da lì, tagliando per il parco, lo stupendo quartiere di My fair con tutti i negozi tipici di abbigliamento inglese, prodotti per la cura della barba e quant'altro...
La stanza matrimoniale con letti singoli (i letti erano grandi) era a quarto piano, molto spaziosa, specie se si pensa agli standard inglesi! Bagno confortevole (con vasca), arredi classici, di gusto.
Servizio alla reception eccellente, tutto il personale è molto cortese, la hall è molto bella e la sera è piacevole fermarsi a bere qualcosa seduti ai divani mentre il pianista suona...
Colazione abbondante sia dolce che salata.
L'acqua in camera (quella non nel frigo bar) è offerta e ogni giorno sostituiscono le bottiglie aperte.
La metro è a due passi (una delle due fermate però chiude il sabato e la domenica) e bisogna prendere l'altra poco più distante.
CONSIGLIATISSIMO",4,2015,12,01
121,"Very British, nel bene e nel male","Struttura spettacolare a due passi da Buckingham Palace e dalla stazione di St..James's Park  e 10 minuti a piedi da Westminster. Stanza grande, silenziosa ma come da tradizione tanta moquette, tanto velluto, tante tende...non proprio impeccabili. 
Bel bagno, lavandino con il miscelatore! ma con la solita vasca-doccia senza telefono.
Buona colazione ricca nella parte salata, meno assortita in quella dolce.
Personale  pronto e gentile sia di persona che per e-mail.",4,2015,11,26
121,"Hotel estupendo bien situado, equipado y muy recomendable","Hotel en el que hemos pasado 4 días en Londres. Un hotel situado entre Victoria Street y St. James Park. A parte de la 
buena ubicación, el trato del personal. el desayuno e instalaciones están muy bien. Las habitaciones algo pequeñas pero con muy buena insonorización. Albornoz, zapatillas, café, té y agua gratuitos. Repetiría sin duda alguna...",4,2015,11,23
121,Das passende Hotel für ein London-Wochenende,"Wer ein Wochenende oder ein paar Tage für einen Besuch in London plant,
sollte das Hotel in die Planung einbeziehen. Das Hotel ist zentral gelegen. Wir haben alles mit der U-Bahn gemacht (Victoria-Station wenige Minuten zu Fuß entfernt, viele Sehenswürdigkeiten auch.)

121,Non lo consigliamo,"Abbiamo preso due camere per un week end lungo.Edificio molto bello in stile vittoriano.Posizione non ideale per visitare Londra.Camere piccoline e vecchiotte seppur pulite.Quella al sesto piano si difendeva mentre quella al terzo era un disastro : bagno da pensioncina romagnola,spifferi freddi dalle finestre e manutenzione lacunosa.
Personale molto gentile.Colazione abbondante ma decisamente non qualitativa.Dal gruppo Taj ci aspettavamo molto molto di più.Delusione!",3,2015,11,22
121,Ubicación excelente,"Por las fotos me lo imaginaba mejor, de todos modos en lindo y tiene una ubicación excelente, se puede ir caminando a los lugares que toda persona que llega a Londres por primera vez quiere ver, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace,National Gallery, Westminster, creo que es una buena elección",4,2015,11,13
121,Bello e confortevole,"Situato in una posizione eccellente, a 5 minuti a piedi da Buckingham Place ma in una via tranquillissima, il St. James Court è davvero confortevole e di classe.
Hall di livello e personale, sia alla concierge sia alla reception, Gentile e cordiale.
Abbiamo fruito di una camera King executive di buone dimensioni complessive, con un bagno davvero grande e comodo.
Gli arredi classici sono davvero avvolgenti, ma un bonus va riconosciuto alla prima colazione, presso quello che alla sera è il Bistrò: davvero notevole quanto a scelta tra dolce e salato.
Avevamo la.prima colazione inclusa nel prezzo della camera ma, visto il prezzo, è opportuno che la si fruisca se si hanno abitudini alimentari continentali oppure se si opta per un sostanzioso brunch.
L'orario di apertura nel fine settimana è da premio:consente di riposare senza problemi!
Da consigliare assolutamente: prezzo di livello, come l'hotel, d'altronde!

La location è ottima, vicino a Buckingham Palace, ha stanze relativamente comode per gli standard di Londra, ha una buona prima colazione ed è pulito. Infine, il personale è gentile ed efficiente.

121,Muuuuy recomendable,"Situacion perfecta, a 3 minutos de Victoria Street y a 10 del Big Ben andando.

Pase siete dias con mi bebe de 5 meses y mi familia y tengo que decir que el trato estupendo desde el primer hasta el ultimo dia.
A pesar de que nuestro ingles es muy basico siempre habia alguien que hablaba español.
Teniamos dos habitaciones y a pesar de ser pequeñas tenian una puerta comun con un pequeño recibidor que pudimos usar como guarda maletas, por si vais a reservar dos habitaciones que sepais que son la 755 y la 756.
El desayuno esta fenomenal, el clasico English Breackfast y te hacian huevos fritos, revueltos y tortilla si querias en el momento, fruta, bolleria, zumos, cafes, tes, te hacen el pan tostado si lo quieres, mermeladas, yogur, cereales...no se si me olvido de algo, pero vamos que esta fenomenal.

Das Hotel befindet sich in mehreren alten zusammenhängenden Gebäuden und ist in die Jahre gekommen. Die Flure riechen teilweise etwas muffig, die Zimmer sind klein und auch nicht mehr die neuesten. Gerade im Badezimmer und auf dem Teppich ist das gut zu sehen.

121,buon soggiorno,"avevamo prenotato un'offerta al volo quindi le nostre aspettative non erano grandissime, la camera era al 7º piano con vista su un l'edificio che subiva dei lavori, ma ciò non disturbava il nostro pernottamento.
i pro: il personale e la posizione veramente strategica a due passi a Buckingham Palace.
uniche due pecche: bagno senza finestra (odore che ristagnava inevitabilmente)
passaggio della metro che faceva tremare il pavimento...ma poi ci si abitua.
detto ciò il personale è stato veramente cordiale un ringraziamento in particolare ad Arianna che essendo italiana ci ha permesso di velocizzare i dialoghi.

A pochi metri fermate del metrò e del bus per visitare le altre attrazioni della città.

121,Clienti di serie A e di serie B?,"Vado regolarmente a Londra per lavoro. Prima volta in questo hotel. Soggiorno di due notti. Bell'hotel. Costo della camera oltre 300 eur a notte. Al check-in ho fatto una sola richiesta, di avere una camera tranquilla. Mi hanno dato una grande ma decisamente datata camera in fondo a interminabili corridoi, con una vaga puzza di umidità e ancora i vetri semplici (non doppi) alle finestre, dalla quale si sentiva un baccano di treni della metropolitana davvero estremo. Inizialmente ho provato a dormire ma mi era possibile perciò sono sceso alla reception a chiedere un cambio. Il ricezionista molto gentilmente mi ha spiegato che l'albergo era molto pieno, ha consultato la sua superiore e poi si è scusato per l'inconveniente dicendomi che non si poteva fare nulla. Sono rientrato in camera ma una volta capito che non avrei dormito sono sceso di nuovo chiedendo di parlare direttamente con la responsabile per cercare una soluzione. Dopo qualche minuto è arrivata, le ho spiegato con calma il problema e mi ha in effetti sposato in una camera più piccola ma nuova, con i vetri doppi e tranquilla. La sensazione è stata quella di essere stato trattato almeno inizialmente come ospite di serie B (che paga come gli altri però). Metto tre pallini perché alla fine la stanza del livello giusto e pagato me l'hanno data, però ho dovuto insistere parecchio per il cambio e non credo che sia giusto. Se me l'avessero data subito sverrebbero stati anche 4 o 5. ",3,2015,07,08
121,ottima scelta,"buon rapporto qualità/prezzo per camera ""classic"". Ovviamente  la camera presenta qualche  problematica essendo non di recente ristrutturazione, ma, tutto sommato, da viaggiatore reale , ritengo che i vantaggi di una grande (mq.35) camera classica ""old style"" siano preferibili a una piccola camera di recente ristrutturazione.",4,2015,06,19
121,Bello ,"Che dire erano le 23:45 quando faccio una veloce ricerca per capire dove poter soggiornare all'ultimo momento .. Alternativa sarebbe stata dormire in Piccadilly per strada 😜 non mi sembrava il caso ... Ho trovato disponibile e rispetto ad altre soluzioni  era anche competitivo il prezzo!!! Beh è stata una piacevole sorpresa e  un gradito soggiorno anche se  per i miei gusti molto dispersivo e grande come struttura ( non è una critica negativa il fatto che sia grande) ma nello stesso tempo la pulizia l'ordine e la cordialità del personale fanno si che tutto sia piacevole.
Bello l'arredamento delle camere 
Bellissima ed elegante  hall .
L'unica nota negativa per noi italiani o per chi è abituato in bagno ad avere il bidet... Che non c'è 
Come penso nella metà degli hotel di Londra

121,Kein Vergleich zu Suites and Residences,"Dieses Mal haben wir das Taj St James Hotel probiert, da uns die Taj Residences and Suites sehr gut gefallen haben. Leider halten die Zimmer in keinem Masse dem Vergleich stand. Wir hatten ganz am Ende irgendeines verwinkelten Ganges (was uns nicht störte) ein sehr veraltetes Zimmer. Die Scharniere der Fenster fielen fast auseinander. Der Abendservice fehlt komplett und die Möbel waren vielleicht antik, aber eher total abgenutzt. Alles in allem eine Enttäuschung.",2,2015,06,10

121,quasi ideale.....,"dico quasi ,visto che la perfezione non sembra esistere!
In posizione estremamente strategica, ottimo livello di comfort generale,staff estremamente cortese e gentile. Abitualemnte preferiamo cenare in ristoranti esterni: una sera eravamo stanchi e ci siamo fermati al Bistro 51. Ottima qualità dei piatti scelti,con presentazione davvero apprezzabile: il rapporto qualità prezzo é senz'ltro positivo. Da consigliare senz'altro.",5,2015,05,17
121,BELLO E STRATEGICO,"Ho soggiornato presso l'hotel dall 08 Maggio al 11 Maggio, la struttura è molto bella e curata, la posizione è altamente strategica, a pochi minuti dalla metropolitana e da Victoria Station ma sopratutto a 500mt da Buckingham Palace.
E' talmente centrale che programmando i percorsi è possibile visitare moltissime zone di Londra senza bisogno di mezzi di trasporto.
Le camere sono spaziose, pulite e munite di ogni comfort, sempre ben servite ed in ordine.
Il personale è un'eccellezza di quest'albergo, molto attento, cortese e professionale, non mancherete di trovare chi parla l'italiano.
L'Hamptons Bar altro lato molto piacevole con un ottimo champagne ed ogni sorta di distrazione alcolica si desideri.
Non ho avuto l'opportunità di provare i ristoranti tranne il Bistro dove abbiamo consumato ottime colazioni anglosassoni ma la scelta è variegata con buffet o a la carte.
Ho invece avuto la fortunata opportunità di cenare nel ristorante stellato michelin ospitato nella struttura dell'hotel, Il ""Quilon"", uno dei migliori ristoranti indiani di Londra di cui scriverò recensione a parte, vi dico solo che una cena li può essere menzionata come"" esperienza culinaria "" ed io non sono di bocca buona.
Una menzione speciale al Concierge che ha saputo ogni sera, con pochissimo preavviso, trovarci ottimi tavoli nei migliori ristoranti di Londra, merita proprio la mancia.
Le tariffe dell'Hotel sono oneste comparandole con il tipo di offerta che propone Londra,
Insomma, buon soggiorno al St. james' Court Hotel.",5,2015,05,15

121,nettes Mittelklasse Hotel ,"Ich war für drei Tage in einer Junior Suite. Das Zimmer hat tatsächlich die schönsten Tage hinter sich gebracht, aber für das Preis Leistungsverhältnis ist das i.o. für London. Am meisten zu bemängeln ist die Preispolitik betr. Internet. Das Zimmer wird mit Gratis Internet angeboten, aber Gratis ist ein dehnbarer Begriff. Gratis wird nur eine langsame 256kb Verbindung Angeboten, wer mehr Geschwindigkeit möchte, muss zusätzlich bezahlen, 10 GBP für 24 Stunden. Da ich auf schnelles Internet angewiesen bin, habe ich bezahlt obwohl ich mit dieser Preispolitik nicht einverstanden bin. Heute erwarte ich in einem 4* Hotel 100% free high speed Internet! Für mich persönlich ist dies ein Grund dieses Hotel bei meinem nächsten London Besuch nicht wieder zu berücksichtigen, da ich mich in dieser Angelegenheit leicht abgezockt fühle.

difficile descrivere l'eccellenza nel servizio, nelle camere e nei dattagli.

Le stanze enormi, pulitissime, in un contesto ottocentesco, curato nei minimi dettagli.
Tutto è puntato sulla soddisfazione del cliente, non si può proprio trovare niente di meglio.

121,Piccola delusione,"Avevo soggiornato per la prima volta in questo hotel meno di due anni fa', anche se ogni volta che vado a Londra soggiorno sempre in un Crowe Plaza( ora diversi non appartengono piu' a questa catena) Il ricordo che ne avevo era fantastico, anche perche' avevo una bellissima suite(ricordo ancora il numero, la 458). Quindi in occasione di un evento sportivo, che si e' verificato a fine febbraio, non ho avuto dubbi e ho riprenotato questo hotel dal nome nuovo molto esotico( mi piaceva di piu' Crowe Plaza St. James).All'inizio tutto bene, tutto perfetto e tutti molto gentile, anzi ho fatto molti complimenti per come mi ero trovata la volta precedente.Siccome la camera alle 11 di mattina non era pronta io e mio figlio abbiamo lasciaro i bagagli e siamo andati via. Quando la sera siamo ritornati ho avuto la spiacevole sorpresa. La nostra camera non era nel corpo centrale, decisamente molto bello ed elegante, ma al 51, una struttura che appartiene sempre a loro, ma decisamente meno accogliente.Per accedere a questa struttura si deve uscire dal corpo centrale, attraversare una corte scoperta, anche se piacevole ed entrare attraverso una porta molto squallida, senza reception( a parte un bancone dove non ho mai visto nessuno) e salire in camera senza vedere aniima viva. Questa porta tra l'altro rimane sempre aperta!!!!! Mio figlio e' ritornato in hotel verso le 24 ed invece di passare dal corpo centrale e' passato dal cortile, ha trovato la porta aperta ed e' salito in camera, senza che nessuno gli chiedesse qualcosa( e la sicurezza?). Siccome per due notti ho pagaro € 486, la mia delusione e' stata enorme!!!!! Ho decantato a tutti questo albergo, ora non lo faro' piu' e mi dispiace moltissimo... anche perche' mi sono sentita declassata. Forse non hanno simpatia per gli Italiani??",5,2015,03,11
121,Ottimo hotel,"Ottima accoglienza, servizio professionale. Camere accoglienti e pulite. Comodo per soggiorni di piacere.  Vicino a Buckingham Palace ed alla fermata St James's Park. Consiglio una sosta all'Hampton Bar ed anche al Quilon. Ci ritornerei.",4,2015,02,19

All'entrata il concierge che ti apre la porta ogni volta e ti aiuta per tutte le esigenze di spostamento in città o per prenotarti ristoranti e spettacoli. Poi la reception con il bravissimo Claudio. Un grazie particolare a Francesco e Algirdas dell'ufficio prenotazioni che mi hanno assistito al meglio. Camera molto curata con cassaforte, minibar, ferro da stiro, phon, bollitore x te' e caffè, ciabatte, accappatoi e beauty set. Finestre apribili, cosa rara a Londra.

Uova strapazzate ottime mentre il bacon è troppo spesso e non invitante.  Dovrebbe essere bello sottile e croccante!!! Un'altra nota negativa e'il costo del caffè espresso al bar: 3 sterline è un po' troppo!!! La posizione è ottima a 3 minuti a piedi da Buckingham Palace e 20 minuti dal Big Ben. Consiglio di attraversare St.James Park molto bello e pieno di scoiattoli che vengono a mangiare dalle vostre mani!!!! Vicinissima anche Victoria Steet piena di negozi, supermercati e fermate dei bus. Consigliatissimo.",5,2015,02,14
121,Bella esperienza,"Consiglio vivamente questo bellissimo hotel: la stanza era molto carina, fornita di tutto il necessario per una permanenza confortevole ( ampio armadio, cassaforte, asse da stiro, tv satellitare mini bar e comodissimo letto). 
La posizione e' perfetta come punto di partenza per visitare Londra. 
Personale estremamente gentile e disponibile.
Mertita anche una sosta l' Hampton Bar: ho potuto apprezzare un vesper martini veramente ben eseguito! 
I will be back!",4,2015,01,01
121,Di ritorno con piacere,"È la seconda volta quest'anno che soggiorniamo in questo bel hotel. L'ottima impressione della prima volta è confermata. Il personale è molto cortese e gentile. Tutti pronti a sorriderti e a soddisfare ogni richiesta. La struttura dell'albergo è degna di un 4 stelle, il servizio concierge all'entrata è molto efficiente e cortese, la reception ti accoglie con un enorme banco ed il personale è molto professionale e gentile. La camera Excecutive King è spaziosa e ben arredata con stile moderno ma inglese, il bagno è ampio e generoso. La colazione all'inglese viene servita a buffet ed il personale alla ristorazione si impegna in modo esemplare. Il bar è efficiente, discreto e con ampia scelta. Tra il personale dell'albergo si trova qualcuno che parla italiano. La vicinanza dell'albergo alla stazione della metropolitana e ai principali luoghi di interesse si apprezza particolarmente.",5,2014,12,30
121,Ottima scelta,"A due passi da Buckingham Palace, ho soggiornato in questo albergo per motivi di lavoro. Personale cordiale, rapido, disponibile. Silenzioso, pulito, camera doppia con bagno ampio, cassaforte, ferro da stiro (non sia mai che venga indossato un vestito stropicciato!) e come sempre l'immancabile bollitore per the e caffè! 
Al prossimo giro voglio tornarci sicuramente!",4,2014,12,20
121,Non male!!,"Gran bell'albergo ci sono ritornato per una seconda volta. 

Tutti cordiali, discreta colazione, stanze comode e ben arredate. 

La sola pecca o il solo suggerimento che darei sarebbe quello di ristrutturare i bagni che risultano essere molto vecchi. ",4,2014,12,15
121,Assolutamente perfetto,"Hotel di gran livello, tutto perfetto e di ottimo livello: camera, letto, servizio, spazi comuni, colazione, attenzione per l'ospite.

121,Agradable y muy céntrico.,"Estancia de dos noches muy agradables en este hotel que está muy bien ubicado. Repetiría por la ubicación de mismo, si bien tienen aspectos que mejorar como la limpieza de las habitaciones. 

El personal es muy amable y están en todo momento dispuestos a solucionar cualquier duda que te pueda surgir.",4,2014,12,09
121,hotel sopra alla media,"Ho soggiornato per 4 notti a Londra al St. J. Court e la mia esperienza é molto positiva.
Ben piazzato nella città é un hotel sopra alla media nonostante le 4 stelle. Struttura, servizio e qualità delle camere tutto perfetto, nonostante si senta leggermente (al 6 piano) la metropolitana (ma non viaggia di notte).
Precisione e servizio inglese da godere!

Ci tornerò senza problemi",4,2014,12,04
121,Bellissimo ,"Non posso che lasciare un commento ottimo per questo hotel : posizione centralissima, personale cortese e disponibile, camere curate e pulite . Piccole chicche come una bottiglia di acqua e dei biscotti in camera .... Il tutto a un prezzo più che ragionevole ",5,2014,11,27
121,Buen fin de semana en este hotel,"Reservado por simple casualidad, la sorpresa fue muy agradable. Hotel supertranquilo y silencioso. Su aire británico con bastantes toques de la India le dan un carácter muy especial. Buen ambiente en sus estancias y personal muy amable. Las habitaciones son adecuadas, cómodas, silenciosas y muy completas. Sin duda un lugar muy agradable en un lugar estratégico de Londres. 
Los desayunos buenos y abundantes con un servicio de primera",5,2014,11,26
121,Ottimo hotel in un'ottima posizione,"Ottimo hotel. A 8 minuti a piedi circa dalla stazione Victoria e 3 da Buckingham Palace. Vicino a molte attrazioni di Londra. La camera era molto grande e con tutti i comforts possibili. Il bagno era abbastanza grande e curato. L'hotel ha dei servizi di buon livello. Prezzi per colazione, minibar e altri extra troppo alti ma questi sono gli standard della cittá. Staff molto effeciente, abbiamo chiesto 2 adattatori aggiuntivi per la corrente e in 3 minuti li avevamo in camera. Per il mio compleanno mi hanno fatto trovare in camera anche la torta.

Per il mio 50° compleanno al ritorno in Hotel bellissima sorpresa con  Torta offerta da tutto lo staff (eccezzionale).  Colazione non  provata esagerato il prezzo ma di fronte angolo Petty France Ristorante  gestito da Sergio,  ottima colazione.
Consiglio vivamente questo Hotel.",5,2014,11,07
121,Adecuado para un hotel en Londres,"Cuando visitamos este hotel, había sido recientemente comprado por la cadena Taj, por lo que aun no se hacían las remodelaciones correspondientes. Lo que si nos llamo profundamente la atencion: a pesar de estar en un 5 piso, cada vez que el tube pasaba bajo tierra, temblaba el edificio (una vez cada cinco minutos). Por otro lado, tuvimos una pésima experiencia con el servicio a la habitación, ya que entre la comida venia un pedazo de plástico parecido a un band aid. Muy desagradable. El baño impecable, la cama cómoda pero el mobiliario y paredes se veian mal mantenidas.",3,2014,11,06
121,Hotel ottimo come posizione! Centralissimo!!,"L'hotel si trova in una posizione meravigliosa vicino a buckingham palace raggiungibile in meno di 5 minuti, Victoria station in 10minuti a piedi e big ben 15minuti a piedi .

121,"Strategico, bello, funzionale. Unico difetto ...","Ci torneremo sicuramente, ed ecco il perché:
Strategicamente collocato, offre la stazione metro di Victoria a sette minuti a piedi. La fermata del bus opp-on opp-off a due minuti.
Buckingham Palace e Hayden park a due minuti.
Le camere (674 piani alti) grande, pulitissima, letto comodissimo, comoda vasca da bagno per recuperare le energie.
Il frigo bar è costosissimo una birretta Peroni da 33cl €8,50 statele lontano. Ecco il difetto.
Personale gentilissimo, grazie a loro abbiamo saputo del mercatino (bello) di Nottinghill.

121,My buen fin de semana,"Acabo de regresar con mi mujer de un largo fin de semana el Londres, hemos estados alojados el este hotel y todo ha sido de nuestro agrado. Pedimos una habitación el un piso alto y tranquila y nos dieron la 604. Mejor imposible, con un pequeño recibidor/saloncito, una cama king size, un baño completo con todos los accesorios y toallas perfectas, una armario con sorpresa, albornoces/batas, zapatillas, tabla y plancha, kit para preparar te.....
La atención el recepción un poco fría, quizás a nuestro bajo nivel de ingles, conserjería bien, personal de servicio bien, atentos y serviciales, tanto porteros como maleteros. El desayuno tipo buffet completo, fiambres, bollería, huevos revueltos baicon salchichas, zumos, fruta, yogures....con la posibilidad de solicitar a la cocina huevos fritos, tortillas, tostadas, lo unico el cafe es el tipico de jarra, si se quiere algo  de mas calidad hay que solicitarlo a los camareros.
Tiene un pub a la entrada con un pianista por las noches, muy agradable, restaurante propio y  una terraza interior para desayunar o tomar copas si hace buen tiempo.
Esta bien ubicado a un paso de Victoria St y muy cerca del palacio de Bakinhang, zona tranquila y muy segura, New Scotlanh Yard esta a la vuelta de la esquina.
Cuando vuelva a Londres repetiremos en este hotel, seguro.

Freundlich und hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter. Lobby sehr stilvoll und grosszügig. Bar und Cocktails nett. Zimmer sind sehr unterschiedlich in Grösse innerhalb derselben Kategorie.

Ausgezeichnete Restaurants und gutes Frühstück.  Werde sicher wieder hingehen.",4,2014,10,07
121,Die besten Tage sind längst vergangen,"Das Hotel ist gut gelegen und sehr schön anzusehen. Der Schein war beim Betreten unseres Zimmers jedoch auch schon verflogen. Das Zimmer ist deutlich in die Jahre gekommen, darüber hinaus befindet sich im Moment eine Baustelle unmittelbar am Hotel. Für den entrichteten Preis hätten wir wahrlich mehr erwartet!",3,2014,10,06
121,Bello bello e comodo a tutto!!!!,"Ho alloggiato presso questo hotel per capodanno e mi sono trovata molto bene,pulito, personale gentile e davvero centrale...a 100 mt c'è buckingham palace, St. James park e si è nel mezzo di ben 2 fermate di metro.
La colazione era compresa nell'offerta ed era molto buona, si poteva scegliere tra la classica colazione itaiana oppure quella inglese.
e' 1hotel molto elegante e se si vuole c'è anche il servizio spa!!!!
CONSIGLIO VIVAMENTE A TUTTI!!!",5,2014,09,26
121,Hotel fantastico!,"Ho soggiornato la seconda volta a Marzo e non posso far altro che confermare tutto! È un hotel fantastico sotto ogni punto di vista... Personale gentilissimo, parlano tutte le lingue e per ogni tipo di problema sono di aiuto. Insomma quando tornerò a Londra soggiornerò di sicuro lì.",5,2014,09,26
121,A due passi da tutto,"Ottima struttura, ben tenuta e con camere spaziose per lo standard inglese. Posizione centrale per raggiungere a piedi tutte le attrattive principali del centro di Londra e ben servita con una stazione metro a 100 metri (Saint James Park su linea District e Circle line) e a 2 passi da Knightsbridge (Harrod's, Harvey Nichols e Sloane Street) e Victoria Station.
Camere Pulite, forse la moquette andrebbe rivista, causa un po' di odore nella stanza e non è sempre igienica e attenzione alle stanze sul retro, risultano un po' rumorose causa lavori e cantieri.
Ottima colazione internazionale e Bar aperto fino a notte fonda.
Da segnalare la presenza di una discreta sala fitness con attrezzature moderne (appena cambiate..) e sauna.
Sicuramente un ottimo punto di riferimento, in pieno centro, con un rapporto Prezzo/Qualità adeguato.",5,2014,09,16
121,Situación inmejorable,"Andando está a sólo unos 10 minutos del BIg Ben. Hotel elegantes ,con lujosas zonas comunes. El servicio excepcional.

121,Great Service and unparalleled experience!!,"Wir haben meiner Mutter zum Geburtstag 4 Tage London geschenkt und dafür das St James Hotel ausgesucht. Bereits im Vorfeld habe ich mehrmals Kontakt zum Concierge gehabt, um Musical Tickets zu buchen und eine Restaurantempfehlung- und buchung zu bekommen. Außerdem, da mein Vater sehr lärmempfindlich ist und weil es ja der Geburtstag meiner Mutter war habe ich darum gebeten, ein ""ruhiges"" Zimmer zu bekommen. Schon beim Tag unserer Ankunft wurden wir sehr freundlich und nett begrüßt. Als wir auf das Zimmer kamen, waren wir mehr als positiv überrascht und sehr berührt: wir hatten 2 ruhige, in den Hinterhof gelegene und sehr schöne Zimmer bekommen haben und als Highlight hat uns in dem Zimmer noch ein Happy Birthday Törtchen erwartet. Das war wirklich was ganz Besonderes und meine Mama war ganz begeistert. Die Lage des Hotels ist fast nicht zu toppen. In Laufnähe ist man am Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, Westminster Abbey u vieles mehr. Zusätzlich perfekte Anbindung an das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz. Leider war der Wasserdruck im 7. Stock nicht mehr ganz so optimal und das Haare Waschen hat etwas länger gedauert, aber das war überhaupt kein Problem. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und würden immer wieder kommen.",5,2014,08,31
121,"nicht schlecht, aber in die jahre gekommen ...","die lage ist hervorragend und das haus einfach schön ! alles andere , - na ja ...  das service ist auch teilweise ""bemüht"" aber nicht perfekt, vieles einfach kaputt und abgewohnt, die besten zeiten sind vorbei ....oder die renovierung kostet viel geld ..",3,2014,08,27
121,Klasse!,"Ein unbergessliches Hotel, würden es gerne immer wieder buchen. Hatten ein Schnäpchen gemacht. Die Lage ist super und das Ambiente extra Klasse. Das einzige was uns störte war, dass man fürs Fernsehen bezahlen musste. Haben uns nach der Reise beschwert und ruck zuck eine Antwort bekommen.",4,2014,08,14
121,Muy buen hotel,"Muy buena ubicación, a 3 cuadras del Underground. Atención excelente. Buen desayuno, moderado pero todo muy bien. Las habitaciones son agradables. El lugar muy tranquilo, si bien no está tan cerca de Piccadilly Circus, está ahí nomás del Palacio de Buckingham. Todo muy prolijo. Solo le faltaba presión a la ducha, quizás se deba a que estábamos en el piso más alto, piso 7. Es lo único que puedo decir que no es favorable. El resto realmente muy bueno.",5,2014,08,10
121,Ottimo hotel pulito e personale eccellente,"Sono stato ad agosto per una settimana e mi sono trovato molto bene in questo hotel molto lussuoso ed elegante.
Il wifi in camera prendeva bene, le camere erano molto pulite e spaziose, letti comodissimi, inoltre il personale alla reception (praticamente erano tutti ragazzi italiani) sono stati gentilissimi e molto disponibili. Consiglio vivamente questo hotel, vicino alla fermata metro di St james Park, e a 8 minuti da Victoria.
La zona è molto tranquilla.",5,2014,08,08
121,Ottima posizione ma camere da rinnovare,"La posizione è ottima. A due minuti a piedi da Buckingham Palace e metro dietro l'angolo.
Hall appariscente, colpisce subito l'effetto da grande hotel di lusso. Corridoi e camere però avrebbero bisogno di una rinnovata. Moquette e tappezzeria alle pareti consumata, camere piccole e bagno ancora più piccolo. Finestra claustrofobica. Wi Fi a singhiozzo (in camera non prendeva, dovevamo andare nei corridoi). Colazione, inclusa nella nostra tariffa, abbastanza soddisfacente ma potrebbe essere più ricca. Suggestiva la sala colazioni con vetrata che da sulla strada. Abbiamo prenotato 1 giorno prima di partire con un'offerta smart su booking.com perciò nulla da dire sul prezzo. Nel complesso esperienza positiva, ma ci tornerei solo se trovassi un'ottimo prezzo (considerando le tariffe di Londra!!).",3,2014,07,28
121,"Bonito, Tranquilo y Muy Bien Situado","Mi mujer y yo acabamos de estar 4 días/3 noches en el ST. James. El hotel, en líneas generales, se merece un notable alto. 
No es que pasáramos mucho tiempo en sus instalaciones, porque de los 4 días de estancia, la mayor parte del tiempo estuvimos  ""paseando"" por la ciudad; pero en lo que pedíamos para nuestro descanso cumplió perfectamente con las expectativas. 
La ubicación es  buena, a unos 5 minutos andando de Buckingham Palace y a no mas de 10-15 minutos de paseo de Westminster y el Parlamento. Además con la estación de metro de St. James Park muy próxima (2-3 minutos) y la London Victoria (10-12 min) para moverse hacia el resto de la ciudad.
El edificio muy bonito, en una zona tranquila sin demasiado ajetreo de trafico ni ruidos. La fachada exterior y el patio interior son preciosos. 
El trato del personal estupendo, todos dispuestos a ayudar y hacerte la estancia agradable (especial mención para Alessia que nos atendió en Recepción y fue un encanto, y también para todo el personal que atendía el desayuno, maravillosos todos y siempre atentos y serviciales).
Por ponerle alguna pega, la habitación donde nos alojamos un poquito pequeña, aunque eso sí muy limpia y en líneas generales bien equipada. 
Sólo nos llamó la atención la falta de cajones en el armario (¿?), perchas había suficientes; pero entre el minibar y la caja fuerte, se quedaron sin sitio para colocar algún cajón donde guardar toda esa ropa que no cuelgas....
El precio no es barato pero, siendo Londres, la relación calidad/precio no está nada mal. Muy recomendable",4,2014,06,23
121,"Silencioso, cómodo, antiguo y bien ubicado","El desayuno es similar a la de otros hoteles de la City de su categoria, nos atendieron muy bien (un camarero español). En cuanto a las habitaciones, es mejor que te guste el gusto ""retro"" inglés para disfrutarlas; son antiguas y  pequeñas para un hotel de su categoria (algo habitual en Londres) pero limpias, comodas, y (dado que el Hotel está cerca del Palacio de Buckingham) muy silenciosas por la noche, sin ruidos de gente ni tráfico. Estan disponibles 2 opciones de wifi, gratis y de alta velocidad-de pago, pero la opcion gratuita funciona estupendamente para navegar por internet y ver e-mails. La localizacion, excelente, se puede ir andando a Buckinham Palace y a Wenstminster/Big Ben sin problemas. Buena atención en recepción. El restaurante anexo es muy bueno. Es un hotel caro.",4,2014,06,02
121,Buena elección para visitar Londres,"Lo más destacable de este hotel es sin lugar a dudas el personal del mismo. La atención es exquisita en todo momento. Hay varios españoles trabajando en él. Nosotros tuvimos un upgrade a una habitación executive que era de un tamaño adecuado, aunque daba a un patio con las máquinas del aire acondicionado. A nosotros nos daba igual porque sólo íbamos al hotel a última hora y el pequeño ruido de las máquinas no nos molestaba. Nuestra habitación había sido reformada y tenía un estilo moderno y actual con todo tipo de conexiones para ordenador. El baño era moderno y la cama era buena. También cenamos un día en uno de los restaurantes del Hotel el Bistro 51, que es tranquilo y con buena comida. volvería sin duda. Respecto a la ubicación, que decir, excelente.",4,2014,06,02
121,Muy bien ubicado,"Las habitaciones standard son pequeñas así como tambien los cuartos de baño   La limpieza y atención estupenda
La ubicación del hotel es muy buena con todo lo céntrico q se requiera. Aún así el hotel es muy tranquilo y no hay ruido
Para pasar una corta estancia es recomendable",4,2014,05,31
121,Nice stay...,"An diesem Hotel gibt es wirklich nichts auszusetzen. Von der Begrüßung bis zum Check out - alles bestens! Mein Sohn wurde auf dem Zimmer mit einem hausgebackenen Cookie und einem Kännchen Schokolade begrüßt. Auf den ersten Blick wirkte das Zimmer etwas 'abgewetzt' - oder wie man heute vornehmer sagen würde 'vintage' oder 'shabby chic' ;-) - aber alles sauber.
Da wir jeden Morgen sehr früh beim Frühstück waren, blieb uns nur eines erspart: die lange Schlange vor dem Frühstückssaal zur 'Frühstücks-Rushhour'...",4,2014,05,27
121,Hotel mit Charme in guter Lage,"Ich war für eine Nacht Gast und habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Hotel ist von der Lage optimal.  Man erreicht zu Fuß viele Sehenswürdigkeiten.  Das Hotel selbst ist optisch schon in die Jahre gekommen,  allerdings ist alles sehr sauber und ohne größere Abnutzungserscheinungen. Letztendlich trägt dies auch zu dem Charme des Hauses bei. Obwohl das Hotel sehr groß ist, war mein Zimmer zum Innenhof hin sehr ruhig. Einen Punkt abzug gibt es für die überschaubare Zimmergröße. Besonders das Badezimmer ist sehr klein. Vom Frühstück hatte ich mir auch mehr erhofft. Ich war schon in mehreren Hotels in diesem Preissegment, die wesentlich mehr Auswahl geboten haben. So gab es zum Beispiel nur eine Brotsorte und auch die Käse und Wurstauswahl war mehr als mickrig. Ansonsten kann man das Hotel aber empfehlen. ",4,2014,05,27
121,Un viejo hotel con 4 pesimas estrellas,"El hotel es viejo, sinuoso (mil pasillos) y actualmente esta de obras. Desayuno pesimo, croisant duro, etc. No vayais, he estado en muchos hoteles como este por mucho mejor precio pero es una broma el cache que le dan por internet en esta misma pagina...

121,Ottima scelta,"Posizione centrale, pulito, servizio cordiale e disponibile, buon rapporto qualità prezzo, la colazione non è molto assortita ma non ci si può lamentare ed anche la sala colazione non è
forse abbastanza grande e quindi s'incontra un po'di confusione ed è rumorosa ma tutto
nella norma. Le stanze non sono proprio grandi ma per un hotel di città dove si deve solo
dormire vanno più che bene.",5,2014,05,13
121,formidable opcion,"Hemos pasado unos dias en Londres, y tanto el alojamiento, situacion, y comida han estado exquisitos. No hemos encontrado ningun pero al establecimiento.

121,"TOP, kann man nur empfehlen, jederzeit wieder!","Wir waren Anfang Mai in diesem Hotel und können uns wirklich über nichts beschweren. Hatten ein Angebot mit Frühstück zu einem Superpreis gebucht und dachten schon, dass es einen Haken hat, jedoch bekamen wir sogar ein Upgrade auf eine Suite mit wunderschönen Blick in den gepflegten Innenhof. Wir würden jederzeit wieder dieses wunderschöne Hotel buchen, alle sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, es gibt ein Business center, in dem wir online unsere Rückflüge einchecken konnten und das WLAN ist frei im Hotel. Das Frühstück war zwar typisch englisch, aber das wußten wir vorher und trotzdem hat man etwas gefunden, frische Früchte, Säfte und Müsli mit Joghurt usw. z.B.. Wir danken alen für einen tollen Aufenthalt. Wenn wir nochmal nach London fliegen, dann schauen wir zuerst nach diesem Hotel.",5,2014,05,06
121,Nel cuore di Londra e vicini alla Regina,"È il quinto viaggio a Londra in due anni. Degli hotel che abbiamo visto, questo è senza dubbio il migliore. I pregi di questo albergo sono tanti, primo su tutti è l'ospitalità e la cordialità del personale. Ci si sente subito ben accolti e l'ospite è al centro dell'attenzione. Del personale molti parlano italiano o si impegnano a cercare qualcuno che lo capisce. L'albergo è un bel 4 stelle con i portieri in livrea pronti ad accogliere gli ospiti. La concierge è a disposizione per ogni occorrenza e con cortesia soddisfa i desideri, la reception con le sue signorine sorridenti e gentili accoglie i clienti in arrivo ed in partenza. La camera da noi provata è la 632 executive con vista sulla corte interna. Camera molto confortevole e ben accessoriata, tranquilla e silenziosa, bagno generoso. Pulizia ineccepibile. La colazione continentale abbondante con personale attento e cordiale. Dagli impiegati ai manager abbiamo riscontrato gentilezza e cortesia. La posizione dell'albergo è invidiabile, a 5 minuti cronometrati dalla stazione della metropolitana St. James Park nel centro di Londra. È come essere vicini di casa della Regina, Buckingham Palace si trova dietro l'angolo. Torneremo ancora a Londra e questo sarà sicuramente il nostro alloggio.",5,2014,05,04
121,Fenomenal,"Hemos pasado una semana en este hotel y sólo puedo decir cosas buenas.
Empezando por el edificio, majestuoso, siguiendo por la ubicación, inmejorable al lado del Palacio de Buckingham, continuando por la calidad interior de todos los detalles y servicios y acabando por la excelente atención de todo el personal (siempre hay alguien un poco más rancio pero supongo que todos tenemos días...)
Sólo pondré un par de pegas menores: nos confirmaron en el momento de la reserva y poco antes de ir que la habitación daba al Courtyard, pero cuando llegamos al final no era así. Y el aire acondicionado no iba del todo fino y a veces hacía ruidos, aunque sólo una noche nos supuso un poco de inconveniente a la hora de dormir.
Pero el resumen general no puede ser mejor.
El desayuno de una calidad altísima, todos los profesionales cumpliendo perfectamente su cometido y con mucha amabilidad y atención, el restaurante estupendo, y la permanente sensación de estar envuelto por clase y elegancia en todos los rincones de la casa.
Cuando volvamos por Londres seguro que repetiremos, y también buscaremos algún otro Taj en más ciudades.",5,2014,04,29

121,Classe e qualità,"Abbiamo soggiornato per un week end in questo bellissimo hotel a 2 minuti a piedi da buckingham palace. Atmosfera molto british lord...idea di signorilità e cortesia.
Camere pulitissime e molto belle; all'interno del comprensorio c'è un cortile molto tranquillo per sfruttare il massimo del relax prima o dopo cena (specie d'estate).
La posizione è davvero l'ideale per visitare il centro di Londra: si arriva facilmente a piedi ovunque...per chi non ama camminare c'è comunque la fermata metro a 3 minuti e Victoria Station a 5.
Nota: ad inizio strada (Buckingham Gate) c'è un pub delizioso per delle british breakfast ottime!
Sicuramente consigliato",5,2014,04,23
121,Molto buono,"Vicinissimo a Buckingham Palace, quindi ottimo come partenza per qualsiasi attrazione nel centro di Londra. Ambiente pulito, raffinato, stanze spaziose, pulite e comode. Al primo piano ogni tanto si sente la metro ma non da fastidio. Bagno chiaramente senza bidè, (siamo a Londra!), vasca da bagno con classica tendina fastidiosa se si vuole fare solamente la doccia. Personale molto cortese e disponibile. Davvero un buon servizio. Prezzo medio alto, sui 160£ a camera per notte, ma sei in pieno centro e ripeto il servizio è molto buono.",4,2014,03,28
121,qualità e cortesia a 2 passi da Buckingham Palace,"Ci siamo concessi una breve fuga a Londra 3 gg dal 22/3 al 24/3 . L'hotel è praticamente a fianco di Buckingham Palace , vicino alla fermata metropolitana di st.James facilmente raggiungibile a piedi in 3 min. Il personale è gentilissimo , giovane , alla reception ci sono almeno 3 ragazzi che parlano italiano , nella sala delle colazioni ti chiedono da dove vieni e ti mandano la cameriera italiana , gli unici che se la ""tirano"" un po' sono quelli alla conciergerie , forse perché sono ""meno giovani"" e tipicamente inglesi . La stanza grande , pulita , con tutto , guardate nell'armadio troverete il phon , ferro e asse da stiro , tutto il necessario per farsi un the . il bagno è grande e spazioso ma come al solito manca il bidet . La Spa è dall'altra parte del cortile-giardino interno , anche qui ragazze gentilissime e una parla anche italiano . Quindi non preoccupatevi se avete difficolta nella lingua loro faranno di tutto per non farvi sentire a disagio e imbarazzati per questo . La colazione inglese ottima , nel buffet c'è tutto uova cucinate in tutte le maniere , pancetta , salsiccia , piselli e fagioli in umido , salumi , pane , fette da toast te le portano calde al tavolo , frutta , yogurt , tutti i tipi di cereali , muffin , paste ... insomma tutto tranne la nutella .. ohhh come mani ? Va bhe non si ci deve lamentare con tutto questo ben di dio . Prenotate la camera con colazione perché se pagate a parte costa circa 18-20 sterline a testa . Il prezzo considerando la posizione la qualità il servizio non è eccessivo ho trovato l'occasione su Kayak. Nel giorno di partenza dovete lasciare la camera entro le 11, ma vi danno la possibilità di andarvi a fare la doccia e cambiare nella Spa prima di partire . Che dire andateci , se torno a Londra sicuramente ci torno .",5,2014,03,26
121,Perfetto,"Gentilissimi, professionali (per gli italiani che non parlano inglese sappiate che ci sono dipendenti che parlano italiano). A 50 metri da Buckingham Palace, è centralissimo e vicinissimo alla metropolitana di st.James. Pulito (asciugamani, lenzuola ecc), silenzioso, confortevole. Insomma, perfetto. Non abbiamo mangiato all'interno della struttura ma tutto sembrava delizioso. Per chi vuole c'è anche la spa. Non è la prima volta a Londra, e ne ho viste di tutti i colori. Qui si va sul sicuro. Consigliato!",5,2014,03,25
121,Un hotel con clase,"Exelente hotel, exelentes profesionales, exelente atencion y exelente ubicacion! Tambien agradecerles el detalle que tuvieron por nuestra luna de miel al ponernos una habitacion superior con una tarta de felicitacion!",5,2014,03,18
121,Ottimo albergo,"Un bellissimo hotel, a due passi da Victoria Station e da Buckingham Palace. L'ambiente e' molto elegante e il personale gentilissimo. Alcune stanze sono un po' vecchie, ma è in ristrutturazione. Da ritornarci.",5,2014,03,16
121,Ottimo Hotel per soggiorno a Londra in zona Centrale (Westminister),"Soggiornato in questa struttura di alto livello, nel mese di marzo 2014 per 1 notte. Ho riservato una doppia con letto matrimoniale. La stanza, posizionata al 6^ piano, era di buone dimensioni e confortevole. Idem per lo spazio nel bagno dove era presente la vasca (doccia). Ridotti gli spazi per posizionare i bagagli nella stanza. L'ho scelto perchè in viaggio di lavoro e quindi per la posizione, di certo non per il prezzo (264 sterline per 1 notte). La posizione è a ridosso di Westminister, quindi molto comodo per visitare la città. Note: è presente l'asciugacapelli. Ciavattine monouso, frigobar, accappatoi e tutto quello che ci si può aspettare da un hotel di questo livello. Il Wi-Fi è disponibile in tutto l'edificio ma con segnale non ottimo. La tv non funzionava (assenza di segnale). Stanza ben climatizzata. Location non molto silenziosa di giorno per via degli infissi datati e di lavori in corso nella zona circostante. Dispone di ampi ascensori. Materiali degli arredi e rifiniture molto buoni. Reception sempre aperta, parlano diverse lingue e sono molto disponibili. Si vede subito che il livello dell'hotel è alto. La sala reception è ampia e di design. Dispone divani e poltrone e wi-fi. Disponibilità di parcheggi non valutata. Colazione internazionale abbondante e diversificata. Dispongono di un comodo e sicuro servizio di deposito bagagli. Voto Complessivo: Molto Buono. Sicuramente da valutare per eventuale soggiorno a seconda delle esigenze...ma di certo non economico.",4,2014,03,12
121,"Il modo migliore, più elegante e più comodo di godersi la città di Londra","Ho soggiornato presso il Taj con mia madre per il ponte di carnevale, e ho raggiunto la conclusione che quando tornerò a Londra, non esiterò a scegliere ancora questo hotel. E' un hotel lussuoso e pieno di comfort, posizionato strategicamente tra Buckingham Palace e la fermata della metro di S. James. La camera era strepitosa, arredata elegantemente, e caratterizzata da ogni comodità: tv, phone, bollitore e tazze, minibar, saponette e creme, biscotti, accappatoi, ferro da stiro, servizio di lavanderia, servizio in camera, letto comodissimo, etc. L'aspetto più sorprendente, è che abbiamo usufruito di tutte queste comodità ad un prezzo davvero ragionevole, approfittando di un ""pacchetto volo+hotel"" tramite il sito expedia, grazie al quale abbiamo pagato 370€ a persona tra volo, 3 notti di pernottamento e tasse. 
Ciò che contraddistingue il Taj da altri hotel è sicuramente la gentilezza e la professionalità del suo staff, dal personale alla reception, ai camerieri del Bistro, ristorante in cui viene servita la colazione e in cui ho cenato due sere, provando sia specialità inglesi (come lo stufato di cervo) sia piatti tipici indiani (come il Chicken Tikka Masala). I prezzi del ristorante sono leggermente superiori alla media, così come lo è anche la qualità. 
All'interno della struttura sono presenti anche un centro conferenze, un centro benessere di lusso, una palestra e altri ristoranti come gli Hamptons, il Bank, e il cocktail bar Zander.
In conclusione, presso l'hotel St. James Court ho avuto un'esperienza più che positiva, lo consiglio caldamente a chi vuole visitare la dinamica città di Londra senza rinunciare al comfort.",5,2014,03,11
121,"Comodo, di classe e molta cortesia","Location strategica, a due passi da Buckingham Palace e ottimamente servito da mezzi pubblici. Lussuoso e confortevole, si caratterizza per la cortesia e disciplina del personale, molto professionale, che vi fa sentire a casa. Da segnalare positivamente anche il ristorante che, oltre ad un servizio assolutamente impeccabile, garantisce una cucina di buon livello. Assolutamente un must per visitare Londra!",5,2014,03,10
121,"Perfetto, Gentilissimi, Fantastico!","Ho soggiornato i primi di Gennaio in questa struttura e ci tornerò anche a fine Marzo, il personale é gentilissimo, le camere ampie, pulitissime e dotate di ogni confort, letti comodissimi e cuscini fantastici.
Tutto veramente ottimo!!!! 10+",5,2014,03,09
121,Kurztrip nach London,"Leider nicht mehr so wie vor 22 Jahren,das Zimmer behindertengerecht mit Leinen über dem Bett und zig Halterunegen im Badezimmer der frühere Teppichboden wurde durch einen Holzboden ersetzt der sehr abgelebt vorgefunden wurde. Das Frühstücksbuffet war nur mit dem Notdürftigsten bestückt. Beim nächsten Londontrip wird's 100% ein anderes Hotel",2,2014,03,06
121,Empfehlenswert,"ich war bereits zum 2. mal in diesem Hotel und kann es nur wärmstens empfehlen.
Die Lage, in unmittelbarer Nähe zu Victoria Station, weniger als 5 Minuten zum Buckingham Palace und Green Park. New Bond Street, Bond Street, Regent Street und Oxford Street sowie Piccadily Circus sind ebenso in weniger als 10 - 15 Minuten zu erreichen.
Das Hotel bietet alles was man von einem Haus dieser Preisklasse erwarten darf. Zimmer sind für Londoner Verhältnisse angemessen und sauber. Ebenso wie dies andere Bewerter schon erwähnt haben, sollte man sich den sehr teuren Aufpreis für das hoteleigene Frühstück sparen und direkt gegenüber dem Hotel in das angenehme und preiswertere Café gehen, wo man alles bekommt was das Frühstücksherz begehrt.
alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen und ich werde bei weiteren London Trips, dieses Hotel buchen.",5,2014,03,02
121,Schönes Hotel mit guter Lage,"Wir waren dieses Wochenende im St. James Court Hotel und können dieses Hotel ohne Probleme empfehlen. Die Lage des Hotels ist für eine Städtereise geeignet. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit erreicht man zu Fuss den Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, London Eye, etc. Empfehlung: das Geld für das Frühstück sparen und direkt gegenüber morgens im Pret a Manger frühstücken.

Die Zimmer waren nicht sonderlich gross dafür sauber und die Lage ist das was bei einer Städtereise zählt.",4,2014,02,25
121,Eccellente,"In questo albergo si respira un aria di vero relax e comfort. In pieno centro a pochi passi dalla metro e dai principali punti d'interesse londinesi. La stanza era abbastanza grande e molto pulita, forse l'unica pecca è stato il letto non comodissimo seppure abbastanza grande almeno per gli standard italiani! La colazione ottima ma con poca varietà. Staff di grande gentilezza e molto premuroso ma non invadente. Eccellente il rapporto qualità prezzo.Sicuramente ci torneremo",5,2014,02,23
121,HOTEL MUY BONITO Y CLASICO,"Hace un año visité este Hotel y me pareció precioso, la fachada es antigua y de ladrillo rojo y está muy bien situado es precio no fue muy caro porque cogimos una oferta tiene la estación de tren al lado y los monumentos más emblemáticos cerca es una zona muy buena nosotras volvíamos tarde y estábamos tranquilas, la habitación  que nos dieron era grande y bonita pero tuvimos un problema en el baño y muy amablemente nos dijeron que por la mañana dejásemos las maletas cerradas que nos cambiarían de habitación y nuestra sorpresa fue que cuando regresamos por la noche nos habían cambiado a un ático en una zona privada con jardines que tiene el hotel con una habitación maravillosa y durante nuestra estancia tuvieron muchas atenciones con nosotras, fuimos en Navidades y Londres está precioso en esas fechas si conseguís un buen precio aunque no tengáis el ático podéis elegir el Hotel pues la otra habitación estaba muy bien",5,2014,02,22
121,Muy buen hotel en excelente ubicación,"Establecimiento muy bien ubicado junto a las estaciones de St. James y Victoria, y a la vez muy tranquilo. Instalaciones en excelentes condiciones, bien conservadas y muy limpias. Habitaciones amplias, cómodas y otra vez, muy limpias, cuentan con todas las necesidades. El servicio del hotel es muy correcto, educado y amable en general aunque a destacar una de las recepcionistas, Belén, una chica de Jaén, España, no olvidaremos la amabilidad con la que nos recibió, una sonrisa sincera, educación,profesionalidad...Nos asesoró y aconsejó excelentemente y nos llevamos un gran recuerdo de ella a Mallorca!
Como contrapartida, el servicio en el bar del hotel, Hamptons creo.... Los 2 chicos que nos atendieron ...desastrosos! Un tal Mauro y al otro que ni recuerdo su nombre...",5,2014,02,10
121,Ottima struttura,"Ospitalità, cordialità, eccellenza del servizio..tutto questo è il St James.
Un grazie ad Annamaria, Patricia e Claudio per le premurose attenzioni...
A pochi metri dalle principali attrazioni è situato in ottima posizione per esplorare a piedi la città...
Le camere sono piccole, ma molto confortevoli e pulite.
Il Bistrot è un luogo molto piacevole dove fare colazione!
Da mettere sicuramente nella lista dei ""ci tornerò""!!!",4,2014,02,09
121,buon rapporto prezzo / qualità,"Ho avuto occasione di soggiornare in questo albergo due volte (la prima 2 anni fa quando faceva parte della catena Crowne Plaza) e mi sento di confermare l'ottima impressione che mi aveva fatto. L'albergo è situato in posizione centralissima, a due passi da Buckingham Palace e dalla fermata della metropolitana di St. James Park; in 15/20 minuti a piedi si può raggiungere Piccadilly Circus / Soho / Trafalgar Square etc. Il personale è molto mprofessionale ed estremamente gentile a partire dalla reception. Le camere sono confortevoli e complete di tutto (ferro da stiro, boiler elettrico, stirapantaloni, accappatoi etc) unico neo il wi.fi. libero ha una velocità di connessione veramente molto lenta. Colazione ottima. Ho avuto modo di cenare presso il Bistrot e devo ammettere di essere rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso. Altro optional, che per me non ha prezzo, è la possibilità di uscire dall'albergo e di poter fare una piacevole e rilassante passeggiata in St. James Park.",5,2014,01,30
121,"Excelente hotel, antiguo pero bien conservado!","Muy buen hotel, a metros de las atracciones principales de Londres. Muy próximo a Victoria St, lo que favorece el transporte. La atención es muy buena, al igual que el desayuno que es de primera! Los servicios del hotel son muy buenos. Si bien es un estilo conservador y viejo, está muy bien cuidado y obedece a un hotel de su categoría. La sala de negocios es muy cómoda, y hasta ofrecen salas privadas de negocios.",5,2014,01,27
121,Bello e cortesi,"ho soggiornato in questo hotel molto bello , esternamente ma anche dentro, begli spazi, molto pulito, personale davvero cortese, molto del quale diu origine italiana, la poszione è perfetta a due passi da tutto inclusa la fermata della metro di St James park.",5,2014,01,27
121,Bellissimo albergo,"abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo molto elegante con un' offerta speciale e non siamo stati delusi
la posizione è centrale, a pochi passi dalla metropolitana St James Park
La camera classica è spaziosa e silenziosa, l'accoglienza ottima",5,2014,01,22
121,Ottimo hotel,"Ho soggiornato in quest'hotel con mio figlio dal 13 al 15 gennaio.
Hotel molto elegante, allietato nel pomeriggio e la sera da ottima musica al piano.
La posizione è superba: a due passi da Buckingham Palace, pochi minuti a piedi dal Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, vicino alla stazione della metropolitana di St James's Park. Anche Victoria Square, da cui partono i collegamenti per l'aeroporto, è raggiungibile a piedi (10-15 minuti).
Abbiamo cenato una sera al ristorante Bistrot dell'hotel e ci siamo trovati molto bene.
Non ho dato l'eccellenza solo perché la nostra camera era in una posizione dalla quale si avvertiva il passaggio dei treni. Il signor Claudio alla reception, vero fiore all'occhiello dell'hotel per la sua squisita gentilezza e impeccabile professionalità, mi ha assicurato che la prossima volta ci sistemerà in camere silenziose e non disturbate dai treni. Ci torneremo senz'altro.
Ottima esperienza",4,2014,01,16
