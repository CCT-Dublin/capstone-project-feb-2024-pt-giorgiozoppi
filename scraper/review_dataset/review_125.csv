125,Best place to stay in the West End,"We have lots of experience in London, and we love it every time.  Of all the many hotels we have selected over many trips there, this is the winner, by a long shot.
The location is unrivalled.  A block from Leicester Square and a block and a half from Covent Garden, a block from the Strand.  Lots of Tube stations in every direction, an easy walk to all the theatres, tremendous restaurant selections near by.
The room was very comfortable and had the best, instant hot water of any place we have ever stayed.  The breakfast was a joy every morning, we were there 12 days, and the staff always attentive.
Great bed and linens and lots of TV options.  We did not watch a lot of TV as we were at the Theatre most of the time, but nice to have when we were in the room.
Not a bargain hotel but no doubt worth it.
I cannot say enough good things about it.",5,2024,10,19

125,St Martins Lane Hotel Saved My Life,"I had booked a major hotel in London through the largest travel site, only to find when I arrived there was no reservation.  Taylor Swift was performing and it was summer holidays and rooms were very hard to find.  While we were hitting websites to find a new hotel, we walked past St Martins Lane Hotel and stopped in to sit in the lobby while we continued our quest.  Seeing we were in distress, staff members came over and offered to help.  Although technically full, they gave us a very nice room for 2 nights and then let us move into one of their amazing King Garden Suites for the remainder of our stay.  Thanks to Franco, Phil and Visar, who truly went above and beyond.  St Martins Lane Hotel is definitely our go-to hotel in London from now on.",5,2024,08,23
125,Visar is the best!,"Great team and the location was perfect.   Loved the hotel.   The team at the front - especially VISAR - were incredible !!!!!!  We were there twice - flying thru London.  

I plan to go back to London and this hotel is where I will stay.  The bed was heavenly and while the rooms are smaller it‚Äôs nicely appointed.",5,2024,08,20
125,Home away from home,"This was my second visit to St Martins lane and it was a really lovely stay. It was great to meet Joao at the reception desk again and have him check us in. He made us feel so welcome and insured we had a beautiful room.
We had a deluxe room with a lovely little outdoor terrace where you could enjoy the sun and have a cuppa.
I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of hotels in London over the years but the location of this hotel is second to none. You are only a 5 min walk from Covent Garden, Leicester square and Trafalgar Square. The hotel has numerous dining and beverage options. On this occasion we used the cosy outdoor summer terrace, a perfect spot to have a cold drink and chill.
All the staff we met were so nice and professional and a credit to the hotel.",5,2024,08,20
125,Hope To Be Back,Superb hotel - clean and bright room with an extremely comfortable bed and excellent shower - exceptionally helpful staff - puzzled that it was nigh on impossible to get a drink in the bar after 10.15pm but thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be back.,4,2024,08,20
125,Great hotel on west end.,"Nice hotel in London w actual space for a family of 4.  Convenient walk to food, sights and restaurants.  All the staff said hello and offered assistance from the lobby to the elevator and the floor.   Have to give compliments to Visar for the excellent hospitality and service. He always helped with our bags and was always at the door w a smile and water bottles for the kids and me.  It was fun talking football with him. (Iam sorry England didn‚Äôt win the Euros. I have same name as one of the players last name-sorry didn‚Äôt score another PK for you).  Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2024,08,17
125,I nice time and delicious cake,"In the cozy EllaMia cafe I enjoyed the most delicious ice latte, which was prepared for me by a very friendly girl Tatiana. I also ordered a lavender tart with blueberries, it is a very unusual and delicious combination of taste and texture. I recommend this place if you want to relax a little and have a good time.",5,2024,08,16
125,Another great evening at St Martins Lane,"We have been here a number of times and always enjoyed our meal. When the menus came I thought the food did not sound so exciting this time, but I was wrong. Our mains were delicious and perfectly seasoned (such a skill) . Our puds were also fab and a little crazy!  Of course without great service eating out is not wonderful, but we were looked after by Skender who made our experience extra special. Thank you",5,2024,08,15
125,Great location,"Checked in early which was fine with the hotel - about 1.30 and others were checking in too. There were two staff in the lobby greeting people as they arrived but only one on reception which seemed a bit odd. I never saw more than two staff on reception the whole time I was there which meant that when I wanted to report an issue I either had to queue or not report it, or go to my room and call reception! 

My room was on the 6th floor and faced onto the back of a couple of rows of houses so I was not disturbed by London street noise at all while I was there. However I was disturbed by some very loud crashing noises from the room next door which I imagined was the door between their room and their bathroom. This woke me up before 6 a.m. on my first two mornings and I did report it on the phone. I think it was fixed but I was woken at other times by their TV noise.

My room was clean, and the bed was super comfortable, there were 4 large pillows and additionally the headboard of the bed appeared to comprise two more large pillows. There were handy USB ports both sides of the bed and behind the headboard a shelf as there was no bedside table. The hanging space was in the hallway covered by a curtain, and there were shelves here and more shelves in the bathroom so plenty of storage space although I was a bit confused about where to stash my suitcase. 

The room came equipped with a coffee maker, kettle, tea, coffee pods etc. Bottled water was also provided free, and there was an extensive mini bar which was not free. I found a little box saying ‚Äòvanity kit‚Äô on a shelf with the hairdryer and I used the cotton wool from this on my first night there, but it was never replaced. I don‚Äôt think anyone even checked for it, so I called reception asking for more cotton wool. I also had to call them to replace the small bottle of long life milk that was provided each day, things were overlooked which I was not expecting in a hotel that describes itself as ‚Äò5 star‚Äô. 

Breakfast was not included in my room rate (which I booked directly on the Accor App) but I had breakfast one morning, ordering the ‚Äòtwo eggs and sourdough‚Äô option. The eggs could be ordered done any way, so I ordered poached. They arrived scrambled. The waiter was apologetic and offered to change this but I hate food waste so had them anyway, they were fine but not what I ordered. An annoying thing about the breakfast was that a 13.5% gratuity had already been added to the bill but when the bill arrived at my table there was space for another gratuity to be added, a practice which I really don‚Äôt like. I always tip (even if service isn‚Äôt what it could have been) but to expect guests to tip twice is not on. 

I arrived back after 10 pm on my first two evenings and there were several children between the ages of about 6 and 10 running riot in the lobby, one of them ran straight into me as I was trying to circumnavigate them to get to the lift. No sign of the parents and no staff trying to calm things down a bit. I suspect parents may have been in the restaurant which was visible from the lobby. 

All in all I had a decent 5 night stay as the hotel is in a very convenient location but there were a few issues with my stay.",4,2024,08,12
125,Incredible experience at The Den,Amazing service and an amazing lounge bar. Really cool artwork and great hospitality. Good music playing and a lovely ambiance. Aarati was a lovely host and so so helpful. Great on explaining the concept of The Den and gave us a free alternative drink when we didn‚Äôt like the one we had. Viviane was also great and so helpful! Overall a 10/10 experience! I would definitely come back.,5,2024,08,10

125,Great location but rooms are a let down.,"Great location. It is in the center of everything (restaurants, shopping etc..)
Lobby and hotel entry area  is really nice
The rooms are about 5 stpes down from the rest. 

THE GOOD: The bed is nice bright white but i reserved a king size and i dont think that is what i got. The view from my 6th floor room is amazing. 
THE BAD: The carpet looks old. As well, the flooring in the bathroom also looks old and dated. The closet space is quite minimal. For the price, i would probably try to find a place where the rooms match the level of the rest of the hotel.",3,2024,08,01
125,Lovely experience.,"I had the pleasure of staying at St. Martins Lane Hotel, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish.

The hotel, the vibe and the rooms- nothing but wonderful and the signature scent to die for ü•∞
St Martins lane after our 14 year relationship with you- you still continue to give. 
A big shout out to the concierge team, those guys are the life and soul of the hotel and always remember a face. The reception team generally were great, the only thing I would say is we as customers don‚Äôt need to know of there having a bad day as it reads through their service.
Anyway..
St Martins Lane we hope to be back again soon, 14 years and counting..",5,2024,07,27

I had a king garden room.
Just be aware They ask for another ¬£200 on arrival for any extras you may have during your stay.
I complained about the blinds not shutting and moved rooms and found out the original room was not the room I paid for.
Cooked breakfast was just ok but the buffet was exceptional.",4,2024,07,24
125,Wonderful Hotel and location,"St. Martin‚Äôs Lane in London exceeded all of our expectations! From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. The chic and modern design of the hotel perfectly blends with the historic charm of the city. Our room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and offered stunning views of the city.

The location is unbeatable, right in the heart of Covent Garden, with easy access to top attractions, theaters, and dining options. The hotel‚Äôs restaurant and bar were also top-notch, providing delicious meals and drinks in a stylish setting.

125,The noisy Tom Holland fans in room 128‚Ä¶ :D,"This is the best hotel I‚Äô ve ever stayed in. I can‚Äôt say enough, seriously, it‚Äôs so good I could live there.
Stayed there while in that part of London a few days to see  Romeo & Juliet at the Duke of York theatre, the hotel is in an exquisite position for the theatre, which really suited us for swanning about in our fancy outfits which aren‚Äôt made for walking. 
The whole hotel is spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, full of delights.  The food and drink is made to perfection. The bed is the comfiest I ever slept on, their pillows are made from angel wing feathers I swear. 

It wouldn‚Äôt be right to leave a review without mentioning the staff: they make the hotel what it is, they treat you like honoured guests and they are sweet, funny, engaging , attentive, helpful, and just the best people. 
We were looked after by the supremely brilliant Jo√£o and his team of colleagues on reception, and the very kind and warm Nuno and the beautiful staff on the terrace. I hope they all get a fat payrise, they certainly made sure we will return.",5,2024,07,20
125,Awful customer service,"Terrible customer service, cannot get anybody on the phone from outside the hotel.  Had an issue with my reservation that one manager had agreed to resolve and another manager back tracked on the resolution the following day when we arrived.  They did not even have the courtesy to call us or at least answer the phone when we called multiple times to confirm prior to our arrival.   With so many better options in London, I would avoid this hotel at all costs.",1,2024,07,18

The best part of our experience was the great service.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with some of issues me ran into in our trip with transportation and some other challenges with our travel.  One member of their staff, Visar, was amazing.

The tariff was ¬£430 for B&B The mini- bar prices were hilarious ¬£8 for a small pot of Pringles or a bottle of beer. Breakfast was OK but a bit of a faff with one cup of coffee rather than a pot.
There was one member of staff on checking in and out , but two people wandering about asking what they could do to help ? So I waited 10 minutes to checkout while they schmoozed ! All in all a very expensive average hotel.",3,2024,07,09
125,Good stay,"Great location. We stayed twice here. Great brealfast. Rooms are small but the location makes up for the same

125,Perfect Double Double for family,"Our family of 4 traveling from US needed a room in London with 2 real beds(not one as a sleeper sofa) Hotels there call their rooms with just one bed a Double because of the size of the bed.  So we needed a ‚ÄúDouble Double‚Äù. Those seem hard to find in London and this hotel has just 5, but theirs are absolutely perfect for a family! The location is in the heart of where to be if you want to walk to most Must see tourist spots. There are tons of eating options fitting the diversity needs of a family right outside your door.  It was great to walk to the many theaters just around the corner in any direction as well.  The restaurant has an easy self serve breakfast too for quick mornings or sit down. The cleanings and nightly turn downs were first class. The gym is exceptional and my whole family slept like babies with the very comfy beds & pillows all night.  The water pressure in showers was fantastic as well.  It was more expensive than I normally spend but every penny worth it and would choose it hands down for our next visit.

Equally commendable is¬†Visan, the luggage handler, whose friendly demeanor and appreciative personality shine through his work. His willingness to go the extra mile to ensure guest satisfaction is truly admirable.

Rooms are modern and comfortable. We upgraded to the loft room that qas a perfect balance of comfort and practicality and gave you the needed room for a couple to feel right at home. 

The hotel‚Äôs location is the icing on the cake‚Äîa convenient 20-30 minute walk from almost any destination you‚Äôd want to visit in the city. Whether you‚Äôre here for business or pleasure, this hotel is an excellent choice.

125,Location and service beyond compare!,"The hotel has some very well thought out spaces (especially The Blind Spot speakeasy bar). The staff are the most accommodating of any of the many places we have stayed across the world.

125,"Fabulous, highly recommend","Fabulous stay. We were instantly made to feel valued and welcomed by the reception staff. Nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded and shown around the hotel, even the bar that was closed but we were curious about. Monica was incredibly helpful - Advising us on how to get about and convincing us (rightly) that the Uber Boat was the best way to The Shard. She was a great ambassador for your hotel.
Food and drinks incredible and friendly, professional staff - no complaints from us and we‚Äôd love to visit again, Kate & Mark",5,2024,05,31
125,Stylish but lacks of service,"Certainly, the ,hardware' is outstanding. Very well located, clean rooms, tasty a la card breakfast.

But for a 5* Hotel I had expected more attentive service. When I arrived I had been felt disturbing the frontstaff: No smalltalk, no warm welcome, but a lottery and coolness. The hotel was very short fot perks for ALL Diamond members ( No Welcome Drink, not really a late Check Out, upgrade I didn't realized ). Just one thing  more, I asked and paid in advance for a corner room, but didn't get any reply from the reservation desk. Finally I have got another room without any explanation.

I admit that are first world problems. But when I book such a hotel I expect a highend service too. Actually I made better experience in other hotels in the city ( e.g. Sofitel or Pullman ).",3,2024,05,30
125,Quirky,"Recent weekend stay with partner; we had not visited St. Martin's Lane Hotel for a few years and we were looking forward to returning. The interior is always a pleasing assault on the the eye, quirky and in your face, as you would expect from a Starck interior.

Always happy to stay at St Martin's Lane when visiting London; guaranteed to put a smile on your face!",5,2024,05,26

125,Lovely cocktails,My husband and I popped in after seeing a sign outside for an outside terrace area and cocktails - we have walked past countless times and didn't actually realise it was a hotel or that there was an outside bar area. We each had a saki cocktail that was much enjoyed. All of the staff members we spoke to were welcoming/friendly and the person who served our drinks was just lovely and went off to get us cushions etc unrequested. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and interesting - we also spotted a lovely lounge area which would be perfect for a coffee. We will definitely pop in again next time we are in the area. ,5,2024,05,19

125,Apr/May 24,"Excellent location. Tremendous Service. Concierge Desk (Patrick I believe?) was incredibly helpful and courteous. Visar was fantastic - cheerful, friendly and eager to be of help. As was Demetri. Those three were the best part of the stay but all the staff we dealt with were great. Only negatives were lack of storage in the rooms and the lack of privacy with open bathroom. When we returned on last leg of trip our second room had a bathroom door so now I know to ask for that.",5,2024,05,11

This hotel is very convenient to the theaters of the West End, and there is great  shopping, wonderful restaurants, and proximity to multiple major attractions that are must-sees while in London! Great people watching as well!

The hotel itself is really spectacular, with clean, well appointed large rooms. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning and had dinner one evening, which was excellent as well. What further makes  this hotel so outstanding are the efforts every staff member makes to insure that  each guest‚Äôs stay is as pleasurable and memorable as possible.

Shout outs to Paula, Simo, Jemma, Vizr, Dimitar, and Aldo, and everyone else!

125,Great hotel and location.   Concerned about new added fees.,"I love this hotel.  Great location. Cool decor.  Friendly staff. Etc

I‚Äôve stayed many times and always enjoyed myself.   

I think they‚Äôve changed management recently though because the historically very accommodating front desk personnel seemed really focused on up charging.  I arrived mid morning (approx 10am) because I was travelling from the States. The desk clerk said there were no rooms in my class ready, but he could find an upgraded room. .. for an additional 70 pounds/ night.  Since I was staying 8 days, this didn‚Äôt work for me.  He the offered a different room for 50 pounds/ night.   Still out of my budget.   He then offered to let me Che k in early to the room I reserved. (Yes, the one he just told me was not ready) for 170 pounds.   At this point, I declined on principle and simple returned at check in time that afternoon.  

Again, I love the St Martins Lane and hope this experience isn‚Äôt a sign of more things to come.",4,2024,05,05

125,10 year Wedding Anniversary Celebration!,"Fantastic, very friendly staff & fab-u-lous interior design! We were looking for a special venue to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary in the heart of London (without our kids!). Friends had recommended St Martins Lane to us and it did not disappoint!

Champagne on ice in our room was the icing on the cake for a very special & memorable weekend....we'll be back!",5,2024,03,14
125,Amazing staff for an unforgettable stay!!!,"We stayed for a week and we really enjoyed our stay. All the employees we met were kind, nice and welcoming.

If we ever come back to London, we will certainly return here. Finally, we recommend the tea and tales experience mainly if Fabio is the one serving it.",5,2024,03,14
125,A Fantastic Visit - Great in Every Way!!!,"Stayed here for 3 nights for our 10-year anniversary. Would highly recommend. Overall, it was a fantastic stay. We were able to check in a little early (check in was quick and easy) and the awesome front desk staff upgraded our room. They were very nice and personable upon check in. Had a room overlooking the main street (street was under construction and no cars were driving down it, which I liked). Room was great - bed was super comfortable, loved the different color LED lights, hotel smelled great, loved their shampoo/conditioner. Zero complaints about the room, hotel and staff. The staff was very generous and sent us a dessert platter, a few waters (we don't drink) and a lovely handwritten card to celebrate our anniversary. It was such a nice touch and really made us feel special/appreciated as guests. We ate breakfast at the restaurant one day and it was delicious. Loved the breakfast buffet, and the hash browns and eggs. Super yummy. The concierge staff was amazing and we want to give Ilidio a huge shout-out. He booked us a 3-stop day tour of Windsor Castle, Bath, and Stonehenge. It was such a great experience. He was very nice and helpful. We also met Patrick, who was equally just as friendly. We felt bad that we checked out super quick (we were running late for our train) and forgot to give him a tip (we still feel horrible about it). I know it's not the same, but I hope this review sends our appreciation to him and to all the staff. We really had a special trip staying here due to them. Even the doormen were super helpful and friendly when coming and going.  The location of the hotel was also great. Walking distance to a lot of attractions, restaurants and sites. Super helpful that the room had an umbrella for us to use -- we definitely needed it (and it was also a really good umbrella. Never turned inside out despite the strong winds and rains). 10/10 would stay here again and recommend this hotel to all my family/friends. Thank you St. Martins Lane for an unforgettable experience!!!",5,2024,03,12
125,Bottoms up at St Martins!,"Has lost it‚Äôs sparkle from earlier times, but was a nice break from the hustle & bustle of the big city. Our waitor Frayer was so attentive and we had great service!

All of the staff are just incredibly friendly, helpful and go over and above to make you feel special. Check in was quick and easy. The reception areas are quirky and interesting, the music makes it even better. 
Our room was beautiful, stylish and had the most amazing city views across to the London eye. The bed was the comfiest and everything was there you may need. If not, the staff will help you get it!! I especially loved the umbrella you can borrow whilst staying. great touch. Each night our bed was turned down, curtains closed, each day our room was cleaned spotlessly. 
The  bar/restaurant is lovely, again made by their staff and their attentiveness and interest in our visit. The cocktails were lovely and I loved my breakfast from the table! 
The hotel is in the perfect position for London - could not have been better. 2 mins walk to Leicester Square tube. Near the main theatre district, China town, Covent Graden and a short walk to Westminster and Buckingham Palace. We could not have asked for better.

He is an excellent ambassador for your business and will be looking to make return stay at your venue as it is ideally located and we found the hotel and staff to all be superbly friendly and helpful.

125,St Martins Lane London Hotel,"Jemma our host at St Martins Lane Hotel was down to earth and made sure our stay was fabulous. 
We really liked the bathroom suite, we requested rose petals for our room and they did a fantastic job with laying out the petals and making our room a sensual & inviting experience for us. 
The added experience was the colourful lights behind the bed, you can change them to any colour you like & dim them. 
Overall, a friendly, comfortable, and luxurious stay, and we recommend the room service for breakfast; as it was delicious.",5,2024,02,11
125,Well done Juliana,Excellent service in the restaurant by Juliana fabulous food and she recommended us the best choices from the menu.  We loved the bass and the cheese souffl√©. Also the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was fabulous. Without her we wouldn‚Äôt have known what to order,5,2024,02,10

Food and drink were both great, and the steak was delicious. Would 100% recommend and will definitely come back.",5,2024,02,10
125,Great Hotel and Location in Covent Gatden,Just finished a 2 night stay in a Junior Suite. The room was good sized and nicely appointed. I particularly liked the little cubbies in the bathroom to put your toiletries on instead of having them crowded around the sink. There were more cubbies and space in the hallway which would have made it convenient for a longer stay. The staff were all friendly and helpful especially Visas who greeted us on arrival and helped with our bags. He went out of his way to make sure I was OK when he spotted that sticks due to me recently having hip surgery. I make it a point to read the ‚Äúterrible‚Äù reviews and absolutely none of them applied during our stay which was lovely despite the rain :-).,5,2024,02,09
125,Excellent restaurant,"Delicious food at a very reasonable price. Great location. Great service from Juliana our waitress. 

Modern British / continental style extremely well flavoured. 

Mix of fish, meat, and vegetarian. 

Also reasonably quiet for a conversation. 

Highly recommended.",5,2024,02,08
125,Worst hospitality experience ever,"Disliked  ¬∑ I was disgusted with how we were treated  We booked a table in the secret bar to follow our dinner in Soho. We had had a small glass of wine each with our meal! As we approached, the man at the entrance to the bar told us to go and sit down, calm down and sober up! We hadn‚Äôt even spoken. And meanwhile he was letting in a large noisy group of people. It was absolutely bizarre and I have never ever been treated in this way anywhere. We were stone cold sober! It was embarrassing. The night manager told us this guy was agency staff. He offered us a free drink. But actually couldn‚Äôt seem to care less. He was joined by another guy who seemed to find the whole situation really amusing. This experience was appalling and ruined our stay. No one followed up with us to apologise. Also there is NEVER anyone to help at the concierge desk.",1,2024,02,06
125,Cocktails,"Had a fabulous evening at the Blind Spot - cocktails great and attentive customer service especially from Manon who is incredibly knowledgeable regarding the cocktail menu and continued to check on our needs throughout our time at the bar.
All the staff gave us a wonderful evening following a spillage of drinks - recommend highly.",5,2024,02,05
125,Another Great stay,"Every time I stay here I have a great experience. Their is real teamwork at this Hotel and the staff are simply brilliant, nothing is too much trouble.

The from desk team are a joy and always welcome you with a smile and are happy to help.

What I particularly like is that they go out of their way to  remember who you are and a make a personal connection.

Great stay !! Can‚Äôt recommend enough",5,2024,02,05
125,Good food & decent speed,"Great service by Manuel & the team. Great food, and no faffing or unnecessary wait! Got to the theatre on a tight schedule with time to spare. Recommend!

Ps: entrance to restaurant hated to find - look for large glass frontage to east of the road.",5,2024,02,03
125,Great service and food,"Lovely food and great service by Manuel. We were late and we messaged and it was no problem. Manuel was super efficient & knowledgeable. Started with the hump Comte souffl√©, which was so yummy, the monkfish was amazing and I had a very nice glass of cremant to start followed by Carignan. Bit of shame they don‚Äôt do pre-theatre on a Saturday but that was a minor issue and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.",5,2024,02,03
125,Great atmosphere and service,"I went there with my friend for a brunch on a Saturday and had a great time. The location is convenient. 

Joao and Kyle provided exceptional service to us and I would definitely go back. The food and drinks were delicious and I would love to try other food next time.",5,2024,01,31
125,Very happy with my visit at Blind Spot!,We stopped by and visited the bar Blind Spot during our weekend in London. Cleverson is so lovely and made our visit to the bar excellent! Such a kind person and very caring of all the customers. Definitely worth a visit. Drinks are also very nice,5,2024,01,31
125,AMAZING STAY,"Where do I start!? This hotel is perfectly placed in the heart of London!  We only had a few days in London, and this stay was so convenient, comfortable, and accommodating at all hours!

We spent an evening at the Speakeasy located in the hotel, and Manon was amazing. She ensured we had a great experience while we were celebrating our anniversary. I highly recommend visiting the Speakeasy while you are staying here.

Everything we ordered was delicious and on Saturday night we were happy to find out that they had 24hr room service since we were at a concert at The 02 Arena and didn‚Äôt have time to eat at all! I really couldn‚Äôt say enough amazing things about this place, and you will not be disappointed if you decide to stay here!",5,2024,01,30
125,Fantastic stay!,"I stayed at this hotel recently and had a lovely stray. Gabriel, was awesome with top-notch service. He was super friendly and helped us with everything.

125,Great hotel and restaurant in central location.,"Great find for us. Very friendly staff. Nice bedrooms and enjoyed cocktails in the very cosy cocktail bar.

125,Fabulous food and service,"Manuel and the other staff looked after us very well. Loved the soup and the other 2 courses; the pre-theatre menu is great. 
Will repeat. Loved the space and decor.
A handy place for Duke of York Theatre goer which is just 10 seconds away across the street.",5,2024,01,25
125,A gem of a hotel in London,"My sister and I had our first visit to London and we're booked here for 7 nights. 
The stay was incredible from check-in to our departure. Gabriel was most gracious and friendly. He even sent us a bottle of fine wine and fruit to celebrate our first time in the city.
The rooms were immaculate!  The bed was ever so comfy. Loved the large bathroom. The windows overlooked a great view of the city.
We had breakfast included with our stay. The waitstaff was more than friendly and remembered all our details. The breakfast table had such a wonderful selection of cold meats, salmon, and pastries. The entrees were wonderful.
The event that really made me love this place more was when my sister had a pickpocket event. She needed to recover her wallet, that was found,  and didn't have the money to get a cab. The front desk went above and beyond. They lent her the money for the cab. This really is something that is way beyond the expectations of a hotel.
I would highly recommend this hotel.
Yes, it is close to a lot of great London sites
I will be coming back!",5,2024,01,24
125,Best Hotel in London!,"During my recent stay at St Martins Lane Hotel, I was thoroughly impressed with the exceptional service provided by Gabriel, the receptionist. To make our stay even more special, Gabriel went above and beyond by sending a bottle of champagne to the room as it was our anniversary. This thoughtful gesture showcased Gabriel's commitment to ensuring guest satisfaction. In addition, the bellman, Rafa, was incredibly friendly and easy-going, further enhancing my overall experience. The dedication of the staff, , coupled with the affordable pricing and comfortable accommodations, makes St Martins Lane Hotel a top choice for any traveler. I highly recommend this establishment and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2024,01,23
125,Perfect spontaneous dinner out,"Ate in the restaurant here after the ballet  (we were not staying in the hotel) and the food, presentation and service were second to none. Delicious sea bass in an innovative style, amazing dessert and wonderful coffee- all served with a smile by Manuel and another lovely young man whose name I unfortunately didn‚Äôt get. The non-alcoholic cocktails were great too. Would definitely come again!",5,2024,01,20
125,I loved it,"Had a great time at this Hotel! The rooms have an awesome view that really made the stay. Special acknowledgment to Gabriel and Jennifer for making the check-in and check-out smooth and friendly. Totally recommend it!
Definitely we will come back",5,2024,01,16
125,Beautiful hotel in the best location,"We have stayed at this beautiful hotel a couple of times when going to the Theatre. The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from the tube station & in the heart of Covent Garden & Theatre land.
We were celebrating my birthday & the hotel gifted me a bottle of Champagne which was a lovely surprise. The staff are all so friendly & make you feel welcome.
We will certainly return again.

125,Warm welcome in a Great Hotel,"a warm welcome early in the morning. Even though the room is and was only available from 3 p.m., we were warmly welcomed and even asked about our preferences regarding floor choice. The Christmas decorations in the modern entrance area, which houses even more secrets (shake the golden hand), give a cozy feeling. The very committed staff is always approachable and ready to help. The rooms, small and modern, but very well equipped. Coffee maker, free water, and a minibar full of all sorts of drinks (including Moet, Canada Goose...) and snacks. Fluffy towels and bathrobes are always exchanged. The small bed with a shared blanket invites you to snuggle up. The bathroom is clean and in case something was forgotten at home, it should be available in the basket. If, as in our case, you have short-term requests such as tickets for the fireworks or visits to a restaurant, please contact the concierge. Patrick made all of our wishes come true and made our New Year's trip to London something very special. All of the points mentioned as well as the central location in the theater district not far from Trafalger Square make this hotel a great destination.",5,2024,01,09
125,Uniquely fabulous cocktails in an intimate environment,A lovely bar with a Speakeasy feel for intimate late night cocktails. Unique and quirky menu topped with fantastic service. Esteban surprised us with birthday treats which was the perfect end to our night out. ,5,2024,01,07
125,Anniversary theatre trip.,"Having stayed at this lovely hotel a few times before, our expectations were already high. The warm welcome from the reception team reminded us why this is our first choice for a London theatre break. They were quick to recommend some restaurant options and nothing was too much trouble. 
Set in the very heart of Theatreland and dangerously close to some fabulous shopping options, you would find it very hard to find a better location. The room was terrific with their usual funky twist. You MUST try St Martins Lane Hotel.",5,2024,01,07
125,Enjoyable drink and stay,"Friendly and efficient check in, good clean room and friendly service in the bar from Manuel. The only odd thing was the lack of a bathroom door in the room. Privacy for going to the toilet was nonexistent which is not what the reserved British like. We have stayed here a number of times before and I recall toilet doors existed then so all very strange. This is an ideal location if you are visiting the opera or theatre",5,2024,01,06
125,Lovely waiter,"The restaurant has a lovely ambiance. Food was exquisite and arrived quite fast. My friend and I went there before a representation at the Coliseum.
Our host for dinner was Manuel who had a very welcoming attitude and presented the menu comprehensively.
He kindly remembered that the reason for this dinner was my friend‚Äôs name day. He surprised us with a cake and Happy Birthday song. 
We didn‚Äôt stay at the hotel.",5,2024,01,06
125,"Excellent pre-theatre dinner ; attentive service, delicious food","We booked this restaurant as it was close by the English National Opera. 

The service (thank you Manuel) was prompt and courteous without being rushed. The staff were all lovely and helpful. Kyle offered to look out for my daughter as I was early.

The pre-theatre menu is exactly what you need. Not too heavy and a good selection of dishes that won‚Äôt leave you feeling sleepy.

The atmosphere and ambiance is private, upscale but not pretentious. My daughter would describe it as bougie.

Would highly recommend and will definitely come back next time I‚Äôm in the area.",5,2024,01,05
125,Mix feelings ,"We went to the restaurant with a group of friends. We were lucky to get a table as it was very last minute. The staff that looked after us, Adam, Max and Joao, were great, friendly, professional and attentive. The place is nice although a bit sterile, maybe expected as a hotel restaurant. 
The main disappointment to not make this a 5 start review was the food, for a restaurant with relatively high prices. Some dishes was cold and overall not great quality or taste, and portions of starters and deserts were ridiculously minuscule (even more in the desserts). ",3,2024,01,05
125,Beautiful space & great service,"We had an amazing afternoon tea in The Den. The location is great, decorated with nice and clever poetic art. 
The food was delicious and the highlight of the experience was the service by our host and waiter Skender. 
We‚Äôll definitely come back! ",5,2024,01,02
125,St Martins lane hotel and star rating.,"Firstly this hotel is in the perfect location for London, the issue i have is with the five star rating it has. My wife and i have stayed in the Ritz, Savoy and The Langham all which are five stars. St Martins lane hotel claims to be a five star hotel the same as the above mentioned. If i were going to give a rating it would be a high 3.5 stars. The only other issue we had was room cleaning. We had been out all day and arrived back at our hotel at 4:30pm and the room had not been cleaned, about 15 minutes later they came to do our room, but my wife and i had already started to shower and so turned them away. The following day we come back after being out from 9:00am, arrive back at 4pm, the room still not done. We go across the to the local pub and come back at 5pm to room cleaned. I know in the grand scheme of things theses are not big issues. If you want a nice hotel with a fantastic location to everything this is the hotel for you, but definably not a five star hotel.",3,2024,01,01
125,Great late night experience ,"Marele was so pleasant and fabulous for our late night-cap! Helped us select cocktails and made them incredibly quickly and well. Very tasty cocktails and a nice ambiance. Music playing, but not too loud. Highly recommend! ",5,2023,12,30
125,Great service & food,"Really great service. Manuel was super attentive and made sure we were ready on time for our theater show.
Food was good as well and excellent ambiance.
Highly recommended to people looking for a calm dinner and Greta service.

Thanks Manuel for the help all evening",5,2023,12,28
125,Excellent start to an evening,"Excellent service and fantastic food. The smoked Octopus starter was amazing and the Duck was also very good. Our waiter Manuel was very attentive and couldn‚Äôt do enough, thanks Manuel see you very soon.",5,2023,12,27
125,Disappointing hotel but unbeatable location,"The reception was slow to check us in and overall a bit helpless. Despite there being 10 people standing around, we didn't have any help with our luggage.

The room was a good size but overall dirty, with wet stains on the chair of unknown origin. The coffee maker was equally old and dirty, but in the end functional after we cleaned it.

The design of the hotel is very unique. However, the harsh neon lighting and plastic furniture definitely do not give a cosy atmosphere in the room. The lighting around the bed is very difficult to manage from a single control panel on the wall. The location of the hotel is obviously excellent.

The bathroom does not have a door. The toilet is a glass stall with a flap that doesn't close completely. There is definitely no noise insulation, so definitely beware if you like a little privacy. The tile floor had been worn away in a circle around the toilet from urine drips and drops.  The shower has extreme water pressure in a 4cm diameter beam which could be used to strip the paint off a car.

The breakfast is a very small cold selection. You can add a small side dish of scrambled eggs for ¬£7 per person and other warm dishes for far more money. The service in the breakfast (which takes place in the hotel lobby bar) was ultra slow. We had to speak with 4 different people to get a coffee which arrived after we had already finished eating.",2,2023,12,26
125,Christmas Lunch,"wonderful meal on xmas day in the hotel‚Äôs restaurant.    Manuel was our server.   he was extremely welcoming and helpful.   he also advised us on wine selections.

",5,2023,12,22
125,Quite disappointing.,"The Den is branded as some sort of cozy hideaway but was anything but when we went. Bright, stark overhead spotlights , no back ground music and considering it‚Äôs Christmas , zero decorations. It was very stark  and uninviting . Luckily our waiter Manuel was lovely as was the food but you really need to work on the ambience.",2,2023,12,21

Excellent training, such staff members are  a credit to the Hotel.  I‚Äôll definitely be back.",5,2023,12,19

Did I say this is the best hotel ever? I highly recommend you stay here. ",5,2023,12,18
125,Disappointing stay.,"Very disappointing. 

Booked 4 rooms for family Christmas get together 

Only 2 rooms were ready at 3pm arrival. 1 wasn‚Äôt ready until well after 4pm, affecting our lunch plans. . 

It‚Äôs a lovely hotel in a Great location, but‚Ä¶

Sunday breakfast waited 15 minutes for a coffee and to order breakfast. But had to leave after an hour without eating as needed to get our train home. Very poor service. Under staffed. Left hungry and disappointed. 

In an area with lots of good hotels I won‚Äôt be returning.",3,2023,12,17

",5,2023,12,16
125,A great experience with first-class service,"We had a lovely dinner in the restaurant this evening and our experience was made even better by the attentive, courteous and thoughtful service from Manuel.

125,Afternoon Tea at the restaurant ,"Anna gave us the greatest welcome at the restaurant and asked the chef to prepare an after-hour afternoon tea, which he gracefully accepted. After visiting the different areas to select the spot we preferred, we were served by the fantastic Manuel, who entertained us with much more than a simple afternoon tea. The whole culinary experience was actually a journey in the design of the hotel from Starck to Dali artwork. Meals referred to various humorous items across the rooms. A stimulating moment for all senses, with great food, service, and setting. Highly recommended!",5,2023,12,11
125,"Splendid food, splendid service","We were in London for a couple of days and we picked Saint Martin‚Äôs Lane for our only night out. We were seated in a quiet area of the restaurant. We ordered the mushroom mille feuilles, which was light and rich in flavors; the green goddess salad, a subtle mix of kale, avocados and cucumbers - very wholesome. For dessert, we shared the apple mousse accompanied by the best blackberry sorbet we‚Äôve ever had - perfectly textured and not too sweet. Our server was wonderfully welcoming and friendly and provided with excellent advice.",5,2023,12,09

125,Love 10/10,"Went to St Martins Lane for Bottomless Brunch on Sat 25th for my brothers bday and was slightly skeptical of how good bottomless brunch could be (both food wise and drink wise) however we absolutely loved it. Around ¬£65pp and very good value for money. We were served by someone called Juhi who was PHENOMENAL and one of the reasons we would go back- constantly topped us off with prosecco and advised us on food and drinks- she‚Äôs a star. Also loved the manager who encouraged us to go for the bottomless- we loved the experience. 10/10 would recommend- much better than any other bottomless brunch I‚Äôve done. The food is phenomenal, service and ambience are both great and the team know how to make an occasion special. ",5,2023,11,28
125,Bottomless Brunch,"What a wonderful time we had at St Martins Lane LondonüòäWe went for the 2 Course Menu & Bottomless Brunch- we could not fault it, DJ great & all the staff looked after us so well but special  mention to Debora who  made us feel so special & kept coming with the Bottomless drinks - thank you üòä",5,2023,11,25

125,A Mixed Review,"The hotel is renowned from the early2000 when i used to be a regular to a great restaurant Asia de Cuba which is no longer there.
The ""deluxe"" room was sufficient but lacking a few features notably a vanity mirror, kind of imperative if you are trying to put on contact lenses.
The coffee cups are too big for the coffee machine and fell out covering the floor and wall on hot coffee. Dialing room service on the phone went to the head office number so didnt work.

Advice to check charges very carefully.

Breakfast was included in my stay , i ordered a ginger shot at 6 pounds ! they decided to add 12.5% service to bring it to the table as discretionary , even though i crossed it out they still had it on the bill at checkout.
Room service they charge 6 pounds and then i spotted on the bill Tray Service ! at 4.50 so they charge to deliver room service and take a tray away but ucked away on your bill at the end of the stay. I demanded they remove these ""tray charges"" and they did.

The ""gym"" is a little underwhelming and is too busy with more than 3 people in it.

Positives of hotel - location, cleanliness, noise levels low even thjough on a main road.

",3,2023,11,23
125,It's all about the people,"Another stay at the St. Martins' which was great again as always. Excellent and friendly communication with reception, delicious and rich breakfast, few times a day of making our room, smiling, and welcoming staff and of course great location at the center of all main attractions, restaurants, coffee, bars, theaters and more. The room was quiet and had a beautiful view of monuments such as the Big-ben and the London Eye. We'll sure come back.",5,2023,11,22

125,Lovely brunch,"An excellent Saturday afternoon brunch with friends, lovely food and great, attentive service from our water Julianya. The set menu was varied and food was tasty. The prosecco was good quality as well. Will definitely return!",5,2023,11,19
125,Brunch ,My husband took me for brunch for my birthday and we had a great time. The service was wonderful. Our waiter Manliel was very attentive and friendly. And the food was delicious! I can definitely recommend coming here. ,5,2023,11,18
125,Not a great hotel!,"The budget-friendly lodging unfortunately doesn't live up to the grandeur promised by a 5-star designation. Despite expectations, the rooms are compact and follow a minimalist aesthetic, leaving guests desiring more comfort and amenities. The persistent street noise further detracts from the overall experience, transforming the stay into a reminiscent ambiance of a hostel rather than a serene escape.

Regrettably, the price point for this accommodation doesn't seem justified given the limited offerings. It's an investment that falls short in terms of both luxury and tranquility. For travelers seeking a more satisfying and comfortable retreat, exploring alternative options might be advisable. Overall, the value proposition of this establishment leaves much to be desired, and, as such, a cautious recommendation is warranted.",2,2023,11,17
125,Superb - especially the service!,"Ate in the restaurant, pre theatre. Delicious food, service impeccable! A great experience. Had the octopus and cod. Menu was excellent. Sauvignon Blanc even better. Waiting staff all great but especially Manuel. Thank you very much Manuel!",5,2023,11,17

125,A Pleasant Lunch,"Lunch at Yhe Restaurant was mixed.

Starters were lovely.  Squash & Pecan Salad and Souffl√©.

Both of us were disappointed with the mains.  Duck and Monkfish were a bit dry, as was the condition potato.

Queen Mary's Garden and Tobacco Dock were 2 very good cocktails. 

The Paparazzi was outstanding.   

Excellent service.  Thank you to Frayer for that.

125,Do not recommend,"This is not a five star hotel!
The only positive points are : our room was cute and the location was great for us, apart from that everything else was a fail
The bed and the pillows were super hard and uncomfortable 
The hotel definitely doesn‚Äôt have the feel of a five star hotel, the staff at reception always changes and is inattentive, I had lots of questions that were met by blank looks and a lot of I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I ended up not relying on them at all
At check in no one from reception showed us to our room and explained the amenities 
Cleaning HAS to be requested, it is not automatically done, and turn down was done once out of the whole week we stayed for
Housekeeping does not speak a word of English, it is hard when you are trying to ask for something 
And to top it all off , right after we left we realised we forgot a universal current converter and an iPhone charger we tried to get through to the hotel straight away and they NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE, after over an hour of trying we finally got through to someone by what seemed to be a miracle and they just said no, nothing was plugged in your room üò± and hung up, tried to call again no one answers, tried emailing NOTHING, awful service 
So basically do yourself a favour if you want a five star hotel stay somewhere else
The nicest of their staff are actually the valets",2,2023,10,30
125,Sunday brunch,"Impeccable service from Manuel! Very friendly and welcoming from the start.
Food and drinks from brunch were lovely!
Salmon from the starters and the lobster egg Benedict were very tasty.
Background music with the dj on a Sunday, nice vibe.",5,2023,10,29
125,"One of the worst hotels in 5-star in London, go somewhere else","St. Martin's Lane London is one of the worst hotels to stay in London in the so-called 5-star category. I stayed for 3 days and moved out. I have stayed at several of the well-known hotels in London - Langham, St. James, etc. I selected St. Martin's Lane London as it had high reviews on all the hotel websites - Tripadvisor, Expedia, Booking.com and others.

Firstly - there's almost no way you can get in touch with the front desk, Best of luck trying to make arrangements if you make a booking online. No one picks up the phone, and you can't leave a message. The service falls far short  The hotel does NOT accept American Express in the hotel restaurants. If you call and ask for extra tea, they don't have any way to keep track of requests. They never arrived. This is not the service I have gotten in ANY other 5-star hotel. The rooms are dark and quirky - yes, it might be fun, but trust me you can get the same experience anywhere else at a much better price.

And as a note for the hotel staff who will review this - there's no need to reply and leave messages stating you're sorry for inconvenience. Fix your issues and train your staff. Action speaks lounder than empty words.",1,2023,10,27
125,Best stay in London ever,"Everything was excellent, staff, room, the vibe in the hotel and the service.
the hotel is close to everything in walking distance. special thanks to Francko, in no time he upgrade our room in the best we ever had including a champaign welcome.

125,Great afternoon tea,Lovely afternoon tea hosted by Manuel.  Served in the Den very relaxed atmosphere and perfect quiet space to catch up with friends. Food was lovely. Good selection of sandwiches and savouries and gorgeous cakes to enjoy. Manuel was the perfect host checking on us and explaining the menu to us,5,2023,10,21
125,Loved London & St Martins Lane,"I had the most amazing experience at St Martins Lane hotel. From the moment we walked into the gorgeous lobby we were warmly greeted by the hotel staff. My husband booked our reservation using his AE Platinum card & was able to upgrade our room with the accommodation of the staff. We were escorted on the elevator, which you can only access your floor with a room key card. The room was gorgeous & the bathroom unbelievable. Every detail was perfect from the huge dressing area to the huge tub, gracious shower, private toilet room & all the supplies necessary to make your stay perfect!
Every AM fresh water, hairdryer, converters for your electrical items, plus bathrobes, etc. 

While my husband rested I went downstairs to the concierge, Patrik & presented him with multiple papers with lists of places I wanted to see. He spent over an hour laying the out the land for me, advising on what would be the most important sights, where they were located on a map & of course made several dinner reservations for us. Every detail was perfect & all the restaurants were fabulous! 

We ate that night in the hotel restaurant, where they happily accommodated my peculiar dietary needs, and the food & atmosphere were delicious & inviting!!

Every day that we left the hotel, we were sent off with a smile from one of the wonderful & knowledge staff members. 

All & all we had such a wonderful time that we tried to extend our vacation but understandably they were fully booked. 

I want to thank a few people that made our stay so wonderful that I recommended the hotel to my brother, who just returned last week with the same glowing report

Thank you Patrik for all your guidance 
Thank you Juliana for all our delicious food 
Thank you Jemma for assuring our stay was delightful & allowing us to extend our checkout time in our room
Thank you to Aldo, Illidio, Ajay & Lana as well!

125,Delicious lunch in a calm oasis,We were ready for lunch after a visit to the national portrait gallery and chose a secluded garden area on the hottest day of the year. Juliana was perfect in her welcome and quietly attentive throughout our delicious lunch.

We sat on sofas and Manuel greeted, charmed, informed, served and poured - and even took photos! He is a part of this delightful experience - magicking a festive slice of birthday cake with candle and putting us at ease. An unforgettable tea - the china, the cutlery - everything is a delight!",5,2023,09,05
125,Caring staff members in a medical emergency,"I had an intense chest pain right after I checked out and was worried that it might have been a heart attack. As a visitor to London, I was not familiar with the healthcare facilities and norms. I truly appreciate the immediate help and guidance given by the staff members at the reception, the coffee, the security personnel and the management personnel on 29 August 2023 at around 2.30pm to 4.30pm. In that critical situation, I only managed to get the names of DJ and Juliana from amongst the staff members who attended to me but all of them were caring, attentive and responsive and all of them were wonderful. 

I was also given a room to rest and I was not charged for it which was very kind of the hotel. I was given the first diagnosis by a doctor and NHS paramedics in the hotel room, before being sent to the University College Hospital (NHS). I am truly appreciative of the medical response especially those from the NHS.

Luckily, I only had a heartburn and not a heart attack. So, a little caveat here, I have since understood that in a situation of a heart attack it is absolutely critical that the patient must immediately be sent to the hospital.",5,2023,09,05

The Den has a variety of cakes and small bites. If you are looking to have tea time, dont eat anything before, you will need the room to enjoy every bite.",5,2023,09,04
125,Nice but Disappointed,"It was nice and very good breakfast but the hotel didnt worth the money.

we got superior room which we pay almost double  cost of standard room and there was no difference . they said it just a little bigger so instead of paying 1100-1300pound we paid for superior room 2500 pound for nothing. somehow i feel I was fooled
and its not the same as images

The hotel was written as 5 stars but I felt it should be 3 stars.. we got disappointed

So at last it worth only half of what we had paid",2,2023,09,04
125,"Location, service, a great hotel for family!","Location, location, location! Everything is just about 15 minutes walk away. The different tube lines are also very close by. I just stayed there with my family for 4 nights and were really happy with it. The hotel is so centrally located with a very clean modern look. The hotel staffs were so friendly and knowledgeable as well. The only thing we did not try is the restaurant. A+ all around!",5,2023,09,03
125,"Fantastic, convenient and comfortable stay with great staff","I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay! The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and the location was extremely convenient. A very special mention to Fromcko at the front desk who set a very positive and wonderful tone from the start of our trip at this hotel. He made us feel special and very well taken care of and therefore our experience at this hotel made our London trip all the more special. Will absolutely come back again! Thank you, Fromcko!

The rooms are pretty small, but the friendliest staff in the world - Jenni checked me in and sent us a bottle of bubbles to help celebrate my birthday.

I had a wonderful experience with the hotel. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice. A special thanks to Francko who was very attentive and helped me with everything I needed.",5,2023,08,19
125,A very good Value for Money choice in the center of London,The hotel is at the very center of London; close to everything still without any noise or distractions. Good breakfast; especially if it is included in the booking (as in my case) it is definitely value for money. Room service food quality is exceptional. Staff overall is helpful.,4,2023,08,18
125,The restaurant bar at St. Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel,"Max, our bartender was fabulous! Not only is she personable, she‚Äôs an expert mixologist. My husband had a Paparazzi, delicious with notes of caramel and coffee. I had a wonderful Pimm‚Äôs lemonade. Perfect night cap after a day on the town.  ",5,2023,08,16
125,Great experience and value,"Really great experience,  will definitely be back. Illidio & Patrik at the concierge desk were able to get us tickets to a sold-out show and arranged dinner and car reservations for us seamlessly. Juliana and Manuel made our visits to the bar fun and memorable - we're especially grateful for that since we were entertaining guests of our own at the hotel. The hotel is well appointed and In great location, but it's the staff and their hospitality that made the stay memorable. ",5,2023,08,16
125,Faded Glory,"This property was originally THE hotel to see and be seen back in 1999 when Starck did the design.  That was 20+ years ago...  And the hotel is showing not only it's age, but general grime and disrepair that was surprising for a $600 night hotel.

Hallways need full repainting, as the finish of the white paint used for touch-ups over the years is off and visible.  Carpets are absolutely dingy and worn, both in hallways and in room.  Blinds in my suite didn't function, as the strings were cut or pulled out.  The television system is antiquated, slow and buggy.  The wifi was spotty.  The gym, a claustrophobic afterthought with no windows. Lighting in rooms might have been cool in the '90s, but it now just looks kitsch, but not in a fun, self-realized sort of way.

The scent they use in the lobby is insanely overwhelming.  It was actually nauseating.  Thankfully, they only used it right in the entryway.

 Another oddity I had with this property was the wild variance of temperature in hallways, bars, sitting areas and corridors.  One floor would feel hot and humid, while another was cold and dry.  There was no continuity and it was jarring.  It also made some hallways smell with no exchange of air.

This hotel is now a solid 3-star hotel.  It's right there with a mid-level Westin, although I'd say that even Westin would have done a full renno of their property at this point.  To not change much of anything in 20+ years is putting your hotel into a time capsule and not a very smart thing to do.

The positive?  Great staff and superb housekeeping.  It's clear that in lieu of having a 5-star facility, they're really going above and beyond on the personal side.  I appreciated that and always felt well cared for as a guest.

That said, the price on this hotel needs to be adjusted down for the experience.  It's simply not in the price bracket it's trying to stay in anymore.",3,2023,08,11
125,Love the St. Martin Lane,"Stayed here numerous times in last two years. Perfectly located and close enough to the Picadilly Circus and West End shows, but tucked away down a quieter side street. Perfect London spot to sleep and recharge.",5,2023,08,06
125,Really lovely service and food,"We had a meal before going to the theatre. The pre-theatre menu was great. The food  was perfect . The service  from all the team was excellent .  Juliana  was the member of staff    who served us was truly charming , a great sense of humour and excellent  service. It was tricky to find  but well worth it and a spotlessly clean place . Thanks very much

125,New and chic,"Stayed here over the weekend in July 23. We got a good deal. The hotel centrally located very convenient if walking around soho, Leicester sq, Covent Gardens etc. The hotel has a new chic feel to it. Quite funky.

125,Excellent service.,We were lucky enough to have Samira as our housekeeper and we were so pleased we wanted to bring her home with us.

125,"Best location in London, beautiful staffs","The room was spacious, bright and fresh. The location is one of the best in the heart of London, closed to McDonald, Pizza Hut, Gordon Ramsay, China Town, M&M , Leicester tube, and bus, shopping streets, even museums.  

On the second night, we got problem with WIFI. We tried to call receptionist who informed us that there will be a technician coming up to fix the problem, but no one showed up after whole night. 

Next day around noon, problem still remained. We decided to went down to lobby as we might need to pack our bag and leave this beautiful place, luckily we got to talk to Mr. Joao, FO manager who tried his best to offer us both times and options to fix the problem. 

With his touching service mind and hospitality, we gain more patient and eventually, everything was fixed just in time. 

I can say that without his help, it would have been another horrible review.
Thank you for taking care of us.",5,2023,07,26
125,Repeat Stay,"We have stayed here a few times before. It is in a great location for everything and the price for central London is fair. We had a corner suite and the view was amazing.

125,Great Hotel with excellent service,"Everything here at the Hotel has been remarkable. When arriving at the Hotel we were greeted by a gentlemen in the Hotel Attire on the sidewalk who helped us with our luggage and introduced us to the front desk for check in. Everyone was warm and professional. Our room was ready and the Gentlemen that greeted us escorted us to our room explaining everything in the room. The Hotel room is contemporary with all the modern conveniences, plush towels and robes, very comfortable bed and exceptionally clean. The restaurant has great service, wonderful food, an exceptional afternoon Tea service and we were blessed to have Monica serve us. One more thing, the housekeeping service is outstanding. This Hotel knows how to make its guest feel comfortable and special.",5,2023,07,24
125,Great hotel.  Great conceirge.  Great location. Grat bargain.  A winerr.,"A well located, reasonably priced 5-star hotel in the heart of London with a sensational concierge.  The tel is in the heart of the theatre district, two minutes from Trafalgar Square and half the price of the fancy Mayfair hotels.  the rooms are modern in all aspects and well equipped.  Patrick, the lead concierge, was amazing.  He made many of the arrangements for us and was especially helpful during our five day stay.  Make sure to ask for the architectural tour. I have travelled aboard for more than 60 years and he is absolutely the best concierges I have encountered. Housekeeping requests were fulfilled with 5-10 minutes.  This hotel is a winner.

125,Great location and large room,"Location - the location was good for me. A very short walk to the Peloton Studios London. And many restaurants and coffee shops. Also close to tube stations. 

Room - an interesting setup with a very long hallway (with a nice room closet and oddly handy hooks on the wall) leading to the room and bathroom. Great light with all the windows. The bed was comfortable with a neat pillow headboard. There are some fun colored lights. There is a desk with tv and mini bar refrigerator. 

Bathroom - Good sized shower with nice water pressure. And I love the full sized/refillable toiletries (and great Malin & Goetz). Thank you! The room includes a hair dryer & ironing board with iron. The shelves in the bathroom are convenient and useful. 

My husband used the gym and it looked like a good gym with great selection of weights and good space. We had some drinks at the outside bar and the server was very nice. 

Front desk crew was helpful and I appreciate our room being ready early.",4,2023,07,10
125,Monika made this experience so wonderful!!!,"We loved everything about this hotel.  We were there for a week and had three rooms (our large family) and each was fabulous.  However, I really need to highlight our breakfast server, Monika.  She was there every single morning and made the start of each day so wonderful!!!  When it was time to check out, we felt like we were saying goodbye to a friend.  Monika is a treasure!!!",5,2023,06,28
125,First Class Service,"Great hotel with a perfect location right near Covent Garden and the theater district.  You can walk to most sites or jump on the Hop On Hop Off bus which you can pick up nearby in Trafalgar Square...

Service was exceptional!  We had ordered a suitcase on Amazon and when we came back to the hotel it was in our room. When we shipped our bags back they handled the pick up perfectly.   

The concierge was incredible and helped us with everything.  
Would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2023,06,26
125,"Awesome location and rooms, but it's starting to show it's age","This hotel was THE hippest place in the early 2000s. Still is a great property, perfect, safe location in the West End and really nice clean rooms.  Just starting to show it's age a bit.  A lot more subdued. Not the same energy or vibe as it once had (maybe since Asia de Cuba closed).  That said, it is walkable to theaters, great restaurant options, key London sights and the Tube.  Still highly recommend and will be back -- just with managed expectations.",5,2023,06,22
125,Nice Stay -but miss Gymbox!,"The St Martins Lane hotel has always been our home away from home whenever we travel to London. One of the main attractions was the use of Gymbox right next store. We were so disappointed to see the gym had closed. The gym they opened in the hotel doesn‚Äôt even compare and the use of Fitness First is nice but again, not Gymbox. 

The only shining light at the hotel is the manager Joao and his staff. Joao was amazing! He went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. We were given a room that was on the first floor facing the street. I could not sleep well with the noise and complained the next morning. Joao recognised our name right away and the fact that we‚Äôve stayed there many times. He switched and upgraded our room and treated us to breakfast at the hotel. We were so pleased with the new room and the great service we received.  ",4,2023,06,19

125,Fab start to the evening‚Ä¶.,"Popped for a pre theatre drink and bite to eat. The wine and food were absolutely delicious, but Juliana, our waitress gave the evening the very best start. Thank you St Martins Lane for a lovely experience. ",5,2023,06,15
125,Stressful and embarrassing check in ,"DO NOT PRE PAY if you are booking for a family member or someone other than yourself. You have to present AND enter the pin on the card used for booking to put the deposit for incidentals. 
My card didn't have pin set up and they had me in tears coming off a long redeye. 
They refused to let me use another card in my name and were more than happy to try and turn me away 
After phoning long distance to my card company we eventually landed on tapping ¬£50 4x. 
As I was visibly upset and shaking they could have at least offered me some water instead of pure attitude. 
I've never heard of such an obstinate policy. 

The hotel itself was okay.. rooms are nice/clean but some maintenance issues. 

The restaurant and bar are no where near as chic as the marketing suggests.

- beautiful, hidden bar - ask for it!
- great location
- clean

CONs:
- overpriced breakfast,
- very very small room for a family (2 kids: 7&9), hardly a space to walk around beds

125,nice place to be,We had a lovely afternoon tea experience. We came because we were looking for the traditional scones. The scones were amazing and Manuel gave us very good recomandations about places we could visit in London! Thanks again:),5,2023,05,21
125,Short break,"Great location, clean and probably one of the best appointed rooms I've stayed in for the price, for example, minibar, snacks, phone cables, even shaving foam and razor,incase you forget your own.   Only downside for me was that the corridor echoes every noise which seems to emplify in the room, every conversation and door click through out the night meant a Disturbed sleep, especially late at night and early in the morning. Would stay again though",4,2023,05,20
125,RUDE,"Not a bad stay overall, rooms are good, amenities are fine, and the location is pretty amazing.

125,A great afternoon tea!,My sisters and I had a wonderful time having afternoon tea in London at st martins lane.  The tea room was comfy with couches and quaint decor. Our servers were Juliando and Juhi and were awesome!  Food presentation and flavor was great! would recommend. ,5,2023,05,06
125,Top service. Centrally located,Great hotel. Centrally located. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Clean. Great bar area. Very chic. Hotel staff very nice. Anything you needed they would provide. They could answer any questions about the area you needed. Would recommend to anyone staying in London.,5,2023,04,30
125,Welcoming and atmospheric,Brilliant service from Juliana.  Popped in for a drink pre-theatre made to feel very welcome and great choice of drinks. New menu looks good as well for any time of day. Five star experience highly recommend ,5,2023,04,26
125,Top London hotel,"Our second time at St. Martins Lane and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. As good if not better than our
last stay. The staff are all extremely helpful and friendly. Especially Monica and Julien in the restaurant who really made our stay enjoyable. All the staff are to be thanked for a great stay.
Hopefully see you all again next year.",5,2023,04,24
125,Super Friendly Staff,"Without a doubt, these employees are the friendliest and most helpful we‚Äôve ever known in our extensive travels. One of the two delightful concierges got us great seats at a play we wanted to see. The next time we saw him he greeted us with a big smile and inquired about our experience. His colleague helped me covert my old British pounds, which were no longer accepted, into new ones. He did this by walking with me to his bank and making the change using his personal account. The next day he waved and called me by my first name when I came through the lobby. These two were great, as were the staff in the restaurant, at the front desk, and everyone we encountered. What a pleasure!",5,2023,04,24
125,Great people Great hotel,"Patrik, from the concierge desk, spent 30-45 minutes with us booking train tickets we needed for our trip around UK.  He was wonderful to talk to and made getting the tickets so much easier.  Hotel is in a fantastic location, close to Trafalgar square, the tubes, shopping and great restarants. We felt safe in the area.  

We had our first high tea with Monika from the hotel.  She was wonderful and did not make us feel silly about not knowing about high tea.  It was a lot of fun and soooo much food!  Do not eat lunch before high tea. üòÄ

Be sure to checkout the art in the Den!  

We will stay here again when we visit London.",5,2023,04,21
125,Great hotel - paper thin walls between rooms,"Great location, friendly and helpful staff, overall a good experience BUT the walls are paper thin, I could hear a lot of noise from the room next to me on both the left and right hand side, which woke me up and affected my sleep significantly on my 6 night stay at the hotel. I brought this matter up with the front desk staff, they said they are aware of the issue. This is a real shame as it ruined what was otherwise a great hotel and experience, would want to stay here on my next trip, but the noise is an issue.",4,2023,04,19
125,Amazing stay,"Amazing stay great location incredible staff so helpful

The hotel is so handy for central London. Stayed with my 13 year old son we did Covent Garden‚Äôs, soho, London eye. So handy to walk places but equally a stones throw from Leicester Square tube. 

Room was ready on arrival amazing . 11am. 

Super speedy check out. Lovely drinks at the bar special mention to Juliana and Ana for helping me get sorted with a technical problem they were so helpful I would have been lost without them",5,2023,04,18
125,Great service and location,Service was wonderful and staff made me feel welcome. I enjoyed the deluxe room with garden patio and the hotel location is perfect for exploring London. The food I tried from the restaurant was also very good. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.,5,2023,04,14
125,Lovely time in the Den,"We have had a lovely evening in the lobby ‚Äúrefuge‚Äù bar and well looked after by the delightful Juliana who was attentive, caring and interested in our evening.   Quite the respite we needed from the crazy streets outside where we could talk in relaxed comfort.",5,2023,04,13
125,You pay for the location. Nothing special for extortionate price. NOT DOG FRIENDLY despite what they advertise.,"You are paying for location. We are currently here at the St Martins Lane hotel, paid for by a friend as a special generous gift. However I am appalled she‚Äôs paid well over ¬£3000 to stay. Room only, one standard room one suite. 

We are staying 3 adults, 2 children and a dog. The hotel states it is dog friendly, but it appeared the staff don‚Äôt know what the rules are about dogs in the hotel. On arrival our friend was asked to pay a ¬£500 deposit for having the dog with us. She‚Äôd gone to great lengths to make sure it was ok to bring the dog and had been in communication when booking. She was reassure it was ok for her dog to come. 

She was sitting in lobby and asked to leave because she had the dog with her‚Ä¶ she was told she could sit in the Den area, where we joined her with the children and proceeded to spend lots of food and drink. 

She took the dog for a little wander and on her return, I can only describe it as been chased in by the Duty Manager  aggressively telling her she couldn‚Äôt be there. He was insisting, in an patronising tone she told him her room number, of which off the top of her head couldn‚Äôt remember. He persisted, clearly thinking we weren‚Äôt guests. His manner and tone towards guess who have laid thousands to say for 4 nights was disgusting and distressing. 
The friendly waiter who had been serving us all evening even came to check we were ok as he heard and was shocked at the way we had been spoken to. 
It was really taken the shine off of our stay which was a very generous special treat after a difficult year. 

We then had a lovely exciting surprise of an invitation to an Easter egg hunt for the children. They were very excited.. it was short lived. They hunted all over reception with nothing to be found. They clearly think guests have lots of time to waste. Lots of much older children looking for eggs, fair enough, but the younger ones couldn‚Äôt find anything. The ones we saw find small choc eggs.. that was their prize. Seemingly if you found a special yellow and white egg those children got an actually Easter gift. They know how many children are booked in the hotel, they should have provided for all or none. We stayed at another london hotel last Easter, The Park Plaza. They were incredible and very family friendly and make the children‚Äôs stay extremely special. 

The rooms are not spacious and have no special touches. Toiletries bolted to the wall like budget hotels. You can‚Äôt close the blinds. So it‚Äôs either full sun or darkness. The mini bar prices are obscene. I would say the cleaning staff are good, but would be expected at such prices. 

Great location for covent garden and Leister Square.  The exterior of the hotel is grotty and looks like an office building. You‚Äôd walk/drive past not knowing it‚Äôs an expensive hotel. 

Overall I still can‚Äôt get over the way we were treated on our first night. I really was a very upsetting experience. 

Avoid this pretentious overpriced hotel. ",1,2023,04,10
125,Excellent,"I stayed for about 2 weeks. The hotel is excellent - location, amenities, rooms, cocktail bar and service. I had a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend this hotel when visiting London for work or pleasure. More importantly, the staff are exceptional - friendly and good spirited as well. I especially would like to mention - Iuliana and Cleverson at the cocktail bar and Eugene and Jenni at the front desk.

Rooms nice but nothing special for the money.
Seems to get dearer every month.
Bar very dark.
Seems to cater for over seas tourists.",3,2023,03,31
125,Relaxing & Tailored Experience - Above and beyond service,"I had the best time staying over at St. Martins Lane, all of the staff were so kind  and thoughtful, shout out to Jose & Eugene at the front desk for being so welcoming. I had such a lovely dinner at The Restaurant (thank you Adan & Omar) and a perfect night sleep in the most comfortable bed. The room was so spacious with customizable lighting, great views, and perfect amenities. The bathroom was beautiful with a large tub and luxurious products. Breakfast the following morning was splendid, thank you Kinga & Frayer. I can't wait to return to this hotel! ",5,2023,03,29
125,Be careful‚Ä¶,"Birthday trip to London. Found this hotel due to reviews, location and price. Sadly, the location is the only good thing about it! 

The staff tried to upsell us upon arrival; 60 British Pounds extra per night for a hotel room that was the same size as the one booked. 

The staff also sent up a bottle of champagne and strawberries for my birthday, then proceeded to charge me for them. 

Overall, great location. That‚Äôs it.",1,2023,03,27
125,Great Location,"Great location, right in the heart of the theater district, and walkable to the Thames and many other local sights. Helpful, professional staff. Lovely little coffee shop for a morning brew and people watching. The room was clean, with very comfortable beds and a nice modern bathroom. A decor update is needed in the hallways outside the rooms, and when we arrived there was a strong unpleasant smell of air freshener. Some of the photos online are a little misleading, as the hotel isn‚Äôt quite as spacious and elegant as portrayed. But we liked the hotel and would stay there again if in the area.",4,2023,03,22
125,"Home Away From Home‚Ä¶ Best Staff, Amazing Location","I spent a weekend at St Martins Lane with my Girlfriend and everything was flawless. Rooms are pristine clean, the girls servicing our rooms were super sweet and they really looked after us. The front desk people were AMAZING‚Ä¶ The guys at the door were always helping us in a wink to get taxis, and the Concierge dealt with all our bookings and theatre tickets. Room Service was sublime, I really loved the breakfast options. Perfect location for shopping with Covent Garden area at your doorstep. Very close to Seven Dials. Really in love with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking london, we will definitely be back very soon!",5,2023,03,20
125,Great Stay,Another excellent stay at this central London hotel. Very friendly reception staff who let us check in earlier than expected as a room was available. Great as we had a theatre matinee booked. Parking charges at the adjacent car park were sorted via the hotel which was very helpful. We had cocktails in the Blind Spot all booked when we checked in. Rooms were as good as ever despite the fact that we haven‚Äôt been since the Covid lockdown. Will definitely be back,5,2023,03,19

So pleased about it. Xxx

125,Great stay in london,Wonderful hotel - great staff for check-in and check-out.  Bar in lobby is great for a quick meal or drink.  Francko at check in was super friendly and helpful!  Shower is possibly best in London in terms of water pressure.  Hotel is walking distance to shows restaurants soho etc ,5,2023,03,17
125,Delicious pre-show dinner,Manuel was the most amazing server and hosted us to what felt like a private dinner party. He was immensely helpful sorting out the menu and just how to order for our family. He was a great deal of fun and we all felt very special. He is a treasure...better hold on to him.,5,2023,03,09
125,The Best Afternoon Tea Set," It's so delicious! Mr. Manuel is very kind. Good service. I think it will be a good travel memory. The portions are very large. I will definitely recommend it to my friends who come to England. If I come to England next time, I will come again.",5,2023,03,09
125,Delicious Afternoon Tea,"Amazing afternoon tea.   The hotel have made such a brilliant effort to create a Vegan afternoon tea‚Ä¶‚Ä¶loved every element.   We were looked after by Manuel,  he was super friendly and a real credit to the hotel.    

Great value for money,  highly recommended.   We will definitely be back :-).",5,2023,03,08

125,Could be better,Stayed here for 2 nights. Location was smacked in the city where all the happenings is which is good. Breakfast was ok nothing special. Wifi was down for like 18 hrs. Card key not working on the 2nd day. They certainly can improve on this. Room is comfy. ,2,2023,03,03
125,A Great PlaceTo Stay,"Hugely friendly and helpful staff, lovely clean vibrant hotel 
We reserved room 221 and it did not disappoint 
Clean, modern, windows on both walls so light a hugely well stocked mini bar and room service just a buzz away 
Bathroom was clean and modern with an excellent power shower üöø 
The hidden bar was a lot of fun, breakfast and lunch yummy ",5,2023,03,01
125,A solid four stars for 1 person; two stars if there's a second person in the room,"This hotel is very well located, and my room was just fine for one person. It's just too small for two people, however. I would award only three stars if you have a second occupant. You are hard pressed to find room for a second bag, and if you have more luggage than that, it's near impossible. Either way, however, the bathroom is adequate. Service was fine. There's a lovely gym two doors down, although you have to go outside to get there (not a big deal).

There's a desk that's big enough for two, but there's only one chair. And the plugs....there are two wall plugs on the right hand side of the desk, barely enough and slightly awkward to reach. But they worked for me, and there were other wall plugs here and there. And plugs on each side of the bedstand. So while I am usually critical of hotels over plugs, St. Martins gets a passing grade. Still, a power strip on the desk would help.

Otherwise, I was happy enough. The hotel has a slightly bizarre revolving door that never seems to work right. There are normal doors on either side that are functional.

I would stay here again.

",4,2023,02,26
125,2nd time around,"This is the 2nd time my husband and i have stayed at st martins lane hotel, this time around we stayed with our children, the room was smaller than i expected & the double beds are quite small. The hotel on general is clean, tidy & smells amazing. The staff are very friendly. Would stay here again",4,2023,02,25
125,Great dinner!,"Friendly service, delicious food and stylish ambient. The waitress Juliana was super attentitive with us. After a busy and tiresome day, our family could enjoy a relaxing moment here, remenbering everything we did along the way.",5,2023,02,21
125,"Not 5 star facilities, no attention to detail and poor customer service","We went as a weekend treat - it was myself, my husband and my stepdaughter. We came away very disappointed with the stay and feeling more stressed at the end of the visit than at the beginning. 

If we are honest, the rooms are no better than those in the Premier Inn we stayed at the night before, and costing only ¬£50 a night instead of the ¬£400. The walls are paper thin and we were kept awake all night by people walking past in the corridor and noises in the room next door. The TV only had Freeview and the signal dropped out every 10-15 minutes. We were given one pillow per person with no spares in the cupboards. Despite the room being booked for three people there were only two glasses and two mugs for tea/coffee. There was no attention to detail. 

The first morning we had breakfast we were told to take a seat and that somebody would be with us to take our order. No one appeared and after half an hour of waiting and trying to get someone's attention, including going up to the bar area, we left. We complained to Reception who apologised and told us we would not be charged for breakfast. We chose to go out for breakfast on the second morning.

We came back later that day at about 4pm to find that our room had not been cleaned, no fresh towels, the beds were not made, no replacement water and the bin was not emptied. We advised Reception of this and were told that someone would clean it then and there. While we appreciated this, it did mean we had no choice but to go back out into central London into the rain with a tired child, having been out all day, while we waited for the room to be cleaned. It would have been nice to have been offered to sit in the bar and have a complimentary drink whilst we waited but the staff did not seem bothered. 

On checking out, the breakfast had not been removed from our bill as were had been told and we therefore had to go through the complaints process again in order for this to be removed. 

Overall we were not made to feel special in any way and the service was definitely not 5 star - we will not be returning and will be advising our friends and family about our disappointing experience.",2,2023,02,20
125,Best location in London with comfie beds and great staff.,"If I can stay here when I‚Äôm in London, I do.

125,Favorite accommodation in Covent Garden,"First rate accommodations and possibly my favorite hotel in the area. An unfaltering attention to detail in the room. In particular i liked the large closing door between the bedroom and bathroom and the fact that both the shower and the toilet had doors as well. Lots of tv channels, fully stocked bar plus reasonable dine in costs. Slippers and bathrobes were a nice bonus.",5,2023,02,11

125,Sophisticated and welcoming,"I booked the St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel as a treat for my birthday. I commute to London most days and occasionally stay over, so wanted this to feel special, which it did.

At check in we were helped to find our perfect room from those available and we both loved our Loft in the corner of the third floor.

The room was spacious and restful and was perfect for a two night stay. All of the team members we encountered were warm and professional and made us feel very welcome. The treats we were provided with to celebrate my birthday were thoughtful and genuinely made me feel special. 

Sadly our budget won‚Äôt stretch to this being our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù property in London, but will definitely be somewhere we would like to return to for another special occasion.",5,2023,02,09

125,Great Stay...Great Location,"We stayed here for a quick 3 night London trip.  The hotel is very well located right in the theatre district.  It is  short 5 minute walk to either the Charing Cross Station or the  Embankent station. All the staff are super friendly and helpful.  The rooms are fairly large with very comfortable beds.  The bathroom is a bit strange as the door to the bathroom is only 1 large door that separates the entry/bathroom from the bedroom.  We loved the Blind Spot bar in the hotel.

The staff from all departments are beyond friendly and pleasant. Fabulous breakfast is served in the morning, though I haven‚Äôt tried the dinner menu.",5,2023,01,12
125,Very disappointing.,"I have stayed in the sister hotel a few times (sandersons) and always found it amazing. I booked the new year experience hoping for a really special stay - including the 6 course tasting menu. The food was just dreadful - the first course was a very plain soup in a thimble sized cup, and the langoustines were virtually anorexic - I could barely scrape together half a fork of meat and that is in not in any way an exhageration - it was basically a shell! VERY poor quality and inexpensive langoustine. The cod didnt taste of anything. I gave up after the 4th course as the waiting staff didnt appear to have any system for letting the kitchen know when the last course was cleared and we just waited and waited and waited with empty glasses! We ended up going to chinatown at 10pm to actually eat something! The next thing was THUD THUD THUD of our bedroom being on top of the nightclub (nobody warned me of this!) by 3am of not sleeping I had enough and went to reception to complain and was told it would finish at 2am (this was at 3am!) - he casually asked if I would like a room change (at 3am!) - I said no I just want the music to stop and for a manager to contact me in the morning to let me know what they intend to do about this joke of a stay. I went back to bed only for the cleaners to start dragging furniture around and cleaning the night club until gone 4am. I went to see the manager Ali in the morning and whilst I have to say he was very polite, pleasant and apologetic - he offered a discount off the room - but NOTHING off the horrendous meal - So all in all this ONE NIGHT stay STILL cost about 900 quid after my discount! An absolute joke - I asked him why was I not informed of the room being on top of the nightclub and I was informed that was because I UPGRADED to a garden terrace! Surely that would be all the more reason to warn me so I had the choice to keep my original quieter room- not a reason why I wasn't warned it was DIRECTLY ABOVE A LOUD NIGHTCLUB lol! Given that the meal was disastrous and that the bedroom meant I didnt sleep AT ALL - I think to still issue a bill of 900quid is simply an absolute joke. 40% of accomodation only actually didnt make that much difference to the bill as the meal was a huge part of the cost - and genuinely the worst meal out I have ever had. Would I stay again? ABSOLUTELY NOT IF YOU PAID ME! Without doubt the absolute worst stay I have ever had anywhere!",2,2023,01,09
125,Great to be back at St Martins Lane,"Longtime fan of St Martins Lane Hotel and was able to make it back after a four-year absence. Location very scenic, convenient and great for walking or catching tube. Modern, chic, yet comfortable, from lobby to public areas to the well-appointed rooms.  Staff always on their game. Special shout out to Vinnie who was extremely helpful both before and during stay. ",5,2023,01,03
125,"Don‚Äôt make our mistake! Stay elsewhere, at one of the MANY beautiful properties in London!","I‚Äôm currently writing this from possibly the worst room I‚Äôve been in for many years. 

We booked a ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù king room thru the Amex hotel collection. No upgrades were offered, which does happen maybe one out of every 20 stays when we book with Amex, but it‚Äôs a rare disappointment. 

Here, turns out an upgrade could‚Äôve made all the difference. Who knew that the ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù room category- despite being a few categories up from the lowest class here- would be so godawful. We are in a third floor room, which may as well be in a windowless basement because the only two windows in the room must remain fully blackout-curtain shut. One window looks directly into another guest‚Äôs room (we have full view of his desk and tv, he has full view of our bed), with also a bonus partial view of an ugly rooftop. The other window has the blinds (which are inside the panes and can‚Äôt be adjusted) permanently drawn shut by the hotel so I shudder to think what that view is.  So, unless we get the urge to peep in on our neighboring guest, will not enjoy even a sliver of light during our stay. At 500 euros/night, is a window too much to ask for? 

The shower has a floor to ceiling gap where its two glass walls are supposed to meet, so the bathroom floor is wet after a shower. For the ladies, the shower is just a small rectangle with no perch whatsoever for shaving legs. 

The entire room is very small and the bathroom has only one sink. The weird creepy lighting turns everything the wrong color, and is annoying and gimmicky. The single ‚Äúcloset‚Äù is tiny with no door, just a cheap curtain covering it. The narrow bedside tables are literally just a foot wide. The furniture all looks and feels like, and is, cheap white plastic. The comforter is strangely not very wide and we fight for the covers. 

This hotel is located in an extremely busy and noisy area ‚Äî think Times Square in NYC. Every outing has us fighting crowds on the sidewalk for blocks around. Don‚Äôt even think about finding a place to eat without long lines/waits or reservations made well in advance.  Because we kept our plans fluid, we had no reservations and had to walk about 15-20m in order to escape the area and find good, available restaurants on a random Tuesday early evening. The hotel itself has an all-day place to eat called ‚ÄúThe Den‚Äù that interested us, but we were turned away because the space is tiny and was fully booked even at an odd hour. 

I‚Äôm astonished at the good reviews of this place. For the same price, we‚Äôve stayed at much nicer properties in London in better locations, with incredible amenities, flawless service, views. If this is a deluxe room, which, again, is nowhere near the bottom category of room here, then there must be a dungeon somewhere in this hotel for those poor souls who booked lower categories. 

Overall, there is no character or personality in this hotel. I‚Äôd describe the vibe as soulless and impersonal. The hotel is trying to pull off modern and cool, but such sparsity isn‚Äôt modern or cool. 

One more dreary night to go here, and then we get to leave. Yay! Oh, the WiFi is decent, so there‚Äôs that I guess.",1,2022,12,27

125,A first class hotel in every aspect,"We checked into the St  Martins Lane Hotel for a major wedding anniversary weekend.   Originally I had my doubts;  any hotel that is so often lauded as the epitome of cool and THE place to stay  raises one‚Äôs expectations to the point where  the hapless guest sometimes wonders if one is being allowed a massive favour to even set foot through the door.
And too often this type of hotel coasts along on its reputation and doesn‚Äôt even bother to try.
Not so the St Martins Lane Hotel.  It is quite simply outstanding,   From the genuinely friendly and helpful lobby and reception staff to the stylish rooms.   The comfortable beds and furnishings  to the cleanliness and the immaculate room service.  Not to mention the gorgeous breakfast.
And the thoughtful touches to:  we found a bottle of champagne and a happy anniversary cake awaiting us in our room, compliments of the management.   
All in all a faultless stay and a memorable experience.   Now we can‚Äôt wait for our next anniversary‚Ä¶",5,2022,12,20
125,"Great location, rooms and service","Small but extremely well designed rooms, attentive service, great location.  We had a few small issues with our room (thermostat didn't work) but these were addressed quickly.  Breakfast was great, as was the nightclub.  Highly recommended",5,2022,12,20
125,Ideal location for theater,"Location is ideal if you plan a theater heavy trip.  If not, a less frenetic area might be preferable.   The property was very pleasant - contemporary rooms, good bed and bath, friendly staff.  Room was small but serviceable, wifi was strong, outlets plentiful and well located.  A few challenges - the TV didn‚Äôt work despite repeated efforts and swapped out equipment - not a big deal, but weird.  Housekeeping  could use some improvement - amenities not replaced when used, bathroom floor and particularly shower shelf needed a good scrubbing (floor sticky and mold in shower).  Patrik Romano, the concierge went out of his way to help me with an issue - despite initially looking at me like I was an idiot tourist.   NB - I suppose anyone out of their hometown is a tourist, but I expect I have more travel under my belt than most ‚Ä¶.

Finally, my personal and perennial hotel gripe - stall showers need a stool or bench or ledge.  I‚Äôm convinced most hotels are designed by men who have never tried to shave their legs in a shower with no place to rest a foot ‚Ä¶!

Overall, would recommend.",4,2022,12,07
125,Perfect Christmas tea,"This is the best high-tea I have Experienced!  I was traveling solo while my husband was working. I always enjoy going to tea, but their festive holiday tea was amazing. I got to enjoy the traditional savory options which I always love,  but their holiday desserts took this one  over the top. Great service too. Ask for victoria and Manuel!",5,2022,12,05
125,"Great location, lovely hotel","We picked St. Martin's for the location and reviews and were very happy with our choice. Our reservation included breakfast everyday - the choices and food were terrific. There is a great ""hidden"" cocktail lounge on site - open on Friday and Saturday- reservations suggested.",4,2022,12,03
125,Christmas Afternoon tea treat,"A wonderful Christmas afternoon tea. The selection of sweet and savoury treats were delicious and beautifully presented. 
Manuel our waiter was friendly and very helpful, and we have to compliment the kitchen staff too. 
It was a perfect birthday treat",5,2022,12,03
125,We are kissing and telling!,The bar inside the St. Martins Lane Hotel is exactly the place to have a drink and a small bite to eat before a play in Leicestershire Square.  My sister and I are visiting London from the USA and discovered this hidden gem. James and Kyle at the bar made us feel so welcome. James in particular brightened up our evening with perfect cocktails and delightful conversation,5,2022,12,02
125,Super happy. Highly recommended.,"The service was really good from the girl who took us to our table, and offered to expand our table without us evening asking, and Manuel our Spanish speaking waiter definitely looked after us very attentively all evening. Very impressed.  
The food was incredible. The family was super happy.",5,2022,12,01
125,Hotel staff STOLE my phone,"During a business conference at the hotel today, my phone was taken from the ladies toilets. Phil, a member of staff  advised me to activate Find My Phone which showed me that the phone was last active at the back of the hotel in the staff area which I was not able to enter. Picture attached. The green line is the ladies toilets. The ear phones is where I was sitting in the conference room and the phone is in a staff area not accessible to the guests.
Upon showing this to the staff and security they entered the area with my work phone which had gps on it and proceeded to look. They told me that they checked lockers and found nothing. A thief will never hide their stolen items in a locker. 
My phone was switched off after an attempt was made to use contactless for a transaction. 
I was helped by one young man at the hotel who said that they had reviewed cctv and saw only guests and the cleaner enter and leave the toilet during the timeframe. I was not allowed to view this myself. 
My daughter is 18 months old and I have lost hundreds of pictures of her. I‚Äôve messages from loved ones that I‚Äôll never read again. Many months of memories have been stolen from me and I‚Äôve received no real help from anyone at the hotel except for one young man who offered to email the manager. 

There has to be an explanation as to why my phone was last switched on in the staff area. I was repeatedly told that gps isn‚Äôt always accurate. If this is the case then why did it accurately locate my earphones, and work phone and iPad to the conference room. And why did it also show me moving around the building when searching for my phone. 

I won‚Äôt be staying here again. Very sad state of affairs",1,2022,12,01
125,Still Got it to a degree After all these years,"This was the place to be in early 2000¬¥s and Asia de Cuba restaurant was the go to restaurant.
20 years after last being at this hotel i returned to England and spent 3 nights here in a Studio.

Much of the decor is the same, Philip Starck basic design and sorry but TINY tv in the room. As with any central London hotel these days, open the curtain and you can see and be seen from the offices on the other side of the street. My room was opposite a ""Boardroom"" where the door was constantly opening and shutting.

The replacement for Asia de Cuba is no where near as good. Breakfast is decent but comes at extra cost. Extra one slice of Avocado with scrambled egg, 3 pounds fifty. The one annoyance of these hotels now as it was then, they add 12.5% service but then leave a space for you to add Gratuity. Not good practice.
Overall is a great hotel, good location. Expensive for sure but still has some good vibes from yesteryear.",4,2022,11,26
125,NOT Value for Money!,"This is supposed to be a 5* Hotel. They must have a very particular idea how 5* Hotels must be. If you want to have an evaluation as such, then we start from the carpet on the alleyways which must be replaced‚Ä¶:yesterday. The doors are all painted blue and it reminds you more a Motel in US and not a five stars Hotel in London. For three nights we paid about ¬£3,400 for a room for three persons with the view of a roof across the street. The breakfast was charged separately and it was tragic to say the least. The cook made a great effort to improve it. One of the ladies in the breakfast was very rude. We felt like she was making us a favor for serving us. The gentlemen on the front desk were very polite and willing to facilitate. The location was good as well as the room service. Needs a lot of work to be recommended.",2,2022,11,20
125,Miss kurt,"I have just had coffee in the cafe here, and I have to say Vivi that served me was very nice. I was welcomed with a warm smile, and made to feel very welcome. The coffee was fab too! Thank you Vivi, I‚Äôll be back.",5,2022,11,14
125,Amazing,"Amazing service from Jonathan that served me the best Mocha I ever had. 

Thank you to Ilidio that kindly helped me with advises about London. 

You are the best.

Thanks to you my trip to London was much better and happier. 

Looking forwards to see you again.",5,2022,11,12
125,A place to return!,"I met Ilidio at the lobby of the hotel and he was very welcoming and helpful! He also advised to have a mocha at the coffee shop next door! Such a great experience, Jonathan was the most kindest person!thank you so much üòä we will come and we highly recommend!",5,2022,11,12
125,Great service!,"Lovely coffee, lovely staff, great vibes! Jonathan was really lovely and provided word class customer service :) food is really good too, the pastries taste as good as they look! Will definitely be back!",5,2022,11,12
125,Excellent!!!,"Thank you Vivi and Jonathan.
Coffee was perfect, very friendly and helpful staff.
We had a stop on our way to the national gallery. Lovely and relaxing place with nice low volume music.we will definitely go again.",5,2022,11,11
125,This is about the little coffee shop right next to the main entrance belonging to the St Martin‚Äòs Lane Hotel.,"We went tongue coffee shop three days in a row - every morning between 9h30-11h00 - the service was nice and friendly, Vivi who is behind the counter has always a smile on her face and is quite efficient. The coffee is top class and the small vienoiseries are fresh and very good as well.
Such a coffee shop makes lots of sense for all those who are not abig breakfast enthusiast!
Well done and keep going!",5,2022,11,10
125,Great waiter,"Manuel was the perfect waiter: Informative, professional and friendly. I had opted for several starters rather than a main course, and his suggestions were first-rate. Thanks for an excellent first meal in London since Covid arrived on our scene.",5,2022,11,08
125,Birthday break,"Four day half term break for my wife,daughter and I. Myself and my daughter were also celebrating our birthdays during the four days we were in a London.

A bottle of Prosecco for me and a lovely little cake for my daughter. The Front desk team (Gemma) also organised to fill the number 8 balloon we‚Äôd brought with us, with Helium. She was thrilled. 

Super location, close to all the destinations we were visiting.

Will be back one day soon‚Ä¶!",5,2022,11,07
125,Amazing service,"Jhonatan was so kind when we walked in, greeted us with a smile and the coffee he made us tasted so good. It's a great little spot and we were lucky to find it while frantically trying to get out of the pouring rain!",5,2022,11,06
125,No door on toilet area.,"This visit to London was to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary and decided to treat ourselves for this special occasion, costing over ¬£1000 for three nights.Very pretentious hotel.  On entering our room on the left hand side is an alcove covered with a curtain, the shelving is for goods the hotel are selling, candle ¬£49, room spray ¬£19 and various other goods. Then there is a doorway with no door into the bathroom area where there is a toilet and basin and a shower which has a door.  Then another alcove on the right hand side with 6 hangers, safe, dressing gowns, so hardly any space for clothing.  Then through another door to the bedroom, this door needs to be closed all the time otherwise you can see/hear if someone is using the toilet. Not good. The bedroom is small with no bedside tables.  First evening my husband had a brandy, about a tablespoonful in the glass and I had white coffee for which they charged us ¬£19!!  ",2,2022,11,06
125,Comfort & Kindness all around St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel,"Modern, contemporary but comfortable reception on the lower level. 

Such a cosy suite, with nice welcoming coffee table and lots of fluffy pillows on the beds. 

Special thank you for Phil and his kindness, and for Franck for helping our checkout. ",5,2022,11,03
125,"Comfortable, lovely, great location, excellent service","Beautiful hotel, great staff. The wonderful concierge, Patrick, was so helpful in recommending shows and restaurants, and he went out of his way to make sure we got reservations. Hotel is in a great location - walking distance to many theaters and restaurants, and if needed, two Underground stations close by. The Front Desk staff was also very helpful with transportation and directions. Highly recommend St. Martin's Lane Hotel!",5,2022,10,24
125,Worth a stay,"Welcoming reception team, very comfy beds and a chilled vibe. Right in the heart of the west end it is somewhere we have returned to. I am still mourning the loss of Asia de Cuba but you won‚Äôt be disappointed. My only note of caution is the drink prices are on the silly side of high but there are plenty of great places within metres of the front door",4,2022,10,23
125,Exceptional!,The staff was exceptional and went out of their way to assist us.  Ali and Joao at the front desk were so attentive and truly made us feel special!  The accommodations were comfortable and very clean and within walking distance to restaurants and points of interest in Coventry Gardens.,5,2022,10,22
125,The best Lane in London,"I can't say enough about our recent stay here. A wonderful experience with staff and management who really care about their guests. We stayed for three nights as part of our honeymoon and couldn't have been treated better. From the easy check-in experience to unexpected amenities and surprises in our room, their attention to detail really made our stay feel special. The room was wonderfully appointed, beautifully maintained and refreshed every time we came back. Hotel management should be so proud to have a team that works so hard for their customers. And the location... a block in any direction will take you to theaters, restaurants and/or Covent Garden, yet it's quiet enough to get a good night's sleep. We can't wait to return to St. Martens Lane for our future holiday travel!",5,2022,10,17
125,Wonderful experience,"Stayed with my 10 month old. They prepared a high chair and a cot. Also got free laundry for the baby.
All staff are friendly, professional and welcoming.
The location is also amazing. I would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,10,17
125,Another great stay at St Martins Lane!,"We‚Äôve stayed at this property many times. We love the location, the staff is extraordinary, the rooms are modern and very comfortable and we love the access to Gymbox! We cannot wait to return to what we consider our home away from home in London.",5,2022,10,15
125,Afternoon tea and a great hotel,"Great food, service and ambience. Manuel gave us a great experience.

We ordered the Afternoon tea, and we enjoyed all the tasty dishes. Our 15 year old daughter really appreciated the experience. 

Great hotel also, nice and delicate, quiet rooms.",5,2022,10,10
125,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights recently and had a wonderful welcome from Octavia on the front desk. She asked if we were celebrating anything. Told her our son and daughter had paid for our stay to celebrate our 70th birthdays. Our room wasn't quite ready so we gad a drink in the holel bar. The waiter came over with our drinks and 2 fresh cream cakes with candles in and happy birthday written on the plate. We asked if we could put the drinks on our room bill but was told they were complimentary. When we finished Octavia said our room was now ready. We stayed in a studio room which was beautiful and very spacious.  Later in the day after exploring the area we came back to find a complementary bottle of red wine in our room. The location of the hotel is superb, right in the heart of Covent Garden. We had tickets for Back to the Future, a short walk away, which was fantastic. All in all, we had a lovely stay in this hotel and would definitely stay again. Thank you Octavia for a wonderful welcome. Joan and Peter",5,2022,10,09
125,Amazing Hotel!,"I've stayed here twice now and hosted some workshops using their meetings rooms. Service is always fantastic, front desk are friendly and welcoming! Bar and Restaurant are also a great addition with some delightful breakfast options! Special mention to Yvie & Jhon who have always made sure our stays went off without a hitch. Definitely will keep coming back to St Martins Lane.",5,2022,10,06
125,A Wonderful Stay in London,"Our daughter and son-in-law recommended this hotel for our stay in London.  It was an outstanding hotel.  The staff were excellent.....very professional, very helpful and very friendly.  The hotel is well located just above Trafalgar Square which made walking everywhere very easy.  The rooms are very well lit and spotless.  The people at the front desk were excellent and quickly figured out your needs.  All of the staff were excellent, but a few people stood out as going over and above to make our stay a great experience.  A few names that we would like to mention are:  Phillip, Patrick, Jemma and Ilidio.  Thanks to everyone at St. Martins Hotel for making our stay a memorable one.  We hope to be back again soon.",5,2022,09,25
125,Wonderful hotel and staff!,"My partner and I stayed at St Martins Lane in August and had a really nice stay! The location was perfect, 5min walk from the Leicester square and covenant garden, and the street was not too busy so you wouldn‚Äôt hear a lot of noise at night. The staff were very polite, and the concierge was helpful in giving us directions/tips on places to visit and popular restaurants. The room was very spacious and clean, with probably one of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve slept on! My partner and I really enjoyed the gym that all hotel visitors could make use of. We will definitely be staying here again! Thanks for having us.",4,2022,09,24
125,Excellent Hotel and even more fantastic location,"This was a great hotel and well worth the price.  The Hotel Staff was very friendly and always willing to help if you had a question.  They gave great advice on where to go in town and where to eat.  When you ask for a taxi at a certain time, the staff is outside waiting for you at that time to ensure that you get in the correct taxi.  

The rooms were also great.  Plenty of USB ports for your electronics if you are a foreign traveler like myself and plenty of electrical sockets for you to use as well.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large.  The water pressure on the shower was outstanding as well, and got hot within seconds.  

The location is in the theater district so if you want to catch a show, there are literally dozens within walking distance.  It is also not far from the city center and also very close to the Tube if you want to move around the city.  

I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  This hotel along with the staff made our trip that much better.  Book today!",5,2022,09,24
125,BEST place EVER,"I cannot say anything but amazing things about St. Martin‚Äôs. The staff is absolutely fabulous - the whole staff! Everyone was so helpful, kind, funny, all going above and beyond they were simply superb! The hotel is in a great location, it is very clean, the rooms have several USB outlets, the showers are lovely and the beds are comfortable. I would stay here again and again. Thank you to all the staff at St. Martin‚Äôs Ln you made our crazy holiday perfect.",5,2022,09,21
125,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location,"We stayed here for three nights over the weekend and it was perfect for our needs. It is in a fantastic location with easy access to Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Soho. Lots of bars, pubs and restaurants within a 30 second walk. It also has 2 tube stations within a 5 minute walk and if coming from Euston it is only 4 stops away without the need to change lines. Very convenient!

We found the bed to be super comfy with great pillows and mattress. The air conditioning worked really well and the shower had great water pressure. 

The bars downstairs was a great place to hang out and have a few drinks. It had a very cool vibe with low lighting and comfy seats. They had a DJ playing some good music and the cocktail making was top class. 

We would stay here again and would recommend to others.",5,2022,09,12
125,Our new magic spot in Covent Garden‚Ä¶,"I loved this hotel since like forever‚Ä¶ the staff is so helpful that you‚Äôll fell in loved you walked in. Thank you Jennifer for arranging all our out Bday Celebrations! She is indeed the sweetest girl I meet! Monika in the breakfast was just superb every morning, greeting us every morning with such a smile! What a Joy!

Thank you also to Phil, he went over the moon as always and make our life easier every morning! We will definitely be back soon, I love my home away from London, in such a treasured location!",5,2022,09,04
125,Afternoon tea,"Amazing afternoon tea! Lovely ambiance, delicious (and filling!) treats and tea, and all-star service from our wonderful hostess Monika. Highly recommend this afternoon tea service for any occasion!!!",5,2022,09,01
125,Perfect location for theatre lovers,"Rooms are well appointed: spotlessly clean, fluffy pilllows, unique lighting, temperature controlled (a blessing when London stays at 80+ degrees.).  No individual amenities but shared shampoo, conditioner and body lotion all of high caliber.  Rooms are quiet even though hotel located in a noisy area.  Elevators are secure and efficient.  Staff is very helpful.  The location is central to West End Theatres and to the National Museum & Trafalgar Square.  The modern, quirky lobby is looking a bit dated but was clean & comfortable.  We did have  a significant kerfuffle over rooms but management worked hard to solve problem even though first floor not our requested location.",5,2022,08,27
125,Nick on the front desk is amazing,"Love coming back to St Martins Lane Hotel, the staff are amazing. In particular this trip was Nick on the front desk - massive smile, remembered my room requirements and helped me resolve something really quickly. Thank you Nick. The hotel is the perfect place to rest and restore, its beautiful, clean, quiet and central, it feels pure luxury, and people like Nick make it even more special. Thanks again, Starling",5,2022,08,23
125,Could have been better,"The hotel was good but not 5 star. The room was small and air conditioning was not the best. Tv was not working so had to mess around with cables to get it on. Some of the furniture was chipped. The breakfast was okay one day, the next two mornings were hit and miss. Cold beans, lukewarm scrambled eggs and also hard fried eggs. I would expect better from a 5 star environment. Overall the hotel location was very good and the bed and servicing of the room was good. 
The room amenities were poor. Teabags(4) No flavoured teas, no biscuits, no hot chocolate sachets and a coffee machine with (4) pods and a metre electric cord and two metres from a socket. Like I said, far too many little things wrong to be a 5 star establishment. Overall was ok but for 360 pounds a night you are having a laugh.",3,2022,08,22
125,"Stunning. Superb staff, gorgeous design and fabulous location","I've stayed at St Martins Lane a couple of times in recent months and can't wait to return. 

The design may be achingly cool, but the atmosphere which the team creates is extremely warm. The reception is buzzy, friendly and yet still highly efficient. The public spaces are very cleverly designed to create quiet spaces for a private chat or call alongside bustling exciting spaces.

The bedrooms are exceptional. Stylish, yes, but also extremely comfortable (beds are GORGEOUS) and with beautiful bathrooms. Real havens.

The location could not be better with stunning restaurants and bars nearby (try Giovanni's (https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719025-Reviews-Giovanni_s-London_England.html), as well as West End theatres within a stone's throw and yet it does not feel oppressively busy.

Most impressive of all is the team working in the hotel. From doorman, through reception, and house-keeping to the food and beverage team, every single person I encountered seemed absolutely determined to make my stay better - and each did this with their own personality and attitude.

Genuinely brilliant hotel and staff.",5,2022,08,19
125,A Great Stay In Central London,"We decided at the last minute to move our accommodations to Central London to be closer to the attractions and wanted to be near Covent Garden. While there was an issue with our room we were put in a Corner Suite Loft which we loved as we were traveling with our two young kids. Jenny and the front desk staff were super helpful as was the manager and concierge in helping to book nearby restaurant accommodations (Sticks N Sushi - so good, we went twice) and have a drink at the rooftop at St. James Hilton, a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is pricy but we thought very much worth it given the location and proximity to everything nearby. ",5,2022,08,10
125,"Location, Staff and Food!","With it being my first time in London my friend suggest I find somewhere in covent garden and what a great suggestion. We were close to everything which was so nice with kids! The food was some of the best we had the whole time we were in England! The staff was super helpful, especially Juliana who not only suggested Ting restaurant at The Shard but called and helped make a reservation... even with that said my daughter thought the St. Martins food was better! We also had a over the top service from the front desk. We needed a cab and couldn‚Äôt get one so one of the gents at the front ran up the street to hail a cab for us! Now THAT is service! Thank you for all you did to make our stay amazing!",5,2022,08,09
125,Best choice in the best location,"Best location in the heart of the best location.
A walking distance from all major attractions, and in the heart of west end.
Stuff attitude was outstanding , light ‚Äúcool‚Äù atmosphere.
Room was a bit small, but very functional, modern design",5,2022,08,07
125,"An unpretentious, friendly boutique hotel","We have stayed twice this year at St Martin's and it was not a fluke that we weren't disappointed the first time. We stayed on the fourth floor in a good size room, especially when compared to other hotels in central London. The deluxe room was on both occasions spotlessly clean. The kingsize bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom is a decent size and offers lots of shelf space to lay out your toiletries, etc. (unlike a lot of other hotels). The food in the restaurant and also the bar snacks were delicious. What stands out for me is the reception staff who are very helpful and friendly, especially Ibrahim who went the extra mile. The hotel staff play an important role in whether or not I would choose to return to a hotel and St Martin's has definitely become my favourite place to stay in central London. Its location near to the theatre district, Covent Garden and Soho means we can walk everywhere and avoid the hot tube!",5,2022,08,04
125,Platinum Jubilee Afternoon Tea,"Visited St Martin‚Äôs Lane for the first time yesterday and it was the best afternoon tea we‚Äôve ever had. 

Firstly, Monika deserves a pay rise or promotion. She‚Äôs the most hospitable person I‚Äôve probably ever met. She made us feel so welcome and was extremely attentive. Her warm smile and friendly nature made the day extra special.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food. I‚Äôll begin my review of it by mentioning that the portion sizes were brilliant. As someone who‚Äôs a sucker for afternoon tea, I usually always find that the portions are either too small or too big. So, at St Martin‚Äôs Lane you‚Äôre not leaving too stuffed or too empty. 

In terms of the savoury items, my top two favourites would be the Dorset crab with beetroot bread and the carrot wrap with cream cheese and cucumber. 

The coronation chicken sandwich was my third favourite. Those who know me know that I‚Äôm not usually a fan of coronation chicken filing as it can either be too sweet or too curry powder-y. However, the chef at St Martin‚Äôs Lane found the right balance. I‚Äôm now converted.

The sweet items were delicious, as expected! My top three (even though I loved them all) were the trifle (which again I‚Äôm not usually too keen on, but St Martin‚Äôs Lane SMASHED it), the English rose and the crown (joint with the Union Jack). Basically all of them. 

Last but by no means lease, let‚Äôs talk tea: Queen Elizabeth black tea blend was fantastic. Best tea I‚Äôve ever had.

It‚Äôs also very reasonably priced for the quality of what you‚Äôre receiving too, might I add. ¬£45 for what could easily be a ¬£70 afternoon tea. [Please don‚Äôt put your prices up, though ü§£].

This is not an ad, it‚Äôs just an honest review of someone who was there yesterday and loved it.",5,2022,07,31
125,High Tea at The Restaurant,"We dined at The Restaurant to experience a High Tea social. 

Juleana was a tremendous hostess. She was pleasant, knowledgeable and very helpful. She made us feel very welcome and made our experience all the more special. 

The sweets were delicious!! The ambience was very chic. 

Would totally come back here again!!

Thanks again, Juleana!!",5,2022,07,30
125,Still my favorite,"Modern art deco lobby and rooms make it pleasant, but the best of this hotel that s nestled in a quiet lane in middle of West end theaters and at two steps from Covent Garden, is their young/helpful/ friendly Staff. After a few visits they greet you as family and it does make a difference. Good to see that  plenty of them stay long and the front desk does not have the turnaround of trainee staff as in other hotels. One of my favorites: well done guys!",5,2022,07,30
125,Afternoon tea,I had a lovely afternoon tea on Saturday 21st July my grandaughter booked it for my birthday. It was really nice and Monika was very good at seeing that every thing was OK with us would definitely be back soon . Thank you for the birthday cake and the ladies that sang happy birthday.,5,2022,07,24
125,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"We visited today for afternoon tea and I was so impressed, I had to leave a review. We were due to go for afternoon tea for my Nan's birthday and I stumbled upon this afternoon tea at the last minute and I am so glad we did! The afternoon tea itself was absolutely fantastic, my highlight was the pork and apple lattice! Also a special shout out to Monika and the team who were so attentive and friendly and made our day. They even brought a cake out for my Nan and sung her happy birthday which was a lovely touch. We will definitely be back again soon!",5,2022,07,23
125,"Wonderful View from the room, excellent location!","I‚Äòve enjoyed my stay at the St. Martin‚Äòs Lane London Hotel very much. My room was on the sixth floor and had large windows that offered me  a wonderful view over the rooftops of my neighbourhods. I could even catch a glimpse of the London Eye in the near distance. The staff was wonderful, professional and helpful at all times - even though the first welcome, when I arrived at the lobby, was curt and not so pleasant. I think I interrupted a conversation between the staff and manager. 
The check-in then was very good and turned out to be welcoming after all.
I first got a room on the fifth floor and was a bit disappointed as I had only one window and the room - especially the carpet - needed maintenance. I just thought it was very different than the pictures showed in my booking. After a short call with reception they upgraded
me to premium room because of my hotel.com gold memeber status. I am very thankful for that - it really made my stay perfect. 
Also the breakfast was nice. Hot dishes were served and there was continental buffet. Unfortunately, I am on low carb diet and this continental buffer isn‚Äòt  good for me. Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äòt able to reorder  more eggs. So I only had hotel-breakfast on the first day.
All in all, I can very much recommend the hotel.",5,2022,07,20
125,Afternoon Tea,"The food was lovely and the service was amazing - the staff were very friendly and I felt very looked after. 

This was for a birthday treat and I was made to feel very special. I would definitely recommend!",5,2022,07,18
125,Less is More Elegance,"The hotel is centrally located to Theatres, walking distance to all the ""big"" must sees. Surrounded by great restaurants and shopping. Our room was very comfortable with a decent view. House keeping was on top of all aspects of our comfort. When we arrived a fruit bowl and bottle of water was delivered which was a very nice touch. We will definitely stay here again in the future.",5,2022,07,14
125,Excellent service,"We had dinner with friends and the service was excellent. The food was very good, and the staff friendly and kind. Julianna and James were great, very kind and accommodating. We ordered dessert, but had no time to have it as we would have been late for a play we were going to watch. James and Julianna offered to serve our dessert after our play. We were very impressed and will definitely come back.",5,2022,07,12
125,Best Hotel in London,"I have been staying at St Martin's Lane Hotel for 22 years on and off, and that in itself speaks volumes. Apart from the hotel being absolutely beautiful, the staff and service are second to none. I've developed a rapport with the Executive Office staff over the years, and they always take care of bookings for me. I would like to say a BIG thank you to Vinne De Waal for being so attentive when catering to our needs during our stay. It would not have been the success it was without his help. Thank You!",5,2022,07,09
125,Great location and great value!,"We stayed at this hotel in June 2022. The location is excellent and is close to the best shopping, restaurants and entertainment in the city. The room was very modern and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for great value, a central location and top notch service.",5,2022,06,26
125,Chilling at The Terrace - fab experience!,"As it was a lovely sunny day in London we decided to try out The Terrace at St Martins Lane Hotel for dinner and take advantage of their outside space.  Wow, we were not disappointed on either the space, food or drinks.  They‚Äôve cleverly maximised their outside space and created an oasis of calm ‚Äì a great place to relax away from the craziness that is Covent Garden ‚Äì with the added bonus of sitting in the sun.   The large flowerpots and foliage screens shield you from people walking past so you don‚Äôt feel you‚Äôre on display. 

We ordered their signature drink ‚Äì the Chandon Garden Spritz ‚Äì which was the perfect drink to enjoy in the sun.  It‚Äôs refreshing with a hint of orange served with dried orange slice and rosemary.  Sounds weird with the rosemary but it really works.

We decided to share a couple of starters and mains so we could try as many of the dishes as possible.  The menu isn‚Äôt large, but we found we were spoilt for choice as everything sounded delicious.  We had the salmon tartare which was refreshing and full of flavour.  The burrata was so smooth and creamy ‚Äì just melted in your mouth and the spiced melon puree was an inspired addition!  We loved their twist on the classic Caesar salad ‚Äì especially the tempura anchovies ‚Äì could have eaten a bowl of them!  The sumac trout with crab tabbouleh was a hit with us both as well.  

The level of service was spot on, we didn‚Äôt have to wait long or wave manically to get their attention.  A shout out to James and Ottavia who were so welcoming and attentive.

Highly recommend The Terrace ‚Äì it‚Äôs now a firm fav and will be a regular haunt for us during the summer months.",5,2022,06,21
125,"Pity, not valid for the price to stay anymore","Big problem with accounting system. Staff mistakes costs us 100 GBP.

Restaurant and bar isn‚Äôt as good as we experienced before. Slow service, not good quality of food and bad choice of drinks
We like location, but service except small caff√® was very pure.",2,2022,06,17
125,Meal after Pretty Woman show,"A huge thank you to Vianni, do hope I got his name correct!!! I had pre booked already but we were able to go earlier than the booking. When we arrived he was very busy but promised to call should an earlier table become available.  Fair play  within 15 minutes he called and sat us at a fabulous table. The food and wine was absolutely beautiful so thank you to Vianni and his amazing team. Sam.",5,2022,06,13

125,Birthday Theatre Trip,"We booked to stay here for 3 nights with our children (aged 7 and 8) to celebrate mine and our daughter's birthday.

The hotel is very central and is a 5min walk from Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square.

We were impressed from the very start.

The hotel is incredible, staff were friendly and helpful and the bedrooms were amazing.

The restaurant / bar is lovely and the staff were wonderful especially Monika and James. 

My birthday was while we were there and I was thoroughly spoilt by the hotel. The day we arrived, there was a handwritten note wishing me happy birthday and a mini black forest gateau waiting for us in the room.

 Monika, who worked at breakfast, found out it was my birthday and she went away and came back with a mini black forest gateau on a glass plate that had 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate. She came and said hello to us the next day and asked how our trip had been.

James, who worked in the evenings, was also fantastic. He was so friendly and helpful, plus when he found out it was my birthday, he went away and came back with a complimentary glass of champagne for my husband and I.

When it came to checking out, the process went very smoothly, plus the hotel staff looked after our bags so we could have one last look around London until we had to go and catch our train.

We will absolutely be back to stay at this hotel as we really felt valued.",5,2022,05,31
125,Excellent,"Great experience! The place is great and we love the food there . The food was absolutely amazing.
Everything we tested had very good flavour balance , modern presentation. The entire menu we found extensive and seasonal to very high standards.Staff are knowledgeable and friendly.
Highly recommend!",5,2022,05,30
125,"Stayed here rather than the Dorchester, and I'm pleased that we did! ",Excellent and very helpful staff. Fastidiously clean room. We has a corner room with panoramic views over the city. Breakfast was plentiful with a good choice (such as full English or porridge). I found the unique 'lobby scent' a little over powering but it could have been worse (it could have been a nasty smell)! ,5,2022,05,23
125,Fantastic Stay,"Excellent stay at a wonderful hotel.  Staff couldn't be more helpful, the room was lovely, the design of the hotel particularly the reception was amazing, great location with easy access to Leicester Square, Soho, Trafalgar Square & Covent Garden, Parking was convenient but pricey, Hotel was good value.",5,2022,05,23
125,Excellent afternoon tea ‚òïÔ∏è,"Really enjoyed my afternoon tea that drew influence from a range of British and even a some new world cuisine trends.  This created a decadent sweet selection full of glitz and glamour for me. Service was impeccable, attentive and friendly throughout.  Pair with champagne for a perfect palate cleanser to end the joyful experience.",5,2022,05,22
125,Wonderful stay,"We had the most perfect stay at St Martins Lane. We are a family of 4, two children 6 and 8 and we were spending a couple of days in London taking in the museums, and the typical touristy spots! The room was absolutely perfect and had everything we needed while being very comfortable and quiet, despite the incredible central location. The staff are absolutely incredible, can not do enough for you and very welcoming. Breakfast was wonderful with lots of delicious options for us and the children. We will definitely stay again, I can't think of a thing I would change!",5,2022,05,18
125,A HOME AWAY FROM HOME IN ONE OF MY FAVORITE CITIES!,"This gem of a hotel is centrally located in Central London and within walking distance to‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING! From the West End theatres, The National, and The Old Vic, to the Tate Modern, Somerset House and several great galleries, BFI Film Center and IMAX (I believe it‚Äôs‚Äô London‚Äôs largest screen)!  The rooms are stylish with UNBELIEVABLY COMFORTABLE BEDS but‚Ä¶
THE STAFF has consistently been the single friendliest, most helpful and welcoming I‚Äôve ever met and had the pleasure of continually seeing, since my first stay in 2017!  Imagine my surprise when the singularly charming, warm  ILIDIO greeted me as I arrived after a three year pandemic pause.  Not even Covid could dim this gentleman‚Äôs gracious, welcome.  He is the embodiment of everything that makes this a world class hotel!  The attention to detail is really wonderful here andI WILL ALWAYS BOOK MY LONDON VISITS AT THE ST. MARTINS LANE HOTEL!  Wall to wall EXCELLENCE!",5,2022,05,13
125,"Lovely hotel, great staff","Stayed once again in the very central hotel St Martins Lane.
Great hotel and excellent staff. In particular Ibrahim at reception  and Kyle in the bar.
The staff are what makes a hotel stay memorable. 
Couldn't fault anything about or stay. We will def be back",5,2022,04,25
125,Wonderful Stay,"A wonderful hotel in the middle of London. Fantastic decor and the room was amazing. Very clean and tidy with all the amenities. Our trains were cancelled on the day so we had to drive and Phil was amazing and made sure we had a parking space. Reception staff were very friendly, especially Emily and Jenny. They were very accommodating, polite and friendly. I will definitely be staying again.",5,2022,04,12
125,Beware if you are on a budget,"We arrived yesterday evening, I had booked through Bookings.com on arrival I offered to pay with Apple Pay but they did not have the facilities , then my husband used his debit card to pay and we where told as it was a debit card ( i have stayed in many London hotels and have been given the option to add but never told I have no option ) they would have to add another ¬£200 incidental charge to the bill taking what we thought we would be paying from ¬£704 to ¬£904 ( the two hundred pounds will be returned on departure but Will take 3 to 7 days to return to the bank account , the gentleman also said if there is any problem and the money is not returned that we should contact the hotel to chase it!! )

The hotel is very nice and would defiantly have stayed here again but my principles tell me that I probably will not 

My issue is that nowhere in Bookings.com was I made aware that any additional charge would be added to my bill , and that ¬£200 would need to be held, a vital bit of information for anyone planning a trip anywhere",3,2022,04,09
125,Birthday,Had dinner at the restaurant for a friends birthday on 4 April 2022. We received great service from James and Jose. Was greatly appreciated. The venue and ambiance was great. Although the food portions were small the service from James and Jose made up for it.,5,2022,04,05
125,Great service,"I recently hosted my partner‚Äôs birthday dinner party at the Martin‚Äôs Lane restaurant. The food was delicious and served with professionalism and friendliness. Beautiful decor, and lightning. Special thank you to Jose and James for making this celebration so special",5,2022,04,05
125,Amazing stay!,"Amazing hotel! I have stayed at alot of hotels in London and this is by far my favourite one!!

Room was ready early when we arrived at midday which was a great suprise. Room was fantastic, very modern, huge bed which was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on!! Mini Bar has a great selection aswell.

When we were out on an evening house keeping would come in the room, draw the curtains and set the mood lighting etc for our return which is a great touch.

We used the restaurant and the bar which are both amazing. Really good quality food and drink with amazing service. The staff are fantastic throughout the hotel and really go out if their way to ensure you have a great experience.

Overall we were very impressed with the hotel and, although it is quite expensive, you really do get what you pay for and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We will definitely be returning on the near future.",5,2022,04,04
125,Brilliant restaurant with excellent customer service and tasty fine dinning,"Great atmosphere, Great food, Great staff, and brilliant location. What more can we say, spot on
and very much looking forward to coming back in the next few weeks for bubbles and calamari.

A very relaxing atmosphere with smart staff helping us to enjoy it all. Thank you",5,2022,03,31
125,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Cocktails, Amazing Location","I stayed at St Martin‚Äôs Lane last week and with my boyfriend for his birthday and from the moment we checked in, Jose and Olegs were just so much fun that we couldn‚Äôt feel more loved and welcomed. Their cocktails on the bar are just amazing, and the food was very tasty. Location is just minutes away from all the landmarks in London. They defintely spoiled us, and we cannot wait to come back. They looked after out suitcases as we had out flight back in the evening, just superb service.",5,2022,03,21
125,Restaurant breakfast disappointing,We visited the restaurant for a Sunday breakfast with high expectations. Unfortunately this wasn‚Äôt delivered. We ordered the rocket frittata which looked and tasted like a plain thin omelette on a plate with some rocket chucked on top. The side of tomatoes were unseasoned and tasted like they had just been put over a grill pan for 5 secs. It‚Äôs didn‚Äôt come with any bread. The French toast tasted burnt and tasteless - not fitting the description on the menu. They food came late but in fairness  they did apologise for this. Staff were nice hence scoring 2/5. Left disappointed.,2,2022,03,13
125,Perfect stay in perfect location!,"I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever written a hotel review but could not pass this one up.  This hotel is amazing in and of itself because of its decor, private speakeasy, cleanliness and location. But what takes it a step above the rest is the staff.  They absolutely went out of their way to make our stay perfect.  From hailing taxis to providing umbrellas to restaurant recommendations - all flawless but not stuffy!  Perfection!!",5,2022,03,08
125,Solid stay but room for improvement,"I‚Äôve genuinely longed to stay here for so long, finally managed to book to stay in December for an annual family London trip and was really excited after all the reviews.

We had a friendly welcome, we dropped off bags early with expectation that room wouldn‚Äôt be ready however actually did have a room for us and got a cheeky upgrade which was nice surprise, so thank you. Room was decent sized, lovely bathroom and dressing room/area, cool touches with the lighting etc. As this is a review, it probably didn‚Äôt have quite the impressiveness that I‚Äôd conjured in my head for this boutique hotel that sets it apart from others, or expected it to. 

One of the things I did notice was the general appearance of the corridors etc and some of decor finishes wasn‚Äôt actually that great if you actually looked at the general paintwork in some parts of the hotel, corridors even hotel bar, which we spent a few hours in drinking‚Ä¶ I mean obviously I wasn‚Äôt there to inspect the paintwork but you kind of expect a level and finish quality of a 5 star hotel and I just noticed it.  The bar staff were attentive and we had a joke with them, so found them accommodating.

The receptions staff were friendly and helpful, so all satisfactory.

It was a good stay, but maybe it wasn‚Äôt as WOW as I had imagined and expected (after wanting to stay for so long!) 

Location is superb though and you couldn‚Äôt fault it, but obviously being so central and in the heart of everything you can‚Äôt expect that it‚Äôs going to be really quiet (or at least probably some of the rooms). 

Sleep was decent, we didn‚Äôt venture for breakfast so can‚Äôt comment on it as we did early skate at Somerset House. 

I‚Äôd stay again perhaps, but not itching to go back for the cost if I am honest.",4,2022,03,04
125,not as good as last time,"I used it last August and had such a good experience that I returned, but this time I was disappointed. The front desk is covered only by one staff, so there is a line up at every time and they are not as friendly as before, except the very helpful porter. By far one of the best location: quiet, but in the middle of the theater district and at 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar square and Covent Garden, but the hotel is not worth the price that they charge; and they do not offer any return guests welcome back rates‚Ä¶ so I booked somewhere else for the my additional days in town.",3,2022,02,18
125,My fave hotel in London,"Beautiful hotel, incredible staff who go out of their way to make you feel special - true gem and my fave spot in town.  Jose is an absolute superstar, if you cross their path, you're one very lucky guest - exquisite service and efficiency. All in all - fab place, esp the bar ",5,2022,02,14
125,What a hotel,The most amazing hotel in the world wow thanks to Natasha and just all the staff. Me and my dog teddy could not want for anything at all the breakfast was amazing the bathroom amazing and just a big thank you to all the reception staff will defo stay again x,5,2022,02,10
125,Great Service,"Nice hotel in London. Very clean room and comfy bed. I ordered room service which was nice and fast. All the staff I met were very friendly, especially Olegs on the front desk. I will definitely be returning soon!",5,2022,01,31
125,A last minute booking at this iconic hotel. What a treat!,"The place needs some love, marble floorings are so old they can do with a revamp. Room was OK but just lucking that lacklustre, sharp edge this place had once upon a time. A refurbishment is due I think. My friends booked this as a surprise for me and my wife, it was unexpected, how exciting!
Thankfully staff were superb, although quite scarce, there was hardly any around! Massive thanks to Jose the manager who was literally everywhere solving our issues and checking on us, thank you very much, you and your team are stars!!
The Blind Spot still lives up to his reputation, the long queue of people waiting to go in was as long as the hotel lobby. An amazing atmosphere around the West End buzzing just like it was pre-Covid. 
We will be back.",4,2022,01,31
125,Family visit,"I have stayed with this group a few times before and won‚Äôt be returning.

I booked the hotel and called a week before to explain that it was my daughter birthday if they could do something in the room for arrival and that I don‚Äôt mind paying. The request was accepted. 

I got a phone call in the morning of arrival asking my daughters name and told the request was accepted and the room was ready for whenever we wanted to arrive.

We checked in at 1pm to find nothing in the room. I complained as we were leaving for some sight seeing and was told it was because we checked in early it hadn‚Äôt been done but assured it would fulfilled for our return. We came back at 5pm and still nothing. I complained again and told them the moment had passed. Another 45 minutes passed and a tiny dessert arrived. 

The aircon blew out hot air and I complained to which there had been mis communication (i don‚Äôt know how it was like a sauna) and maintenance turned the heating up even higher!

My wife called house keeping and requested a pen. After nearly two hours we had to call again.

Honestly do not stay here. It‚Äôs tired, out of date and needs renovation. Plus the service is appalling.",1,2022,01,24
125,Fantastic stay!,"Superb location - close to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and right in the middle of all the theatres. Service was great and staff was really excellent. Oleg at reception deserves a mention - nothing was too much effort for him. Had a brilliant weekend with the family and St ML definitely produced the goods! Breakfast was fantastic - everything exactly as it should be. We will definitely return.",5,2022,01,16
125,Amazing!,I stayed at St Martins Lane hotel with my boyfriend and they looked after our birthday celebration and our weekend away. Jose and Olegs were the best party planners ever! Room was meticulously clean and all the staff we encountered were really friendly and very nice. We will definitely come back soon.,5,2022,01,16
125,Fantastic,"We stayed in this GEM in covent garden last week and everyone in the hotel was very friendly. Special thanks to Ilidio for getting our transportation around the city. The hotel is very immaculate clean and the rooms are very well designed, we loved the lights changing feature in the rooms, we had so much fun we cannot wait to be back!",5,2022,01,16
125,Amazing staff,"If you are looking for a quirky hotel with amazing staff, lovely cocktails and food, and the best location in London, you need to stay in St Martins Lane. From the moment you check in, they will look after you like royalty. Jennifer organised some cakes for my daughter's birthday, and they organised our tickets to the show who was actually next door. Very well located if you are planing to go to any shows in London. Thank you Lucia for looking after us, we will be booking again this hotel for our Summer Vacation.",5,2022,01,16
125,"Great area, food not great.","Great area, but sadly let down by a cold breakfast, so we decided to eat elsewhere the next day, as really disappointed.
Nice room, but lock in the toilet was broken, which considering the amount paid, is a little frustrating.
Staff were friendly enough, but overall probably not worth the money, due to the poor food.
",3,2022,01,16
125,Top hotel!!,"Well this was a first visit to this hotel, recommended by some friends. We absolutely loved it. Firstly the hotel is very quirky‚Ä¶. Loved the speak easy club, loved the decor, our room was fab and the room service ( twice a day) was top class. We had breakfast in the hotel on one occasion and it was beautiful. 
The staff at the hotel are all soooooo friendly and welcoming. We had several conversations with the reception staff who genuinely seemed interested in our plans for the day, asking where we had travelled from, being really informative about where to go on New Year‚Äôs Eve and where to avoid etc. 
Having stayed at many many hotels in London over the years, this is now my favourite. 
The bed was the most comfortable bed ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Absolutely luscious. 
Thankyou to all the lovely staff at the hotel, and please don‚Äôt change‚Ä¶ We will be back and will always recommend to others. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ",5,2022,01,03
125,Cool hotel in Central London,"Stayed between Christmas and New Year. Had eaten in the hotel before but never stayed. It's a great location, just a short walk from Charing Cross Station and so close to many restaurants, bars and theatres. The room was comfy and modern (and quiet for central London). I love the smell throughout the hotel too!  Breakfast again was good with swift service. Would stay again for sure. ",5,2021,12,30
125,Birthday treat,"We stayed at this hotel last week and remembered why this is our first choice in London, the staff are superb, early check-in and a room upgrade to boot. We absolutely love it here and will return after the new year.",5,2021,12,18
125,Excellent Location - Friendly Staff - Nice Rooms,"Perfect location. Surprisingly quiet for the location so close to the centre of London. Very comfortable room. Friendly staff. The price is what I would expect from such a great location. Charing Cross rail and Embankment tube are 5 minutes walk away. Trafalgar Square is 2 minutes away. Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus & Covent Garden are all within 5-8 minutes walk away.",5,2021,12,14
125,Fantastic stay at St Martin‚Äôs Lane,"Stayed here with my partner to meet up with friends for dinner. Fabulous location just off Trafalgar Square. Lovely room, clean, lovely shower. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast. We will be staying here again.",5,2021,12,12
125,PERFECT HOTEL!!,I stayed for a night at the hotel. Was really impressed with every aspect of the experience. Jose was especially helpful and always had a happy face at reception. Will definitely be staying again and 100% recommend it.,5,2021,12,05
125,Sadly disappointing,"I have wanted to stay in this hotel for a long time and found the opportunity when we booked for my sister‚Äôs family hen weekend. Having travelled all the way from Liverpool, she was very excited about the plans I had lined up for the weekend for us (3 female siblings) in Central London - starting with what I thought would be a top-notch, super impressive hotel. We arrived in full hen party style with balloons, t-shirts and sashes - so it couldn‚Äôt be missed that it was a special occasion! We were told that the room wasn‚Äôt ready and to go off and grab a bite to eat and it would be ready within the hour. We did as asked but explained that we had a tight schedule to stick too, with theatre bookings etc‚Ä¶ 

We promptly arrived back an hour later and staff fumbled around without any real explanation other than the room still wasn‚Äôt ready. I had to ask for a drink or somewhere to sit while we waited and we were then offered a coffee. I explained that this was clearly a special occasion and could they at least accommodate us in the bar whilst we waited even longer (I should not have had to ask for this!). We were then given a glass of Prosecco in the bar area which was, at the very least, a nice place to wait and simmer down at the poor service we had received so far! 

Another hour passed and I asked to see the manager. Whilst waiting, another couple asked if I had booked via booking.com (which I had) and they said they were also having issues due to a miscommunication between the company and the hotel. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice to have revived this information from the front of house staff rather than another exasperated customer! The manager advised that she did not have our triple room available and the 3 of us would have to split across 2 adjoining rooms which completely defeated the object of booking a triple considering we hadn‚Äôt actually seen each other in person for over a year (thanks COVID!). However, as we now had around 45 minutes to wash and change before our evening outing, we accepted. 

When we got to the rooms they were in the back arse of the hotel behind a very strange door which led to the rooms which were not, in fact, adjoining at all. We were told by the concierge that to make them adjoining (around a corner) we had to wedge open both of our doors with a door wedge! Unbelievable!!! 

At this point we were all feeling disappointed and deflated. So, we had to make the best of the space we had been given. The rooms were small but clean and quiet despite overlooking the back street. The atmosphere we had hoped for hadn‚Äôt surfaced because of the wait and the weird rooms we had been given. Thank goodness the location of the hotel is so fantastic, so we managed to get to our reservation on time and I was also able to introduce my sister‚Äôs to the delights of Leicester Square / Covent Garden, as it was all within a very easy walk. 

Breakfast was nice, although we had to keep asking for service (tea / coffee / fruit / our order) rather than it being readily provided which was again not the standard expected - particularly considering how expensive breakfast was!  

Upon checkout the assistant manger - Lucia - was very apologetic but unfortunately it felt like too little too late, as the special weekend had already been ruined. So disappointing.",3,2021,11,28
125,Excellent Hotel. Excellent location,"Arrived early evening. Room was ready, and there was a paper tape on the door which tore when I entered. Sanitized. Very large room and bath. Modern furniture and bath fixtures. Shower modern. The front desk staff was always cheerful and helpful during my stay. Bell staff also. It's in the theater district, centrally located, so there are many good restaurants nearby. A short walk to Chinatown. National Art Gallery down the street. St Martin's in the Fields Church also. Taxis abound. Very close to almost anything. Breakfast was fine - but I missed Stilton Cheese. Said so. It was provided. Service great. I really liked this hotel, and I will be back. I highly recommend it for business or leisure travel.",5,2021,11,25
125,Best Hotel Ever!,"I spent a weekend away in St Martins Lane Hotel last month and it was AMAZING! The rooms were super well designed and the showers are a dream came true. All the staff was making you feel like a part of their family, nothing was trouble for them. Thank you Kamil and Jose for helping us with all our bookings around London, you guys rock! We will be coming back soon! I miss your pillows so much!",5,2021,11,25
125,Great hotel! We will come back very soon ‚ù§Ô∏è,"We stayed for a weekend away with my boyfriend a and everything was just superb. From the restaurant downstairs to our amazing room, spotlessly cleaned. Everything we wished to have  during our stay, it was delivered instantly. Thank you Jose and his team for looking after our weekend away from the kids. We will be back definitely for Xmas shopping, and we will remain loyal as always to this hotel‚Ä¶ an authentic Gem In Covent Garden. I miss already Phil‚Äôs and his boys at the door! They will recommend you the best places to have fun in London",5,2021,11,21
125,Great location,"The location of this hotel was the main reason we booked it but we found the staff were very friendly and attentive. We booked a ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù room as we thought the other rooms looked quite crammed. The room was spacious for a London city hotel and had a slight view of the London eye at the left side. We didn‚Äôt dine in the hotel so can‚Äôt rate the food but noted they have a cafe, restaurant and bar so plenty of choice. Would definitely consider it as an option when returning to London.",5,2021,11,19
125,Just fantastic!,"Stayed here for three nights in September and had a fantastic stay. Never known such lovely rooms! We had a garden room with a beautiful little patio. The room itself was clean, superbly decorated, and unbelievably comfortable. Staff were really friendly both on arrival and during our stay. I definitely felt like they were all going the extra mile, from reception staff to the lovely friendly housekeeping staff who maintained our room so well during our stay. We‚Äôve booked to come back in December and we can‚Äôt wait!",5,2021,11,07
125,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Hotel was lovely, clean and in a fantastic location. Above all, the staff were absolutely tremendous. They were super helpful and very friendly from the check in desk, the breakfast staff, maintenance and hotel bar staff. Couldn‚Äôt fault them.",5,2021,11,02
125,Delicious lunch with outstanding service,"We came for a quick weekday lunch and absolutely loved the service and the food. Victorja welcomed us warmly and made sure that we were well looked after for the whole time, in fact she went out of her way for our additional wishes. Outstanding service! Food was also incredible! And the cocktails too. A special place in the heart of Covent Garden.",5,2021,10,31
125,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night whilst in London for a theatre visit. Excellent central location around Covent Garden and theatre land. Arrived early, great welcome from the Concierge ( who remembered us when we arrived back later in the day). Quick efficient check in and got to our room early  as it was ready! Room 202 was right on the corner so has excellent views. Great shower, comfy bed though not used to being in a double bed. Spotlessly clean. Had drinks in The Den which was great, but found service in the cocktail bar to be very slow, waited 15mins from ordering our drinks, and it was only a bottle of wine. However  fantastic hotel with great front of house staff, we will be back. ",5,2021,10,24
125,Great comfortable hotel,"We wanted to be near the theatres in London and chose this hotel, with a loft style room. More expensive than we would notmally want to pay but we enjoyed the stay and the room. Very clean and staff attentive. Our room had views of the Colliseum top tower that slowly spins around and could just see Nelson on top of his column! We opted not to eat there for breakfast (which was not inclusive) or dinner but just got up and out to see the sites and ate more a brunch type meal anywhere we felt like and then early dinner at other restaurants either before or late dinner after our booked shows, then back to hotel. We just decided to try other restaurants etc and make use of our time in London. Very comfortable room with walk in shower for my hubby and big bath for me to relax in.",5,2021,10,24
125,Great location & pleasant stay,"This hotel is really well situated as you can reach many key London venues on foot. Plenty of restaurants around and Covent Garden is just a stroll away. I can recommend Dishoom, an Indian restaurant which is only a five minutes walk from the hotel and is excellent. 

The room we got for the family was quite big with a spacious bathroom equipped with plenty of places to store your personal effects.

The rooms are clean and the housekeeping is impeccable. They come twice a day. The staff is helpful and saved some mail we needed to receive upon arrival. 

We did not have breakfast nor any other meal so I cannot comment on that.",5,2021,10,19
125,Thank you Rut!!,Rut the Bell Man was very helpful and gave us perfect service. He provided us with great information and made our experience at St. Martin‚Äôs lane hotel exceptional. This is the type of service that makes you want to go back to the hotel!  Thank you Rut for going above and beyond to make sure we have the best experience during our stay at St. Martins Lane hotel!,5,2021,10,14
125,Very good stay,Excellent front of house service. Quick checkin. Concierge and doorman helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location for all the theatres and restaurants in Covent Garden and for getting around on the tube. Room was large (for London) and we had a great view towards the London Eye. Very nice bathroom area. We‚Äôll defo stay here again. ,5,2021,10,11
125,Gorgeous Afternoon Tea,"I came here with a group of girlfriends for my birthday for afternoon tea and we had an absolutely gorgeous afternoon .
Even before we arrived the whole customer experience was really good - I explained our numbers weren‚Äôt finalised, there were 2 with nut allergies, I was vegetarian‚Ä¶. they couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating!
And then the actual day itself was just perfect - really relaxing with just the best service from Vicky! Nothing was too much trouble, every need was taken care of - from refilling pots of tea to being our personal photographer!
She couldn‚Äôt have been any more helpful!
The afternoon tea itself was delicious, served on the most gorgeous tea set and tableware and in short it was probably one of the nicest covid/post covid experiences I‚Äôve had - I will definitely be back!!",5,2021,10,11
125,"Nice Hotel, Superb location, Friend Staff, but bad blackout courtins.","Beautiful hotel, in the heart of West End, walking distance of Soho and Covent Garden. Rooms are good, modern, great shower, nice coffee shop downstairs, friendly staff, really good and I intend to come back more times. I am not giving 5 to the hotel only because of the blackout curtains that are not good and caused me some bad nights of sleep.",4,2021,10,08
125,Would not stay here ever again,"I will start with the positives. The staff were very pleasant.
Hotel itself hugely disappointing and in need of a refurbishment. Now looking very dated. Probably one of the worst rooms I‚Äôve stayed in. The rooms are so small that you would struggle not to bang your limbs when moving around. 
There is no privacy and we were kept awake by one couple having sex next door, someone coughing above and could hear the person the other side of us every time they went to the toilet. This along with the noise outside meant we didn‚Äôt get a wink of sleep. Not ideal when my husband and I had a day of meetings 
How this hotel is classed of 5 star I will never know 
It‚Äôs ridiculously expensive for something that is 2 star quality. Would not stay here again",1,2021,10,07
125,50th Wedding Anniversary Golden wedding anniversary.,"My Wife & I stayed at this hotel for 2 night's ( 1st & 2nd of October 2021.):for our 50th wedding anniversary. Yes our golden wedding anniversary. We did not have a golden time though.
The room was fabulous , housekeeping was fabulous , the breakfast was Luke warm &very small  poached egg on warm bread...Not toast &1 mushroom,!
VERY POOR INDEED!!!
VERY POOR INDEED!!!
VERY SLOW SERVICE AS WELL
Most of the staff ie front desk, restaurant staff we're terrible.
I had to complain 4 times about the front desk being disingenuous and restaurant staff being uninterested. 
This is not a 5 star hotel, its more like a 2 star hotel.
Do not stay at this hotel if you want 5 star luxury as you will be dissatisfied.",1,2021,10,06
125,Fabulous Location for City Break,"Fab Location
This hotel‚Äôs location is central to Leicester Square with a 1 minute walk to the underground.
Very clean, spacious rooms & friendly staff. Huge bathrooms. Very modern & perfect for what we needed. Comfortable beds & very soundproof.",5,2021,09,30
125,Average stay - minimalist service,"Firstly, I want to say the stay was relatively pleasant, but there definitely was something missing for us. As a family who don‚Äôt come to London often, it always feels exciting to be somewhere new. Our Initial impression was relatively good - the room was nice, the bathroom generous & the beds comfy.  It was the little things that let us down - We were just wary about using anything in the room because its all extra charge. Took us ages to find the tea/coffee, which there wasn‚Äôt much of. It was breakfast in particular that let us down & I kind of wish we hadn‚Äôt paid for breakfast with our stay. We weren‚Äôt greeted with any service or pleasantries & it was as if we knew what we were supposed to do. No one came over to our table or explained how it worked. It took ages to receive any tea or coffee and it felt as though staff were going through the motions. We had to call for the staff to come over on a number of occasions for service. The. Food was average - pretty bland & not really worth the price. I recognise that this clearly isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs experiences, but it was ours.  
In all the experience of being in London was great, but I wouldn‚Äôt return to this hotel on our Next visit. 
I did want to say that The friendliest member of staff we encountered was the cleaner - she was so incredible cheerful & lovely to talk with.",3,2021,09,30
125,Our go to Hotel in London,"This is our 3rd stay at this super hotel. This trip is a birthday treat for my husband & the staff arranged for helium balloons, cake & bubbly 
SUPER:
STAFF - friendly, helpful, kind, courteous, considerate.  Going above & beyond.
SERVICE - first class 
ROOM - well appointed, very comfortable bed, quilt & pillows, spacious bathroom, our had a bath & shower
FACILITIES - well stocked mini bar with a good selection, good quality toiletries, kettle along with coffee machine
LOCATION - a stones throw from Trafalgar Square & theatres it is an excellent base
PRICE - considering location along with facilities & service it's very reasonable.
We will definitely be returning.
Highly Recommend",5,2021,09,29
125,Practically perfect in every way!!,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay in this remarkable hotel. As a family of 4 including my 5 year old daughter, we simply don't have enough words to explain how brilliant this hotel and its staff are. The perfect location for us as a family as my father has health problems. Absolutely immaculate and the attention to detail is second to none. Rooms lovely and big, clean and airy. Every extra you can think of. We ate breakfast each morning in the hotel and it was cooked fresh of your choice. The hotel doesn't charge children for breakfast which is a nice touch. The reception staff were helpful with nothing too much trouble. However the two staff that simply made our stay and deserve an extra special mention are Camille and Phil who man the front if the hotel. They never failed to greet us on our return to the hotel. Due to my father's health we got taxis everywhere and they immediately got us one and helped us in and out. Their humour with my 5 year old didn't go unnoticed and she had a soft spot for them
 They are a credit to the hotel!! I already have recommended to a friend and will most definitely be booking again soon. 

The Hornby Family",5,2021,09,27
125,New hotel of choice in London,"This was a change to our normal hotel of choice in London, we always stay at Dean St Townhouse, well we loved St Martin‚Äôs, check in was smooth and friendly, our delux room was well appointed amenities were of a good standard, breakfast was good.

The staff made it, thank you

We have re booked for November and December.",5,2021,09,26
125,Nice hotel,"We booked St Martin's Lane primarily for its convenient location.   But the hotel was generally very good with a slick appearance and feel.   The deluxe room was a nice size (but I suspect the standard rooms would be a little small) and reasonably well equipped.  The multicolour mood lighting was nice and unexpected, though not strictly necessary.   The disappointment was the breakfast with both food and coffee only lukewarm when served to us.",4,2021,09,25
125,Great hotel! Highly recommend!¬†,"Great hotel! Highly recommend!¬†

Location is super just in the middle of many attractions and lots of restaurants. 5 min from Covent garden.

Hotel design is brilliant and it shows where ever you look.

Room are super convenient with all you need for a perfect stay.

Most appreciated is the service!¬† Stuff is fully tuned to the guests needs, twice a day cleaning at highest level.

Last but not least- Great breakfast!

We will sure be back!¬†

Very friendly welcoming staff.
Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2021,09,13
125,Lovely hotel,"I was in London from August 29 thru September 4. I chose this hotel because of the location and it was on the American Express list of preferred hotels. First, the service was excellent. Staff was very accommodating and were quick to respond to all of my requests and needs. The hotel is very well located to shops, restaurants, subway stations, Covent Garden, Chinatown, Trafalgar Square. Rooms were cleaned and checked daily. We did have a few issues, but they were addressed very quickly. We received complimentary goodies from the staff to say ""Thank You"" for staying with us. That was totally unexpected, and greatly appreciated. Overall, wonderful experience at the hotel, and when I return to London, this is where I will be staying.",5,2021,09,07
125,Fantastic,"There was nothing to dislike about this place from location to staff everything was amazing
We were given a room with a view and a complimentary bottle of fizz as it was our wedding anniversary 
The breakfast was lovely too
The bed was so comfortable and the rooms were cleaned twice a day",5,2021,09,04
125,Great Location,"I booked this hotel as we had tickets for Hairspray and the theatre is a few doors away.

Having looked at other hotels, I chose this one because it had a car park.  Unfortunately, thanks to protestors, we couldn‚Äôt get the car near the hotel and had to find an NCP nearby. 

I used my google maps to find the hotel and would have walked straight past it if it wasn‚Äôt for my phone telling me we had arrived.  There is no signage on the hotel, which was a bit annoying. 

On arrival, we were greeted my friendly staff and our room was ready so that was a bonus.

The rooms and the hotel itself are very modern and minimalist.  It reminded me of a Miami hotel.  If you want a typically British hotel, this isn‚Äôt it.  However, it was clean and the beds were comfortable.

The location is great and in walking distance of many areas.  There are plenty of restaurants and Theatre‚Äôs in the area.

Overall, it is a nice hotel and my husband said he would stay there again, which is something he doesn‚Äôt say often! I personally like a more cosy hotel.",4,2021,08,31
125,5 star rooms but 3 star customer service,"We booked this hotel as a treat for our sons 21st birthday. We booked two rooms a loft double double and a deluxe king size room. We had considered other five star hotels but weaved the location and size of rooms on offer. Check in was 3pm so when we arrived at 1pm we didn‚Äôt expect our rooms to be ready. We were told they would be ready by 3pm and so we left our luggage at concierge and went shopping. We returned at 3.05 as we were due to go out and needed to freshen up. We were then told our rooms were still not ready. We expressed our concern that we had paid for two rooms from 3pm - 12pm the next day and we were then told it would be 15 min and to go enjoy a complimentary drink in the bar and they would come and get us in 15min. Anyway the bar was fairly quiet but the drinks we ordered took 30min to arrive   Needless to say no one came to give us our room keys so at 4pm we went back to reception to find than only one room was ready. We had fo make do as we were due to go out so we all went to the one room to freshen up. We were told that they had been fully booked the night before and were short staffed the next day. However it‚Äôs poor when you pay a significant amount of money for the rooms and it was ruining the weekend celebrations for our son. Surely if you are fully booked you make staffing provisions plus when you know that the customer is now in the vicinity you make sure their rooms are rushed through so not to disappoint. In the end we didn‚Äôt get the room till 6.30 as we had to go out and come back later. For a five star hotel you expect a five star service and this was sadly lacking. I wish we had booked one of the other hotels in the area. On the plus side.when we did get our rooms they were well equipped, modern and very comfortable beds.  Breakfast was slow but nice. The cappuccinos were lukewarm which made me think it had been sat for a while before they brought it to us. If you don‚Äôt care so much for service but want a beautiful big room In a great location this is your hotel. But if like us you want to feel valued as a customer and get treated well then I think there are better options available to you.",3,2021,08,30
125,Belated anniversary night away absolutely perfect,"Arrived at the hotel to spend night in the West End. Great location for the theatres. Unfortunately our room was not ready on arrival but manager arranged complimentary drink. Room very clean and spacious.
Staff were very helpful and so friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious. Highly recommended. Car park just behind hotel with a short walk to front entrance. Approx cost ¬£45 per 24 hours.",4,2021,08,30
125,"Good, but slightly disappointed","I booked this hotel as a 40th birthday treat for my husband. As I couldn‚Äôt leave work early, and wanted it to be a surprise, I didn‚Äôt add his name to the booking. I called on check in day and had to add his name to the booking so he could check in. The staff kindly obliged and facilitated this. They kindly asked if it was a special occasion and I said a 40th birthday, so without expectation they kindly offered a small gift in the room. 

Apparently, it was attempted to be delivered when we were out but we had the do not disturb sign on. A note was pushed under the door to say please contact reception. My husband asked reception on our return, and was told by rather abruptly that there was nothing ‚Äòon the system‚Äô without anyone actually checking the system. He found the situation a bit embarrassing like he was ‚Äòout for a freebie‚Äô so we didn‚Äôt ask again.

On checkout, when asked if everything was ok with our stay, I mentioned the card in our room, the guy checked the system and said ‚Äòas yes, we tried to deliver you a celebration basket‚Äô.

Clearly, the lady didn‚Äôt check the system, the moment/event had past, and it was all a bit awkward, embarrassing and ultimately disappointing. 

The moral of the story I guess is don‚Äôt offer false promises or goodwill that can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt be delivered. 

The rooms are pleasant, spotlessly clean, the beds divine, and the breakfast comprehensive and delicious. But I remain annoyed that our ‚Äòspecial occasion‚Äô wasn‚Äôt deemed as special as others within these reviews. 

Not sure I‚Äôd return.",4,2021,08,30
125,"Staff and location are wonderful, but space for improvement to justify the rates","The young front desk staff makes the hotel a place to stay: all are friendly, helpful and very pleasant. The location is in the heart of everything, but be ready for noise at night with party crowds in the area and insulation not that good.  The rooms are extra clean and decent size, evening room service is routinely done. Breakfast is instead terrible: slow service, poor choice, ridiculous buffet: definitely not a 4 stars service and not worth the money. The amenities in the rooms are also poor: relatively small TV , no digital options like Netflix, low quality furniture, extra small mini fridge, The printer supposedly available for the guests is permanently ‚Äúout of order‚Äù and staff will offer to email and print through front desk. We had a very nice time, especially thanks to the staff, but the hotel is not worth the money they charge.",4,2021,08,27
125,"Great service, delicious cocktails!","Spent a lovely couple of hours out on the terrace of the Den bar, drinking delicious cocktails and eating snacks served very efficiently by our charming waitress, Juliana. A great place to visit on a sunny evening!",5,2021,08,25
125,"Amazing hotel, ready to book again. ","Just got back from a long weekend in London. Absolutely perfect hotel, no a single fault. We had a room with a garden and it was a great addition with a unique experience. Breakfast was great with a wide range of meals to choose from. Fernando in reception gave us a great welcome, and even gave us a bottle of prosecco as it was a birthday celebration. Nice touch. There are many hotels to choose from in London and especially in this area which is so local to convert garden the theater and Oxford Street and we would 100% choose this hotel again. 

Biggest compliment I can give the hotel is that we will see them again soon. ",5,2021,08,23

125,A real gem in the heart of theatreland!,"Such a beautiful and welcoming hotel! My husband and I decided to visit London for the first time since everything has opened up again, we wanted to be central to the activities we enjoy to avoid too many tube or cab journeys. 

The hotel was easy to book, with great rates. The welcome was super friendly and check in was swift. The room was light, airy and had fantastic facilities and mini bar.

It was super clean, the bed was comfortable too! 

The breakfast selection was varied and absolutely gorgeous, 

A really wonderful stay, we will be back!",5,2021,08,12
125,Great hotel,"We stayed for one night celebrating our wedding anniversary. Paola on Reception is wonderful. She gave us a great welcome and ensured our anniversary was celebrated in style with a bottle of champagne! The room we had was quiet, immaculately clean and had fabulous views across to the Eye, Big Ben and beyond. Amazing location and reasonably priced given this location.Staff in the Den and on room service could learn some better social skills - but everyone else was so lovely. Really recommend .",5,2021,08,11
125,Briliant,"We visited for two nights and had a great stay.
It felt like a luxurious hotel, the smell is amazing! The staff were so friendly, who could not do enough for you, especially Phil, fantastic service!
Our room was clean, tidy and airy. The beds were very comfortable.
We were treated to a complimentary bottle of fizz for our stay due to it being for my mums 60th birthday.
The location above anything else, is fantastic, so central for everything and most of the main attractions are in walking distance which was perfect! We watched Hairspray during our stay which was literally about five doors down from the hotel.
We will absolutely be returning and would recommend to anyone.",5,2021,08,10
125,Vicky at the Den was so most hospitable host! Thankyou!,"Visited the Den for a bridal shower afternoon tea. 3 members of our party were vegan, and the vegan afternoon tea selection was one of the best we‚Äôve experienced! Vicky was an excellent host; so friendly and extremely attentive! Thankyou Vicky for making our experience so great!",5,2021,08,08
125,"Great location, reasonable value, very clean, plan to stay again","We stayed in late July, 2 rooms, 2 adults, 2 kids. Check in was smooth, rooms were ready early. Kids loved being able to play with the colour ambience of the room (It's still a step above smart bulbs at home, though not by much).  The beds are comfortable, room temperature control works well, bathroom clean and pressure great, coffee and tea easy to set up....so basics all more than covered in a very engaging design and good use of space.

The location is perfect, in addition to the attractions of London, if you need something there is the fair size Covent Garden Tesco within 3 minutes walk. I didn't feel the hotel is expensive for what it is and there are cheaper alternatives nearby. The breakfast was great quality and the service was attentive but not overbearing. They were able to cook food separately and cater for severe allergies (we'd checked beforehand).  It was all good. In contrast to the unfortunate experience of another recent reviewer, I would never have considered any security risk as notable.

I remember this hotel 15 years ago as a leading avant garde business hotel and ate at Asia de Cuba a few times when 'fusion' was first on corporate entertainment bucket lists. I missed the large eyeballs which stared at you from the lift TV screens as you went up to the rooms.  Knowing that is what it used to be, I am very impressed they managed to keep the clean lines it used to have, the general cleanliness and the whimsical tone - it felt superbly well maintained compared to many similar places which had to reinvent themselves in other cities. I feel like they have have bought good solid materials back in the day,  made good design choices and it has lasted well. ..Which is a funny thing to think about a hotel lobby full of sculptures of giant noses and whatnot.",5,2021,08,07
125,Worst hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had,"On first approach this does look like a lovely hotel but that‚Äôs as far as it goes for our experience with this hotel. Our hotel room was burgled whilst we were out during the day, with only staff having access to our room. The hotel felt they could justify our room being accessed x6 and we had cash, a bank card stolen and all our belongings pulled apart and rummaged through. There was no 5 star customer service throughout this ordeal, no genuine attempts at compensating us at all for our experiences and no initiation of attempts at making the situation better. To top off our already horrendous experience the hotel then re charge me for for my full stay including safety deposit 2 weeks after my stay clearing out my account. Again my experience with customer service was appalling and frustrating. I am disgusted by my experience with this ‚Äú5 star hotel‚Äù.",1,2021,07,31
125,Mid week stay,"A lovely stay , we visited for one night a Monday and booked a deluxe room . We arrived at midday and delighted  the room was ready early  . Really high cleaning standards throughout . The room was lovely and a great location in Covent Garden . We booked with breakfast too . The staff all really friendly and nothing was too much trouble . We will definitely stay again thank you .",5,2021,07,27
125,Mediocre,"Im not one to complain or write reviews but I‚Äôm writing this review on my last evening at this hotel as I am really disappointed. only one of the staff on the door is actually delivering the 5 star service, apart from that you may get the odd hello from the ladies behind the counter. The only positive about this hotel is the location. We are staying in a deluxe room and we both weren‚Äôt impressed the moment we walked through our door, I actually wanted to walk out and cancel the room but the missus didn‚Äôt want the drama. First off the room wasn‚Äôt ready when we tried to check in at 3, we were offered to sit in the den and have a drink whilst we waited at our expense of course! It took so long to get our drinks and bill that we had to leave the hotel to make a table reservation at 3:45 without checking into our room. The room is very basic and small, a lot of wasted space. There is no main light in the bedroom area just some brightly coloured leds around the bed and a small chandelier in one corner. The tv kept freezing and turning on and off. The view from the window is obstructed by the blinds in the actual glass so you cant actually see through clearly unless you‚Äôve got ya face up against the glass. The sink in the bathroom had no thought go into it at all, can barely fit your hands under it and if ya do manage too all of the water runs down the back of the sink as it‚Äôs not attached to the wall. Overall I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone else. You can get a lot more for your money elsewhere. Don‚Äôt fall for the ‚Äú5 star‚Äù.",2,2021,07,26
125,Fab,Amazing hotel.    Fernando called the day before and upgraded the room as it was my husband‚Äôs 50th birthday.    Great customer service.  Thank you.   Would completely recommend!  Hotel clean a d quirky.   Great location,5,2021,07,24
125,Fabulous hotel near covent garden ,"We've just had a three night stay at St Martin's to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday and it was a great choice. Central location that's handy for all the main attractions, and yet we didn't get disturbed by noise as we slept. Our double x 2 bedroom was really well equipped. Really well maintained and loved the funky lights. Good to have hairdryer, iron, ironing board, coffee machine etc. Just missing instant coffee and sugar (due to covid - we were told on check in but a hassle to ask for it so we went without). We struggled with the TV, not sure how to get it working at times. It was a bit temperamental. Fully stocked mini bar but we didn't use that. 

The bathroom was immaculate, although the taps were hard to turn off. We had lovely fluffy towels and plenty of shampoo/conditioner/body wash etc.

The room was cleaned, to a very high standard, and restocked every day.

I did mention it was my daughters 21st when I booked. Would have been nice for it to be acknowledged, and it wasn't, but only a small point.

All the staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2021,07,16
125,Afternoon Tea at The Den - exceptional,"Nothing was too much trouble for Vicky our waitress, she thoroughly spoilt us when we had afternoon tea at The Den.

125,Exceptional!,"We stayed as a group of 10, across 5 double rooms for a Birthday weekend celebration. Everything about our stay was perfect. The staff were all so helpful, friendly and polite.

Spotlessly clean. Perfect location. 5 stars all round.",5,2021,07,04
125,Fabulous,Fantastic service as always all the staff here are friendly and helpful and this is why we return. Afternoon tea in the Den is delicious and cocktails in the blind spot are spot on!

We will return as soon as we are able to. 
Highly recommended.",5,2021,06,30
125,"Brilliant hotel, loved it ","I think firstly just to call out that the amazing service in the hotel really sets it apart from the others. Right away from check in, the staff were super helpful and friendly. This continued throughout the hotel stay and made it wonderful. Even the lady managing the entry into the hotel bar on Saturday night was just such a lovely lady. 
Aside from this, our room was spotlessly clean and just what we wanted. Location couldn‚Äôt be better and breakfast great too!! Thank you so much. An unexpected delight. ",5,2021,06,28
125,THE PERFECT HOTEL,"The hotel is in the perfect location.All the staff were helpful and friendly.We stayed in a double double room which was spotlessly clean The beds were very comfortable and I slept better than for a long time.
Breakfast was excellent.We could have anything we wanted.
We enjoyed our stay so much we have booked to return next month.",5,2021,06,21
125,Great quality hotel!,"I really loved it here. I was initially worried that it would be noisy because of the location, but actually it was fine. Also really easy to get around from here. We stayed on a Friday night so there was a bit of bustle in the evening but nothing disruptive.
We were in room 305 and the room was lovely. I like that there‚Äôs a corridor when you open the door so there‚Äôs no chance of being caught in bed by room service or anything if you forget to lock the door. Ok view on the 3rd floor (mainly just other buildings tbh,) I would pick a higher floor if you want full view of the city.
I picked a room with a bath and did not regret it. The one thing I wasn‚Äôt a fan of were the bathroom taps; they look cool but they‚Äôre really hard to turn when your hands are wet. There were a fair amount of channels on the tv in the room but no guide to see what‚Äôs on - fortunately these days there‚Äôs nothing you can‚Äôt google. 
Not a lot of storage space for clothes - not sure where you‚Äôd put your things if you were staying more than one night. 
Breakfast was nice, I think it was from 8 to 10:30am? Something like that. I was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt be a poorly thrown together continental and it wasn‚Äôt! I had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs on toast with a hot chocolate. It was nice, deffo worth paying for breakfast when booking. 
Also worth being aware that there is a 100GBP per night mandatory deposit to pay on arrival. I got the money back in 2-3 days.",5,2021,06,15
125,The best hotel near Covent Garden,"Fantastic hotel, rooms are all spotless - quick check-in and a lovely stay. Highly recommended, as in a great location for Covent Garden/Leicester Square. Stayed here a number of times and its always great.",5,2021,06,15
125,Weekend stay with wife,"We stayed here over the first weekend following the lockdown easing in May.  It‚Äôs definitely a good place for couples; great location,, nice and clean room., friendly staff etc. 
Perfect to escape for a weekend but  I wouldn‚Äôt stay here longer than couple nights due to limited storage available - not sure where you could keep your clothes if would be staying for a week. 
Overall it was a enjoyable stay, we had only one issue which was caused by staff promising extras due to my wife celebrating her birthday during our stay. On check in I was informed that there will be a surprise (a lot of stuff was mentioned) waiting for her in the room - unfortunately my wife overheard the conversation and was then disappointed as there was nothing there. For avoidance of any doubt I would never expect or complaint about potential extras not being in place but if you know that there may be a problem with delivering your promise please don‚Äôt make then to your guests. Better to be surprised than disappointed. This is the only reason for a 4 star review - I wanted to make it a 3 star but the exceptional service upon check out which was delivered by Fernando from front desk made me change my mind.",4,2021,06,15
125,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"Stayed in a very comfortable garden room for four nights. Great, large king bed, spacious shower room with ample storage, hanging space, safe and everything you would expect for this level of accommodation

Superbly situated for everything West End, wonderful staff both at the front desk, bar and breakfast. Breakfast was ample with a good choice

Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again soon

125,Superb Service & a Perfectly Quiet Suite & Central Location,We arrived to a great start having taken advantage of the Spring for a Suite offer receiving an upgrade from a double double to two fabulous interconnecting rooms!! There was a huge amount of space for a central London location. Complimentary champagne arrived just as we came back from the theatre which I hadn't realised was part of the offer. The service was exemplary with house keeping discreetly keeping the room tip top. Room service breakfast was delicious. You always expect very comfortable beds in a 5 star well I had the best sleep in a while. Looking forward to booking again soon. ,5,2021,06,01
125,Great value and service,Excellent hotel and consistent service. Late bar is a must to visit. Great location for central london and soho. A short walk to the river or to China town. If it‚Äôs dry the upgrade to a garden room is fun. Good breakfast also. 100% recommend reliable every time,5,2021,05,30
125,Not a 5 star,"Currently lying in bed in room 128 unable to sleep due to a blocked drain in the bathroom that is making the most annoying sound. Crossing my fingers it doesn‚Äôt wake my toddler. 

Great location but other than that this hotel is far from what we have experienced in other 5 star hotels in London. No greeting upon arrival - its these small gestures that make a hotel a 5 star. 

Having read the other reviews I would agree that no info was given regarding hotel amenities and breakfast times etc.

Room is ok and basic. Nice turndown service but experienced better at the Sanderson where they lit candles and left chocolates.",3,2021,05,22
125,Good Experience,"We stayed there for 2 nights. Nice and comfortable stay with daily cleanup. The room was great and quiet, bed very comfortable .Very good breakfast  with attentive service. The concierge did help with restaurants reservations , very nice and helpfull staff. We definitely come back.",5,2021,01,28
125,"Lovely hotel, great location, amazing staff","A very smart well designed hotel with some interesting and fun design features. From the moment you step through the door you‚Äôre made to feel welcome, all the the staff were friendly and warm. For me this is what makes a good hotel great.
The room was comfortable and spacious, the bed so comfortable it was tempting to stay in all day.
The food was pretty great too, we used room service a couple of times and they went out of their way to accommodate our needs.",5,2020,11,03
125,Wonderful Stylish But Peaceful Hotel In The Center Of It All,"Fabulous hotel with incredible service, great food, the best beds and linens we've slept in (those pillows ...) and great amenities. We stayed the first week they'd been open since the COVID shut down, and the staff were just fabulous. Great food recommendations and service. Highly recommended",5,2020,10,09
125,Beautiful Hotel - lovely reception area and bars / dining options.,"Great clean and tidy rooms - loved our little garden area / balcony.
Really liked the bathroom furniture and powerful shower.
Very friendly staff 
Loved the art in the side bar also 
Would definitely recommend and hope to return - thank you ",5,2020,03,16
125,IN THE NAME OF EXCELLENT FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE VISIT THE MAIN RESTAURANT OF ST MARTINS LANE HOTEL.,"I was on late lunch business meeting when I did visit the St Martin's Hotel.
What can I say I don't I have the words to describe the food and relaxed lovely environment.

Ok the food was excellent I had duck red curry and crab fried rice and it was amazing.  I believe my business partner had classic Tuna steak.

I will go back if I am to have future meetings near the city.

Loved it and totally amazing.",5,2020,03,09
125,Multiple visits,"I think we must have visited St Martins Lane for about 6-7 times. It‚Äôs part of the Sbe Hotels (Sanderson, Mondrian - in LA, New York, etc) and it‚Äôs one of my fav 5* hotels in London due to its location. Walking distance to Charring Cross, Soho, China Town, Leicester Square,Regent Street, theatres, as I said, very conveniently located! Very friendly staff, excellent breakfast choices, Blind spot bar is a must! ü§ùüçπ",5,2020,03,03
125,Don't Hesitate to Book,"My stay at the St Martins Lane last week was fantastic. The hotel grounds were nice, the spotless ""basic"" room was anything but (comfortable bed, huge tub, good soundproofing, convenient tech details throughout), and the location was great just off of Leicester Square. A special shout-out to Nell, who was perhaps the warmest host anywhere in London.",5,2020,03,02
125,Good quality,"We stayed 1 night before travelling to Sri Lanka for our honeymoon. A bit of a hassle to get to/from both Gatwick and Heathrow. Rooms small but nice, good quality bed. Strong smell in hallways (on purpose). Great selection of ammenities to buy if necessary. Breakfast nice although a bit pricey. Awesome location! Complimentary use of gym next door, loved it (I am a gym rat ;)) Stayed in room 231, no noise from outside.

Only negative: too little information given from reception upon arrival. Had to go back and ask for breakfast time etc. Wanted to use the gym @ 8 am Sunday, doorman was puzzled they had not told us opening hours from 10 am during weekend (especially as we specified we wanted to use it).

A bit pricey overall, would maybe stay again for a London weekend of sightseeing.",4,2020,03,01
125,"Nice hotel, but not special ","We stayed just one night, on the plus side, the hotel was clean and modern, on the minus side the room felt rather sterile.   Not that it lacked amenities, but it was soulless. 

The bed though was absolutely super very comfortable.   The bathroom was, like the bedroom clean, but just efficient, not a joy, if you get what I mean.

The stay was pleasant but not memorable.",3,2020,02,25
125,Faultless and an incredibly comfy bed!!,"Short review just to say ... what a super hotel, great rooms, spotlessly clean... an epically comfortable bed and gorgeous staff. 
I have not been to this hotel for some ten years and I‚Äôm so glad to have returned. A reasonable rack rate for a Sunday was well worth staying here. Thanks for having us!",5,2020,02,24
125,Nitery Restaurant disappointing ,"I was excited to visit, I have Gizzi Erskine cook books, the marketing hype delivers but the restaurant does not! Three items on the menu were unavailable - who can‚Äôt get hold of oysters in London, in February? Soggy undercooked shoe string fries with average burger and a tiny half roast chicken, followed by lovely lemon meringue but served icy cold. Lacklustre room and lacklustre staff. ¬£71 for Saturday lunch finished in less than an hour - I chose not to pay the 15% service charge. We did give feedback to the two managers on duty, let‚Äôs hope things improve as there are still almost 3 months of this pop-up to run. For a truly amazing lunch in London, 3 courses and champagne for ¬£39 pp, try Roux at the Landau, but give the Nitery a miss! ",1,2020,02,22
125,Pretends to greatness,"Exterior - zero stars -not even a name to tell you you've found the right place. If the taxi driver hadn't known, we wouldn't have found it.
Reception staff 5 star, great, quick, helpful,
Room - stylish and modern, bed comfortable, sound insulation - zero. Not only was I woken up by drunks outside in the street at ground level (which doesnt happen in Premier inns!) but by every alarm within a couple of rooms of me. I could here iPhones going off at 8 am, 8.15 above, below and in neighbouring rooms. Poor at this price.
Restaurant 0 stars - apalling menu - non of our party could eat here. Need to learn what real people actually eat. Not everybody wants fussy food, just quality, simple, well cooked - back to school.
Bar - this is where they really lose marks! Worst hotel bar I have ever been in (and that is an accolade!) Aggressive woman asks if we have a reservation. For a bar? Who do they think they are? Shoves into an uncomfortable location. It's too loud. Its too dark (at 5.30???)  gives us a menu. Its a bar! Wine - none! Beer - None. Expensive vile cocktails, plenty. G&T ¬£13. Really? Do we look stupid? 
I've stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and never seen a restaurant and bar that were so out of touch.",2,2020,02,21
125,This place is a gem!!,"In a word, Excellent! After my initial stay at the St Martins Lane Hotel I am confident that I or my partner will not look anywhere else for accommodations in London. The hotel is meticulously maintained both in general areas and the suites themselves. The location is near all the major attractions without being in the center of them, which I find fantastic as I can sleep without the hearing the activities on the street at all hours of the night. 

The staff is incredible, they are welcoming, knowledgeable and most importantly friendly. Ahmett the doorman greets me upon entry and exit of the hotel that makes me feel like a valued guest. The staff behind the desk and the manager Giuseppe are great as well. St Martins Lane has become a home away from home for us and I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.",5,2020,02,18
125,Style & Substance in the heart of London!,"Great boutique hotel in a superb London location! Conveniently situated close to Covent Garden, Leicester & Trafalgar Squares, the theatre district and the Underground.   Super stylish, but warm and welcoming at the same time.  Staff is great, late night drinks in the hidden lobby bar are fab.... and afternoon tea or a cozy cocktail in the The Den is a must!   Definitely recommend for a fun getaway London style!",5,2020,02,11
125,Fab weekend stay,Our 4th stay and just as good as the others. Initially for 1 night and we had a great free room upgrade. Breakfast was very nice as was a drink in the hidden bar Sat pm. We then found ourselves stranded in London due to Storm Ciara and needing another nights stay. Staff were very helpful and sorted out a room at a good tariff with another free upgrade. We also had a great meal in the new concept restaurant The Nitery although there seemed to be a few teething problems in terms of timing for the food. Will definitely be back to stay again. ,5,2020,02,10
125,Great hotel for a weekend in London,"The St Martins Lane hotel really surpassed all my expectations on a recent 2 night stay. 
I‚Äôd originally booked as much for the location as anything else, with the hotel brilliantly positioned between Covent Garden, Leicester Square & Trafalgar Square and perfect for exploring central London on foot. 
Where the hotel impressed was with the friendliness of the staff, who couldn‚Äôt do enough to help, and the quality of the room, which was super comfortable and with all the mod cons you could wish for, and a nice view even from the 4th floor of the rooftops of London and the London Eye. Bathroom was also great with a high powered walk-in shower. 
The hotel has a cool vibe (including different colour lights you can select around the bed!) but backs that up with top quality service. 
Breakfast in the restaurant was tasty, although it felt a touch expensive, and that was one area where the service was slow and a little disappointing. That aside, really enjoyed staying at the St Martins Lane hotel, would return and would certainly recommend. 
",5,2020,02,10
125,Great Hotel in central london,"My wife and I spent 5 nights at this hotel to celebrate her 30th birthday. 

The hotel is centrally located near theaters, dining places, Covent Gardens, SoHo and what not. Everything is within a walking distance or few stations using the underground. 

The hotel has great service and the receptionists are extremely nice, accepting and helpful, especially Paula who booked us in.

The breakfast is great and has a lot of choice.
We stayed on the 5th floor and it was very quiet and a nice corner room with view. 

We will definitely come back!",5,2020,02,07
125,Great hotel in a great location,"The proerty is not budget accommodation, and there is a general hipster feel to the hotel, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on you. As hundreds of past guests have attested to, it is in a very strategic location in the covent garden area, ideal for the first time visitor to London. It is exceptionally clean,  and the Nice deluxe room we got had this mood lighting system that seemed ‚ÄúJapanese-love-hotel-like‚Äù at first (not that I‚Äôve been to one...) but which we eventually began to appreciate. The Roomy bathroom had separate toilet & shower areas and the hot water was almost instantaneous so no waiting. I also liked the friendly and unobtrusive staff who are there when you need them and are not hovering around you when you do not. We actually stayed here for 8 nights, I will somewhat miss this hotel. ",4,2020,02,06
125,Fantastic hotel and staff,This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel .. the location is amazing for anything you may want to see or do. Staff are so helpful and I have to give a big shout out to the guys on the door who are super lovely and helpful with everything from luggage to hailing taxis and more ... a special thank you to Ahmet who went the Extra mile .. literally.. to get us a taxi due to road closures during Chinese New Year celebrations. We will definitely be back!! Don‚Äôt hesitate in booking this hotel. ,5,2020,01,26
125,Fantastic overnight stay ,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay in St Martin‚Äôs Lane. Our room was beautiful overlooking rooftops of London. We were celebrating my birthday and we were very grateful for the kind gesture of the hotel. So clean and modern and fantastic location close to Covent Garden. Friendly service at front desk too. Thanks again! We will be back. ,5,2020,01,26
125,Fun place to stay,"Quick stay in LHR for a business trip. Know the Morgan‚Äôs group and have stayed with in their group in several properties. Great service and quality accommodation in modern setting. Friendly staff , will be back.",4,2020,01,19
125,Good hotel in the center of london lacking the 5star grandeur,"Stayed there for 3nights. Comfortable stay with daily cleanup of rooms. 

My universal adapter stopped working they had a spare in the room and were kind enough to come and help me find it.

Had a weird experience.. the housekeeping had put all the garbage into a bag but didn't pick it from the room.

Also they had a deposit of 300¬£ for which I had to follow up to check the status of refund and its been a month still waiting for the same.

The concierge did help with entry ticket booking for tower of London and more .",4,2020,01,15
125,Fantastic hotel ,"We have just checked out after a lovely weekend for my husbands forthcoming 40th birthday! Hotel staff could not have been nicer and everything about the hotel was fantastic.  We were treated to an upgraded room, bottle of prosecco and breakfast all to say happy birthday! A truly amazing hotel. The room was great, bed very comfortable and room was quiet which in such a busy area was welcomed. Thank you very much, we will be back. ",5,2020,01,12
125,Simply great,"Always spotlessly clean. Comfortable beds, great water pressure in showers, excellent food and well presented rooms. Good WiFi. Staff are without exception friendly, professional and extremely accommodating. Complementary use of Gymbox next door is really great. Always sure of a warm welcome from Amet on the door and nothing is too much trouble for any of the folk at reception. Highly recommend.",5,2020,01,10
125,New Years Eve Special,"We selected this hotel for their new year's eve special with a room with a view of the fireworks, canapes and a bottle of champagne before midnight, and brunch the next day.The hitel staff was friendly and helpful, they stired our bags early in the day before our check in so we didn't have to carry them all over the city. Our room and the main areas were clean and tidy, but super modern style so not for everyone. Excellent location near tube stops, tons of restaurants and many Covent Garden theaters. The down sides are the rooms have terrible sound proofing so we could hear people in the next room, the hallways and even down on the street (from on the 6th floor). Adfitionally our view of the fireworks was obstructed due to the permanent blinds between the glass panes in the room, none of the hitel staff could help us adjust them so we had a clear view, it was frustrating because that is what we paid for, but the staff did try to assist.",4,2020,01,09
125,Service oriented hotel,The location of this hotel is great! Lots of places to eat near the hotel and walkable to Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. Best thing for me were the staff who try very hard to accommodate the needs of their clients.,4,2020,01,08
125,The perfect location for stay in London for a week end,"i spent 3 nights in this hotel located in the heart of west end,very very close to Trafalgar square,and a large attractions in centre London,nice room,very comfortable king size bedroom and helpfull and nice staff.
I will be back for sure",5,2020,01,07
125,Perfect location,"Perfect location, a bit expensive.
Interior design will soon need to be refreshed ( specially corridors) but it‚Äôs a nice place after all.
Staff is kind, the queen is not so far, fireworks are close too (buy a ticket) ... all good, gentlemens",5,2020,01,06
125,Fantastic,"Arrived early, but told our room was ready and we could check into it straight away. Beautiful modern loft room . Lovely and clean with everything you need. Complimentary  chocolates and water bought to the room later in the evening.I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful and loved my stay here. It was a special treat but will try and make it back here one day....oh and the beds are really comfortable.",5,2020,01,05
125,"Essential, well finished and wonderful position","Receptionist are always available and ready to help. Rooms are very clean with an essential furniture. Spacious bathroom by Philippe Stark. In the room there is a lighting system which allows a sort of chromotherapy. Our room was very quiet facing a secondary street. Really great location, few meters from Trafalgar Square.",4,2019,12,31
125,Birthday Bottomless Brunch,"We booked this as a family group of 8 very last minute not having heard of the place. A birthday celebration I can not recommend it enough.
So chic, smooth yet so friendly - what a gem just a couple of minutes from Leicester Square.
The menu offered a wide range of suggestions. Our favourite was ‚ÄòBreakfast in the Fields‚Äô. And the brunch truly was generously bottomless. At ¬£35 for the set menu it was fantastic value for money.
All the staff were friendly and very attentive. Agnes served our table with quiet efficiency and a smile. Nothing was too much trouble. Bart made up a mean personalised Bloody Mary. 
I would love to spend a night in the hotel next time. It would make a great weekend base for theatre land and all things London. And then experience the brunch again! 
Would highly recommend.",5,2019,12,30
125,Nice unique- needs someting to keep standards,"I have been visiting this hotel since early last decade and i always felt its unique. After so many years it just remains the same, meaning it needs something to improve. Hotel staff is ok, although at the reception only one girl (the one with curly hair) knows what she is doing efficiently and fast. The rest of people wait for her to decide. The room service is really cool, nice pizza and fast service. The asia de cuba reataurant on ground floor has left apparently few years now and the one now operating is of basic standard. Nothing special. The hotel lost its philip stark glamour honestly, partly cos of that. The wifi is fine everywhere. Prices are ok for london standards. Although i left the hotel few days ago, payment of my bill is not yet executed and the whole amount is still blocked on my card, not cleared yet. I wonder how many days it takes them, while that should be done automatic. The guys at the entrance never open the door for a guest, i am sorry they just hang around saying hallo. I feel there is no management guidance as to that, as well as to the efficiency of the reception. I like the hotel and i shall keep visiting, but having in mind the competition in london and the large number of similar hotels, i advice that they people running the business should do something about it prior to being too late. Small details make the difference sometimes. I dont expect anyone to open my door, but when someone does so at 6am on my way to the airport holding luggages, i do appreciate that. ",4,2019,12,29
125,Great location and nice hotel,"Really handy location but rooms are cramp and small - we had a garden suite which wasn‚Äôt much bigger. Unfortunately our can hear people coughing in the adjoining rooms so the build quality isn‚Äôt where it should be.

Even as guests you are expected to book a table at the bar which seems odd ",3,2019,12,22
125,Low value for high cost ,"Rooms are for smoking, hence you can get a smelly room.

Service is in the low-end level. 

Room plan is mediocre and lighting in the room was done without pre thinking.

Breakfast wasn't worth the money.

Location is the only pros. 

All in all, very disappointing experience would not recommend it, the city as much more better offers in this range of rates. 
",1,2019,12,12
125,Always a pleasure staying here!,"I always try and stay here when visiting London for business or pleasure. The staff are friendly & helpful, the rooms are spacious & the beds are super comfy.
Breakfast was good, with a varied selection of hot & cold offerings.
My only gripe was that their cocktail bar was hosting a private event & the service at the other bar was non existent. It‚Äôs a bit of a joke to be then charged for service, when you are having to go to the bar to get the drinks.",5,2019,12,06
125,Compact but very Chic,"The hotel is very sleek and modern and the staff were awesome! I got in at 9am after a red eye from the US and the front desk staff were so accommodating and got me my room right away and even helped me sort my room service breakfast order as well as lending me an umbrella for the day - super helpful when its pouring and you didn't bring one! The downsides are that this is a very compact hotel and the rooms are a little tight, beautiful but tight! I also must have chosen a bad night as there was very loud music coming from somewhere until the early morning but likely not the hotel's fault.",4,2019,12,05
125,Nice but could be better.,"Very comfortable and elegant stay, not to mention the perfect location. Staff is professional but impersonal. The hotel doesn't have a comfortable area open for residents to sit and relax at any point in time. The tea room is great but has specific opening hours and also external guests which makes it partially convenient. The staff at the door entrance are great. The blinds in the rooms are not possible to remove which deteriorates the feeling of the nice view.",4,2019,12,03
125,beware another booking website,beware a website called guest reservations that looks like the hotels own website....appears to charge the same fees then adds over 50% more for service and tax....this hotel is fabulous and i recommend it to you....but i was tricked by using google search and then thinking i was booking at the normal rates...then you receive an email after you have booked informing you that you have also been charged for tax recovery and service,5,2019,12,02
125,"Breathless, but not in an exciting way",This hotel is buzzy but breathless. It feels as if their air conditioning pumps around stale air and leaves an unpleasant odour. It was difficult to sleep because of the stuffiness of room and indeed the corridors. Music is loud and at times overpowering and anything but relaxing.,3,2019,12,01
125,Great hotel but...,Great hotel with great rooms but.... if you‚Äôre looking for a hotel that has a bar to unwind at the end of the day this is not the hotel for you.  The bar is a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù bar and actually more of a lounge.  It‚Äôs lounge seating only.  There is no actual bar seating for a casual drink. ,3,2019,11,22
125,A Xmas shopping treat from a friend,Sorry but all I can say is fur coat and no nickers! The right hand needs to inform the left hand what's going on! Our friend treated us to a 2 night stay breakfast included! the first thing was the dirty bathroom housekeeper came tryed to fob us off with excuses stains on floor etc but once cleaner was called the said stains miraculously disappeared next fire alarm went off at midnight no phone call or door knock to explain or put mind at rest! Heating was off engineer was called and that was repaired next was trying to check out and being told we owed ¬£82 for our second mornings breakfast explained and showed paperwork that breakfast was already paid for yes says the receptionist I can see that on my screen but there's an 82 pound bill for breakfast this morning! After a phone call to restaurant (10 meters away) the receptionist says as if she's doing us a favour OK I will take that charge off there's nothing to pay!!!!! There was 3 people that stood out as exceptionally good staff vicky in the restaurant and the consierge / doormen but apart from that all I can say is ime glad to be home for a rest phew!,3,2019,11,13
125,Afternoon tea,Excellent afternoon tea lots of food and unlimited tea in a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The waitress Michelle was very helpful and nothing was to much trouble. A great value nice central location for afternoon tea.,5,2019,11,11
125,Birthday bliss,"It was my husband‚Äôs 40th birthday so we were spending the weekend in London. The St. Martins Lane Hotel was 10/10 no actually 11/10. From the moment we entered the reception we were made to feel special. The staff we encountered all went above and beyond to make our stay special. We explored The Blind Spot which was excellent too.( thank you for the birthday cake and champagne) Our room was beautiful and the attention to detail and thoughtfulness is second to none. An umbrella to borrow, toiletries for anything you had forgotten. Breakfast was a revelation. I seriously cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We will definitely return.",5,2019,11,10
125,High class service,"Spent a week in this hotel for business. The staff were 10/10 professional - at the front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar and also the backroom where we spent most of the day at meetings. They have a very cool interior and don‚Äôt forget to stop by the ‚Äúspeakeasy‚Äù type bar, where you get to at the pull of a golden hand :) unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get time to try the Gym Box which is included in the rate. Also, obviously the location is amazing: Covent Garden and Leicester Sq a coin toss away. Thank you! ",5,2019,11,09
125,Afternoon tea,"Lovely afternoon tea, unhurried and relaxing with plenty of choices of free flowing tea or coffee. Also a wide selection of alcohol.
The cakes were amazing and the staff very friendly and attentive. Lovely calming and comfortable area to eat after the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden Would highly recommend ",5,2019,11,08
125,Location! Location! Location!,"You can not beat the location of this hotel if your interest is being in the centre of the west end theatre district. Virtually every west end theatre is within 15 minutes walk or less. Covent Gardens is right around the corner. Multiple tube stations make easy access to the rest of London. National Portrait Gallery is just down the street, British Museum is a 20 minute walk. Restaurants galore from fastfood to chains to independent bistros to fine dining,

Oh and the hotel is very nice, the rooms are great and the service is superb!",5,2019,11,06
125,Great Hotel,"We can highly recommend St Martin‚Äôs Lane in London
We stayed at the hotel with our 2 teenage daughters for a long London weekend

The rooms are great , with plenty of space and the staff is very friendly and helpful

The hotel is very well placed with walking distance to Covent gardens , Regent street , London eye aso
So extremely easy to access all you want

Highly recommend ",5,2019,11,04
125,Good and Bad - St Martins Lane London,"Good:
- You really cannot beat the location.  In the heart of Covent Garden just steps from one of our favorite restaurants, Dishoom.  Easy walk to Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, and so many other sights.  Was so nice to be able to walk around and pop back to the hotel to drop off shopping bags or use the restroom.
- Staff were very polite and helpful.
- Lobby has a cool hip vibe and was a good central place for our friends to gather before going out.

Bad:
- One strange room feature is that there is no door for the bathroom which is fine if it's just my wife and I, but if you invite someone up for a minute then it's a bit strange when you need to use the restroom.
- For some reason the hallways on our room floor had a very overpowering potpourri smell.",5,2019,11,02
125,Visit to London,"Many times in London but first time in St Martins lane hotel.  Great location, friendly staff, amazing bed and pillows. Special thanks to concierge Diogo Coelho for some great tips and help with bookings!",5,2019,11,02
125,High standards continue!,"Second visit this year and the hotel remains a class act. Located just off Trafalgar Square don‚Äôt be put off by the outside look because on entry it‚Äôs a different ambience in a very good way! Customer service remains excellent throughout and continues to be of a highly consistent standard. Being very fortunate to have an upgrade and a drink in ‚ÄòThe Blind Spot‚Äô, within the hotel was a cracking bonus. Rooms, bed, cleanliness, breakfasts , communications , standard fare for hotels are second to none here and are the best we‚Äôve experienced in London , so highly recommended. The location for many of London‚Äôs things to do is spot on too. All in all a very enjoyable experience!",5,2019,11,02
125,Another Fabulous Stay - Staff Excellent as Always,"We brought our son into London for his birthday and once again chose to stay at St. Martin‚Äôs Lane.
Firstly, the location is amazing. So close to theatres, Chinatown, Covent Garden and Regent Street.
Staff are and always have been excellent. Friendly and professional. The breakfast staff couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating- thank you to Virginia and Agnes. 
Breakfast was very good by the way with a lovely buffet table - I was slightly nervous having read a few previous reviews but I needn‚Äôt have worried.
Room ( superior category so fairly low on their scale ) was spotless and housekeeping serviced the room very well indeed. Absolutely no complaints.
The guys on the front were as thoughtful and helpful as ever. It‚Äôs so lovely to see familiar faces even though we only get into London infrequently. They are observant -anticipating what you want before you ask sometimes! - and very kind.
I love coming back to this hotel having been in the hustle and bustle of London. It‚Äôs calming and friendly.
Lastly I cannot comprehend an earlier comment about a ‚Äòmusty‚Äô smell in the general hotel areas. It‚Äôs all down to personal taste I know, but the scent that permeates the hotel is gorgeous. I buy the candles and sprays they sell to use at home I like it so much.
Can‚Äôt wait to visit again.
Thanks to all for a lovely stay.

125,Expectations exceeded throughout!,"My wife & I stayed at St Martin's Lane Hotel for a weekend for our anniversary. 
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was an incredible experience.
For context the location of the hotel is remarkable; sandwiched between Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Leicester Square- could not have been better.
Reading some of the other reviews critical of the staff I am left wondering if I stayed in the same hotel as they did; the front desk, bar staff, waiters at breakfast all went out of their way to be helpful and facilitate as much as they could. Particular thanks go to  Michael Fitzgerald the concierge who really went above and beyond.
The hotel lives up to it's reputation as being a cool & stylish boutique hotel. There's much to enjoy looking at the decor and furnishings. The rooms are modern,light and airy with large windows and spotlessly clean.
Highly recommended!!",5,2019,10,21
125,Honest review,"Very nice hotel, the staff really nice, got my room and wasn‚Äôt a bath, but the room got changed quickly. Clean rooms, great location, great for couples, comfy bed, nice bed light, romantic, well worth staying there. Girlfriends birthday and was given a bottle of champagne and a cake, which was amazing! If you‚Äôre thinking of staying or booking for your partner then I highly recommend, can‚Äôt fault it! 

Only thing maybe is out the front if you look up, it need a little bit of painting you know but oh well

Also nice big bath, modern, big bathroom and rooms. Room had sky sports and movies too. Rooms can be nice and bright but also very dark with the curtains closed, bed lights can be changed to loads of colours but not red. 

But yeah great. I‚Äôm also 20years old male.",5,2019,10,21
125,Fabulous hotel,"We had the pleasure of visiting St Martins Lane and must say it is very classy. Michael Fitzgerald is a superstar, made everyone feel welcome and like VIP's! the location is spot on and ideal for visiting central London. Thank you for making our time in London so enjoyable - we will definitely return.",5,2019,10,16
125,Gorgeous classy hotel,"Absolutely delighted with this hotel! Bright modern classy! We were especially pleased with our suite, two sides had wall to wall glass windows, bathroom lovely, mini bar well stocked & well priced which we indulged in. Breakfast in the room was great with no mistakes! Luxury toiletries! Overall came away having had a fabulous experience!",5,2019,10,14
125,Nice but was expecting better.,"I just stayed here with my son. The good points- the location. The doormen (very helpful!!) . The front desk. I thought the room was ok. The bed was comfortable. Nice pillows. Bathroom was great. The not so good points- Housekeeping was not great. The halls smelled musty. The breakfast was so horribly slow that we had to leave after 45 min even though it was included. Not how I wanted to spend my day. There is no lobby to speak of. Touch-ups are needed everywhere- halls, elevators.",4,2019,10,12
125,Lovely ,"We went for a fun and romantic getaway to London and stayed at the perfectly located St Martins Lane Hotel. Many great places to visit in walking distance, varying from museums, bars, restaurants, covent garden, piccadilly circus and the list goes on. Weather was great when we were there, so lots of mingling and good vibes at the bars near the hotel. Contemporary art style. Hip and modern. The hidden bar is a fun concept. Breakfast also edgy and original. Room was good, especially considering the central location. I was in love with the bathroom, so well designed. Unfortunately, service was average, have experienced better",4,2019,10,11
125,There are better hotels at the same price level.,"Perfect location, walking distance to everything in Central London. Very nice staff at every position. Mediahub in rooms is nice. Minibar is well stacked.
Small rooms. Even smaller wardrobes. Uncomfortable bed. Poor lobby design. Breakfast buffet is a joke compared the cost.",3,2019,10,07
125,Covent Garden,"Nice design hotel, well located, convenient to walk or shop around West End or for a Theater night.
Great gym facility and from the hotel you can easily reach any park if you like running.
Staff was very accommodating definitely an hotel I suggest.",4,2019,10,07
125,Great location & don't miss the GYM,"Only after my second time in the hotel I discovered that the it is 5 min from Covent garden..
So do yourself a favor and open a map, make sure you know how close you are to everything.. 
Covent garden & Trafalgar square are super close. You can enjoy the city and walk to oxford st and to Buckingham palace, London eye and the big ben, they are also pretty close.

The breakfast was nice but not overwhelming.

Even if you're not such a sport figure make sure that you check the GYM there, its HUGE.",5,2019,10,06
125,Very nice employees ,"Beyond the hotel (very good), the employees, in highlight Jorge are very nice. Thank you Guys. I had good days here. The hotel is clean, the food is good. Very good localization. Lots of stores and restaurants around. ",5,2019,10,03
125,back after 9 years,"visited in 2010 and gave 5* review here, 9 years later and not too much has changed.

feels a bit worn, staff at reception were friendly, doormen were excellant.

corridors need some tlc as do the skirting boards in the room, comfy bed but a horrible chlorine smell from the bathroom water",4,2019,09,30
125,Joke,Really not happy. Every town in the world has hotels that serve drinks to guests throughout the night. Even in Cleethorpes. During our stay at this hotel On a Saturday night we were informed all bars were shut and not open to residents. This is the only hotel I‚Äôve stayed in worldwide that adopts this policy. We cut our night short to go to the hotel bar and then we were told this. Ruined our evening when we could have stayed further afield. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We scoped it out for future corporate parties but we couldn‚Äôt even get one drink before bed. Let alone 100s for our staff. Poor place to choose.,1,2019,09,28
125,Modern luxury in great location,"Hotel is located in thriving Covent Garden. Lots of attractions, great restaurants and theater shows just a short walk away. The breakfast hits the spot, and has a particularly charming waitress named Agnes who took great care of me. I highly recommend this hotel next time you‚Äôre In London.",5,2019,09,26
125,Finally found our London hotel,"There are so many hotels to choose from in London. It can be really overwhelming, even after narrowing it down to a good area. After finding this hotel there is no need to waste any time looking for another again! The location was great-not too far from the airport, and also close to so many things to do. There are a ton of bars and restaurants nearby so you don't even need to leave the area. The speakeasy has amazing cocktails if you don't even want to leave the hotel! We booked the loft double room-which had a nice view of the town. The room was huge, the bathtub was super deep and the beds really comfortable. I would definitely stay here again next time in London, for the location and the price its really one of the best options out there!",5,2019,09,18
125,About the hotel and staff,"We loved the hotel, it has a great location and beautiful bright rooms. The breakfast was marvellous. The waitresses T√ºnde and Agnes were very nice! They were helpful and kind.

We plan to come back in the future.",5,2019,09,15
125,Fabulous,"Perfect location, nice service and fabulous breakfast. St Martin's Lane was such a great experience. Our room was not so big, perfect for a city break though. Lucia was exceptionally good and the personalized welcome card in the room was definitely a great touch. I would repeat it over and over again",5,2019,09,13
125,Very comfortable Hotel with great location,"The modern facilities of the Hotel are located in the heart of London, a few blocks of Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus. Tough to get a better location. Nice minimalist decoration and lights , for a comfortable room and bathroom. 
We didn't try the breakfast. 
Very nice stay, to be repeated in future trips.",5,2019,09,10
125,Great stay,"Had a wonderful week at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel fantastic location fabulous staff big clean rooms huge bathroom 
Great comfortable bed changed or made up twice a day clean fluffy bath towels every day 
The location was perfect for getting around central London 
The concierge was fantastic with great suggestions for shows and restaurants 
The staff were all friendly and very obliging 
I will be back ",5,2019,09,07
125,Great location - very stylish,"We first stayed in this hotel in 2009 and have not stayed since.It is quite expensive even for London prices and there are others that are better value. The location is  very good for the theatre and general sightseeing. 

It is still an amazing hotel and very stylish and feels like a real destination hotel however we felt that in the bedroom it was a bit tired around the edges and maybe needed some updating..

The breakfast was good but the service was very slow and we had to hurry them along as we had a train to catch.  That is why I marked the service down. 

I still love the hotel and would go back at some stage.",5,2019,09,03
125,One of the best in London,"This is a great hotel to stay in London. We stayed there with the children for a week. Great staff. It is a new building with nicely decorated, clean and bright rooms. Possibly the best location to stay in London. Walking distance to almost everywhere. A lot of restaurants, cafes in the area. Overall we enjoyed very much. Would definitely stay again and recommend to everyone looking to stay in central London.",5,2019,09,01
125,Great breakfast,The wonderful Agnes made great suggestions as to the perfect breakfast to start a day of adventure in London. What a perfect location from which to begin. So central to everything. Ready for a top day out now.,5,2019,09,01
125,Wonderful Service,"We stayed at St Martins Lane with our children while visiting London. The staff were wonderful. The hotel was well appointed, clean and well designed. 

The room we had was small but lovely. However the size was expected when booking. The hotel and room were accurately depicted on its website.  

The area was a bit too crowded for us but it was during peak season in August and at times it was hard to walk around. Literally during the day the crowds in the main area were massive. 

However the hotel is within the district with theaters and walking distance to a lot of shops. 

Overall I would recommend it. ",5,2019,08,27
125,Michaela is horrible - do not eat at the hotel restaurant!,"Had a lovely stay at this hotel, the room was perfect and the staff were really friendly and helpful. 

We did have one criticism, Michaela working at st martins lane kitchen was extremely rude on the two occasions that I met her. She was no helpful and extremely unfriendly and was unwilling to let my mother who has back problems not sit on a bar stool while having a drink. Really disappointed with this, and surprised that this behaviour is allowed at a 5 star hotel. We would have eaten at the restaurant but she was so rude that it put us off.",4,2019,08,25
125,Afternoon Tea at the Den,"Of all numerous places to have tea, I chose the Den since it is located in Covent Garden.  Our waiter and waitress are delightful funny. We were looked after with 100% attention. The afternoon tea gas savory and sweets. Definitely more sweets, and we get tea refills. Price is also right.",4,2019,08,21
125,Looked after so well,"Loved staying here.  So central (to theatres, food and pubs), so alive (alive till all hours with the cocktail lounge) and so well looked after by all the staff ( be it where to find something or just checking up all is ok).",5,2019,08,16
125,Clean touch and great location,"The location is just perfect. Quite at the spot, but a lot to see and to just around the corner. A nice hotel to stay at if you want to be able to walk around the city. The rooms themselfes wasn't that impressive other than the lights at the bed and really good shampoo.",5,2019,08,16
125,Enjoyable hotel in great location but beginning to show its age,"Been staying at this hotel for almost 20 years on and off.  Having read recent reviews its interesting to see how different people can be in the exact same place and have completely different reactions. 

The hotel is showing its age a bit, but I have noticed changes in the rooms for the better.   Sometimes the design of the hotel gets in the way of comfort and that happens to be the case in many rooms, although far better than 15 and 20 years back.

Cool looking bathrooms but many  allow little privacy. As others wrote, some bathrooms have no door.    The sink is beautiful but water will splash all over due to the design.  Great shower but difficult to turn on in advance of stepping in ( design issue).

Although the hotel has upgraded its electric outlets in some rooms,  still would be nice to have a regular plug outlet in the bathroom.  You need to seek out a location in the rooms to dry your hair with a hairdryer.

The rooms I have stayed in and the most recent one this past week now have black out curtains since the window blinds no longer function.  This does limit how you can or cannot handle the light coming into your room. Not really a big deal , but something to be aware of. 

The furniture and chairs in the rooms are very comfortable.  In some rooms a good deal of work space.  Many rooms are tiny others are very large. Hard to get one right in the middle.  The garden rooms on the first floor have a charm...but the living space is limited. 

Beds and linens are really nice and comfortable.

Great number of channels on excellent  flat screen TV's.

Unless you have a very high tolerance for street noise- best you stay facing any direction other than the street.  Since the hotel is in a fantastic location , there is loud street noise 24 hours per day.  Plus - there is now a newly created photo opportunity area directly under the room windows facing the street.  That area now attracts even more people lingering and shouting trying to take that perfect picture.  The noise gets worse as people who have been drinking start posing for pictures after 11pm at night. Many bars in the area plus the theater crowd also make it far worse.  (Avoid rooms facing the street especially 107, 207 and so on...that room line is right above the busiest area).

For whatever reason the staffers at the front desk assured us that the rooms facing front are not that noisey.  Simply an impossible assertion, I mean there are two major stage theatres right across the street.

Hotel allows access to a full service gym right next door.

As far as the staff, they are actually better than years previous, especially the early years when the hotel was very trendy and hip.  The staff are far more friendly and welcoming.  The only exception was the concierge...not the most helpful and as another reviewer stated,  you can feel you are bothering them with questions or requests.

Housekeeping is good and hallways quiet , which allows for late sleeping or mid day sleeping due to jet lag or whatever else.

I read that another patron ran into a mouse of all things in the lobby.  I too met that same mouse this past week...the sitting room on the right side of the lobby (not the restaurant) is where he or the mice are.  I found myself working in that area all the nights while staying at the hotel.  I saw a mouse run by twice.  Frankly to me , not a big deal and they run in from the back alley.  You can't really blame the hotel.  But if squeamish- avoid the sitting room to the right.

Two things to note. The hotel has the most amazing music playing in the lobby and sitting room. The hotel also has the most wonderful scent in the hallways.   The hotel smells clean, is clean and ""sounds great"".

You can include breakfast in your room plan. The buffet is not huge and a bit pricey for the selection.  You may do better eating at one of the many restaurants in the area at breakfast time. You will certainly save money and have a greater choice.

The food in the restaurant,  lunch and dinner is very good. Service is also very good. 

There are so many choices for hotels in London, if you want stuffy tradition - you must go elsewhere. If you want fun , cool , hip - this is the place.  The room rates are more in line than they were years back - yet still pricey.  But remember the location cannot be beat - so you do save money on transportation getting to the area since you are already there.

Find a large room away from the street and all will be good.",4,2019,08,07
125,FOURTH OR FIFTH EXTENDED STAY! Home away from home in London!,"This is my fourth/fifth stay at the St Martins Lane Hotel and it is HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED IN!  The location is fantastic for Central London in terms of accessing the city's Museums, National Theatre West End theatre, the Tate Modern Sommerset House, the Heyward Gallery, BFI (both IMAX and Southbank)  all of the great bars, clubs and dining in Soho.  BUT THE STAFF IS THE BIGGEST PLUS OF ALL!  AHMET, RICARDO And All of the team that works the door, bell positions and front desk ARE ALL OUTSTANDING!  So friendly, always congenial, seem to love their jobs and always genuinely friendly and happy to see you!  Most of my visits are from ten days to two or three weeks long and I am never disappointed.  These people are excellent at their jobs.",5,2019,08,05
125,Gorgeous luxury hotel,"My husband and I stayed her last night, this hotel is absolutely gorgeous..  the room was stunning, we had a corner room with wall to wall window's all the way round. The bathroom was lovely as well with a really great shower. 
We struggle to find a hotel with a bed as comfortable as our one at home but this was fantastic and the duvet was amazing.
We will definitely be back!",5,2019,08,04
125,Anniversary stay made very special,"St Martins Lane went above and beyond all our expectations for our 1st wedding anniversary. The staff were an absolute delight, very friendly and attentive. We were upgraded on arrival and able to check in early. We were also provided with a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate and rose petals left in a heart shape in our bed. Lovely clean room, the bed was so comfortable and the shower was amazing! Thank you for making our 1st anniversary very special indeed.",5,2019,08,03
125,Excellent COntemporary Hotel,"The location is in the heart of Soho... close to Metro station. The rooms were very modern with lots of out lets for charging. The hotel was clean and quiet. It had a great bar, Blind Spot, for after dinner drinks...",5,2019,08,02
125,My favorite hotel in Europe!,"I have travelled to Paris, Amsterdam and multiple stays in London.   HANDS DOWN THE ST MARTINS LANE IS MY FAVORITE HOTEL!  The style is forward without being intrusive or obnoxious.  The connection to free gym membership helps ease any vacation dietary transgressions, the rooms are lovely with great bathrooms and are always spotless but the thing that lifts this hotel above and beyond is the First Class EXCELLENCE OF SERVICE!   The Bellmen... 
AHMET, RICARDO and a gracious and extraordinarily kind Afro British Gentleman from Jamaica originally, are all the very best.  I have now stayed here four times and unless they close or fire any of the staff, I am always staying here when I‚Äôm in the UK.  My stays are often extended over several weeks and these people know how to make you feel at home without ever feeling over the top or aggressive.  They are kind gracious attentive, warm, genial and altogether terrific.  They go out of there way to make you feel looked after.  The hotel‚Äôs attention to detail is outstanding.  Any American or particular and difficult New Yorker, like me... LOL should consider ST MARTINS LANE ABOVE ALL OTHERS!  Outstanding!  Thanks for another terrific twenty day visit!",5,2019,07,30
125,Birthday Weekend // Amazing and friendly staff,"Checked in Saturday morning - really friendly and welcoming. (A room wasn't ready, but promised to call when it was - well before 15h we got a call) I'd requested a quiet room on a higher floor, this is what we got!
It was my birthday weekend, and the guys working at St Martins went out of their way to make it very special and memorable.
We had pre theatre dinner in the restaurant as well as afternoon tea in the 'Den' but both were really nice. (My only negative point re: afternoon tea - the savouries we somewhat dry - I'd recommend keeping a traditional cucumber sandwich with a twist)
I would like to thank everyone at the hotel who made it a really special weekend.",5,2019,07,30
125,"Lovely design, poor service","This should be a wonderful hotel--beautifully located, lovely interior, comfortable rooms, reasonably good restaurant--but the front desk staff is just plain indifferent. The concierge otoh hand is knowledgable and helpful.",3,2019,07,24
125,"Good location, comfortable room","Location is really great. Room is modern and comfortable. I was on a low floor and the street/alley noise can be loud (wake you from sleep), so definitely recommend others request a high floor. Nice stay.",4,2019,07,23
125,Fun times,"This was a really cool hotel. The staff are all pretty laid back, but get the job done. The rooms are amazing and the bar is pretty cool. Area around the hotel is nice because you are near all the attractions, however alot of homeless in the area. All in all, we cannot wait to be back in London and stay here again.",5,2019,07,23
125,Didn't live up to the hype at all. ,"Had such high hopes for this hotel and was so looking forward to staying here. It disappointed at every turn other than its location.

Having stayed in many 5* hotels this in no way deserving of its rating. Staff were rude to say the least. Facilities weren't as implied and we've never felt less welcome staying in a hotel. In fact, I would go as far as to say, whenever I asked a question I felt as if I were intruding on their personal conversations with their friends that must've come to visit them in work at their ""fancy work hotel"". Everything was answered with a no. A few changing lights in a bedroom does not make a 5* establishment.

Other than location I have nothing positive to say about this hotel. 

We absolutely won't be staying at this hotel again. ",3,2019,07,22
125,Modern but missing... ,"Overall a great hotel. This modern contemporary hotel with designer features everywhere is a good hotel and very central in the heart of London. 

We were given a standard disability room - simply because we checked in early and it was available - we didn‚Äôt mind of course. 
Pretty room, nice and bright (all white) with all the amenities you could want. 

Once settled in we realized that there was no door into the bathroom and toilet. Even though it is a disability room and the doorway is wider than normal - it would still be great with a door for toilet visits. 
There was however a door into the bedroom from the hall - but it might as well have been a curtain as you could hear everything through it. 

Washing your hands was another challenge with the designer faucet pointing straight down into the huge sink in an angle that made it impossible to get your hands in. 
Your hands needed to be rubbed up against the sink it self in order to clean off the soap. I can‚Äôt help to wonder how a disabled person in a weal chair could possibly be able to reach - as it was so far back that even I with my relative long arms had to bend in over the sink to get my hands clean. 

The same designer shower head was of course installed - again with the odd angle pointing right down and with no way of moving it around. I‚Äôm 187 cm tall and I had to bend my knees quite a bit to rinse my hair. 

Designer features can be pretty and nice in a hotel like this. And yes it looks good. But in this case there has been no thought about the practical use of it at all. They should really consider doing something about it. 

With all that said - the bed was great - the breakfast was good and the staff was nice. 
Although - every day we were here a room service person knocked on our door in the late afternoon with a little toolbox in hand - just asking if everything was alright in the room. At first we though ‚Äúhow considerable of them to ask‚Äù. But it quickly got quite annoying - although I‚Äôm sure it was in the best intention. ",3,2019,07,15
125,Excellent - professional ,"Another great stay with the friendly and professional staff at St Martins Lane Hotel. From checkin to checkout, including room cleaning, room service and breakfast the whole stay was perfect. See you again soon - want a great team!",5,2019,07,14
125,Lovely pre-theatre dinner menu ,"My two best friends and I met here for dinner on a Tuesday because the set menu was a bargain, and it was an early birthday meal for me before one friend goes travelling.
The bar is cool, behind a secret door, but very dark! My friend asked me to be her bridesmaid inside and I could hardly read the words! Not a complaint at all, just funny and worth being aware of.
The restaurant was lovely though, we chose a smaller table at the side than the large one we were originally offered. All the waiters who served us were great and very friendly - it wasn't very busy so we had a lot of attention :)
All our food was great - the salmon sashimi and chicken starters were divine; my friends loved the chicken kra pao and the snapper but, although I loved the sauce of my aubergine curry, the vegetables were all a bit too hard for me. The Asian greens were also very tasty.
Dessert is always my favourite course and this restaurant didn't disappoint - my friend had arranged for a Happy Birthday version of the delicious chocolate and banana cake, which was lovely! The mango sorbet and the lime cake were also both delicious - yes, of course we tried each other's.
We'll definitely be trying more pre-theatre menus after this success! Thanks! ",5,2019,07,10
125,Better first time around,"We have stayed here twice first time is was great, amazing room and service. This time we had our daughter with us and we didn't have much space in the room for pram and that was without a cot.. No bath ect. We paid more for a larger room on our 2nd stay but there wasn't hardly any difference from the 1st time. We had breakfast but I wouldn't do it again as definitely wasn't worth the price. There are much nicer places for breakfast nearby. The hotel is in a perfect location
",4,2019,07,08
125,Ticked my boxes yet again,"I have had a wonderful 19 night stay at the St Martin‚Äôs Lane. It ticked my boxes yet again. Perfect convenient location, comfortable room, bed conducive to a good  nights sleep. Housekeeping excellent. I would ring housekeeping before breakfast and my room would be made upon my return. All the staff very friendly and would single out Riccardo and Ilidio on the front door who always go out of their way to assist. Very high praise for Diogo at concierge desk. Helpful, knowledgeable and a perfect gentleman. Obrigado Diogo.",5,2019,07,08
125,Casual & modern 5 star hotel,"To be honest as a smoker I booked this hotel for the Garden Suites as you are allowed to smoke in the small enclosed out door garden patio area. It's an unusual offering that I am very happy to pay for as it's a rare luxury & much nicer than having to stand outside in the street. The patio is very pretty at night as they light the oil lamps on turn down service too. The down side is it eats into the room space so it is only a cosy double bed with a block behind comprising of wash room with wardrobe etc, separate toilet & independent shower cubicle. There is no bath. The coloured back lights give a nice ambience to the room. There is a surprising amount of noise from the hotel corridor but this & light from the garden can be blocked from the bedroom by push to doors. Other than that it is surprisingly quiet & peaceful.
The hotel has very casual feel & style, the aromatic corridors are a pleasant addition to the relaxed atmosphere. 
If you are staying for breakfast ensure you have the guest special rate ¬£20 assigned to you on check in as it's a la carte & cold buffet. It is very good quality, in St Martins Lane Kitchen their restaurant and all cooked to order.
It will definitely become a regular haunt being right next to ENOs Coliseum theatre so perfect for the opera season.",5,2019,07,06
125,Perfection!,"I absolutely loved everything about this hotel. The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and polite.  The room was phenomenal.  The water pressure was great and the size of the bathroom was great.  The location was excellent both close to public transport and a lively part of town near the theater.  You would think the noise would be an issue but you really didn't hear anything from the room.  Excellent place! Highly recommended!",5,2019,07,03
125,New hotel in the center of everything,"The best feature of this hotel is its location. Right in the center if everything. There are three theaters within a five minute walk. Plus numerous bars and  restaurants. In 10 minutes you are in Trafalgar Square and all that has to offer. Its the best hotel in London location wise. 
As for the hotel itself, its new, modern trendy snd convenient with a very pleasant accommodating staff. My room was somewhat small but they are all small in London. It did have 110v for american electronics in addtiin to USB outlets bedside.  I ate breakfast there and it was plentiful. 
It will be my new hotel of choice for future trips to London. ",5,2019,06,30
125,Convenient Hotel.,"Convenient hotel in the west end of London, theatre district.  Interesting modern decor, good sized bed with ok room amenities.   Perfectly adequate for an overnight stay or a few days as a base enjoying the sights of London.",4,2019,06,30
125,Definitely 5 star! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,"I don‚Äôt often write reviews where I‚Äôve stayed on my travels however this hotel definitely deserves one! The hotel is quite modern with bright, squeaky clean and comfortable rooms. The service is impeccable! Our room was serviced twice a day, all amenities were replenished. Our room always looked the way it did the first day we arrived. Nice views from our deluxe room. The hotel has a really cool hidden bar. It‚Äôs also right in the middle of the theatre district and walking distance to many of London‚Äôs attractions. The tube (Leicester Sq) is only a 5 minute walk away too. 
I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again next time I visit London. ",5,2019,06,25
125,My favourite London hotel,"I absolutely adore this hotel especially the design element of it.  I find the room decor so tasteful and relaxing that I don't want to leave, its nicer than my own house!

The staff are all super friendly, the location is perfect and after a hectic day in London, it's the perfect sanctuary of peace and quiet.

My number one choice in London, hands down.",5,2019,06,24
125,Des R,"Having recently attended an AGM at St.Martins Lane Hotel near Leicester Square Tube Station we were greeted with either Teas or Coffees and Pastries. After our meeting we were shown into the Dining Room and had a sit down buffet served to us. This consisted of Cold Meats, Mixed salad with dressing and Cooked Chicken on Skewers, all delicious. We did not stay at the Hotel but it looked very nice and the staff were very helpful.",4,2019,06,24
125,Fab hotel in heart of theatreland!,"Myself and a friend recently stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel as we were going to watch a show - I don‚Äôt normally post reviews but the customer service was so good I had to!
When we arrived (early) we were really pleased to find our room already ready and the front desk really helpful with suggestions for dinner etc...
Our room was really nice, beds super comfy etc..
Lovely cocktails at The Blind Spot before our show.
Overall a great stay!
I would recommend asking for a high floor room if you‚Äôre not a party animal as the noise from below at night was quite loud from our 3rd floor room...
Most impressively, i left my handbag in the hotel room on checking out and the staff (Magaly in housekeeping and Viktors in concierge) could not have been more helpful and organised the return of my handbag straight away, I was so relieved and grateful!
Thankyou so much SML, I will definately return...",5,2019,06,18
125,Disappointed,We were booked in through work so had no choice - this would not have been my choice of hotel. We booked a superior room which isn‚Äôt great space to pack clothes is very limited - hotel dark and dingy and I even saw a mouse running around the dinning room at 22:30 as we had a drink after a show .... goodness!!! ,2,2019,06,18
125,The best hotel,"Great location,nice clean rooms.During my latest visit the service was excellent. Timea from lobby was very helpfull and always smilling.I recommand this hotel good for price and very friendly staff. Thank you :)",5,2019,06,16
125,"Great accommodation, location and staff","We stayed here for 4 nights. The room was very big, nice and comfortable, location is great, very central but not noisy and staff were very helpful. The decoration of the hotel is odd but it didn‚Äôt bother us too much.",5,2019,06,10
125,"Modern Vibe, Great Location, Super Service!","Designed to be chic modern and delivers on that with bright rooms that the maids convert to mood lighting at night. Location is perfect‚Äî steps from two Tube lines, Trafalgar Square and West End theaters. Every staff group (front office, maids, porters, restaurant) is wonderful and cares about great service. Agnes in the dining room was especially notable. Thank you very much!",5,2019,06,10
125,"Good location, but room style and functionality wasn't particularly good","This hotel is wonderfully located close to Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square with many good restaurants nearby.  Service was excellent, and I enjoyed breakfast in their ground floor restaurant.  However, I didn't find my room very comfortable:  It was cramped (just one small desk chair for sitting), noisy (loud conversations all night from adjoining rooms and outside the window), had poorly designed bath fixtures and strange room lights.",3,2019,06,06
125,location location location,"Quite often after having an excellent experience at a restaurant or hotel the return visit is a little disappointing,that would not be the case with St Martins Lane.Several years ago my wife and I had a memorable stay and knew any return visit to London would include a stay at St Martins Lane.The location cannot be beat.You are a short walk to tube stops,Covent Garden,Soho,Trafalgar Square,theatres,restaurants,its all so close.
Most importantly the hotel is so nice to come back to after a long day of exploring the city and environs.The rooms are modern and spacious,the bathroom has a great shower and plenty of room for two to get ready for a night out.The bed is so comfy that there were occasional sleep ins.
Best of all the staff are all working from the same playbook:friendly,can do,always a smile and ""have a good day"" or ""welcome back"".Small things that make a big difference.
What can I say but we are already trying to figure out when we can return.",5,2019,06,05
125,"Convenient, Clean, Comfortable, Congenial!","I loved this hotel!  I spent four nights.  During the day, I walked to museums, and in the evenings, I walked to theatres.  Just a few minutes walk from Leicester Station on the Underground.  My spacious room was very modern with excellent climate control, a comfortable bed, great lighting for mood or reading, good WiFi reception, and even charging ports right by the bed!  Sparkling bathroom with fluffy towels.  All linens spotless.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  
And just to show I'm not all gush, I was not fond of the restaurant.  I ate one breakfast there, but there are plenty of other options in the immediate area.",5,2019,06,04
125,Excellent hotel for short break.,"My wife and I selected this hotel for one of our short breaks in London to visit our son. We have tried many different hotels and found this to be, by far, the best to date.
Ideally situated for most of the things you would want to do in London with excellent access to underground network and within walking distance of many attractions.
The hotel is very modern and rooms ""minimalistic"" BUT, this in no way detracts from the functionality. My wife rates this as the best ""user friendly"" bedroom we have stayed in with excellent lighting, mirrors, sockets etc. to facilitate all the things that ladies require to do before they leave the room!
Staff were excellent throughout the stay and I would rate the breakfast as second only to that offered by the Marina Bay Sands hotel (which will probably never be beaten!).",5,2019,06,04
125,A special employee......,"Usually the hostess never get's her due but not today. Venessa the main hostess at the St Martins Lane hotel is a wonderful hostess with a fantastic smile and demeanor. For the last few days she has greeted my family with such a warm smile. She has gone out of her way to make sure we are comfortable in the restaurant.

I hope this note finds its way to her manager and she gets the proper nod.",5,2019,05,28
125,Another comfortable stay ,"Stayed here many times and it‚Äôs always no issues. Other than one the previous time we stayed they charged us for something out of the room we didn‚Äôt purchase. An oversight I am sure. On complaining a lady by the name of Dorota refunded and mentioned she would look after us next time we visited. Well true to her word she did thank you. Bell front desk (lovely) and the men in black at the front door always professional. A mention to Viktor and Mike the concierges also very helpful to our Canadian guests. See ya soon 
Mark & Sarah ",5,2019,05,27
125,Hidden gem,"Great find.  From the outside you would be forgiven if you walked past.  Inside, however, its really nice, friendly and smells amazing.

Made to feel really welcome, staff are attentive, polite and made every effort to make our stay special.  Check-in experience was okay, a little long for the impatient, but staff make every effort to help get you to your room.

Deluxe double room was clean, bright and welcoming.  Nice amenities and amazingly comfortable bed.  Shower was great, powerful and capable of not flooding the bathroom floor.  Room lighting is also good once to work out the selection of controls.  For some reason a set of the bathroom lights were not working, which may have been our inability to find the switch.

Best selection of minibar drinks if that is important to you, even down to an intimacy kit, includes feather tickler, whatever that is.  A number of room items can be purchased, such as the alarm clock, scented candle, bath robes, etc.

We visited the blind spot cocktail bar for a final drink before heading home.  Again made to feel very welcome.  Drink prices were on par for central london cocktails, and if you want cheaper drinks there are plenty of places around the hotel to cater for that.  This was a very nice way to spend our last hour, comfortable surroundings, chilled music and cocktails.

Overall a very nice hotel, amazing staff and it smells great.  I wonder now if I should have bought the scented candle.

",5,2019,05,27
125,Nice hotel....but the bar is better,"After a long trip in...both of our rooms were not ready. We strolled around the city and on our arrival our rooms were still not ready.

But Vicky at the bar...with her wonderful demeanor and easy smile relaxed the 4 of us. Vicky is one of those special servers and hotel employees you meet and wish - all the other staff could be just as nice and friendly.",4,2019,05,27
125,"Top hotel, excellent location","It was the third stay at the hotel for our family of four. We stayed in a loft Double Double room and its the best hotel room we have ever stayed in! Spacious, modern design, nice beds, great view over the rooftops of London and a luxurious and spacious bathroom! Upon arrival a welcome gift waited for us - candy for the kids (that suited my allergic daughter) and wine for us adults! The staff is great and we will definitely return for a fourth stay!",5,2019,05,26
125,Girls Weekend ,"We visited the hotel as we thought we would stay in another hotel rather than our usuals. On arrival we were greeted with a friendly and smile, and every one seemed to be relaxed and happy. Our room was ready so we were able to get sorted before a busy day. The room was very well presented and had everything you needed and asked for fresh milk which was not a problem. We had a coffee in the room that they have afternoon tea, this was quite quirky. We had a lunch and this was nice but was not sure what we had ordered but ok, partly our mistake but the staff were very kind. When we got back in the evening we went to the bar where you hold a golden hand on a door to enter and had some cocktails and listened to the Di playing nice music.
We have a lovely breakfast every thing one could asked for and again very friendly especially Agnes, so kind thank you. the main foyer as beautiful decor, and we will definitely be staying again.
Thank you all for making our stay special.",5,2019,05,25
125,Beautiful!!!,"Arrived early but was told by the very friendly receptionist that our room was ready. Wow, the room was perfect. Stunning decor, beautiful, clean, well equipped shower room. 
Had drinks in the bar where the service was swift and friendly. 
In fact we found all the staff at the hotel extremely friendly. We‚Äôve already booked another visit for later in the year.  Highly recommended. ",5,2019,05,23
125,Best Hotel in London,"as i travel frequently to London and stay most of the times in this hotel. since 20Years i com‚Äô√® here .
the hotel was sold recently to another group,but it had no impact of the quality.
the stuff remembered me as a regular customer and as ex _global card holder of morgans group you have still some privileges.
beds extremely comfortable-clean -friendly and top location.
special thanks to Sameera and Bella ",5,2019,05,19
125,Coffee far from the Madding Crowd!,I have stayed here a few times and have never been disappointed. Today was just a coffee as I always find the bar a lovely adult place with great ambience.  Previous visits to the hotel have always been pleasant and positive.  The staff in the bar ( and previously the restaurant have been positively delightful).  Helpful without being overbearing.  Do visit this wonderful secret. ( Location cannot be bettered for convenience to everything) . ,5,2019,05,16
125,Tacky and poor value - completely lacking in class!,"This is not to the standard of a 5 star hotel. 
We booked a deluxe double room, it was small, carpet was ripped, furniture shabby and no bath in the bathroom... plus chips to bathroom furniture and just general poor upkeep. The rooms desperately need renovating, it‚Äôs no longer modern and trendy, just worn, run down and dated. 

Staff were poor, long wait to check in even though there were staff standing behind reception. I found them to be over casual too and not respectful to the customer. 

Room turn down was lazy, literally just drew the curtains and nothing more. We also returned to our room for it to be lit in a horrible pink/ blue and purple light that felt a lot like a seedy nightclub... I don‚Äôt find this modern or trendy, just seedy and dated. 

Breakfast was diabolical, actually felt sick after eating it. Very poor buffet no better than a premier inn or 3 star hotel.. maybe infact worse! 

Overall a bad stay and will never, ever return! Our first and last ! For the same amount of money, the standard of service and rooms at other hotels such such as the savoy, one aldwych and others is SO much better.
If you‚Äôre staying in Covent Garden and considering this hotel... think again!",2,2019,05,16
125,Amazing hotel,I recommend this hotel 110%!! The staff was amazing from start to finish. Alex at the front door went above and beyond to help. The room was always clean and they even came in for an evening turn down service. If you want to see a play this is the best location. Great access to the undergroud.,5,2019,05,15
125,Afternoon tea at the Den,"This was my second visit to the Den having been so impressed with the high standard of the food and service on the previous occasion. Unfortunately this time these did not stand out for me. I felt the selection of savoury items was boring -essentially 'cheese on toast', a brown bread sandwich and a large chunk of focaccia -albeit with a very tasty filling. Something different would have been nice -maybe a quiche or tart? The sweets were mostly very good but the chocolate & raspberry cake was nothing special and the rocher was huge and so quite difficult to eat. Although I am most definitely a chocoholic, all 4 sweet elements were chocolate-based - some variety would again have been nice.
Friendly service but slow this time.
The lounge area is cosy and quiet so creates a relaxing atmosphere. I like the quirky artwork but the room is a bit dark and the constantly dimming lighting was annoying.",4,2019,05,15
125,Afternoon tea at The Den,"This was my first ever experience of afternoon tea and it was beautiful, the food was delicious and the staff, especially Agnes who looked after us could not of been more helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2019,05,13
125,25th anniversary in London,"My husband and I picked London to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. He came across this hotel and decided to booked it because of its location. It really has a good location, near of underground stations and attractions. Great employees, friendly service. Room was very cleaned and had everything on point. But I have to mention Belle, my husband mentioned our anniversary and she sent us a champagne bottle with a lovely note congratulating us, what a detail. Great experience, very happy!",5,2019,05,12
125,Adequate stay,"After much deliberation about which hotel to stay at we decided on the st Martins after a very pleasant stay last year. The location is still great and the rooms bright clean and comfortable , but sadly the service was lacking and nothing like our experience last year. I would recommend if you are looking for location and comfortable rooms ( but you could probably get this at victory house Leicester Square for much less ) but if you are looking for something a little special i would not recommend , sadly breaks away are very rare for us and we were hoping for a little wow factor which sadly we didn‚Äôt get",3,2019,05,12
125,Still great 20 years later,"I visited St. Martin's Lane Hotel when it first opened in the West End 20 years ago when it was considered chic and fresh.  All these years later, it hasn't changed much and therefore is suddenly ""retro"".  However, it still delivers.  For a weekend getaway in London's theater district, you can't find a better location.  The room was a decent size for a European hotel and very clean.  I still love the mood lighting and all of the mod fixtures.  The showers were the best I've experienced in multiple trips to Europe.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I would definitely stay at St. Martin's Lane again.",5,2019,05,09
125,Changes recently mean it is average when it used to be amazing,"We have been staying at St Martin's Lane Hotel whenever we are in Central London for work and have even been here on New Year's Eve. It used to be the sister hotel of the Mondrian (now Sea Containers) where we also stay depending on what part of town we need to be in. St Martin's Lane was always great service and nice rooms and we have even booked our customers roooms there over the years but the last 2 times have been disappointing. 
We always book a garden room as we are smokers and we love the rooms. When we came to check in on 14th Feb our room wasn't ready so we waited a while and eventually got the key. However the garden room they gave us turned out to be a completely different type to the ones we had stayed in so many times before. They appear to have other inferior garden rooms which are smaller, have a window out to a street which is overlooked by office workers, and no bathroom - the sink being in the room against a window like a bedsit! We called reception and said that we were unhappy and that this was not the room we were expecting and they arranged to move us to an other nicer and bigger garden room (with a bathroom) meaning that they had a nicer room available but chose to put us in an inferior one!
We stayed again on 19th April, again booking a garden room. We checked in and found that yet again they had put us in a small room overlooking the street with no bathroom! We were in a hurry to make a dinner appointment so we didn't complain and agreed that we would speak to them at check out to say how unhappy we were at being treated like this after so many years and so much money staying here.
However, at check out we were completely ignored. There was one person on the desk dealing with a customer who was looking for a room and going through all of the options. Three different staff walked behind the desk, looked at us, and said 'someone will be with you shortly'. All of the time we waited the duty manager was leaning on the doorframe behind and to the side of the desk chatting to a member of staff inside - he looked round and saw us waiting but just continued his conversation. There was no attempt at any customer service whatsoever. The only person who tried to offer us some customer service was the doorman who apologised that we were waiting.
In the end I just put the room key on the desk and went to walk out and one of the staff suddenly took notice and said 'if you are checking out someone will be with you soon'. I said I really don't have time - you have my credit card. The staff member said 'but did you have anything from the mini bar, then you will have to wait'. I just said 'you can check and charge me' and left.
I have never been treated so poorly at any hotel nor have I ever felt so unwanted as a customer. Perhaps they are doing so well that they don't care if you come back after being a loyal customer for so many years?
This hotel was sold recently to Accor (the same owners as the cheap Ibis chain) and it no longer has the feel of a privately owned boutique quirky hotel, it feels like a bed factory in the theatre district that really doesn't care.
Also, there is only one type of garden room available for booking and the picture on the website is of the larger one with a bathroom. So, you spend between ¬£400 and ¬£580 depending on when you book but can get given a bedsit - this should be clear and customers should be able to choose to pay more for a room with a bathroom.
A shame - it used to be amazing and we have been so loyal. I have just booked our next overnight but we are going back to Sea Containers despite St Martins Lane being closer.",3,2019,05,03
125,Trendy ,"Very trendy.  Odd ‚Äúmood‚Äù lighting in the rooms, strong scent in hallways that we didn‚Äôt particularly care for.  Staff was friendly.  Nice cocktail bar.  Breakfast was just okay.  Good location.  Rooms were clean.  ",4,2019,05,02
125,Great Asian food funky atmosphere ,"Hidden away but on st Martins lane us a really funky space serving great thai inspired food.
Service friendly alcohol expensive food mostly great. Seared scallops divine chicken skewers tasty the Cambodian fish fantastic",4,2019,05,02
125,Started the countdown to return to this place,"My wife and myself wanted to mark our double digit wedding anniversary with a trip to London. We wanted a top hotel, in a top location and a top musical show. All 3 requirements have been ticked with a golden ink 
- St Martins Lane Hotel
- West End
- The London Coliseum with ""The Man of La Mancha""

The hotel was excellent and contributed to the kick-off of a wonderful stay",5,2019,05,01
125,St. Martins Lane Kitchen,"This is a review of the restaurant which has taken over from the long-running Asia de Cuba and occupies much of the ground floor embracing a lounge area with books placed around columns and a more self-contained mezzanine dining area. At Saturday lunchtime it offered a brunch menu as well as Asian dishes. We opted for the latter. A starter of scallops on bok choi on a creamy sauce with wafers was a sophisticated and accomplished dish; crispy fried squid a little less so. Of mains of seared tuna with salad and duck breast curry in coconut sauce with rice the latter  was the standout dish. This restaurant is currently described as a pop-up but on the basis of the quality of the food we sampled it very much deserved to be a permanent fixture. 

",5,2019,04,30
125,Ticked all the boxes,"Super comfy bed tick, great design shower tick,   air con just right tick, great location tick, large bathroom tick , super friendly reception Thankyou Abdul Sameena tick, modern design tick, many big , fluffy towels tick, Slept like a log didn‚Äôt immediately want to vacate bed unlike most hotels we‚Äôve stayed in! So you got it just right, Next time we will try your breakfast meaning we will be back next time we‚Äôre in London. Thankyou St Martin‚Äôs.",5,2019,04,28
125,Great hotel in London,"A wonderful modern hotel in the centre of Covent Garden. It‚Äôs rooms are spacious, very clean, modern and well appointed. Quality of sleep is wonderful as the room I had was quiet and the bed amazingly comfortable.

Staff at the hotel are warm and welcoming without being over the top. Concierge Michael Fitzgerald was genuinely warm, welcoming and helpful‚Äîhis local knowledge was happily shared making things so easy for visitors like me.

All round great place to stay in London.",5,2019,04,28
125,Easter,"We stayed here for 4 nights and had an amazing experience. The hotel itself is great, with nice rooms, delicious food and very nice furniture. We slept so well. However it is the staff who made our stay memorable, they went the extra mile to do so. They managed to book a table in a full restaurant, they gave us all the touristic information, kept our luggage for us... All of this with the biggest smile on their face, each one of them! Will be back for sure",5,2019,04,26
125,Another wonderful stay,"I stayed here again on Tuesday night. 
I love this hotel as it is so central to where I want to go exploring all around Covent Garden etc. The staff, service and room were all as amazing as my last visit. 
I think of it as my home from home. ",5,2019,04,26
125,Wonderful quirky Afternoon Tea in the Den,"My children and I enjoyed a fantastic afternoon tea at the Den, with delicious and very creative food, impeccable friendly service, and in a fabulously eccentric environment.  Highly recommend, and good value as well.  Enormous pots of tea, refilled whenever we needed more. Beautiful china. Amusing decor.",5,2019,04,25
125,A real 5 star experience,"Quite possibly one of the best hotels in London, whether it‚Äôs for business or pleasure, St Martins Lane Hotel delivers everything you could possibly want. 

Located in the heart of soho but still noise-free. Lovely helpful staff. Quick and professional handling of orders and requests. Delicious food and cocktails. Instant room service. No request is too much. 

And the rooms are absolutely beautiful. Ultra cool with a sexy twist. 

No matter what the occasion- I wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2019,04,24
125,Cosy Afternoon Tea,"We have alot of afternoon teas and we tend to come to London for themed ones. We were drawn to this particular one by the gorgeous looking sweets. We were not disappointed!
Everything was beautifully presented in the lovely den which was perfectly gloomy and cosy; a much needed contrast from the whirlwind that is sunny, busy London.
The savouries were warm and extremely tasty and paired with delicious sweets which were heaven. Topped off with a small but satisfying tea selection and a crisp glass of procecco. I would very much recommend! ",5,2019,04,23
125,Easter sunshine!,"We loved our recent getaway to London‚Äôs St Martins Lane... having visited the hotel in the past to dine at Asia de Cuba and drinks at the Light bar (both have sadly closed now but replaced by a new restaurant and bars) this was our first time to stay and glad to say it did not disappoint! We had booked through Secret escapes and had a good deal with breakfast included, something that is rarer and rarer in London hotels these days. 
The warm welcome from the front staff and the refreshing scent in the lobby was a great start to the place! 
Our room was ready on our arrival and we were pleasantly surprised with the adequate size! Lots of lovely features which helped to make the room and bathroom super efficient and the lighting options helped to create your own personal touch! Storage was also well thought out and more than adequate and an ironing board and iron in the room too.
We were overlooking St Martins lane on the first floor, but were not disturbed by the outside noise at all. 
 It was lovely to be walking distance to everything, we had drinks in Covent Garden first at the beautiful Petersham nursery and then dinner and a show in the west end. 
As mentioned our stay had breakfast included and this was a great range of buffet options and a choice of an a la carte dish... the menu options are varied and of a great standard; I had poached eggs with smashed avocado and salmon on brioche and my husband had tortillas and eggs with chorizo and refried beans.
After an indulgent breakfast we just had to use the Gymbox next door! It is complimentary for hotel guests and is a great extensive gym to be able to workout in whilst you‚Äôre away!
On checkout we were able to leave our luggage behind as we had a last tourist appointment at the National gallery! As it was on our doorstep how could we miss it!
After some viewing some breathtaking paintings it was lovely to come back and refresh and head off on our way... 
Thankyou to the team at St Martins Lane for a wonderfully warm, high standard and stylish stay! We will be back! ",5,2019,04,22
125,Super Hotel,"St Martins Lane Hotel is a terrific perfect hotel location wise, very helpful staff and very pleasant... i would very much recommend it, if u r looking for a 5 star hotel with much comfort and worth the price then St Martins Lane hotel is THE hotel.",5,2019,04,20
125,Such a pleasant stay,"Lovely place meeting my needs. I had a room with my own cute patio and palm plants. The bathroom was realy big and nice. Breakfast was rich, fast and tasty. I had such a nice stay! Little thing, but important: there are USB outlets in walls",5,2019,04,13
125,Birthday Weekend ,"The hotel was booked as a surprise and I had such a great stay here. The location is excellent as you are in the heart of central London, close to all of the theatres and desired restaurants. The room overlooked St Martins Lane itself which was impressive, it was very clean and comfortable. Not too noisy given we were overlooking such a busy spot. The hidden bar is also worth a visit. ",4,2019,04,12
125,Perfectly situated for central London.,"Excellent hotel ideally situated for exploring central London. Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens, Soho are all within a 5 to 10 minute radius. You are surrounded by theatres and places to eat and drink.

Service was great and all the staff from reception staff to maintenance team were all very friendly and went the extra distance to make the trip feel special.

The room was large for London with super comfortable bed and some interesting lighting. Nice and bright. It could be a bit noisy at night but then you are in the middle of London.

It is a bit expensive but would stay here again if we could.",4,2019,04,09
125,Swanky stay in the middle of central London ,"We stayed here for a few nights during our Christmas trip to London. Great hotel with modern interior design and rooms. It‚Äôs difficult to find affordable yet great quality in central London, and St Martin Lane offers exactly that. ",4,2019,04,07
125,Very average,"I wanted to try this hotel for a change  because you get free access to a great gym called the gym box next door.  On arrival the staff were friendly, Ahmet and Belle were very welcoming and helpful. The rooms are a good size as well.  There is little atmosphere though and it‚Äôs very clinical. 

The disappointment came at breakfast where I‚Äôm sitting now.  No music at all on arrival which I had to ask for, no atmosphere, lightning very dark and the buffet a huge disappointment compared to the Mercer Radisson where I usually stay.  I was going to bring clients here for breakfast but not impressive enough to be honest. 

I would suggest going to some competitor hotels in the area to look at what they are delivering to their guests.  The layout and presentation could be better in my opinion.
Can‚Äôt fault the staff who are very attentive. 

I know next time I‚Äôm in London I would choose the previous hotel purely based on how I would rather start my day.  ",3,2019,04,01
125,My new favourite hotel in London,"I have visited the restaurant here before but never stayed at the hotel, so I was looking forward to my recent stay.

I had high expectations from my experience at the restaurant and have to say that from check in to check out I was not disappointed. 
Very friendly staff and a really nice bedroom with comfortable bed & clean bathroom with a great shower.
The secret bar is great for an evening drink before heading out to explore and the breakfast is really good (try the tortilla - amazing!!)

I look forward to returning soon.",5,2019,03,31
125,Central and Comfortable,"Really close to Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square, yet sufficiently tucked away out of the theatre madness. Rooms are low to medium priced for London (which means expensive for anywhere else) and you get what you pay for, so expect smallish standard rooms which make up for their size by way of well thought out design touches. The bed is large and comfortable, bathroom is very clean, shower is powerful, the lighting is varied, power sockets plentiful. A few minutes walk and you are in the thick of it. I thought when the receptionist said (in a regretful tone) we were on the 1st floor, that it would be noisy, but it really wasn't, although not sure about later in the season. I would definitely come back for it's convenience. ",4,2019,03,31
125,"Great location, a bit noisy","The hotel is clean, modern and right in the middle of theatre land, next to the ENO. The rooms are spacious and very well  equipped, though check the minibar prices to see how much each thing costs. We had a room on the first floor at the front. It was noisy during the evening and up to about 12:00.",4,2019,03,31
125,We felt so welcome,"This is the best hotel with the friendliest  staff that I‚Äôve ever been to. Thank you so much for a lovely stay. The location is great. The breakfast was amazing. I would live in our bathroom if I could. Had a thirteen year old with us and she was treated well as well, not all places do that. The doorman was exeptional. ",5,2019,03,30
125,"Fine, a bit underwhelming","I was underwhelmed by this hotel, particularly for the high price we paid.  It wasn't bad, per se, but I will pick a different hotel next time I'm in London.  The positives: excellent location, very close to tube stop, as well as more shops, restaurants, and theaters than you could possibly visit.  The hotel gives access to the attached gym which was phenomenal, probably one of the best hotel gyms I've ever seen.  The lobby is also very sleek and trendy. The negatives: The room was mediocre. I hated the layout of the room - it's like a circle with shower, toilet, and sink in separate little areas, which is a poor use of space compared to a standard bedroom + bathroom hotel layout. I hated that the toilet was about 2 feet from the bed, and only separated by a glass door! Like, can we at least get a real door for some noise dampening?? We had a ""patio"" area on our room which was honestly sort of a wash. I understand that in a downtown London hotel, any outdoor area is a rarity, but this was a little concrete box, with all of the hotel rooms above you overlooking you in your little 3-side concrete square.  I think we went out there once, and I certainly wouldn't say it's worth upgrading to get it.  Staff was friendly, no issues otherwise.",3,2019,03,28
125,"A lovely hotel perfectly situated for Covent Garden, LeicesterSquare and Trafalgar Square.","A great hotel with lovely funkily lit rooms.
Helpful staff from the minute i arrived. Marcis and Ahmet took care of my luggage and were always very helpful with general information and suggestions for the best local restaurants.
Breakfast in the hotel restaurant is not to be missed - there is a great cold buffet table and an extensive a la carte hot menu.  Agnes and Virginia were on duty when i visited and were very efficient and friendly and fun to chat with.
Stay here, you won't be disappointed.",5,2019,03,25
125,Fantastic bottomless Brunch,"We visited for a girly boozy brunch and it did not disappoint. The staff were very helpful and attentive and incredibly generous with the 2 hour drinks package. Food was lovely, I had the burger which was perfectly spicy. Could have eaten a few more chips.  Would definitely recommend for a lovely brunch experience.",5,2019,03,24
125,Centrally located and big rooms,"Located steps away from Leister Square and short walk to Trafalgar Square location is excellent

Hotel is very modern. has large bedroom and bathroom which can be very hard to find in London. Staff were helpful. ",4,2019,03,24
125,Terrible!,"Well, I can honestly say I do not understand some of these positive reviews as this hotel is appalling and nothing more than a Travelodge.
The negative reviews stating about staff attitude is absolutely bang on. 
So we arrived, bland empty lobby but we didn‚Äôt mind that, got to the desk to be looked at like a piece of crap by the woman behind the counter and then basically got told we couldn‚Äôt have our room as we only had Apple Pay with us and they do not offer any form of contactless payments. Bear in mind we had already paid for our room in full but we‚Äôre told ‚Äòyou might break something‚Äô at this point I asked for the manager and cut a long story short he agreed we may have our room (nice of him) 
We finally made it to our room, which was literally the smallest room in the world, no room for 2 people at all, nowhere to put a suitcase, no bath not even a bedside cabinet!! It was also my birthday and the hotel had been informed but choose to do nothing, not even a card with happy birthday writtern on it, I was absolutely gutted about the room and the poor service, but tried to make the most of it. So we showered and very difficultly got changed with nowhere to move and left for our show. Upon returning at around midnight we went to the bar, ‚Äúbars closed‚Äô‚Äô was barked at us and we shook our heads, however another guest told us there was another bar downstairs so we headed down, this bar is through a secret door and a member of staff took us down and told us which table we had to sit at, I sat down and was told I couldn‚Äôt sit in that chair and I had to move, she gave us a menu but there were only disco lights so it was impossible to see, so we got up and headed to the bar to see what was on offer., we were then chased by the woman and shouted at yo sit down as we were not allowed at the bar!! So we took our custom back out the door and back into town. Awful experience throughout and had it not been such an amazing show we saw could have easily ruined my birthday!
I would not recommend here to anyone, I will not be back ",1,2019,03,24
125,Great location and facilities. In room dining a little limited.,"Stayed for 3 days. Nice location (near Tube and in the Theather District). Great breakfast, cordial staff and nicely decorated (and clean) rooms. Only improvement would be in room dining menu. Too few options.",4,2019,03,24
125,My London favorite,"I stayed in a lovely hotel in the City last year, but decided on this trip with my 16-year-old, it would be better to be more conveniently located. I was delighted that what made that City hotel so special -- its quiet rooms and its luxurious feel -- was just as evident at this hotel. I was concerned that such a bustling location would mean noise, but the opposite was true. You'd hardly know you are steps from some of London's busiest tourist locations.

The staff was accommodating and understanding when we arrived in the lobby well before check-in time. It was my daughter's first trip across the Atlantic, and she was feeling miserable. The staff got our room ready quicker than expected, and we were able to settle in. The pillows and beds were so comfortable, and we loved having our own robes.

The location near two Tube stops is ideal for arriving with suitcases and also seeing the city. I would definitely choose this hotel again.

My one suggestion, based on overnights in NYC and Washington, D.C., is that this hotel consider making the elevator key-card operated so that it is only accessible to guests and staff. I think it would add a level of security.",5,2019,03,24
125,Fabulous Ristorante Italiano,"We were in St Martin for only one night and were recommended to this ristorante 

It was clean, staffed well and the service was exceptional.  Our meals were delicious and reasonably priced with ample time to enjoy each other‚Äôs company before and after dinner.   We were pleasantly surprised when we were presented with a shot of lemonecello. 

We highly recommend you consider IZI for a relaxing evening",5,2019,03,24
125,Wonderful,"Had a visit to London for my partners 50th, 2 nights at this hotel, i can't recommend it highly enough, service impeccable and personal, room beautiful, Bella who look after client care was amazing, can't wait to come back xx",5,2019,03,24
125,WORST STAY EVER!!!!,"Firstly, Someone came came into our room while the Do Not Disturb sign was on the door on our first night there.We should have left there and then but considering the price of the hotel, we stayed, which was a bad, very bad choice. We didn't want to fall, even though the doors were fully locked. 

The rooms were smaller than the photos represented. 
The location of the hotel felt hostile. 
The hallways were poorly ventilated and had an overly scented flower smell. 
The rooms had such thin walls, we were woken up at 8am every morning by next doors alarm clock. 
The mattress kept falling off the bed. 
The reception staff were too friendly calling us 'babe' and 'girls'. 
They made an error with the deposit I made and were pulling money out of my account without contacting me.
Lobby appears to be larger in photos 
Lifts are not modern 
Door staff over looks anyone not in head to toe designer 
Blinds in windows remind me of bars in prison cell 
No room for suitcases - not suitable for luggage more than a few days 
Hallways are not ventilated and there is a constant strong chemical smell 
Toilet flush is overly loud 
Bad lighting in room
Low pressure shower 
No privacy - can hear people using the bathroom 
Amenities in room are cheap - slippers and soap and robe

I feel this hotel violated my trust, made a fool out of me and made me feel like a victim. I can honestly say that this is the worst place I have ever stayed.",1,2019,03,21
125,Loved it!,"When we arrived at St. Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel on a Saturday night (which isn‚Äôt super obvious from the street), I thought we‚Äôd accidentally wandered into a nightclub at first. The music and dressed-up people coming and going made me a little apprehensive about the overall environment at the hotel, but my first impression was completely wrong! The hotel is not any noisier than anywhere else in London. I‚Äôve visited the city several times and this was by far my best stay!! The initial nightclub impression wore off as soon as I‚Äôd rested a bit from my flight. It‚Äôs actually just an exceptionally nice hotel with some really cool lighting, especially in the rooms. The restaurant is good, and there‚Äôs a hidden speakeasy downstairs as well. The rooms were clean and well-maintained. Also, the hotel has their own scent line, and the entire place smells great.  My mom loves it so much that she makes sure to buy several candles from them before she comes home (she‚Äôs stayed at St. Martin‚Äôs Lane several times and she‚Äôs never had any complaints). 

The staff is excellent!! Everyone was wonderful and helpful. 

The hotel employs at least two concierges. One of these gentlemen was absolutely incredible and arranged for my mom and me to eat at a phenomenal restaurant that we would never have found otherwise, because the place was literally underground. However, the other concierge should, in my opinion, find a new line of work (I did not let this affect my overall rating, because my stay was excellent overall and the first concierge was so amazing and by now the second concierge may be working somewhere else anyhow- my stay was in June of 2018). We asked for recommendations for restaurants offering halal options, as we were meeting a Muslim friend of mine for dinner. As soon as we asked for halal, the concierge acted somewhat strange and said he knew nothing about that (it seems unfair to jump straight to an accusation of Islamaphobia or racism, but I can‚Äôt think of another explanation). We asked for vegetarian options instead, and, rather than making use of his own knowledge of the city (which one would expect a concierge to possess), he simply Googled, ‚Äúvegetarian restaurants London‚Äù and showed us the results. Needless to say, we were not impressed with his service. As I‚Äôve said, I did not let that affect my rating or my overall impression of the hotel, which I highly recommend and will absolutely stay at again. I would also recommend the concierge service, despite the hiccup with their second concierge, because the first one did his job SO WELL and I have only complimentary things to say about him and the hotel as a whole. ",5,2019,03,11
125,A little too trendy,"The best thing they have going is location. I upgraded rooms and was surprised to see just how big the room was! However, I couldn‚Äôt figure out the lights. They were blue, purple, green, red, but I couldn‚Äôt get just a regular light except for in the bathroom. I was so tired, I just. Brought my suitcase to the bathroom and asked the next morning. To my surprise, the light was on this artistic looking piece that I had been afraid to touch. The restaurant food was good, but gotta day. The service at the front desk was a little too uber cool for me and the restaurant service was just awful. All this against an expensive rate, not great. ",3,2019,03,09
125,Excellent service,"We visited the hotel 's restaurant. Delicious food with unique dishes. I ate a steak with mushrooms. Service was excellent too. Vicky, the waitress that serve us was very friendly and very helpful. I recommend this place.",5,2019,03,05
125,2night city break,"Customer service from reception right across the board excellent friendly and helpful from all staff! Rooms, facilities and location all great.
Breakfast whether with a package or paying well worth doing, one of the best we‚Äôve had. All in all highly recommended.",5,2019,03,05
125,"Amazing location, gorgeous hotel & impeccable service","Just home after a wonderful weekend in St Martins Lane Hotel Covent Garden.  This is my second stay here and I was delighted that our stay was as great as it was two years ago.  On arriving we were warmly greeted by Abdel on reception who very quickly checked us in and made sure that we were sorted out. 
Our room was fab - the decor is simple and classy, the bed and shower fantastic and the ability to control the temperature in your room effectively means that there is no stuffy feeling that you normally get in hotels. Although we were staying in a real hub of activity there was no noise and we had a great sleep.
The breakfast was wonderful - great choice of really fresh food, pastries, smoked salmon, breads, cereals along with a great menu for hot food.  Everything or anything you could want.  I was hooked on the smashed avocado and poached eggs.  The waiting staff were unobtrusive, attentive and really nice - we were served by Tunde and Virginia and welcomed by a friendly and chirpy hostess called Alessa.  
The restaurant was also a lovely place to enjoy an early evening cocktail - we had some wonderful ones - the menu was extensive.  Once again the waiting staff were great - Miguel was really nice and attentive.
Nothing quite beats the concierge Michael.  He must have a busy and sometimes tough job but you would never guess it.  Talk about someone who really appears to love his job - always happy, charming and a beacon of welcome - I would have liked to take him home with me to cheer me up and help organise my life!  If you could bottle his attitude, warmth and happiness you would make a fortune!",5,2019,03,05
125,Just back from a home from home,"Just back from a weekend in London at St Martins Lane.  Second stay there and I‚Äôm so impressed with the customer service.  Mike at the concierge desk and the rest of the team are so helpful and friendly, you feel like one of the family.  We got a garden room this time with a little courtyard with was lovely.  Breakfast didn‚Äôt disappoint and of course we finish each night off with an amazing cocktail in the blind spot.  With a location as good as it gets and the cool contemporary interior I wonder if there is a better hotel in London.  ",5,2019,03,04
125,"Clean, quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of city center","Pros: 
- Their cheapest room (standard) is lovely, despite being very small. We had two massive suitcases and we could still move around. 
- Love the hallway entry, with coat hooks and a curtain close. Helped us stay tidy. 
- Housekeeping was excellent. They keep the rooms very organized and spotless 
- Bathroom is beautiful and spacious. Luxurious materials (the marble walls/floor, the high quality sink) and nice amenities. 
- Shower pressure is as good as it can get! 
- Great windows 
- Central location; easy to get around 
- Fast check-in/check-out 
- Good espresso machine! 

Cons: 
- Service is not really a thing here. When I arrived, the airline had lost my bag and the hotel did not so much as offer an ""oh we're sorry, can we help you get anything?"" 
- The mattress and linens seem cheap. It is not a super plush bed, nor up to usual 5 star hotel bed standards. But we still slept alright 
- The colored lighting might throw some people off 
- The hallways have a strong artificial smell, but really, who cares?",3,2019,03,03
125,Just amazing,"We booked an overnight stay at the hotel to celebrate my birthday and for some quality time with myself and my eldest daughter. 

We arrived at the hotel early morning due to our train arrival and was welcomed by the concierge and reception team with a warm and welcoming smile and a Happy Birthday (my daughter had notified the hotel).  It was so refreshing to be welcomed despite our early arrival, our check in paperwork was completed, our baggage looked after and confirmation that we would receive a call as soon as our room was ready. A few hours later ahead of the usual check in time we received a call to advise our room was ready and when we returned the concierge showed us to our room. 

The room was simply beautiful, we were shown all the features which included a stunning garden area with candles, extensive mini bar, coffee making machine and the amazing lighting system. The bathroom was set out brilliantly with a great shower area, separate toilet and a wash bowl overlooking the beautiful garden area. 

All of the room facilities were great, the bed extremely comfy and I was so touched when I received a Happy Birthday selection of goodies brought to the room - a lovely surprise. 

We didn‚Äôt want to leave - Check out was just as easy and we left our bagge with concierge so we could make the most of our last day. 

I cannot recommend St Martin‚Äôs Lane enough, I honestly feel like I‚Äôve had a very special weekend and the room really made our overall trip. Thank you to a wonderful team who really went the extra mile. 

I have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels across London and this is my best experience of service and quality over many years of regular travel to London. 

Thank you !",5,2019,02,26
125,The potential to be a fabulous hotel. Sadly a disappointing experience for our special occasion.,"I surprised my wife last weekend with a theatre break to London. I chose St Martins Lane Hotel based on the excellent location to Covent Garden. Prior to our visit I emailed St Martins Lane Hotel to make them aware this was a special occasion for our 10th Wedding anniversary and therefore any special gestures would be very much appreciated. They replied to say they would ensure our anniversary was a memorable one. I also booked a table at their restaurant and one in the cocktail bar post theatre.

We arrived early and dropped luggage off to the hotel, the room wasn't ready of course as we were early and we didn't expect it to be, at this point we were offered an upgrade for an extra ¬£60 to a room that was ready but happy with the wait we declined. The receptionist told us she would call us as soon as it was available. Great, so off we wonder round Covent Garden. No phone call and it was now check in time so back to the hotel to find the room was ready despite the absence of phone call. 

The room was Superior corner room and was stunning, just as I had hoped with a great view. Unfortunately,one of the main features of their rooms,  the mood lights were not working, the connection was loose. Quite disappointed by this I expressed my frustration to the reception and asked for an alternative room or a free upgrade, suddenly the earlier upgrade they offered me for ¬£60 more was now not available and the could only offer me a downgrade to a lower floor room meaning we would lose the view I had chosen. So we had to wait for a maintenance man to fix the lighting. I also reminded reception at this point that they had promised to do something for our anniversary (wishfully was hoping there would have been a nod towards this in our room on arrival), reception replied to say they were sending chocolates up to room later for my wife, lovely.
The chocolates never arrived, a note was slipped under the door simply saying happy anniversary. Not quite the memorable experience they had promised. 

Our pre-theatre meal at their restaurant Asia De Cuba was superb, the waiter couldn't have been more helpful, and a lovely meal was enjoyed. Post theatre we also enjoyed a few cocktails in their bar The Blind Spot, again couldn't be faulted. 

I feel its such a shame that a beautiful hotel with so much potential to impress their guests could leave us so disappointed on such a special occasion. Had their customer service and attention to detail been spot on this would have been such a different experience for us. 
We loved the location, loved the room (once the faulty lights were repaired!), the bed was as many other reviews say one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. The restaurant and bar superb. We would consider staying here again as every other aspect was spot on just such a shame this experience wasn't as it should have been.",2,2019,02,26
125,Fabulous hotel - great location,"This is a modern minimalist style hotel with a great location.  The service is very professional and it retains a friendly atmosphere in a large city.  Bedrooms very comfortable and trendy, lovely breakfast and two interesting lounge areas.  Great for shopping in Covent Garden and visiting the nearby theatreland.",5,2019,02,21
125,Modern luxury and achingly cool,"We stayed here for one night after attending the gala night for Dolly Parton‚Äôs 9 to 5 musical. It is in the heart of theatre land and very near to Covent Garden. 

The hotel is very minimalist and has modern decor, so it‚Äôs probably best not to stay here if you like chintz and gilt. As we weren‚Äôt using the room much we opted for a simple double room, though on checking in we were offered a selection of different rooms to choose from. Note: even if you‚Äôve booked to stay in a double they‚Äôll try to up-sell and get you into a ‚Äúmore superior room‚Äù, without mentioning upfront how much extra this will cost you. As we were only using the room to sleep in we weren‚Äôt remotely bothered by a ‚Äúbigger room‚Äù so declined. 

The bed was ultra comfy and the linen very nice too. They were a bit scrimpy on towels, only a bath towel each and one hand towel between us, though I‚Äôm sure if we were bothered about this we could have asked for more. The shower water pressure is enough to knock you off your feet! A Lavazza coffee machine was included in the room along with coffee pods, instant coffee, tea bags and milk sachets. Only very basic toiletries were included though the quality of shampoo, conditioner and body wash was good. Other toiletries were available to buy if needed. Bathrobes and slippers were there to use too.

I would definitely recommend asking for a room on as high a floor as possible, less chance of street noise and being overlooked by (or looking directly into!) surrounding properties, plus more chance of better views. 

Breakfast was great: smashed avocado on sourdough with tomatoes and poached egg (substituted for bacon) for me, omelette for my husband, all very delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The orange juice, served in a tiny shot glass was absolutely delicious, my only wish was that this was a larger serving!

Sadly we didn‚Äôt get to experience the Blind Spot cocktail lounge, though we did have a peak in when it was closed and it looked amazing. We were offered the use of the gym but again didn‚Äôt have time for this either. 

Would I stay here again? Absolutely yes. The location is spot on and the room was super comfortable. 
",5,2019,02,20
125,Double double loft room,"Lovely hotel in the middle of Covent Garden and theatre district.
We have stayed here several times and particularly enjoy the large double double loft room which has ample space for 4.
Restaurant at hotel Asia de Cuba does excellent food, breakfast is quite expensive, but brunch choices at weekends are good value.

",5,2019,02,15
125,Wonderful stay,"Really enjoyed my overnight stay at St. Martins Lane. It's a rather austere looking building from the outside in a great location close to the West End and Covent Garden. Inside the hotel looks is very slick and well designed. I had a cocktail or two at Blind Spot which is well worth a visit even if you're not a guest. My room was lovely, spacious and unexpectedly with an outside patio. I don't think there are many of these, worth enquiring on checkin. Wifi was fine, I didn't have time for breakfast. This would be ideal for a weekend in London or an overnight dinner or theatre trip. Recommended.",4,2019,02,13
125,Afternoon tea,"We have just come away from the most wonderful time. Agnes, our waitress made us feel so welcome and was very attentive. The food was amazing and we also came away with a bag of food that we couldn't finish. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,02,10
125,Another wonderful stay!,"I love staying at this hotel. Perfect location for the West End, great service & comfortable rooms. A little treat was waiting for me as a regular guest, thanks Bonnie.
It‚Äôs a real treat staying here & I can‚Äôt wait to return.",5,2019,02,09
125,"Lovely hotel, perfect location","Went to this hotel just for the one night, as we had a show at the Hippodrome. This was a perfect location right in the middle of the hussle & bussle & a 5 minute walk from Charing Cross Very clean & friendly staff on arrival, bags taken up to our room. We had a double loft room on the 4 th floor, high enough not to be able to hear any of the noise from outside. Room very clean & spacious. Mini bar was quite expensive but a good selection of foods & drinks. There is a secret cocktail bar downstairs in the lobby, this is expensive & lighting only by candlelight. We never stayed for breakfast but was told we would get it for ¬£18 each if booked before midnight or ¬£30 each after
All in all a nice hotel in just the right place.",4,2019,02,05
125,Afternoon Tea in The Den,"Lovely relaxed informal afternoon tea in The Den. Nice selection of savoury food followed by some very rich sweet deserts. 
Quirky paintings and prints on the wall! 
The hotel foyer  is quite weird with a set of gold molars as a seating area and massive vase of flowers. Good value for money.",5,2019,02,02
125,Location Location Location,"Ideally situated for the theatre goer and tourist. A few minutes walk from a number of theatres. 
Trafalgar Square, St Martins in the Field The National Gallery are right on the door step. 
A little furthe walk and you have Buckingham Palace, Horse Guards, Whitehall, and nany more pkaces if interest.
The hotel itself is very modern clean and comfortable. However, the open plan bathroom (no door) gives no privacy if usung the toilet. 
They leave stuff in the room for purchase, perfume, razors cream. very pricey. There is a drug store at Charing cross station or a Boots chemist in the strand if you need the stuff at a lieer price. The staff are pleasant and helpful, though the porters/security do seem to congregate when not busy.
I would certainly stay here again.",5,2019,02,01
125,Superb Afternoon Tea,"Had a wonderful pre-theatre afternoon tea at St. Martins Lane Hotel with my mum today.  Delious sandwiches, cakes and scones, great value for money and fantastic location in the heart of town.  Special mention to the friendly and helpful staff member Tunde who served our tea, first class service.",4,2019,01,31
125,Amazing City Centre Hotel,"What an amazing boutique hotel in the heart of London!!  Warm welcome by all staff, very comfortable, quiet rooms.  Cute welcome macaroons were a very very nice touch.  The room was ultra comfortable and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.  My only gripe was the spout for the wash hand basin - not well thought out - however I don't blame the hotel for this as it is clearly an installation issue.

The bar was a secret little room that was a very nice touch.  I would not hesitate in staying here again and fully intend to next time I am in London.",5,2019,01,28
125,Excellent venue for tea with fantastic service,"Went here for the ""decadent delight"" offer: unlimited hot chocolate and a selection of teatime snacks. The venue was a small side room with very nice ambience and atmosphere that made the afternoon very comfortable. The hot chocolate (especially the dark chocolate one) was amazing, and the snacks were fantastic as well, though quite filling. We stayed for about 3 and a half hours drinking hot chocolate and eating and had a fantastic time.
The service, especially, really stood out: our server Agnes was incredibly nice and friendly, continuously made sure everything was alright and brought us water and hot chocolate, and let us pack the snacks that we did not finish to take home and have later. 
We were very happy with our time here, particularly with the service.",5,2019,01,28
125,Excellent Location!,"We stayed here for 3 nights just before Christmas and we were really impressed with this Hotel. The room and bathroom were excellent and the location couldn‚Äôt have been better. Great restaurants, fantastic London Pubs and amazing shopping all around this Hotel",4,2019,01,27
125,Very Good but not Excellent ,"Located at the theater district in London very near to tube Station and Covent Garden. The hotel is nice bar is good the restaurant ‚ÄúAsia de Cuba‚Äù not great average to say the best. Good Gym, the rooms are a bit small and the lights could be much better. I would maybe go back but bot sure. Expect to pay about ¬£ 300 per night. ",4,2019,01,27
125,Best possible location for a theater visit,"We chose the hotel because it was located near the theaters we were visiting on an annual trip for that purpose. We were pleasantly surprised by all aspects of the hotel from its discrete entrance to the very pleasant check in and our very nicely appointed room. This was a quiet a hotel as we have ever stayed in. The room was nicely appointed and the bathroom was equally nice. In distinction from many hotels there was more than enough shelf and storage space so that we could completely unpack and have easy access to our clothes. There were many USB ports so that the computers and telephones with which we travel were always fully charged.

While we wanted to be close to theaters, we were pleasantly surprised when we found one less than 50 meters from the hotel and all within 150 meters. There was also a convenient underground stop a few minutes walk away from the hotel.",5,2019,01,26
125,Delightful Afternoon Tea at The Den,"An afternoon tea for friend and I to celebrate her birthday was made even more special by the care and attention given to us by Agnes. The sandwiches were good but the scones and cakes blew us completely away. Scrumptious to say the least, so filling that we had to take some away and the ambiance and surrounding was very elegant.
Would definitely visit again with more friends. Special thanks to Agnes.",5,2019,01,23
125,"Perfect location, excellent room","We loved this hotel.  The room (deluxe, with a view of the city on the 6th floor) was comfortable and chic, with all the requisite amenities.  The bed was comfortable, the room quiet.  The concierge was helpful.  We had a drink at the bar, not the ""disco.""  The bar was fine; good finger food and a nice drink.  For those going to theatre in the West End, the location can't be beat.  Near a Tube stop and within walking distance of all theatres, restaurants, and other spots to visit.",5,2019,01,19
125,Appalling,"Literally the worst service I have experienced in more than 20 years of travel. Slow, inattentive, bill errors - a catalogue of errors.
Room very pleasant, but service is as bad as it gets.
Restaurant (Asia de Cuba) and the bar also massively overrated.",1,2019,01,19
125,Delicious Afternoon Tea!!,"We definitely recommend the afternoon tea in The Den! Bought as a birthday present for my mum. Very filling, we had to take some home but it was creative and every item was delicious!! Agnes our waitress was so friendly and attentive. She even went out of her way to bring Birthday donuts to my mum and sung happy birthday even though it was a month ago! Lovely lady!",5,2019,01,17
125,Great Afternoon Tea,"We had a very enjoyable afternoon tea in the Den at St Martins Lane Hotel to celebrate our daughter's birthday. The Den is small and cosy with a quirky feel to it and the afternoon tea was excellent. It catered well for my daughter's vegetarian requirements and my husband's savoury preferences and also gave the options of hot chocolate, gin and tonic or prosecco as well as tea, which meant there was a drink to suit each of us! The cakes were delicious and there was so much to eat we took some home with us. The service from Michelle throughout was outstanding, she was so friendly and helpful which greatly contributed to our overall experience and the personalised birthday dessert presented to my daughter was a nice surprise!",5,2019,01,16
125,Afternoon Tea,"Did not find the hotel easily.  Staff were friendly and we were given a 2 hour slot, which was plenty of time and good as we did not have to rush.  Water and tea were topped up without even asking, which was really nice.  Did not have sandwiches, little savories which were lovely and would of liked more instead of the sweet treats.  Sweet treats were lovely and we managed to eat them all, really stuffed when we came out.  waitress offered to take our photos which was another lovely touch.  This was a lovely afternoon tea in a relaxed atmosphere, with lovely staff.  Only negative I have is that it is rather expensive to other deals you can get.",5,2019,01,15
125,"Great location, decent rooms, very fair prices","Perfect location especially if you are visiting the theatre and want to be close to Covent Garden. The rooms and very modern and minimal, almost Ikea like. But for the cost it‚Äôs ideal. The gym you have use of next door is great, loads of classes and all the equipment you could possibly need. Mini bar and snacks are very expensive, but that‚Äôs London for you. We will stay here again!",4,2019,01,14
125,The Best hotel in Theaterland,"After trying several hotels in the West End of London over the years I have finally found the perfect hotel. I come to London to go to the theater and the location of the Saint Martins Lane Hotel could not be better. It is within a five to ten minute walk to any theater in Central London. The hotel is sleek, stylish, uber-modern, and maintained beautifully. The lobby is inviting with a quiet wow factor. My room was spacious, all white, sleek, and very comfortable - and with my own espresso maker. It was quiet and had a heavy interior door that could be closed to shut out any sound from the hallways. The bath was large and the shower was the best I've ever had in London. The staff was gracious and helpful. In a word, it was exceptional. I stayed five days in January 2019 and I will be back.",5,2019,01,14
125,Really caring service in a stylish package,"This hotel is unbelievably chic and the location is fantastic for Covent Garden and London's West End.  The best thing about it by far is the amazing service.  The staff are friendly, efficient and genuinely kind to guests.  Small-ish rooms, but extremely comfortable, stylish, well-equipped, and very quiet.  I especially enjoyed a chill-out at the end of the evening in the wonderfully atmospheric ""hidden"" bar.  

This was my third visit and I'm even more impressed than before, thanks to the brilliant help I received with a lost property item left behind in the hotel.  Many thanks to the Concierge and Housekeeping teams for coming to the rescue.",5,2019,01,10
125,Tea at St. Martin Lane,"We had tea for four at St. Martin Lane.  It was excellent.  The sandwiches were very good, so were the desserts.  The theme of the Tea was Narnia - and once of the desserts was the face of a lion - so cute and very good to eat too!  They also serve the tea, if you want, with a specialty Gin drink which also was good.  Service was excellent and we really enjoyed ourselves.  Would definitely recommend this tea.  

The hotel lobby looked very nice.  Our friends were staying in the hotel and had a nice room that overlooked towards the London Eye.",5,2019,01,10
125,Wonderful location and great staff,"Stayed in basic level double room which while being on the small side was very comfortable ,with good standard of furniture , excellent bed and bedding and impressive and spotless bathroom . Outstanding staff on reception , concierge and breakfast room . Thoroughly enjoyed our stay .",5,2019,01,08
125,5 stars is not high enough!,"Wow....just WOW!  My family and I just returned from a 7 night vacation in London and had the pleasure of staying at the St Martin's Lane property.  In short, it exceeded expectations on every single level possible.  I chose this property because it looked like a hip, cool hotel that seemed to also be kid friendly.  I also chose it because they have the DOUBLE DOUBLE room, which offers two QUEEN size beds, which is quite difficult to find in London, and Europe in general.  Most times properties offer two FULL size beds.  I traveled with my wife and my 13 year old son and my other 18 month old son.  The room was absolutely perfect....it truly felt like we were staying at home.  It was extremely clean, the beds and pillows were fantastically comfortable, and it was quite spacious.  It even had a nook/sitting area off to the side, where the staff had set up a brand new pack and play for my youngest to sleep in, so that we could still watch tv and talk in the main area after he had gone to sleep.  It truly felt like home.  The view was excellent, and expansive, as the room had floor to ceiling windows all across the exterior.  The area of the hotel could not be better if you are traveling for tourism, and want to be in walking distance or a short subway/cab ride to any and all of the major attractions that London has to offer.  But I must say, the service is what set this hotel over the top for me.  I read a few posts on trip advisor prior to booking that stated that they experienced to staff to be cold, and not helpful....at some times even rude.  Our experience could not have been more to the contrary.  This was seriously the best staff experience I have had at a 5 ‚ú≠ hotel in probably a decade...and we travel a fair amount.  Diogo, Giacomo, Michael, and the entire concierge team could not have been more patient and helpful as I barraged them with email questions and requests prior to us arriving.  They set up a car service to and from the airport that was just a little bit more expensive then it would have been to try and get a cab.  The car was a brand new Mercedes Van, and they already had the car seat in it when it arrived and the service was top notch.  Come to find out that car service handles nearly every major celebrity that comes into London.  So the concierge team truly has all the right hookups, and is eager to leverage them for the guests...and at a fantastic price.  Their efforts were no less impressive after we arrived.  Every detail was ironed out with ease, from assisting us with daily planning, to dinner reservations, and anything and everything else we needed.  They were more like personal butlers then concierge service.  The front desk staff was equally attentive and accommodating.  They could not have been more pleasant upon arrival, and during every subsequent interaction we had with them.  Allison and Giusseppe specifically were fantastic.  That said, I almost feel bad singling them out, as everyone else was great as well.  I just so happened to deal with them more often, and therefore became familiar with their name.  They negotiated every little problem or request we had related to having a baby on property with ease....which made the visit so much more easy and enjoyable.  The room service e was ridiculously quick, and they were always there to provide a late night glass of milk for our young one to have in his bottle when he woke in the middle of the night.  The property is beautiful, and very unique.  A modern aesthetic, with soft touches here and there.  I have stayed in several SBE owned/operated properties (Delano Miami, Delano Las Vegas, Mondrian Los Angeles, etc), and I would say the St Martin's Lane is absolutely on par with those other properties.  Whether a couple's weekend away, or a family excursion....I would feel 150% recommending you book here...it simply will not disappoint.",5,2019,01,08
125,wow what a hotel,"we booked to stay at this hotel and our travel plans changed and because we had booked a special rate could not get a refund so they offered to upgrade us to make up the difference. this hotel is in an amazing area namely covent gardens. the hotel itself is wonderful and we had a suite which was really mind blowing from lights around the bed that changed colour to a tv that stowed away when not in use it really was great. great lounge area also and extremely spacious. the gentleman at the concierge desk was super helpful and really helped us get around. all the staff very super efficient and friendly and helpful. we had breakfast at the hotel and it was very nice not stupendous and the pancakes were awful so don't order them. otherwise the hotel is really superb. I however had a problem with the windows I felt one could see into our room as we were quite low down so I kept curtains drawn but I think it was me being odd the windows are tinted so I don't think one can see in, I just felt a bit exposed as there are no blinds, but its a small issue I had which was possibly nonsense.",5,2019,01,08
125,Perfect location and spacious rooms,"We have the last couple of years stayed closer to Marble Arch and Oxford Street when visiting London before Christmas. This years we decided to try another location and wanted to be closer to Covent Garden and the many shops and restaurants in that area.

This hotel was really perfect for us. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a room with a private small patio and even if it was late November, this was a great litte place to finish off the evening. When we came back to the hotel at night they have lit the candles out there and it was quite romantic.

The hotel also had a surprise and a hidden bar on the ground floor. Just look for a door with a golden hand :)

However, stay away from the restaurant in the hotel. We tried it once and the service was slow (even if the place was not full) and my wife got food that was terrible but was explained that it was supposed to taste like that and an explanation that she might not be used to this type of fine dining, That is the only reason for not giving top score. Sorry...",4,2019,01,08
125,Great Location and good size room for London.,"Very stylish hotel and modern clean fit out. Good water pressure, very comfortable bed. We had a room on sixth floor (top floor) , which had a nice view over the east of London. Only basic amenities included in room, you have to pay extra for shavers etc. water, tea and coffee included.  
Staff at reception were extremely friendly which was a nice change.
The hallways are perfumed which I found overbearing and would be uncomfortable for someone with hypersensitivity issues, good to note the rooms themselves were not scented. The restaurant and bars were quite expensive as expected at 5star hotel. The location however is incredible, and many eateries nearby. As per usual London the streets can be a little noisy at night. Look out for special prices on the rooms, full rate is quite expensive if it is not a business trip.",5,2019,01,07
125,Location location location,"Excellent location. Within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, theatre, and shops. A clean, trendy hotel with a fun and hip atmosphere, with a cool gym next door. Rooms aren‚Äôt big, but that‚Äôs the norm for London.",4,2019,01,04
125,Always an amazing stay at St Martins Lane,"We've been staying at St Martins Lane for years now, and it's as good as it has always been, if not better! Great service from the second we arrived and the room and amenities were brilliant. The food in Asia de Cuba was one of our favorite meals over the weekend visit - so would highly recommend dinner there and Blind Spot is great for really nice cocktails.

Extra special thanks to Belle on Front Desk who helped us with the booking and looked after us during our stay!",5,2019,01,02
125,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Had stayed in another ‚Äú5 star‚Äù hotel on my previous visit and St. Martins Lane blew it out of the water. Some highlights:
1. Despite being in a bustling area, it‚Äôs remarkably quiet. Could not hear any noise at night. 
2. The service from the front desk to the concierge to room service were incredible.  Had a couple of requests that I thought would not get done and they delivered quickly and promptly each time!
3. The rooms are very well done- cool design, clean and thoughtfully modern. There were two USB ports on each side of the bed as well as a regular plug. I can‚Äôt tell you how many hotels don‚Äôt think about this. 
4.  The amenities are great. Had breakfast everyday at the restaurant and went to the bar Blind Spot.  Both were great.  The bar was exceptionally good.  Great vibe and some very good craft cocktails. 
5.  Location can‚Äôt be beat.  Walked to everything - museums, parliament, attractions, shopping, restaurants, etc
I will 100 percent come back.

125,Can't Wait to Go Back,"We arrived at Saint Marten's Lane London Hotel on a rainy late morning after taking a red-eye from Newark.  As soon as we entered the hotel, the first thing that I noticed was the fragrance in the lobby.  It was inviting and warm, as was the rest of the entrance-way decor.  The staff was very pleasant at the front desk and we upgraded our room and went up for a nap before exploring London.  

The room was impeccably clean and gorgeously minimalist.  The decor is mostly white with a very light colored leopard print carpet.  The lighting over the bed has several colors to choose from which makes the ambiance very chic; especially when returning to your room at night.  The bathroom was gorgeous, and again, clean.  Amenities were great and the bathtub was very comfortable for a couples soak.  View was wonderful with the floor to ceiling windows.  The television had media connections so we were able to hook up our lap top and watch our favorite shows on amazon and Netflix.

After exploring the city for a day or two on our own, we decided to stop at the concierge desk for some advice and this is what really put our trip over the top.  The concierge, Michael, was perfection.  We still MISS Michael and speak about him at home from time to time.  He was able to help us with the bus tour, Stonehenge tour, and recommended great restaurants.  We made sure a few times just to stop by and say hi!  Extremely pleasant, very helpful, and a joy to speak with.

The ""secret lounge"" was also gorgeous and a fun evening for us.  Ask about this on your visit.

Every time we returned to the hotel, it literally felt like we were ""coming home.""  We plan to return to London again and have no doubt we will stay here again.  We have no need to look anywhere else.  Saint Marten's Lane was perfect.  Location is very near the tubes and there are so many great restaurants and entertainment right outside your door (including a Starbucks directly across the street).

Why haven't you booked this yet?  Get on it!  As soon as you enter the lobby and enjoy the warmth and aroma and pleasant smiles and greetings from the staff, you make your way to a clean and relaxing room that will be very difficult to leave.  But when you do leave, please make sure to say goodbye to Michael for us.",5,2018,12,28
125,A gem of a hotel in the perfect location,"My family luckily found this hotel during our recent visit to London.  Everything was perfect - from the lovely staff at check in, the modern welcoming lobby, and our rooms.  We loved the location of this hotel right in Covent Garden - close to several Tube and rail stations as well as lots of restaurants.  We had two rooms - one standard and one deluxe for our family of four - two teenage daughters - and it was perfect.  We can't wait to go back to London and stay here again.",5,2018,12,25
125,Excellent service great location,We always stay here for our trip to London before Christmas and are never disappointed with the room and excellent service received. The staff are very friendly and every room is always clean and well designed. The location for shopping and sight seeing is perfect. We will return again soon.,5,2018,12,23
125,Excellent ,"This was our second visit to this hotel and it will now be our preference for any visit to London. The staff are so attentive without being obsequious. It was really nice to be greeted with ‚ÄòWelcome back‚Äô even though it is more than two years since we visited.  We opted for a de-luxe garden room as we do like a room with outside space which is rare in central London.  The decor may not be to everyone‚Äôs taste but it works and it is clear that a great deal of thought has gone into it.  The hotel is also exceptionally clean and well looked after.  Breakfast is really good with a wide variety of options to choose from. 

We look forward to our next visit. ",5,2018,12,22
125,Love This Hotel,"Stayed here for the first time on Monday 10th December and I loved every moment of my stay. 
The hotel has a great central location. 
The design and decor throughout is stunning and very clean. 
My room was on the 5th floor and extremely quiet. 
All the staff are very kind and helpful. 
I will definitely return - hopefully very soon. ",5,2018,12,17
125,Second visit did not disapoint,"Stayed here for a second time and it was just as good.  Staff are there just when you want them and always help to help.  Rooms are very comfortable and quite, when you need it.  Breakfast well worth while, ensure you have that included in your deal.",5,2018,12,16
125,Fantastic hotel!,"Everything here is wonderful! The staff, including front desk, concierge, bar are friendly and helpful. The rooms are large, comfortable, and quiet. The location couldn't be better! Close to theater, Trafalgar Square, Museums, Covent Garden!.",5,2018,12,12
125,Amazing Hotel!!,"This place is incredible! me and my boyfriend stayed here for our birthday celebrations and i am so glad we did. The staff are amazing and can't do enough for you even with our short one night stay, rooms are lovely and the bed is sooo comfortable, the hotel interior in general is amazing! - Great location for shopping/meals/drinks, definitely worthy of its 5 star rating!
Already looking to come back shortly!!",5,2018,12,11
125,What a bar service!,"Been here last summer for a business trip.
Beautiful Hotel, superb service, staff polite and professional.
The bar was the best part, drinks served perfectly always with a beautiful and polite smile.
Shame I didn't book the same hotel on the next trip.",5,2018,12,10
125,London at its beat,I haven‚Äôt visited St Martins Lane for some years since I haven‚Äôt been to London. But I am happy to say that they keep high quality in their services and the standard of the room. They have also added new bars and modernized the restaurant and original bar. I can recommend staying there.,5,2018,12,09
125,Go for it!,"I have a lovely time at st Martin‚Äôs lane. The staff were delightful, especially Eliza from reception. Comfortable rooms, very nice breakfast and an overall great vibe! Not to mention close to everything you could possibly need. Highly recommended!",5,2018,12,08
125,Super Location & Good Attitude ,"The hotel is so perfectly located and is in close proximity to 3 tube stations. 

The staff are all super friendly and the room was a decent size (king suite).    There was not anything extra I needed in the room.  I was not a huge fan of the bedroom mood lightening but that‚Äôs my personal choice.  

The concierge were fantastic found me a last minute ticket to a sold out ballet.  

The secret bar is vibey and fun with a pleasant wine list.  I felt the breakfast for 29 pounds expensive.  There are plenty of lovely little breakfast spots in Covent Garden for less than half the price. 

What I appreciated most is that I had a problem with street noise for 2 of my 4 nights.  There had been an issue apparently however the way the front desk handled my complaint is what impressed me.  Things go wrong but it‚Äôs ultimately how things are handled that makes one return or not.....",4,2018,12,07
125,Once again a fantastic hotel!,"Have stayed here for the third time now, and am a fan of this hotel- stylish comfortable , great rooms though some (such as the one i got this time) are somewhat small, but overall a really great hotel...and supreme location as well.
One of my favorites",5,2018,12,01
125,Fantastic location and good food,Centrally located hotel with a modern style. The building is poorly signposted. Service was fast and friendly. The room modern and clean just very small. Not enough hangers. Too little space for a suitcase. Not well insulated against noise. Pretty cold in the room and couldn‚Äôt find the aircon control. Otherwise perfect and certainly a recommendation. ,4,2018,11,29
125,Weekend-Trip to show my parents around London,I travelled to London to show my parents around the city since they haven't ever been here and I am absolutely in love with it. The hotel is ideally located very close to Trafalgar Square. I have requested the hotel to prepare some champagne and a welcome letter from me in my parents room which worked perfectly. There is nothing I can complain about during our stay. The hotel room was clean and well equipped with everything you need and the staff was always very friendly. I also left something behind in my room which they sent to me free off charge.,5,2018,11,26
125,We had the utmost pleasure of an afternoon tea at the hotel; phenomenal!!!,"I was skeptical about spending a few hours munching on cakes and drinking tea, but I was so wrong. Stepping into the St. Martins Lane hotel in London is like stepping into a world infused with calm and tranquility. We were greeted by the lovely Michelle who saw us through the duration of the service. Drink as much tea as you can, served in the most beautiful teacups and saucers, while you soak up on the calm and tranquility that this place bestows on you. With a modern interpretation to cucumber sandwiches and a great cake stand, you really cannot go wrong with this one. Time and money well spent and we will be back for sure.  Thank you Michelle!!!",5,2018,11,19
125,Not very friendly,"Good location, might need some renovation work. - Unfortunately staff at the recption desk is not very friendly - just calling guests by the first name does not make it a ""cool"" place rather invest in a smile. Staff in the restaurant friendly and helpful.",3,2018,11,14
125,Afternoon tea at the Den,"I experience my first afternoon tea at the Den. It became the best experience ever because of great service of Inesa! She is so great that she even accommodated a tired kid and let him snooze off while we are doing the afternoon tea and move us to the bigger place and my son in the sofa when space became available. She is an asset to this hotel. I mean superb service. If ever we are back we will visit this place due to her.

The afternoon tea selection was good. The unlimited flow of tea/coffee and relaxing atmosphere. Most were here for a meet up or meeting. We were here to relax after a tired day of checking the tourist spots. ",5,2018,11,13
125,Fabulous hotel,"I have stayed there last week for 4 nights. I was amazed with the services. Staff were so welcoming and friendly. 
Room was beautiful and specious in comparison to other hotels in city. 
Best thing is definitely the location which is  a premium one. Walking distance from Leicester metro station, and from all the main streets, Oxford, Piccadilly...
Straight line from Heathrow to hotel with tube.
Breakfast was so tasty specially the omelet!
Would definitely consider it as my preferred place to stay when in London.",5,2018,11,13
125,Design at its best & warm hospitality,i spent a couple of hours - throughout my shopping in London - at this hotel & was impressed. It's been there for a few years but it never loses it charm. Asia The Cuba food was excellent (I recommend the Bento box). Staff friendly & attentive. Peter McGinnis - who I met in the lobby - pro-actively introduced himself & escorted me to teh restaurant...must visit!,5,2018,11,13
125,Great place to eat,"Had a lovely afternoon tea here in the Den at St Martins Lane. The dining  room is relaxing and has a good atmosphere. 
Our host Michelle was lovely and really friendly and helpful. 
The sandwiches and cakes were tasty and full of flavour. 
Would definately return sometime and recommend.
The hotel is a very convenient location in West End of London,  close to theatres and other attractions.",5,2018,11,11
125,"Fun, funky, cool spot!","Stayed 5 nights at this fun hotel.  If you are looking for a traditional English chintzy-type place, this isn‚Äôt it, thank goodness!  Sleek, cool and fun, our corner room was spacious, and well appointed, with unique touches like choice of colored lighting over the bed (very romantic), great big bath-tub, super shower water pressure, in room espresso machine, comfy bed and seriously glazed windows so no street noise.  Hotel has a couple of fun bars,  and the staff was friendly and helpful without being intrusive.   Great location too!  I‚Äôll be back!   ",5,2018,11,06
125,Great afternoon tea in the heart of the West End,"Saturday afternoon tea at the St Martin Lane Hotel was very entertaining and good value for money. Tea is served in a modern and comfy side room off reception and our host Michelle provided an amusing and witty commentary - instead of just reading the ingredients out. Tea was a huge scone, vegetarians & a whole range of cakes (probably one too many) and endless tea refills. A very good traditional tea with a modern twist in the heart of the West End.",5,2018,11,06
125,"Fabulous afternoon tea in The Den, St Martins Lane Hotel","I took my my mum for her birthday on a Tuesday afternoon to afternoon tea in The Den. We had such a lovely time, it‚Äôs very cosy and feels very different to the usual afternoon tea experience in London. The room is quite dark but actually very cool and atmospheric , and it‚Äôs lovely to fave a mixture of people, not all having afternoon tea. The service was impeccable and we were spoilt for choice with excellent, beautiful food. Inesa our waitress was absolutely charming and so friendly and efficient. Would highly recommend and can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5,2018,11,06
125,Blown away!,"We had an exceptionally large and beautiful room. Guest Experience Manager Belle made sure everything was arranged perfectly with the greatest care and attention to detail. Sameena and the Front Office team had our room ready even before check-in time and made our arrival as smooth as possible. The Concierge team went above and beyond, and especially Mike made us feel like royalty. In our room we were surprised with some delicious pastries delivered by a wonderful Room Service attendant. We started our evening at The Den, where the upbeat Michelle gave us some great gin recommendations and made us feel right at home. After our night out the room was beautifully turned down and had the most romantic vibes with stunning views over London at night. The breakfast was very extensive with some wonderfully healthy options. The whole breakfast team served us with a smile and made sure we had a great start to the day. Thank you to the whole St Martins Lane team for making our stay so special. We'll be back soon!",5,2018,11,05
125,Lovely For A Treat,"I booked a room for 1 night as part of an 18th birthday treat for my daughter, combined with a trip to the theatre on the Friday night and shopping the next day.

The hotel is a few minutes walk from Leicester Square and Covent Garden tubes and slap bang in the middle of London theatre land, so an excellent location. 

The reception staff were extremely friendly and courteous and asked about our visit so I mentioned the special occasion. They encouraged us to go for a celebration drink in the bar during our stay. After we returned that afternoon a bottle of chilled Prosecco had been placed in our room. It turns out to drink in the bar you need to be 21, so this was by way of a consolation. A really nice thing to do.

The room itself was lovely. Clean, sleek, well laid out, and we loved the funky colour changing lights. We were on the 6th floor so we had a good view across the capital and plenty of light.

We didn‚Äôt book breakfast with our reservation as I thought ¬£29.50 was too steep, but it was available for ¬£18 each on check in which seemed far more reasonable and was entirely worth it. It‚Äôs served in the hotel‚Äôs Asia de Cuba restaurant, and includes anything from the buffet (smoke salmon, cheeses, meats, fruit salad, breads and pastries), and 1 item from the a la cadre menu. Absolutely delicious and again, wonderful service. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone coming to the capital and will definitely be back.",5,2018,11,04
125,Excellent location,"First time staying at this hotel and I have to say that we would definitely visit again as the location in the West End was ideal, adjacent to Leicester Square and Covent Garden. 
The hotel decor was fantastic and we enjoyed having a cocktail in the secret Blind Spot bar.
",5,2018,11,04
125,Great location and staff.,"Stayed at st. Martins lane for business and like all former Schrager hotels, the staff was great but the lobby decor just needs a major update.  Hotel lobby feels dated.  With a simple modern facelift the hotel would regain some of its prior glory.  ",4,2018,11,01
125,OK BUT NOT WITHOUT PROBLEMS,"My first stay at this smart designer hotel in the center of London. The location is the most attraktive of this hotel. As neighbor to the English National Opera ENO you are just around the corner from everything. 

The staff is very welcoming and friendly. The lobby, bar and restaurant is good and there is a warm spirit in every detail. 

The problem for me was my room. Despite I set the heating system at 30 degrees the room was still very cold. Floor to ceiling windows can be good - but not on the 1st floor next to one of London's most worn streets, and specially not when the built-in blinds cant be adjusted. There was also a lot of noise between the rooms - I could easily follow the neighbor's long phone calls.

If you like rooms where bathroom, toilet and the closet is integrated as part of the room, then you will like this hotel. Personal I like to have bedroom and bath room separate. 

The bed was very good and also the soft and delicious linen. It is a 5 star hotel so off course you have a well-stocked minibar, also a coffeemaker from Lavazza. The room also have ironing board, umbrella and good toiletries. 

The staff, the lobby, the spirit and the idea is 5 star worthy, but not my room with the heating problems and the thin walls to the neighbor. 

If everything had worked, the price was good. 232 GBP is ok for a 5 star hotel on this location. Maybe you just shall ask for a heated room on the top flor, with thick walls and blinds that works. The rest was high class.",3,2018,10,30
125,Half term theatre stay,"Great location in the heart of theatre land. We stayed during school half term in a loft deluxe room which was spacious (rare in London) and very comfortable.
The bar snacks were good, we had the prawns, sliders and fries along with a nice glass of white and red wine.
Staff were very friendly and next time we are in London, we will book this hotel again.",5,2018,10,28
125,Location and vibe!,"We stayed for 3 nights in a Deluxe room while visiting London on vacation and loved it! 

Pros:
- Location! Right in the heart of London in Covent Garden! Close to nightlife, theatres, the tube, Soho (!), Leicester Square, tons of great restaurants (we recommend Barrafina). All walking distance. Also easy to use the tube or Uber. 
- Deluxe room was very comfortable, quiet, modern (great lighting), good A/C and wifi, with a huge bathroom. 

Cons:
- The hotel restaurant Asia de Cube is not that special and a bit overpriced. There are much better options close to the hotel. 
- The hotel is right downtown so don't expect all of the rooms to have great views, but not a big deal at all. 

Overall we loved it here and would definitely stay again while visiting London!",5,2018,10,28
125,Very Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"This is my first time at this hotel and I'll probably go back. The location is perfect for spending time in London's West End and Covent Garden. The room was a bit glitzy (lights of different colors and other similar touches) but the bed was great and the bathroom was roomy. The staff was generally helpful. There are a few things that can be improved: there's a deodorizing aroma in the hallways, which was unpleasant, and the revolving front door is ridiculous. It's supposed to turn without you touching it when you get in and it doesn't work property. Even the doormen complained about it.",5,2018,10,27
125,Excellent Location!,"The location of this hotel near the National Gallery, Covent Gardens and many theaters is outstanding. It is also close to several metro stations making it a great central location for exploring London. The rooms, while small, are well planned and provide space for unpacking and for putting away your belongings. Everything we could have asked for was provided. The staff were helpful and checkin was quick. It was a great pick for a central London hotel.",5,2018,10,26
125,A second great stay,"This is a really nice hotel in a great location for attractions, restaurants and theatres in central London. It was our second stay and was as good as the first. Staff are friendly and helpful and dealt with an issue about our room quickly and in a professional manner. This time we also used the hotel restaurant for a meal which we really enjoyed. We didn‚Äôt have breakfast which is quite an expensive extra on top of the room cost but there are lots of local places open first thing serving a nice breakfast so that isn‚Äôt an issue. Would definitely recommend and likely to use again when needing to stay in that area. ",5,2018,10,23
125,Relaxed and friendly with top class service,"Just got back from a one night stay as part of a trip to celebrate my wife's birthday. As we'd made plans for the day and booked a theatre for the evening, we arrived in the morning, way before check-in time and had also booked a ""pre-show"" meal in the hotel restaurant. From the moment we arrived, the staff were cheerful and helpful, gladly taking care of our baggage while we went out again for the day. Later, the check-in process was quick and easy and the room (a garden room) was smart, stylish and spotless, the bed luxuriously comfortable and the surprise bottle of bubbly made the stay just about perfect. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the service faultless. On returning from the theatre, a nightcap in the den was a fitting conclusion to the evening. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Overall this is a brilliant hotel, made even better by the brilliant staff. Will certainly be back",5,2018,10,21
125,Superb staff,"Having spent many weekends in London.  My girlfriend & I decided to try different 5* hotels.  First night we stayed at Dukes in Mayfair which was so drab and disappointing.  Luckily for our second evening we had book St Martin‚Äôs Lane.  What a delight...from walking in we were greeted by Belle on reception...she was so wonderful at her job.  Gave fabulous advise on the hotel/local restaurants and just a wealth of knowledge all around too.  We immediately fell in love with this hotel..such a cool vibe with lots of places to dine or just drink in.  To top of the beautiful welcome Belle even sent a note and some bubbles to our room wishing us a fabulous stay!!! Really touched our hearts and made us feel so special and created such a memorable moment for us.  Well done for employing such beautiful staff, and a big thank you to Belle for making our stay so magical and Michael the concierge for your top tips too. ",5,2018,10,21
125,"Lovely Hotel, Great Service, Great Location","I brought my Sister here for her 40th birthday present & we both had a lovely stay.  We arrived early morning & checked our bags in with the Concierge and didn't arrive back until 6pm.    Both morning and evening receptionists were very friendly & helpful.  On arrival in our lovely standard double double room we found a birthday brownie cake for my Sister & a note from Belle which was a really nice touch, thank you.  Location is great as it's around the corner from Leicester Square tube so we found it easy getting about London during the day, and it's only a 5/10 minute walk from Covent Garden in the evening in reach of lots of bars, restaurants & close to lots of theatres.  At the end of the evening we waited for a table in Blindspot & had a cocktail there which was a lovely end to the day.  Unfortunately I left my jacket there & didn't realise until the morning but it wasn't handed in.  Luckily a day later Ineta from housekeeping contacted me as they had found it and Giacomo returned this to me by post the next day.  Thank you so much for arranging this, I really appreciated it.  We also had the breakfast package and there was a wide choice to choose from.  All in all a lovely experience and we had a great time.",5,2018,10,18
125,Weekend away,"The hotel is superbly situated just off Covent Garden, surrounded by great food places & a short walk to many of the tourist hotspots in central London. The boutique style with quirky furniture & fittings was modern & the bar/restaurant was very lively with a great ambience. The room was nicely decorated however the edge was taken off the weekend stay when I returned on the Fri evening to be met with a very strong smell of cannabis on the whole floor which had seeped into my room. I did raise the issue with the front desk & was told that security would investigate however I feel for the cost of the stay, further action should have been taken as the smell was incredibly strong. I accept that the hotel was not to blame for the actions of individual idiots but I should have been offered a different room as a courtesy. There was also a fair bit of noise which did interrupt my sleep & again you could say you are in central London what do you expect, my answer would be triple glazing  in a hotel that charges these rates!",3,2018,10,17
125,Wonderful Stay!,"My husband and I flew to London from Texas and chose this beautiful hotel to stay in for three nights. We are in our early 30‚Äôs and it was a perfect location near everything and great night life. The room was spacious, the hotel very clean, and it even had a secret bar! The bed was so cozy! My husband and I had a good nights sleep each night. I would highly recommend this hotel and will probably stay again on my next visit to London!",5,2018,10,17
125,Wow,"Visited London a lot in the last four years we stayed in many hotels but we just have to say this hotel  is the best location is absolutely amazing walking distance to everywhere the hotel as an amazing atmosphere so clean and fresh and the staff  are  just brilliant and you can have a lovely out side  Area all to yourself 
 we  found our hotel this is where we‚Äôll be staying every time we go to London not the cheapest but deafly the best  Worth every penny",5,2018,10,17
125,Great Location right where you want to be,"My 3rd time at this Hotel, fabulous location, soho, china town, Leicester Square all in a 10 min and less walk. Plenty of local cafe's, restaurants and quirky shops nearby. National portrait gallery a stones throw away. Plenty of theatres around as well. It's not cheap and I think could do with a freshen up, it wasn't as crisp and fresh as my first visit, that was however over 10 years ago. Room was ok and I only say ok because if you are on floor level 1 or 2 the street noise can be annoying if you are a light sleeper. It's not cheap but for where it is and its quirkiness it's the going rate. Would use again and recommend to one and all.",4,2018,10,14
125,Nice on the surface. Expensive for what it is. Great location.,"Our room was incredibly loud.  The street noise, the hall noise, the next room noise.  Only jetlag and exhaustion allowed us to get any sleep.   The customizable lighting was nice, and the bed was comfortable.  It was really inconvenient trying to dry hair and make tea when there are no outlets near those appliances.  The staff seemed nice.  The decor was a bit...'tries too hard to be edgy'.  It's obvious they are catering to a younger, hip, crowd.  We found the in hotel dining prices to be outrageous, especially with so many good and reasonable options within a short walk away.  One thing that is incredibly great about this hotel is location.  It's a short and easy walk to the Leicester Square tube station, which is one straight shot to/from Heathrow.  Easy walks to Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square.  It's simple to get around from this point.",3,2018,10,12
125,Great location within walking distance of key attractions,"Booked via Expedia and stayed for a total of 2 nights / 3 days. Had made inquiries ahead for a late checkout - which the hotel told me they will confirm during check-in.
Reception staff (so bad with names but if I remember correctly was Andreas) was very friendly and accommodating - recommended me to upgrade to a deluxe garden room upon asking for a smoking room (naturally with extra costs of course).
Room quality was simple, no frills, far from fancy. But clean, neat, and tidy.
Tried their continental breakfast which was to my liking and the room service was quite prompt, although it seemed they had forgotten my order on the second day - which they turned around rather quickly in 20 minutes or so.
Checkout was smooth as well. Asked the hotel to arrange a chauffeured transportation to Horsley and they came back to recommend that I take Uber instead as costs were more cheaper - which suited me fine and was pleased with them having my best interests at heart.
One hiccup though which I did not get the chance to pick up with them - is that they charged me for the call I made for room service!!! I dialed the 4-digit number which was clearly printed on the cardboard placed on the room service tray (as opposed to pressing the single room service button on the phone) - and I found out later when reviewing the bill that they had charged me for that. Small cost but still! Very strange. 
Very good location - within walking distance from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery, not to mention the Piccadilly Circus (I say walking distance but it was more like the hotel was right by it).
If you are looking for a decent place equipped with friendly staff nearby the key attractions - would recommend this place.
",4,2018,10,12
125,A let down with staff who do  not care,"room was functional and acceptable.  housekeeping standard uneven.  there was one day when my sign for room servicing hung from 8am to 7pm and room not serviced.
the last straw was security barged into my room when there was a do not disturb sign hung on the door.  th front desk claimed that check out was 12 noon and they had called and knocked. when i obviously upset told them that front desk had agreed to my late check out at 1pm, staff was only concerned that this was not recorded and she is just explaining policies. apologies were clealy insincere.  i would not want to ever stay here again when the system is so disorganised and where staff clearly do not care for the guests.",1,2018,10,11
125,Felt like Living in London,My recent stay could not have been better! Eliza was superb during check in and helped to arrange for a truly unique upgrade. Rubin assisted with my check in. And Giacomo recommended an Italian restaurant that I went to twice for dinner and will return to every time I go to London. My room - more like a flat - felt immediately like a home away from home. The hotel was chic and centrally located with professional and friendly staff. I highly recommend this hotel!! I plan to stay here every time I go to London!,5,2018,10,11
125,Afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea is absolutely AMAZING, they have great service and the location and room is perfect. Would love to go back. Loved the consept and the sweets and savories taste so incredibly good. If you are going for afternoon tea in London, go here.",5,2018,10,09
125,Amazing hotel in great location,"We chose this hotel for its location, there are a lot of theatres around, and from the Friday night play it took us only a couple of minutes walk to get back to our room. Also it‚Äôs close to the Leicester Square tube station which is a direct line from Heathrow airport.
We loved our stay here. Our deluxe room was clean and spacious, and had a nice view on the street and London eye. And the design of the hotel is modern and fancy. Everyone from the staff was welcoming and helpful. We didn‚Äôt have a chance to have breakfast or drinks in the hotel, but we ordered some food to the room, and it was tasty and served quickly. Overall our stay was great and we definitely will be back if we need to stay in the area.",5,2018,10,06
125,"Overpriced, overrated, underwhelming... ","Close to ¬£300 a night for a tiny room with a tattered LEOPARD PRINT carpet?!

No bath... 

Rude staff on the door of the supposed guests only bar which my partner and I weren't able to enter due to overcrowding after being told to ""Wait there! I'll deal with you in a minute!"". 

The lady in the tea room was clearly also lacking the ability to communicate effectively with guests in a friendly and polite manner.

Not what I expect from such an establishment.

Luckily I was in excellent company :) ",3,2018,10,01
125,"Great stay, no doubt the best hotel I have been in! definitely want to come back!!","Everyone of the hotel staff was so nice and pleasant, such a great service!
I was very sick when I arrived to the hotel and my room was not ready (it was around noon), and everyone at the front desk was so helpful and I really felt they are doing the best they can to help me feel better. 
I traveled with my mother, this is my 4th time in London, and this is no doubt the best hotel I have been in - the Deluxe room was perfect, the best room for 2 people, so specious and cozy.",5,2018,10,01
125,Nice location - pretty good hotel,The sell for this property is the location which is brilliant for soho. The rooms are very small but clean and well presented. At ¬£245 it wasn‚Äôt great value as you didn‚Äôt get much for you money but at least it saved a cab fare,3,2018,09,29
125,"Kinda cool, understated, helpful, and fabulously located","We wanted a place in the West End for a four-day jaunt to London.  St. Martin's Lane delivered.  Staff were on point - solicitous, prompt, quick to understand. 
The room had a view of thew Eye just across the Thames; the white theme and lighting effects were pleasing.  Servicing of the room was consistently what we would expect.
Tea in The Den was fabulous - unique treats, both savory and sweet, in a quirky space (we liked the sense of humor in the art work).  We also had a cocktail at Blind Spot - super service and good advice when making our selections.  
The location is hard to beat - easy walk to National Gallery, British Museum, Trafalgar Square, several theatres.  We literally walked across the street to see Sir Ian McKellen in King Lear.
getting there from Heathrow was a breeze - Heathrow Express to Paddington then Bakerloo line to Charing Cross and then a very short walk.
I would happily stay again.",5,2018,09,28
125,Great Service,"Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of the theatre district. Nice sized room with a peekaboo view of the London Eye. The thing that sets St Martins Lane apart is the great service!!!! The staff from top to bottom is top notch, they make it their business to ensure you have a great time in London, everything they recommended from plays to restaurants was a hit!!! They made my birthday vacay special I can't wait to visit again.",5,2018,09,20
125,Heart Of London,The location is perfect. Central to everything. Service is very good and the hotel is very modern and chic. Rooms and beds are a little small is the only very small downside. Definitely recommend. Would stay again,4,2018,09,17
125,5 Stars!,"A lovely hotel located right in the centre of London and within easy walking distance to the theaters, shopping and sights such as Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus.  The staff are extremely friendly and keen to help in any way.  We received a warm welcome from Abdel, Belle and Danilo on check-in and they later followed up to ensure that we were happy with our room.  The concierges, Mike and Giacomo, were helpful with their dinner suggestions and activities to do during the day.  Arnold and Sandip welcomed us back with friendly smiles and a chat after our days out, as well as assisting with our luggage. 
 
We stayed in a Studio, which I would highly recommend.  As the room is located on a corner it receives a lot of natural light.  There are two large  windows on each side with a view of the streets - great for 'people watching' and we did not notice any street noise. The room was immaculately clean and looked as though it had been recently renovated as all the furnishings seemed new.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was spacious with a separate bathtub and shower with great  water pressure.  I really liked that there was a mini refrigerator, coffee machine and a kettle in the room.  

We also ate at Asia De Cuba one night and enjoyed our meals - the Crispy Calamari Salad is a must and absolutely delicious!
 
Overall, our stay was wonderful and we hope to return soon.",5,2018,09,17
125,Another fantastic stay!,"It's always a pleasure stay here. Great location, really friendly staff, who can't do enough to ensure you have a comfortable stay. Well appointed rooms, funky decor & comfy beds. What's not to love!!",5,2018,09,14
125,Best place to stay in London,"Spent two night in London last week and was advised by a colleague to stay in StMartins: best choise ever!!
The location is perfect if you are on leisure as well as if you are traveling for business: super central(1 min from Trafalgar square and Piccadilly circus in a zone with plenty of underground station and restaurants) but the real win for them is the staff:super friendly,polite and prepared.
We arrived very late at night when Andrea and Giuseppe really made us feel home as we walked in: giving us very good advices about resraurants, and museums, they really looked after us.
The room was amazing, but I am a big fan of Starks and could not say otherwise!I would also recommend the Blind spot, hotel's bar, where the drinks were amazingly mixed and interestingly presented by Malia the waitress.
Unfortunately didn't try the restaurant but will do next time!",5,2018,09,13
125,Great location- quirky decor,Really modern hotel with quirky decor in a fab location- 5 mins walk to Leicester Square. The room was well equipped with a lovely free standing bath and expresso machine. Lovely fluffy towels and bath robes. Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that the bar closes early on a Sunday- nowhere to have a drink and had to resort to room service. We weren‚Äôt advised at check in so disappointing to resort to room service for a night cap. ,4,2018,09,12
125,Glorious few days in the centre of everything,"We visited St Martins Lane hotel in late August for 4 nights and couldn't be happier with the location.. 5mins to Covent Garden and 7 to Chinatown...  with Starbucks right across the street for the daily fix.
The reception staff were welcoming and checked our bags as we arrived early and our room wasn't ready. 
We returned to the hotel later in the afternoon and found our bags had been delivered to our room which was a nice touch.
The room itself was compact but perfectly furnished and decorated in a simple contemporary style. Beds were very comfortable and Bathrooms were super - Shower was especially good!
A clever design feature was the extra door to the bedroom witch reduced corridor noise to zero.
One tiny complaint - lighting in the bathroom wasn't conducive to applying makeup - the lights were just too subdued.
Gin and Tonics in The Den were delicious but we unfortunately didn't get to experience The Blind Spot as it was closed on the evening we decided to try it out. But having peeked in the previous evening - it looked fab.
Overall, the hotel was super. Stylish, contemporary and chilled but with great staff which made the experience even more enjoyable. 
We will be back.",5,2018,09,11
125,Best location and Excellent Service,We have stayed at St. Martins Lane over 5 times. We love the location and service at this London Hotel. Especially love the quaint bar that is kind of a hidden gem. The staff is great and very helpful. The entire place is extremely clean. Love it!!!!!,5,2018,09,10
125,Could not have been better!,"I came here after leaving another hotel, in search of clean airy light modern. I got it!  Plus excellent service and friendly (mostly) staff. Breakfast delicious, Asia de Cuba good as always. 
Never wanted to leave but I will be back in a few weeks time!",5,2018,09,10
125,Great location & reasonable value,"Very little to fault at this hotel. Given the location the rates were really good value. Room was good sized, with all the amenities in it and very clean. Very friendly and helpful staff. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2018,09,10
125,"Modern, clean and perfectly located","Rooms are spotlessly clean and trendy in design.  
Breakfast was superb, with great choice and freshly cooked to order.  
Staff very friendly and accommodating.  
Although slightly expensive, I would look to return on my next visit to London",5,2018,09,07
125,Luxurious and quirky,"Great central location close to Leicester Square/theatres etc.
Modern room. Clean and comfortable, love the lighting.
Quirky art in the lounge was appreciated.
Friendly and speedy check-in.
Didn‚Äôt eat there so can‚Äôt comment but the menu looked great.",5,2018,09,05
125,New Years Break,"Great hotel, modern, comfortable. Stayed over New Year‚Äôs Eve and New Years Day. Great atmosphere and party. Had a wonderful evening with friends and fellow guests from all over the world, as well as some well known faces from the London scene.
Would recommend this hotel and would use again myself if needing to stay in central London.",4,2018,09,03
125,London. One of my Fav Cities ,"Love popping back into London when I can and I love this boutique hotel, centrally located to all the highlights I like about London. Easy to walk to Theatres, musicals Leicester square, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square and Soho. 
The hotel is beautifully appointed, being boutique is just perfect with all its quirks. 
Again a property I stayed a few years back but I returned and will again. ",4,2018,09,02
125,Highly Recommend!,"I‚Äôm so glad I chose this hotel, it‚Äôs fabulous. Well located, stylish, great food and a very comfortable bed. We didn‚Äôt end up using our Oyster card because the location is so great, we walked everywhere. The service was above and beyond what I expected. You must stay here!",5,2018,09,01
125,Great Stay | Summer Trip 2018,"Perfect stay from start to finish! 
First of all, the staff in this hotel were super friendly and helpful, and would always greets us with genuine smiles especially Sandy the bellman and Vera! 
Second, the rooms compared to London hotels were spacious and very clean. 
Thirdly, the location is great! Very near to starbucks and Tessco and many more great shops for everyday essentials. Not mention the hotel is 2-5 minute walk to covent garden, the national portrait gallery and leicester square and right in the middle of London's theatre district! 
So to recap, the level of friendliness, service, cleanliness and location is extremely high. 
I would definitely recommend this to families and couples alike.

The beds and linen were wonderful. I was concerned about the location and that it would be noisy but quite the opposite- we slept peacefully with no noticeable noise from the street. The location is perfect for getting around Covent Garden, soho and surrounds. A special shout out to the staff who were professional and helpful. In particular to Daniel who I spoke to about my reservation and Belle for the lovely birthday treat for my friend. Highly recommend! ",5,2018,09,01
125,Amazing from start to finish!,"Well what can I say? This is an exceptionally good hotel. In a city where everybody is a nobody this hotel makes each guest feel like a somebody. Central, spotlessly clean and all staff were so extremely helpful. Arrived with my mum and daughter after a very early morning flight and we were upgraded to the most fabulous double double loft suite. Beautiful corner room with amazing views. Room was COOL in check-in (so so many hotels do not put on a/c until guests are in room). Beds were very comfortable. Had drinks in the den and in the bar. Both were excellent. Breakfast was very good and basically they will make you whatever you want! The hotel smells delicious- no wonder they sell their scent in candles and room spray! I have not stayed in this hotel since my hen weekend in 2006 and I guarantee that I will not be leaving it a fraction as long before I am back this time!",5,2018,08,31
125,A good hotel conveniently located near to London‚Äôs Theatreland,"We‚Äôve stayed at this hotel several times now.
It is well appointed, well located, and well run.
It‚Äô doesn‚Äôt have a gym/fitness centre, BUT it does have free-for-guest access to next door‚Äôs pro Gym Box which is FAR better than any hotel gym/fitness centre
It‚Äôs located close to some nice places to eat, and you‚Äôre right in the heart of Theatreland too.
It has a multi-floor parking option at the rear of the hotel",4,2018,08,28
125,Pop in for a cocktail pre theatre,"This is a hipster hotel with great access to all the theatres around and places to dine .
The bar is always crowded and fun. . Decor funky and hipsters at the bar . 
London gin and tonic on a hot London summmer day goes down well here . Pricey but great atmosphere .",4,2018,08,27
125,Concierge so helpful,"This was a return visit to celebrate a 40th anniversary at the beginning of August. Mike and Giacomo made all the difference to our itinerary. The only pre-reservation we made ourselves (to a restaurant we‚Äôd visited many times) went wrong. With less than 5 hours notice the reservation was cancelled, apparently due to the hot weather impacting on the heat in the kitchen. Mike came up with an alternative, within minutes, saving the day and ensuring we were able to enjoy a Sadlers Wells performance knowing we had a meal at the end of it. Each reservation came with fabulous service AND complimentary fizz. Cheers to Anthony in the restaurant bar for giving us a great send off too.",5,2018,08,26
125,Creative and beautiful ,"Arrived for two days conference , located centrally among endless pubs and restaurants , the hotel lobby is is designed creatively , big small furniture that create illusion , staff very welcoming and check in was quick , the hotel is extremely clean , the rooms have a nice feature that you can decide on the color of the lights , bed comfy , room big and very well maintained ... breakfast is rich , with good coffee .. when price is reasonable book it don‚Äôt hesitate ",5,2018,08,25
125,St. Martins Lane Delight,"Extraordinary staff, especially manager-to-be Danilo Cavalieri, who made our stay a true delight.  Beautiful room, expansive windows onto London.  Wonderful breakfast restaurant (with it's own brilliant staff).  A thoroughly blessed experience.

We have been around the world, but seldom found any place to match St. Martin's Lane.",4,2018,08,22
125,Modern hotel in central location,"I stayed in this hotel for a work trip over a weekend. As soon as i entered the hotel i was greeted by very helpful doormen and a beautiful scent that was circulating in the reception area. I was in a Superior room type and it was spacious and felt like a mini apartment rather than a hotel room. Although it was in a central location on a weekend, i didn't hear much of the busy nightlife outside which is what i was initially apprehensive about. The hotel also has a speakeasy bar hidden away just off reception called ""Blind Spot"", great for meeting clients for drinks or equally ideal to start or end the night in whatever your plans are.",5,2018,08,20
125,Sooo comfortable.,We stayed 5 nights and I really felt happy that I had made such a great choice. The Deluxe room was a nice size considering that I had heard London hotel rooms can be quite small. The bed was super comfortable and the shower was superb.  Top 5 showers of my life due to excellent water pressure.  Housekeeping did a great job with our room each day.  The location was perfect for us.  They offered free cleaning for 3 items of gym clothes each day which we took advantage of. Unfortunately cleaning for non-gym clothes was outrageously expensive ($12 for one pair of jeans). No issues with noisiness despite only being on the 2nd floor.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.,5,2018,08,19
125,"Modern, well maintained, great staff, excellent  location","Just stayed 5 nights in St. Martins Lane Hotel, and it was an excellent stay. 

We had issues with  the TV not showing sports/movie channels, and the staff jumped into action and eventually decided to change out the TV to make sure it worked for us. There was simply no delay or lack of desire to fix the issue AND they communicated well with us on every step (including waiting until we left for a play to make the switch). You can't tell if a hotel is customer oriented when everything goes according to plan, but you can when something goes wrong, and St Martins Hotel was clearly dedicated to us having a great experience.

The hotel is modern and has a little swank in their decoration which we liked. The rooms are not huge, but they are not tiny either. We worried that they were as small as the sister hotel ""Hudson"" in NYC, but the room was larger than that and worked out fine. Excellent beds and pillows, and a nice bathroom as well.There are no ice cube machines, so you will want to call down for a bucket of ice. When we did, it arrived within 5 minutes.

The location is excellent - right opposite dukes of york theater (where we went to see King Lear), and 4 minutes from Leicester sq and the associated tube stop. We were able to get all over London in minutes (including catching the Arsenal opener). Plenty of restaurants around in walking distance (some of which I have reviewed).

We are motivated to come back to this hotel based on this experience. Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,17
125,Still amazing,"Went back to St. Martins Lane, this time with the family. I must say that the stay was better than the first time. Nice studio room, perfect to accommodate all of us. Service was also better, front desk and all staff all friendly and attentive. This time we tried breakfast for the whole duration of the stay. Although everything was delicious, I think it lacked variety. Continue to love SML and will definitely keep going back.",4,2018,08,14
125,Designer Style Over Practical Comforts,"First off, the location of the hotel is great. I think one of best you can have in London. The staff and especially the concierge staff is very friendly and courteous and always eager to help. That said, the hotel does not feel like a 5-star hotel.The rooms are cold, not personal and lot of space wasted in interest of designer layouts. We were in a deluxe room and did check out the room with garden terrace for an upgrade. However, we decided to stay in the deluxe room as the garden was basically a sky open, very small area right at the entrance of the room and with that the room looks even more cramped. The lobby of the hotel has all the designer chairs and furniture and there is no warmth there. Generally, I expect a comfortable lobby in a 5 star hotel where one can conduct quick meetings over coffee or a drink.",3,2018,08,13
125,Great location ,"St Martins Lane is that kind of hotel you end up staying because of all the buzz. It‚Äôs modern, fancy, stylish... but above all its great staff and concierge service really helps you to have a great British experience. And its location is a must",4,2018,08,11
125,Great stay,"We had room 521, a Loft Suite. It was not a suite in the normal sense, but a larger room than usual, with a large sofa, king size bed, fridge, kettle, desk etc. Nice rooftop views from corner windows. The usual white decor, with coloured lighting, and lots of USB charging points, plugs etc.  Wifi was free but not great. There was a large bathroom with a bath, separate shower and wc. 
We had booked a Champagne package and had to ring room service a couple of times to chase the Champagne, but when it did arrive it was accompanied by a slice of birthday cake - neither of us had mentioned that it was partner's birthday, so they must have worked it out from his booking, which was nice. The staff were helpful in finding the car park (left, left and left again) where we had pre-booked online.
The room was quiet despite it being a Saturday night in a busy area of London, and the location is fantastic.",4,2018,08,08
125,Hotel ,"My wife and I have stayed in most of London‚Äôs 5 star hotel but we live this hotel the staff know us very well now and  are so nice we always stay in the same room with a little private garden it is beautiful.

Location is everything it is the in the heart of London the place is vibrant with tourists and locals.",5,2018,08,04
125,Brilliant,"I‚Äôve stayed here several times over the past year and always had a great experience. Rooms are excellent, room service perhaps best I‚Äôve experienced and staff very attentive particularly in the restaurant. The Blind Spot is a great find. No hesitation to recommend it.",5,2018,08,03
125,Nice stay in an modern and well located hotel,"We stayed in a deluxe room, it was very modern, comfortable and spacious. The hotel location couldn't be better, it was within a walkable distance of all major attractions. The staff was friendly and helpful. We didn't try the food but it seemed to be good.",4,2018,08,02
125,Incredible Service in an Incredible Hotel!,"I was lucky enough to have won a nights stay at this hotel through a competition I entered back in December and decided to redeem it for my husbands birthday. The reservationist I dealt with was very helpful when making my booking via email. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with a very warm welcome and the front desk staff wished my husband a happy birthday which was a nice touch. Our room on arrival was ice cold but after being on a hot and sticky tube this was more than welcome! Also, once we located the controls this was easy to change. In the room there was also a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates to help start the birthday celebrations! Breakfast was really lovely, not your average continental breakfast with lot's of healthier options to choose from and the service, again was impeccable. On leaving we asked if we could leave our bags and this was not a problem, and once we picked them up at the end of the day the concierge could not do enough for us and managed to run up the road to hail us a taxi. First class service!

The room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The location was perfect! We really couldn't have asked for more from a hotel and will certainly look to stay here again next time we visit London. Thank you so much for making my husbands birthday extra special!",5,2018,07,31
125,Celebrating the Missus's birthday,"For 'her' birthday I had booked seats to see Aidan Turner in the Lieutenant of Innishmore at the Noel Coward theatre in St Martins Lane and was looking for a suitable and close hotel and I discovered this.  Don't know why I have missed it before being a Londoner and always around Covent Garden. Anyway, what a very, very pleasant surprise.

Set right in the heart of theatreland, this is a substantial but quirky and beautifully designed hotel. A big bonus is the Q underground car park accessed at the rear. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. The room was superb. I had booked a Garden de luxe and although 'garden' is a bit of a misnomer, it had its private small nicely designed outside terrace.

The room itself was extremely well appointed, nice sized bed, beautiful linen, great lighting, all very techno, super bathroom area and lots of bits and pieces such as a La Vazza coffee machine.

The cabinet not only had the usual drinks but a side drawer contained a number of items which could be purchased, such as earphones, a pickmeup shot and, ahem, two condoms in a box for those who, well, use them.

We ate out (see review of Tredwells) but had breakfast which was first rate.

Loved it and will certainly return.",5,2018,07,31
125,"Amazing stay, amazing hotel!","Had an incredible stay last weekend with my 9 year old daughter.
The staff couldn't do enough for us and our 4th floor loft room was stunning.

Special thanks to Mike the concierge, he was AMAZING. Mike organised excellent tickets for me and my daughter for the Lion King. He recommended an excellent vegan fast food restaurant ""Chloe's"" in Covent Garden and took time to find out whether we enjoyed it the following morning. His personality is infectious and he made such a fuss of my daughter, she is still talking about him a week later! 

Every single member of staff at the hotel is incredibly friendly and it feels like such a warm, and non-intimidating environment. Some other luxury London hotels can feel pretentious and stuffy and St Martins Lane is the complete opposite- it's the happiest hotel I have ever stayed in. 

From the minute we arrived we were warmly welcomed and checked in by the lovely front desk ladies Andrea and Vera. My daughter was made to feel very special by the front desk staff. 

Belle arranged our wonderful room, also arranging champagne and lovely cookies to be sent up to the room which was a lovely touch. 

In the afternoon we enjoyed drinks and snacks on the outdoor terrace, it was lovely and peaceful in a shaded area with very good service. 
 
We had an amazing breakfast which catered excellently for my vegan/vegetarian requirements and was served by Vicki who made a fuss of my daughter and took time to check everything was ok. The manager Daniele made a point to come over and check we were happy and to wish us a great stay, 

I honestly can't fault this hotel, the staff are fun, friendly and very professional and it is a very well run hotel which I cannot wait to return to soon.",5,2018,07,27
125,Outstanding Service,"Had a great service experience at this hotel, the Team at the reception was very friendly and helpful - especially Vera, Viki and Ahmet provided great advise/ help re finding restaurants, taxi's and printing a document for me...Great team and looking forward to come back- keep it up! Cheers Martin",5,2018,07,25
125,Great birthday treat,Booked a last minute break at st Martins lane and had a wonderful time. Staff super friendly especially the man with glasses on reception. It was a birthday trip and we had a bottle of bubbly with compliments  for belle which was a welcome surprise. ,4,2018,07,22
125,The Den Afternoon Tea,"Of the afternoon teas I‚Äôve been to, this remains my absolute favourite. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious and plentiful, and the surroundings are beautiful and quirky. We booked afternoon tea here for a special occasion and it far exceeded our expectations. Loved it. Can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough!",5,2018,07,21
125,A great modern hotel in central London,"We had a lovely stay at St Martins Lane Hotel. It was exactly as advertised: great location, airy space, scrupulously clean, fantastic bed, discreet staff and wonderful views. It is a high end boutique hotel with hip services, but not pushy about it all: partake of their evening vibe or head out on your own adventures.",5,2018,07,19
125,Ticked all my boxes,"I spent 2 periods at the St Martins Lane in June, once for 10 nights then later in the month for 12 nights. The hotel ticked all my boxes. Excellent convenient location, friendly co operative staff and a room that was modern, spacious and clean. By London standards (an important qualification) it was good value. Staff I would single out was a  concierge named Diogo who was exceedingly helpful and a friendly young man in the breakfast area whose name I do not know but was of Nepalese descent. Housekeeping was excellent. I would ring to have my room serviced before leaving for breakfast and on almost every occasion it was completed or near completed on my return. No complaints and I would be my first choice on any return visit to London.",5,2018,07,16
125,Our favourite hotel in London! ,"Amazing location, beautiful spacious rooms and staff that go out of their way to make your stay perfect!

This is our hotel of choice when staying in London. We have stayed in other London other hotels but they just don‚Äôt have the same wow factor. The location is perfect - just a short stroll away from Leicester Square. The rooms are beautifully designed and spotlessly clean. My husband and I first stayed in this hotel a few years back for a weekend getaway without the children but we have since been back every year with the kids in tow (who love it just as much as we do!). Belle is amazing every time and always goes out of her way to ensure our stay is perfect - making sure we have a chilled bottle of champagne in the room when it‚Äôs just the two of us, or cupcakes and a surprise gift when we visited for my little girls birthday. It‚Äôs the attention to detail and the amazing staff that make us come back time and time again! ",5,2018,07,15
125,"Location, Location, Location","Fantastic location, excellent service, anticipated all my needs.  Michael Fitzgerald, the concierge, is the BEST!  Theatre and restaurants all within walking distance.  Hotel very modern, very upscale, the place to stay in London.  ",5,2018,07,15
125,"Beautiful modern hotel, great location","Beautiful modern hotel which has been decorated very aesthetically. The rooms are built for style as well as convenience with an espresso machine and mood lighting being among the various nice features. The hotel has a lovely bar and restaurant, and access to a large modern gym (Gym Box).

The location could not be better - in the heart of central London a few minutes away from Trafalgar Square / Covent Garden / Leicester Square. Plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. Very close to the Leicester square tube station. Highly recommend this hotel, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely return.",5,2018,07,14
125,Sanctuary in the city,"With friendly staff, tasty food, great cocktail's and a lovely atmosphere this really is a sanctuary in the city! Thanks for going over and above at every opportunity and making sure we were looked after guys.",5,2018,07,11
125,Great London Hotel where the People are the Experience,"I've always loved St Martins Lane- it's a classic hotel with just the right amount of luxury. I was booking some VIP's during a very busy week and Isabel and Daniele took excellent care of them. They really went above and beyond to accommodate their special requests and were super responsive and helpful through the whole process. There are a lot of great hotels in the area, but the people at SML really make the experience- thank you for wow'ing them, Isabel and Daniele!",5,2018,07,10
125,A Blind Spot on the West End of London,"We thoroughly enjoyed out stay here!  The funky decor was just as engaging as the 80s music in the lobby of this boutique hotel.  You are greeted by the friendly staff at the check in desk when leaving and arriving back to the hotel. The location was in close proximity to the theater district, Covent Garden, Trafalgar and Leicester Square and the tube and train stations for quick access to everywhere London. For us, visiting Windsor Castle and Hackney from St Martin's Lane was simple. 

The rooms are unique and well appointed.  I am used to rooms much bigger but was not disappointed.  The designers have done a nice job making it feel spacious with the bath and bathroom glass enclosure and entries to the bed side of the room on 2 sides. The housekeeping staff kept our coffee service well stocked.  It was a treat to come back to enjoy the turn down service with the fancy lighting option over our bed. The upgrade with the patio enclosure added to the spaciousness feel.  For this time of year, the complimentary umbrella in our room was put to use. 

The gym box which offered workout services located outside the lobby next door was not so convenient. To enjoy the city so much walking replaced the daily workout for me. I did miss a pool or jacuzzi. 

The daily breakfast for us was included in our package.  The buffet breakfast, quite pleasing included scrambled eggs, sausages, pastries, fruits, cheeses coffee, and juice.  If you should choose to order from the menu, try the halloumi cheese, asparagus and field mushroom offering. I continue to make this delicious and memorable meal at home today. Onsite though, you will be pleasantly surprised when you turn a blind eye to the Hotel's Blind Spot for a nightcap.",5,2018,07,10
125,Classy Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed at the Hotel for 4 night in June 2018. Having stayed at the Mondrian previously we knew we liked the hotel chain and were deciding between St Martins Lane and Sanderson, in the end we choose St Martins Lane and we‚Äôre pleased we did. 

The stay at St Martins Lane was in advance of flying to Italy for our wedding, the hotel made note of this and provided us a complementary bottle of prosecco and sweet treats which was a nice touch! 

The hotel is perfectly located on the outskirts of Covent Garden right next to Trafalgar Square. This meant that in the mornings we were able to go for a run along the river which we loved. The Hotel has plenty of restaurants and bars around it providing everything from cheap eats / take away to luxury dining. 

The hotel room is large for London, and feels even larger due to the fabulous floor to ceiling windows. The bed is extremely comfortable and there are plenty of mirrors, charging points, plugs, storage space etc. The room lighting can be changed depending on the mood which we liked. Great turndown service (although a little early in the evening for us).

We made use of GymBox next door which is quite an experience and not your usual style of gym. The complimentary gym kit washing service is a brilliant idea! It was a quick turnaround service and therefore very convenient for daily gym visits. 

We had room service from the Hotel one evening ‚Äì the chicken caeser salad was incredible! (Not a usual thing to comment in a review on but it really was good!). 

We will definitely stay here again when next in London.",5,2018,07,10
125,Amazing at all aspects!,"Spent 2 days with my family, this one is one of the best!
Rooms are big and luxuriously decorated, everything was well thought about, very clean and well maintained.
As for the staff - it gets even better! they are wonderful, always checking to see if you need anything and all you need is taken care of quickly and efficiently - and with a great smile.
Breakfast is served in their restaurant and as it is, it's an amazing one.
all and all, 5 out of five but believe me, I would have given them more!",5,2018,07,06
125,Mid week break,"I stayed at the st  martins in July , the room very clean and nice layout , bright  and the air con a welcome addition that worked well I could not fault and i can be a bit of a stickler. We have stayed at the one Aldwych and the Covent Garden hotel and this room in my opinion was the best. Location is fantastic no matter which direction you go once you are out of the hotel you hit either Covent Garden , leceister square or Trafalger Square perfect !!!!

Breakfast was lovely and a great choice of dishes i had the avocado with poached eggs and sour bread, buffet table was like a picture well kept and well stocked ( breakfast is served until 11.30) . 

The public areas are quirky and can seem a bit bare but once you delve a little further the public areas have hidden secrets ( look closely at the pictures in the den !!)  and Rita who showed us around the Den was charming ( and very obvious she thoroughly enjoys her work ) all the staff we encountered were polite and helpful. 

I would have no hesitation in returning to the st martins hotel .",5,2018,07,06
125,Pretty nice - cleaner version of W and great location,"Stayed here few days for business. Has a bit of a modern hip decor / style similar to the W hotels but much brighter (and cleaner)!.   The rooms are ok sized but very clean, functional and my 2nd floor view had a nice balcony view. Hotel is minutes walk away from Convent Garden theater and Trafalgar square.",5,2018,06,30
125,Great location!,"This hotel is close to the theaters, Churchill War Rooms, Museums, Covent Gardens...
Breakfast in the morning is wonderful.  It also has double beds so families don't have to book two rooms which is rare in Europe unless you get a suite.",5,2018,06,24
125,Very small but modern rooms,"Very modern with regards to british standars, however the rooms are extremely small and there is not much room for anything else than the bed. The breakfast is okay but quity pricey.

Great location, if you are looking for staying at at central part of the city.",4,2018,06,21
125,Our home in London ,"So we went back, again. We go to London 1-2 Times‚Äô per year. And we keep going back to the same hotel. There is just something about the St Martins Lane Hotel. It‚Äôs cool, fresh, quiet, minimalistic and have great beds. The location could not be better with walking distance to Bond Street, Opera or Theatre district. If you don‚Äôt want to spend 20 GBP on breakfast, head to Pret a Manger across the street and spend less than half. Try getting a room on high floors and low number, will guarantee you a nice view of Nelson.... Enjoy! ",5,2018,06,21
125,AMAZING ROOMS,"I booked here a suite. Was in town for work. Room service was amazing, rooms just perfect, perfect location. Bathrooms are very big and that's what u need after a long working day. Book it now and enjoy it!",5,2018,06,20
125,My New Favorite Hotel,"I am a frequent traveler so I tend to be quite picky about my 
accomodations. When in a city even more so. St Martins Lane 
London exceeded all my expectations.  The rooms, the people
that work there , the Location Location Location, the food.
You can‚Äôt stay anywhere better.  But they did go one better
with their concierge service, led by the fantastic 
Michael Fitzgerald.   He goes so far above and beyond he 
is off the scale!

125,Des R,I was at an AGM meeting Friday 15th June and the service was excellent along with the Hot & Cold Buffet which was served at our tables in the Restaurant. The staff were superbt and well trained. Nothing was too much trouble when asked.,4,2018,06,19
125,Marvellous service,"We stayed for a long weekend at the hotel with our disabled mother. 
As always their service was great and very friendly. 
At the airport we found out the rollator was still at the hotel, but thanls to Ricardo and rest of the staff it was delivered just before our glight left!!
",5,2018,06,17
125,GREAT STAY,"I was staying there for just a night in June! Was really really great. From the start at the reception to the end at the check was nice. Everyone was nice and helpful.
the drinks at the Blind Sport were delicious.
For sure, I will just the St. Martins's Lane Hotel for my next stay!",5,2018,06,16
125,My favorite in London,"This is my 4 time in this hotel...
the hotel is very Young‚Äôs do modern.
Very very clean hotel, Both rooms and public areas ... 
Great location, and 2 minuets walks from tube station 
The breakfast is nice, a little bit expensive ...but still  it‚Äôs worth it

 ",5,2018,06,15
125,You couldn‚Äôt pay me to stay here again!,"Stinky, I mean STINKY room, filthy linen. Really, did you think I wouldn‚Äôt notice dirty towels? Reused with someone‚Äôs makeup on them? Freakishly tacky decor, an elevator that booms Muzak and has videos. The location is good, that‚Äôs all. Never again.",1,2018,06,15
125,Too brief,"Really enjoyed a 1 night stay here. Top location....even the cheapest room came up trumps for what we wanted. Cool, comfortable, quiet and clean. Glad we didnt upgrade at check in. Staff all helpful and professional...but location location location.",4,2018,06,11
125,When things go perfectly,"In London for six nights for business and fun. I am a Lifetime Platinum at Marriott but this trip decided to stay at the St Martins Lane. Brilliant as they say. Fantastic location- but quiet street. Rooms are great and well designed but comfortable and welcoming. Most important here is the exceptional staff- just about perfect. Special Kudos to Diogo and Michael who ‚Äúmade the trip‚Äù. If I had a hotel in London I would steal them. So all in all from a critical New Yorker quadruple thumbs up. 

Not only will I come back here but I will explore the other SBE Hotels.",5,2018,06,05
125,"Great hotel, lovely staff and perfect location","We stayed at the hotel for our trip to the Queens Garden party -  a special day made even more special by the excellent team at St Martin's Lane.
From the moment we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly and professional front of house, who were able to help with an early check-in so we would be ready in time.
We were left a lovey note in the room to wish us a lovely day and on leaving the following same staff were genuinely interested in our stay and comfort.
While at the hotel we visited the quirky Blind Spot cocktail bar for an excellent cocktail and took breakfast, which was of a very high quality and varied
I would highly recommend this hotel for leisure and business travellers alike as you get a different / better London Hotel experience, with a great location thrown in.
Thank you also to Sonia Hicks who looked after our booking",5,2018,06,04
125,Fabulous afternoon tea!,"I went to St Martins Lane Hotel for afternoon tea with my mother yesterday. We had a very early booking as we were heading to the theatre for a matinee. We have had afternoon tea all across London (The Ritz, Savoy, Sketch to name just a few) and I have to say the quality of service here far exceeded any of the others. We were welcomed at the door by name as we were looking a little lost! The food was also fabulous, on par with The Savoy I would say. Inesa and her colleagues went out of their way to ensure we had a fabulous time, we even received complementary glasses of Prosecco due to a slight booking mix up (which may have been our fault!) and a complimentary birthday dish as it was my mother's birthday. We definitely will be back again!",5,2018,05,31
125,Great location for a short stay,"Stayed here with my daughter following an organised garden tour this week for 6 nights. We knew this hotel was ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and quirky, however it wasn‚Äôt clinical. Our room had the best twin beds of any place we stayed at recently with a very comfortable double each. The room was compact but usable. The bathroom was a highlight with a stand alone shower instead of the ubiquitous shower/bath combo. Wifi was excellent as was the standard of cleanliness and customer service, which was maintained throughout the hotel. Breakfast was really nice with the choice of a comprehensive buffet together with ordering from the menu which was more interesting than most hotels with a Cuban influence. If you dont have much time in London, this hotel is next door to the National Gallery, National Porttrait Gallery, theatres, Convent Garden with lots of choice for food, culture and entertainment.",4,2018,05,30
125,Premier location,"My 2nd time in this quite nice hotel. Really friendly service this time in the desk. She made me buy an upgrade. But again in the 1st floor? Please tell me is the 1st floor for not wanted visitors or for the mostly welcomed?
The room was nice. The amenities were some low quality stuff. No more Malin + Goetz .
One morning the housekeeping lady did not visit my room. I asked the desk and they were really impolite. Hey guys, you don't pay enough your employees.
This time Asia de Cuba was nice.",4,2018,05,25
125,"Great location, amazing cocktails","Stayed with 2 friends mid-week in January. We had a great room that we could all share with everything that you would expect. The bar had a great feel about it, the food and service in the restaurant were pretty good. Should feel a bit more 'wow' on the whole than it does...... reception welcome not the best it could have been, but that said good hotel and great location.",4,2018,05,22
125,Great Location - Nothing Special,"The best thing about this hotel is its location. Located just around the corner from Trafalgar Square. The rooms are neat modern and compact, in fact a little disappointing so we upgraded to a large corner room after seeing the first offering. 

Couldn't really fault this trendy hotel for our 2 nights but to us it was just a room. Breakfast was very mediocre, staff all very pleasant. I would just about slide it into the recommend bracket if you want to be in this area.",3,2018,05,22
125,Perfect weekend at London's most beautiful hotel,"St Martins Lane provided the most perfect weekend away for my fianc√©e and her bridal party, and could not have been any more helpful to ensure they all had an amazing time! This hotel has been our favourite in London for nearly a decade now and has only got better over the years. If you're after friendly staff, perfect location, and beautiful decor, then this is the hotel for you. The food in the restaurant, Asia de Cuba, was delicious and the cocktails in Blind Spot were also a hit! 

A massive thank you to Belle for helping us to organise the entire trip - she's an absolute credit to St Martins Lane. Until next time!",5,2018,05,20
125,I am buggered now cannot go anywhere else amazing,"Amazing had one issue with cleanliness and I have OCD the cleaner elena helped and was amazing,all staff brilliant customer service second to none and the manager in restaurant fantastic hope to go back soon love all the windows in my superior room as when you have mental illness you can feel trapped not in there rooms I felt like I was outside thankyou for everything see you soon",5,2018,05,17
125,Stunning hotel in perfect location,"We came here for an anniversary weekend in March, and I booked the hotel purely because it was next door to the Coliseum, where we were watching the ENO. When we arrived we weren't sure what to expect, as the outside of the hotel is pretty unassuming to say the least, but once we got inside we were completely bowled over. It's just stunning - so much to take in, and yet very minimalist in style. It's a feast for the eyes, and that's just the reception area. Our room was gorgeous and light, the bed was supremely comfortable and the bathroom was elegant and stylish. There was a lovely surprise treat from the hotel waiting in our room when we returned from the opera too, which was completely unexpected and very much appreciated. We've already agreed that this will be the only hotel we'll stay in when we're in London!",5,2018,05,16
125,The experience keeps getting better,"We‚Äôve stayed at St Martin‚Äôs Lane hotel several times over the years and it has consistently been an excellent experience. The hotel is stylishly appointed and in the heart of central London. The rooms are done in a contemporary aesthetic, with just the right kind and amount of furniture. But it‚Äôs the staff that really make this place shine-from the wonderful people at the reception to the people at Asia de Cuba and the lobby staff. They are warm, helpful and gracious. One of them, and unfortunately I didn‚Äôt ask his name, swopped my outdated ten pound bills from his wallet to save me a special trip to the bank. The staff at the front desk are committed to making our stay hospitable. I wish I could name them all. Diego, who is a concierge, is wonderful and helpful. Vicky, Anthony, Jacob, Carlos and Salim treat us with excellent care. Ricardo and Ahmed, who are part of the lobby staff, are great. Many thanks to you all. ",5,2018,05,14
125,Simply stunning!,"I had booked the St Martins Lane hotel as part of a birthday weekend for my partner. I was torn between The Sanderson and St Martins Lane, but chose this for its location to the theatre that we were visiting. From the moment that I booked the team were emailing me to ask if there was anything that they could do in preparation for our arrival to ensure that we had the best possible stay. I informed them of my partner‚Äôs bday and they promised to make sure it was special. 
On arriving in the beautiful hotel I was asked if I‚Äôd be interested in an upgrade to a junior loft suite... well, it‚Äôd be rude not to!
I‚Äôm so glad we did as the room was fabulous - so spacious, exquisitely decorated (I love the leopard print carpets!) and bursting with luxury. 
(The mini bar is definitely one of the most expensive I‚Äôve come across so we steered clear of it)
I‚Äôd booked pre-theatre cocktails in Blind Spot and it was magical as we stepped through the hidden door into the sultry, decadent hideaway. The drinks were great and the service was second to none. 
After enjoying Dreamgirls at the Savoy Theatre we headed back to the hotel for our dinner reservation in Asia De Cuba. The restaurant was buzzing and once more we were treated to exceptional service - even replacing my gin and tonic when I (drunkenly) knocked it over! The food was beautiful!
On returning to our room we were greeted by a bottle of prosecco with a ‚Äòhappy birthday‚Äô note. 
After a sound sleep in our suite we padded down to breakfast. The buffet alone was tremendous and the great cooked choice (we went for the full English) was superb. The staff were really attentive, so we didn‚Äôt mind that we waited quite a while for our hot food. 
This is definitely one o& the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed in - not just for its style, but also for its staff. They really make it wonderful to be there. 
Can‚Äôt wait to return. ",5,2018,05,14
125,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"Highly recommend Afternoon Tea in ‚ÄòThe Den‚Äô.  It‚Äôs a quirky, comfortable room, on the small side but this is a boutique hotel and perfect for what we were looking for, with the unique art work adding an extra interest. Service was attentive and professional, savoury offerings delicious and above and beyond the usual finger sandwiches of the traditional afternoon tea. Cakes and scones were outstanding, beautifully presented and freshly made. The tea we chose included a complementary glass of prossecco alongside a good selection of tea‚Äôs, coffee‚Äôs and water that was unlimited in your two hour sitting. Very generous portions, we couldn‚Äôt finish everything and we arrived hungry. They were happy to pop our uneaten cakes in a box to take home, again, lovely touch. Definitely will return ",5,2018,05,10
125,Excellent Stay In Central London,"Couldn't beat the location right in the heart of Covent Garden, bedroom was a great size too especially for London! We enjoyed one night here as a weekend away and had a very good stay. Nice bar downstairs too.",5,2018,05,10
125,Perfect room/amazing staff,"I have stayed in this hotel annually (at least) every year since it opened in 1997. It has maintained its high quality. And the location in the West End is ideal for theatre and experiencing London. 
I stayed in the great garden room, which remains my favourite hotel room in the world I enjoyed the garden area almost every day. And even when one does not go out, the outdoor area adds great atmosphere to the room.
I was also really well treated by the staff. It is amazing how many people work so long at the hotel, which must be a great place to work. I was warmly greeted by many people who remembered me from prior visits, especially in the dining room. That really adds a lot to the experience",5,2018,05,08
125,"Wonderful refuge, perfect location, excellent/warm service...","Great location - chic, modern hotel, extremely comfortable with all conveniences. Warm staff, excellent service: from fellow who brought us to our room, very knowledgeable and friendly concierge (no attitude at all), waiters in The Den and Asia de Cuba, front desk -- everyone so friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was first rate: delicious, with a variety of choices.  We had a fifth floor deluxe room with city view: quiet and oh so comfortable!. We had a wonderful stay and will certainly return. Cheers to all at the St. Martin's Lane!  Perfect.",5,2018,05,07

Two minutes to Covent Garden and walking distance to all major attractions.
Highly recommend to consider staying if you are visiting London.",5,2018,05,05
125,Friendly staff but ‚Äúcold‚Äù hotel rooms. ,"I stayed at the st Martin‚Äôs lane hotel 3 nights on a business trip. 
While I thought the staff was very good and friendly, the hotel rooms were very small, and the modern look made them impersonal and ‚Äúcold‚Äù. Everything was white except for the neon light... 
overall not my most pleasant hotel stay in London. ",3,2018,05,04
125,Daughter‚Äôs birthday,Stayed here with my 14yr old daughter and my husband. There were two beds in the Room which were described as double beds. However both beds were small double beds and therefore was a bit of a squeeze for me and the husband! The daughter on the other hand had a lovely sleep!!,4,2018,05,03
125,"Modern environment, Great Location","Quite new hotel, informal and modern environment, great location, good bars inside, very supportive staff. Not exactly cheap, but regular for this kind of hotel in London. Rooms are smalls but facilities and amenities are very good. It worth as an option if you want to stay near Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden.

125,Top end price but not too end experience ,"Stayed with a friend on a Monday night as we were going to the theatre for her birthday. I booked directly with hotel and when we checked in we had been upgraded to a loft suite. So far so good!
The room (437) was lovely. Lots of windows, nice and airy. Unfortunately, it was right next to the lift.
The bathroom was large. Separate bath. Lots of big fluffy towels. The usual Free toiletries and items that you may have forgotten to bring, available for purchase.
The shower was powerful, but water didn‚Äôt drain away. I hate this. Standing in dirty water as the drain is clearly clogged with hair. Not nice or expected in a hotel of this standard.
We headed straight out for dinner so didn‚Äôt use restaurant or bar. 
We came back after theatre and went straight to the room. It was a work night and neither of us were drinking. 
The room had 2 double beds. No turndown service that I could tell. Curtains weren‚Äôt drawn, bins weren‚Äôt emptied etc.
Mood lighting (different colours around head board).
The problem came when we realised lying there in silence, how noisy the lift shaft was. My friend had earplugs, I unfortunately did not. I had a pillow over my head to get to sleep.
The room in the morning was quite bright (from all the individual sets of curtains) so you might want to pack an eye mask as well.
We had breakfast included in room rate. We both opted for cooked breakfast.
The produce seemed of good quality. However, toast was cold, poached eggs over cooked, hash potatoes were raw and inedible. Immediately wish I‚Äôd gone for pancakes instead.
Buffet selection was good and the service was attentive and friendly.
On check out, I advised of shower not draining and that earplugs should be provided in the suite as the lift was so noisy, and I was curtly told that ‚Äòno one has ever said anything before‚Äô. Not sure what I was meant to say to that, so we left.
I filled in hotel survey that was emailed and explained the above. I‚Äôve since received a reply that next time I stay to contact the manager and I‚Äôd receive a room upgrade and a bottle of champagne. I may consider if I need to be in the area again.

125,good but not great,"I have been meaning to try this hotel for a few years since i love the asia de cuba restaurant.  But after a two night stay I would not return,.  It was fine, but that's it, just fine.  I did not prefer the plastic furniture motif -- modern is fine but it felt cheap.  And it may be more suited for the 20 something age group who wants to impress their friends instead of a seasoned traveler who values comfort and functionality of a room.   And if you are not going to the theatre, you will find the neighborhood difficult -- impossible to get a cab with the crazy busy street.   I will stay elsewhere next time.",4,2018,05,02
125,A bit confused!,"This place comes over as a bit confused as to what it is. It‚Äôs almost a boutique hotel but not quite, almost a 5 star but again not quite there.

The positives: The staff are all 100% so the service is impeccable and the entire place is spotlessly clean. It is in the perfect location for ‚Äòtheatre land‚Äô , Covent Garden et al.

Negatives: I have not stayed in London for quite some time so am a bit out of touch with prices but ¬£195 a night for a room where two passing each other have to turn sideways to get through and the bed had no bedside tables, looks to me to be a bit on the heavy side but then I am out of date so perhaps this is the norm now.

I appreciate other, larger, rooms are available +1 Sq. M for +¬£37 (as I write) +11 Sq.M for + ¬£42 and so on 

We were offered a 50% discount on breakfast so only ¬£18 each! That puts it at ¬£36 at normal price. Sorry NO breakfast is worth ¬£36.

You pay (highly) for location convenience.",3,2018,04,30
125,Not impressed. Boutique style hotel with poor poor service. ,"An expensive hotel in the centre of London. Nicely refurbished and good location but dreadfully lacking in service. 

We had booked afternoon tea in advance - as a birthday treat - and had been phoned back by the hotel to ask if our timing could be moved back to 5pm because the room was booked for a function. We agreed but asked for assurance that service would be prompt since we had tickets for a show. 

At 5pm the room had no evidence of any function; was empty; no tables prepared and all the lights off. One employee told us tea was finished. Another that if we took a seat (in the dark???) the kitchen would be advised and would prepare some tea. Not acceptable. We went elsewhere. No apology - just a shrug of the shoulders. 

Reception couldn‚Äôt even provide a street map of the neighbourhood - Covent Garden - only a tour bus operators‚Äô free map of London - with no street names shown around our location. The receptionist hadn‚Äôt heard of Drury Lane (5 minutes walk away) and started looking it up on google maps when asked for directions. Really? Is it too much to ask for a street map of the immediate vicinity?

The ‚Äòsuperior‚Äô room booked had little room to pass each other and a small double bed. We were shown the ‚Äòwalk in toilet and shower‚Äô - how else would you get in - which simply meant that there wasn‚Äôt a door. The coffee machine had no power point within reach so had to be carried to the floor. (We found an extension lead later in the hairdryer box). An extension lead in what was supposed to be a specially designed room. üòÇ

A pre- authorisation on the credit card, for extras, wasn‚Äôt needed because we didn‚Äôt charge any extras. It should have just been voided but we were told, with a smile, that ¬£100 had been taken already and would be returned to our account within about a week. Such is the hotel policy. ",2,2018,04,27
125,Elegance and location,"This is a real treat if you can spend the money. The location is so easy to walk to Trafalgar Square, National Portrait Gallery etc. Rooms beautiful, breakfasts amazing and the bars stay open late. Staff are on their game.",5,2018,04,24
125,"Excellent hotel, very comfortable, great staff","We stayed in St Martins Hotel for one night while in London to watch the marathon. The staff at the hotel were superb from the check-in all the way through to collecting our luggage (which they kept safe for us) hours after check out. 

The room was very comfortable, with plenty of space, good amenities and no signs of wear or distress in any of the furniture or fittings. 

Its location just 2 minutes walk from Leicester Square underground station, as well as all the above, make it a great hotel to stay at. Fully recommend.",5,2018,04,23
125,Stylish and modern West End hotel,"Stayed one night in a deluxe garden room.
We chose this hotel as it was close to the theatre. Location can't be bettered - Theatreland, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden all a short walk away, and yet it has a very calm, relaxing ambience in the busy heart of the West End. Interesting to note a scent like aromatherapy candles in the corridors, which I found very pleasant.
We had a deluxe garden room - all done in white with a small patio at the front. Furnishings are stylish, the bed large and comfortable, the bathroom large and modern. There were a number of nice touches: USB charging ports and Nespresso machine, for example. It was a hot weekend in London, but the patio was lovely and cool, and the air conditioning was quiet and effective. Some reviews have mentioned noise from the bar. We were on the first floor. I was aware of the bar when we went to bed, but it was more like a small vibration, and didn't disturb our sleep at all. Maybe the rooms could be better soundproofed against noise in corridors, but again our sleep was not disturbed.
Breakfast is always important to me on a weekend hotel stay, and this didn't disappoint. Maybe not quite the selection of fruit and juices I have seen at other hotels, but the pastries were delicious, and tasted freshly made. 
I suppose the only note of disappointment was the Blind Spot cocktail bar. We tried to enter after our return from the theatre but we were told it was full and they had no room. It would be nice if there was an option for hotel guests, but we weren't desperate for a drink so it didn't affect our enjoyment too much.
I would certainly return to this hotel. It's modern and trendy, while still being welcoming. Service was friendly and efficient. It's not cheap, but then nowhere is in central London.",5,2018,04,23
125,Great location,"I booked a 'Superior Double Room' for 1-night instead of their 'Standard Rooms'. And as I was only there for less than 1-night, I decided to not book their 'Deluxe Rooms'. 

I was given a room on the 2nd floor, which I wasn't too impressed with as I prefer higher-floored rooms. I also had high expectations for this hotel too which were not met.

Prior to the reservation, the e-mail communication between myself & staff were great! They were very helpful. But when it actually came to staying at the hotel, I was barely greeted by reception staff as they were talking amongst each other every time I saw them. However, the bellmen, housekeeping staff and staff I encountered with at the 'Blind Spot' bar were very friendly and helpful.

Also, I advised them we were celebrating a special occasion (birthday) which was barely acknowledged - the personalised birthday postcard was a nice gesture.

If you wish to receive first class service, I recommend booking directly with them & selecting a deluxe room or above that grade, like I have done in the past with themselves.

The location was great anyway.",3,2018,04,19
125,Great hotel in perfect place,"The hotel is located just 0,2 miles from the Trafalgar square. It is surrounded by lots of restaurants and cafes. The staff was very friendly and checking-in procedure was smooth. The room we got was quite tiny, but very comfortable. The shower room and amenities are very modern and comfortable. There was an iron, coffee maker and electric kettle, as well as a plug converter. The breakfast and coffee is very good. Everything of course is clean and well kept. Perfect hotel, if you can afford the price.",5,2018,04,17
125,It's worth the price,"This is a great hotel. Starting from the interior design and followed by amenities and extras. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. The room is comfortable with lots of light and bathroom is cool, modern and comfortable as well. It's impeccably clean, neat and guests are well taken care of. Even the music in the lobby and elevators is cool. Breakfast area is also very nice. Location can not be overstated - St. Martin's is in the heart of London with National Gallery, Royal Academy of Arts, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly and Covent Garden within minutes of walking distance. I would love to stay here again.",5,2018,04,16
125,Woe,"We arrived at the hotel after a long but enjoyable train journey from Yorkshire. We were presented with a beautiful garden courtyard room and had a lovely welcome from the most amazing gent Mike Fitzgerald. He made our stay extra special nothing was too much trouble. Beautiful hotel and great service in the bar. Great place, great location and wonderful people. ",5,2018,04,15
125,Excellent Location for Leicester Square,"Brought my wife to London  (her first time to London) to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We decided to stay around Leicester Square for this trip as we wanted to watch musical. We decided on St Martin Lane as it is a modern hotel and location of the hotel is excellent. It was less then 5 mins from the tube station. And its in the midst of all the actions from musical theatres to chinatown to convert garden etc, yet its quiet at night and safe.

The hotel is indeed a very modern concept (read its was decorated by Philippe Starck) and was recently renovated.  Upon reaching the hotel, you would noticed its slight different from the hotel you would expect. The decoration in the lobby was interesting with its art works and layout.

The room given to me was excellent. Very modern design, clean, very good use of space. Shower pressure was strong. And there is a light control where you can change the light of the room to suit your mood. The room is also full length glass panels, therefore it may get hot during the day with the sun shining into it. Nevertheless, the air conditioning was good. Overall, very satisfied with the room and the service of the staffs.",5,2018,04,14
125,Excellent,"We stayed for one night, for my Husband's birthday. Our room was upgraded for free, and we were also sent a chocolate brownie later that evening, with a handwritten note . The room was clean, fresh and sleek. Hotel staff were helpful. I would recommend a higher floor to get away from street noise if you're a light sleeper, or need a particularly undisturbed night.",5,2018,04,12
125,As Good as it Gets,"What a wonderful experience! Impeccable location. Nice, spacious room. Up to date. Highly competent and genuinely helpful employees. Nice beds. Efficient and timely room service. Great shower.  We stayed a full week and would intend to book there again.",5,2018,04,08
125,Amazing afternoon tea and service!,"Went for afternoon tea for my daughters 15th birthday and it was fantastically unique. I loved the different artwork and sculptures like the golden tooth chairs and the hand doorknob. The best afternoon tea I've ever been to! Keep in mind that we didn't stay at the hotel I'd just booked afternoon tea which was expensive but defintely worth it.The food was impeccable and my daughter was extremely pleased when they came out with a plate of hot caramel doughnuts saying 'Happy Birthday Daisy!' written in chocolate sauce. She received unlimited hot chocolate (of three flavours) and we had an amazing time chatting to the staff and stuffing our faces. Even when we took some of the leftover cakes and treats home and they'd been in the fridge for a couple of days they were as fresh and delicious as ever. Teenage friendly. I would reccomend our waitress Inesa, she was funny, bubbly and took many pictures of us as well as giving us a little tour of the place. Had to give her a big tip because she was just so kind and welcoming.",5,2018,04,08
125,"Superb location, special environment","Overall a very good stay with high class facilities and generally attentive staff. The location is superb close to tons of restaurants, theaters and bars. The room was a bit small for the 3 of us as it seems the 2 queen beds were forced into the available space. The mattresses were a bit larger than the beds so you could fell down off the bed if not aligned correctly. One of the chair legs had to protrude out over the path from beds to the exit door or toilets so we were hit few times accidentally especially at night. Overall I would stay here again.",4,2018,04,06
125,Great location ,"Have stayed here on numerous occasions when visiting London and have to say the location is great fro the West End theatres and restaurants.  The hotel is contemporary  and minimalist and although the rooms are not huge, they do feel well furnished and equipped.  Staff were attentive and polite.  All in all cannot fault the hotel and will continue to return.",4,2018,04,05
125,Superb,"Having stayed at the Sanderson which is the sister hotel of St Martins Lane, I was excited about staying here and comparing. Well, the hotel is on a par with The Sanderson, both hotels are equal in quality and comfort.

The bed is extremely comfortable and the shower and bathroom area are spacious. 

Complimentary water was in the room each day, along with an iron board, iron and hairdryer, which was of good quality.

St Martins is now my first choice of hotel in London. It's perfectly placed for all the attractions.",5,2018,04,04
125,Mr John neller,"The hotel was perfect, from the upgrade they gave us to its location, every member of staff was helpful and polite, room was stunning and quiet to the outside, breakfast is a must and was so delicious and catered for every culinary taste, thanks for making our short trip perfect and would definitely book with this hotel again",5,2018,04,02
125,Excellent ,"Can‚Äôt fault this hotel, staff were professional, helpful & friendly. Room was fantastic so comfortable. Breakfast was great . Location was excellent. Will definitely book this hotel on our next visit to London . Thank you ",5,2018,04,02
125,Wonderful hotel and location!,"My sister and I stayed for one night over the Easter weekend and had a wonderful time. We were in London to see Chicago and the hotel was ideally situated in the theatre district. The rooms are a little on the small side for the price we paid but apart from that, it was perfect. We were taken to our room by a lovely guy named Ricardo and found all staff members polite and friendly during our stay. We probably wouldn't order the breakfast next time but we will definitely be back! ",5,2018,04,02
125,Overall a good stay...,"This was our third stay over the years at St Martins Lane. Super clean. Great location. Helpful staff - especially the bellman. One of the few hotels in the area that have two double beds for a family of four. Only complaint was were are on the first floor and had I walk down to ask them to turn down the music from the restaurant, which could be heard clearly in our room at midnight. Strongly recommend a higher room is if you want quiet. Our first floor room also had a fair amount of noise from those smoking in the alleyway.",4,2018,04,01
125,Perfect location ,"Perfectly located hotel in the heart of everything easy to get to most places 
Our room was a bit small other than that room was nicely presented though 
Mini bar prices were ridiculous so didn‚Äôt bother with that! 
When we checked the receptionist asked us if we had plans that evening we explained we were had dinner reservations elsewhere so she suggested after dinner to go to the bar in the hotel she said it‚Äôs really nice so after dinner we came back to the hotel walked towards the door to the bar to be met by a bit of a stroppy woman asking if had a reservation which we said no she said we couldn‚Äôt go in!?
My husband went to have a look in the bar and she stood in his way said he was only having a look which she reluctantly agreed 
That was as far as we got a quick look.....
Annoying that receptionist didn‚Äôt tell us we would need a reservation and attitude of woman at door was annoying at best 
We had a quick drink in the bar in the restaurant which was nothing special 

The following morning we had a lovely breakfast in the room 

Overall was a great stay and we would return just remember to book if you want a drink in the bar! ",4,2018,03,29
125,Fabulous ,We‚Äôve always wanted to stay here but price prohibited us. Got a great deal on Expedia so jumped at the chance. Hotel was everything we hoped for and more. Rooms amazing and surprisingly spacious. Pricey drinks but as a treat considered it was ok. Besides plenty of places to eat and drink in the area at more reasonable prices.,5,2018,03,26
125,Theatre Trip,"Really nice hotel in a great location. A stones throw from most of the theatres and some nice tourist spots. If I had one very small barb, it would be that there were bottles in the mini bar, but for the life of me I couldn't find a bottle opener. Other than that it was awesome. I have never slept on a bed that big before.",5,2018,03,26
125,Great hotel stay,"Stayed for one night. Service from all staff very good and really nice room. Didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel but the bar area was very nice with a  music on Saturday lunch time and evening. 
Location is really good for Covent Garden or the theatres 
Looking forward to staying again sometime",5,2018,03,25
125,An absolute Gem! Great hotel and location,"The hotel and staff are an absolute fantastic gem. The hotel itself is very clean. Bed was comfortable and the room an adequate size.  The speakeasy bar has great ambiance, music and cocktails. The decor of the hotel is modern and fun. The area surrounding the hotel is rich with restaurants and scenery that made for easy walks to many sites. ",5,2018,03,25
125,2 blissfull nights,"What a great location for the theatres, restaurants and site seeing whilst away on holiday.
Went to drop our bags off before check-in at 10am was told our room is available.  This made the rest of the day for us fantastic......  good job from the attentive staff, super service from the front desk made the start to our holiday.
bed and room were comfortable, excellent shower. stay here you wont be disappointed",5,2018,03,21
125,Great Weekend Getaway,"We spent the weekend at St Martin's Lane Hotel and had a great time. The hotel is centrally located and ideal if you're going to see a show. A big plus is that hotel guests are able to use the facilities at Gym Box, which is right next door. Unfortunately, there was a private event this past weekend and we weren't able to try to the hotel's brunch, but the menu looks very good. 

The concierge, Diogo, was extremely helpful and found several great vegan/vegetarian spots for us during our stay. He was always friendly and went out of his way to help us. The next time that we're in London, we'll definitely stay here again!",5,2018,03,14
125,Revisited one of the best hotels in London ,"I have become a regular guest at the St Martins Lane not only for the great location but mostly for the excellent service, super comfortable rooms and the all excellent Asia the Cuba restaurant in the hotel.

If staying at the hotel always double check their website for last minute prices and indulge your self with a eg Studio room, preferably on a higher floor as the low floors facing the street can be a bit noisy.

To the staff at the hotel, from housekeeping to the front desk, love you all for making the stay enjoyable.",5,2018,03,14
125,"Still our number one hotel in London,","It's been a few months since our last visit but still worthy of a review!
We stayed over 2017/18 new year and found everything to be the same standard as normal. The Den was closed due to a private function which was disappointing but understandable but meant that we spent more time outside the hotel. The location is still one of the best available in London  and the rooms are clean, with great AC, excellent showers and very comfy beds and bed linens (one of the few hotels that I sleep in as well as at home!) 
You won't be disappointed!",5,2018,03,07
125,Lovely Hotel!,"I love staying here when going away for a shopping trip. Perfect location and stylish decor!! One thing that I really enjoy here is the breakfast, where you can choose between the buffet of off the menu, perfect! The staff are always lovely and helpful. Would recommend!!",4,2018,03,04
125,Excellent recommendation from previous reviewers,"Really enjoyed our stay.Great location, less than five minutes to Trafalgar Square in one direction and Covent Garden in another.Helpful staff, good breakfast, quiet despite activity outside hotel. Lived up to previous recommendations and will look to return
",5,2018,03,01
125,Best service ever,"The stance was amazing. The installations and the service was fantastic. The Spanish waiter Alejandro was very jealous and attentive with us in the Breakfast. 
The rooms are beautiful. The music in the hall of the hotel was wise.",5,2018,03,01
125,Stylish St. Martins Lane Hotel,I visit the St. Martins Lane quite frequently and is doesn't disappoint. Great area around the hotel and the property itself has a a great atmosphere with a young yet sophisticated crowd. The staff is very helpful and and the concierge has been excellent. The 'Blind Spot' speak easy is a must visit. My only complaint would be the hallways. The minimalist white walls tend to look great in the beginning of a renovation but after a while start to look worn. The hallways could use a pick-me-up but many hotels I have stayed at in all star ranges do. Overall I would highly recommend staying here you will not be disappointed.,4,2018,03,01
125,4th visit. Still great,"I love the theatre.  When in London, this is the effect location!  Breakfast complete with many great choices.  Beds are comfortable with multiple pillows.  Colored room lights adds ambience.  Staff were exceptionally helpful!  Screens in elevator, installation art, have broken screens, art (which is whimsical & fun) needs refreshing but these are minor matters.",5,2018,02,27
125,Wonderful weekend ,Spent 4 nights in this wonderful hotel. We were last here 16 years ago and enjoyed our stay. Still had the same enjoyable experience. We a had a corner room on a higher floor with a wonderful view of st Martin lane. Modern minimalist hotel and room. Central location with easy access to public transportation. Good service and friendly staff. Highly recommended. Will certainly return soon,5,2018,02,25
125,One of the nicest hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed at ,"This would have been my 6th time staying at the hotel. It‚Äôs always lovely to have someone greet you with an open car door (that isn‚Äôt over the top). 

As my father and sister both live in different countries it‚Äôs the perfect location to meet up for a weekend as it is situated in the heart of London. 

Throughout our stay everyone is always so kind and helpful - plus the housekeeping cannot be faulted. It‚Äôs a great place to bring younger children, with my sister only being 10 everyone is so kind and sweet! ",5,2018,02,25
125,"Still Excellent, Still Stylish, Still Ultimately Located","My third visit to this amazing hotel. It's always an exciting cab ride into central London to arrive at this perfect location. Staff as always greeted me in a professional, friendly manner, which isn't over the top. Throughout my stay, all staff were awesome. Always ready and willing to help with anything, but at the same time you don't feel suffocated like in some  luxury hotels 

The room as always was immaculately presented with the modern style i enjoy so much. The staples of any good hotel room are the bed and the bathroom, both are amazing at this hotel. Lovely quality comfortable bed and a spacious eye pleasing bathroom with a shower which has great water pressure.

Housekeeping, again can't be faulted.

This trip i finally dined at Asia de Cuba with several friends which was an enjoyable experience. Food and service was top notch, but the selling point of this restaurant i think is the vibe.  It's fun, exciting and vibrant, and adds to the dining experience

I also took advantage of Gymbox this trip. An amazing gym guests can use right nearby. As someone into boxing and martial arts, i really enjoyed the amazing high end equipment this gym was kitted out with.

Lastly, i cannot say enough about the amazing location of this hotel. I just love the west end of london, so much to do, so many people having fun, it's where things are at in London in the evenings. And you are right in the heart of it if you stay at this hotel :)

As always, highly recommended.",5,2018,02,23
125,Fun and interesting change of pace,"Forced to stay here from another hotel being under construction, but so happy we did!  Great location, lively and energetic night club scene.  Exceptional breakfast buffet, and very courteous staff.  Highly recommend, and will stay here again next year.",5,2018,02,19
125,A first choice for a stay in London,St Martins Lane Hotel has an exceptional standard of service.  The rooms are fabulously stylish and are very comfortable. An abundance of choice is offered for breakfast and all served with a smile.  The hotel is central to the exciting buzz of Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden yet the rooms provide a haven amidst the outside bustle. From now on this will be my first choice whenever I stay in London.,5,2018,02,15
125,Great hotel close to Covent Garden,"Although this hotel doesnt look much from the outside appearances are definitely deceptive. The elegant lobby leads to a cosy bar / restaurant area that has constant Cuban background music. Check in was quick and easy. The rooms are fantastic. Well laid out with excellent facilities and good wifi. The higher floors have views over Nelson's column, The London Eye and other landmarks. Breakfast is a continental buffet or freshly made options ranging from a simple omelette to a full English. Service could be a bit slow at times, but overall it was pretty good. There is another bar downstairs that has a nightclub atmosphere but essentially sells the same bottled beers as upstairs. The hotel is literally a hundred yards or so from Leicester Square Station. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,02,12
125,Best afternoon tea I have ever had!,"My mum took me here yesterday for my Birthday lunch. We was not disappointed. 

The hotel front does not look like a hotel no signs even google maps got confused ü§î. 

Staff on the door directed us and were very pleasant. 

On arrival the desk for check in was very busy. But we went to a restaurant which directed us to The Den. 

On entry to den we felt very comfortable it was hidden away very unusual. 

We had delicious tea jasmine was 1 and mint the other. Very good tea in beautiful tea pots. 

Yes there was a wait but it was nice sit down talk and relax. 

We had some amazing savoury items and the cake display was simply beautiful. 

We can not complain about anything not even 1 thing. 

Staff member sadly didn't catch her name but she was wonderful. 

We also had prosecco with our cakes. 

Music was very relaxing and calming. 

To top the lovely afternoon off the staff member brung me 4 homemade mini doughnuts with Happy Birthday on! That just topped the afternoon off perfectly. 

Best Afternoon Tea I have ever had! ",5,2018,02,07
125,"Wonderful hotel, very central","I loved the hotel. The room was large. Everything seemed quite new. 

Attention was given to the details, including making sure everything was organized and stocked. The internet was fast and without any issues. 

The hotel is conveniently located near many of the tourist attractions, but was completely quiet.

I highly recommend it!",5,2018,02,05
125,Once again an excellent experience,"Stayed here for one night in connection to meetings, and as I'd gotten a very good deal online, and as I go to great lenghts not to sleep in the City. Anyway, as before the check in was a breeze and the hotel just has ambiance. I was upgraded to a corner room, with views of the street, and - as always - the room is just one of the best decorated (and most stylish) rooms in London.",5,2018,02,04
125,Becoming my go-to in London,"I come to London about every other month on business and I've been looking for a hotel to be my home away from home. I think I found it here. Great stay during my last visit. Super friendly staff. The room is clean, modern and comfortable-and big! I really appreciated the bottled water at turndown. Love the restaurant and speak-easy. Only disappointment is that the room service menu could be  bit more expansive. But there are a ton of good restaurants nearby, so it's not a huge issue. I've already booked my next stay!",5,2018,02,04
125,Lovely stay at a great hotel,Very welcoming hotel with great staff. we ere offered an upgrade and free drinks when we arrived. Breakfast was classy and delicious. Impressive location very convenient for central London attractions,5,2018,02,01
125,Terrific Hotel,"Just returned from another stay at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel. We were welcomed back and upgraded to a Loft Suite for our one night stay. It was superb. The suite was spacious and spotlessly clean. We had fabulous views of London and a wonderful sunset. The staff at the hotel go the extra mile to ensure your stay is memorable. Breakfast is excellent with a good choice from the buffet and a varied a la Carte menu. 
We had a great table in Blind Spot for post theatre cocktails. We received excellent service from Roche who makes a wonderful gin cosmopolitan. 
Usually we book a Deluxe Suite which, although not as spacious as the Loft suites, still has everything you need for a relaxing stay, including mood lighting, huge comfy bed and excellent toiletries. Housekeeping is first class with any requests being dealt with efficiently and with a smile. 

All in all this is our favourite London hotel. It is not cheap but does represent good value for money. 

",5,2018,01,28
125,"Excellent location for theatres, shopping and eateries","Brilliant location modern and quirky.
Booked a deluxe room and was not disappointed, nice big room with views of London skyline, large bed and very clean.
No wardrobe in room!!! however the bell boy showed us where to hang our clothes and stow socks, underwear etc. in the entrance to the bathroom area !!!! (Different)
Breakfast was cooked to order during the week, but buffet service at the weekend which was very busy to say the least.
Waited 20 minutes for the scrambled eggs to be replenished and spoke to 3 people to say that they were finished but this fell on deaf ears so left without having breakfast.
Spoke to the manageress who was very sympathetic and offered us room service which I declined as we were ready to go shopping also sent a bottle of wine and 2 glasses up to the room early evening and again had to decline as I do not drink wine!!
A nice touch and thanks
Overall an excellent stay and staff very friendly staff

Will be visiting this hotel again in March/April this year.
Must remember to get up earlier at the weekend to get the scrambled eggs!!!!!!",5,2018,01,27
125,Great location for a great hotel,"What else could you ask for. Great Hotel with outstanding customer service, great room with amazing facilities, great breakfast with excellent staff and all in a great location. I normally stay just outside of whichever city we visit but this has changed my mindset. It made everything so easy to be in the centre of the action and with such facilities this will be on our list of places to stay agin. Minutes from Covent Garden, the Theatres and most iconic landmarks. Great stay and thank you.  ",5,2018,01,27
125,ST MARTIN'S LANE HOTEL,"Brilliant location in Convent Garden/Strand area. Great pubs abound; close to great Chinese/Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatown; hotel is an oasis of cool. Our corner, Jr Suite room had views over London apartment rooftops and London Eye was right outside our floor to ceiling windows. Bathroom was very large and shower water pressure fantastic. We will return.",5,2018,01,26
125,Great hotel,"Loved this hotel. Very modern, great design, streamlined, simple chic, very clean & comfortable. All facilities excellent. Good location, good breakfast although the a la carte hot food was better than the hot breakfast buffet.
Can't find anything negative to say!",5,2018,01,24
125,Excellent stay with great staff and perfect location,Title says it all. Am a regular traveller and 'destination' hotels can sometimes disappoint but this one didn't. Staff (Belle and Vera) super friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and the hotel lobby immaculate as always. They even organised a surprise for a special occasion and had the concierge hold onto a package for me that was delivered. The food in Asia de Cuba was fantastic and the overall helpfulness of the staff was great. Location really is perfect. Thank you,5,2018,01,21
125,Up date and well designed ,"The hotel location is superb, close to national gallery, fashion stores in Covent garden, royal opera house and got very good restaurant, fashion bar and one of the beautiful gym in london. The room is very comfortable and well designed as the hotel if very well decorated. Fun to stay highly recommended. The place is also with local night life scene... big plus‚Äôs. ",5,2018,01,21
125,"Excellent location, beautiful hotel","Great hotel right in the heart of Covent Garden, amazing restaurant and bar with great quality meals. In room dining is prepared very quickly and just as good as eating in the restaurant. Bed is extremely comfy. Only downside is there isn't enough lighting in the main room particularly for when it is dark and the halls are very noisy particularly during in room service",5,2018,01,18
125,Good location and excellent staff!,"From the moment we arrived and there was a hot guy outside ready to help us with our bags I knew I'd like this place. Rooms are funky with a proper bathroom (compared to some other hotels we stayed at this was a bonus), really amazing breakfast and short work to anywhere in central London. 

Only issue we had was a long wait for mulled wine, like half an hour as they were trying to figure out how to bring it from one bar to another but it was tasty once we got it. 

Loved the nightclub out the back and the room service. Will stay here again.",5,2018,01,18
125,London Theatre visit,"This hotel's location is excellent for theatre visits which we took advantage of during our recent stay.  The hotel staff in reception and the Den were super nice with housekeeping maintaining the room clean, tidy and well supplied with towels and water. 
The room on the third floor was quiet and comfortable but I found the mattress a bit hard.  The bathroom accessories were excellent and well supplied throughout our 4 night stay.  There were many products for sale within the room e.g candles!!! etc.. I prefer a room with inclusive items you can use without extra charges.  I did not like receiving a ¬£4 charge on my credit card, after my departure, and one week later no explanation, since we did not use any mini bar products during the stay.

I would recommend the afternoon tea as the the wraps, scones and cakes were very tasty set in a very quirky decorated Den 

Overall a stay at this hotel should not disappoint",4,2018,01,18
125,Another nice stay at an excellent hotel,"Have stayed as this hotel several times already. Apart from the excellent location right in the middle of Central London, I like the rooms, which have a decent size for London. Service has been attentive. We had a room on the first floor with a view at the next building. However, this I have known beforehand and it was not an issue as I do not stay for the view. Good sized bathroom, with Malin+Goetz amenities, which I like. Apart from a minor issue at breakfast, our stay has been as satisfactory as always.",5,2018,01,13
125,Amazing Stay,"If I could give this hotel 6 stars I would. This is a funky / modern / clean hotel in a fabulous location. 

Our room was cleaned daily always with new toiletries and the staff were so helpful. 

Specifically Ricardo on the door always with a smile on his face and so willing to help us. We got back at midnight one night with our rental car and he went above and beyond to help with parking. 

Giacomo was also a pleasure to deal with from the communication via email whilst we were still in Australia to when we arrived.

I loved this hotel so much I tried to see if there were any in Paris for our next trip. I have raved about this hotel to all our friends. Usually I like to try new hotels when I travel but will definitely stay here again to on my next trip to London.",5,2018,01,11
125,perfect location,"This is a great hotel with a young vibe in a perfect location for our needs. We chose the hotel because of the location and the clean modern look of the rooms on the hotel website. We were prepared for disappointment, as is often the case, but the room was exactly as advertised and the hotel generally was better than expected. The staff were extremely pleasant in both the restaurant and reception. This was a romantic getaway without kids but we are intending to return soon with our young daughter, ",5,2018,01,08
125,Afternoon tea in the den ,"We recently experienced afternoon tea here. It was really enjoyable. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. 
Some parts of the food were really stand out. I liked the savouries really tasty and different to the traditional sandwiches. The dulcey in the glass was my favorite along with the pistachio and massive choux bun. Delicious! Overall tasty afternoon tea. Only got 3 savouries and 1 scone but a lot more cakes than usual. 
The crockery and chess table we sat at was really nice. 
There was only a small selection of tea but jasmine was good. Also massive tea pots! We found later on the air con came on quite strong so our tea and scone went cold quite quickly. 
As for the hotel there is no signs for when any rooms are or even where the toilets are. 
Overall it was a nice relaxed experience. However on reflection I feel that the 15% service charge was way too high. Considering the waitress weren't even in the room that much. It's a nice place but definitely not a 5* experience. ",4,2018,01,07
125,Fabulous overnight stay,We were staying in the hotel as we had stayed before. It is in a brilliant location for us to go to the royal opera house and a restaurant just off Covent Garden. We are also able to pay to park at the hotel which is a brilliant service in the centre of London. The staff have always been so polite and helpful and that is certainly something these days.  Rooms very clean indeed as are all communal areas.  Cannot comment on food in this hotel as we have not tried it. ,5,2018,01,07
125,Excellent location and service,"We stayed at St Martins Lane for the 2nd time as we really like the location close to theaters, shopping, dining, tube, etc. Staff is really friendly, good bars & restaurants and nice to join the gym next door. The concierge, Mike, really makes an effort to make your stay special. Good value for this kind of hotel in London.",5,2018,01,06
125,Fantastic hotel in a central location,This hotel caters for all your needs and the staff are very helpful.  Having stayed in a few other central London hotels in the same price range recently where style substituted substance I found St Martin's Lane to excel at both and would definitely stay there again.,5,2018,01,06
125,"Slow Start, Incredible Finish","This hotel was beautiful, clean with a modern feel to both the lobby and the rooms.  We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a modern style and the location could not have been better..and a great little place in the lobby for a drink or two. 

We flew in from the states just before Christmas as a stop before Paris and Rome. Overall, we enjoyed our stay immensely and highly recommend it.  

We got off to a poor start with the staff and service during our check-in, and without getting into the details, a small mistake by someone where our confirm showed a cot in a room but the room didn't accommodate one, blew up in our face as being ""our problem"" to deal with and our two rooms needed to be changed and would cost substantially more than the rate previously booked - the second room needed to be changed too in order for the two rooms to be on the same floor. Typically, when a small booking issue occurs, the service response from a hotel of this caliber would be impeccable and quickly corrected and we would be on our way. But after 15 mins of standing at the front desk being told repeatedly by this young lady that this was our fault and not hers and higher room rates were now necessary for two rooms, we capitulated and went upstairs to unpack after our 8 hour overnight flight.  

When we returned to the lobby an hour later to start our tour of London, I was intercepted by the manager Daniel who explained how he heard about our check-in and wanted to talk when I had a free moment.  He said he would stay late that night if our return was going to be later than his 6pm scheduled departure, which I appreciated.  When I did return, Daniel could not have addressed the problem more professionally or corrected the issue more appropriately - he even stepped away from staff's party to speak with me for a few mins.  Daniel's response completely changed our perspective on the hotel and the stay and everything else was lovely.  Even though things got off to a slow start, they ended splendidly and we would return and it would be a recommendation to my peers who travel to London frequently.",5,2018,01,06
125,Great hotel for business or the young and hip. Not so for families,"This is a modern, clean and sleek hotel with minimalist decor, an exceptional restaurant serving Asian-influenced Cuban cuisine, a trendy gym and a high-end hair salon next to it. It is targeted to young, cool, trendy people who wish to be in the very centre of London. The location is outstanding! Just a couple of minutes away from Covent Garden, Leicester square and Trafalgar square. The centre of London on your doorstep.

Which brings me to the next part of my review. We are a family with one toddler. We are so NOT the target audience for this hotel (surprisingly I saw a few other families with toddlers around). First of all I'd like to qualify my review by saying that I knew exactly what to expect of the hotel having lived closed to it in the past. My gay friends adore this hotel and I can see why. I have no idea why my husband booked it as it is not ideal for families (can you imagine dragging a toddler to a designer restaurant with hip clientele wearing your jeans while everybody else wears the latest Louboutins?). Maybe my husband wanted to relive his youth-I don't know.. It is not the type of hotel that will prepare mac n' cheese for your kid (we actually asked but they told us the hotel serves no pasta- thankfully we know our way around the area and we got take-away).  

Saying that the staff were amazing. We arrived 1,5 hr before the formal check-in time but Daniela the receptionist checked us in after seeing us walking in with a sleeping toddler perched on my shoulder, having passed out after an 8 hr long overnight flight crossing the Atlantic. She actually gave us a better room than what we had booked. It was one with 2 small double beds instead of one. To be honest I'd much rather have one king sized bed than two small ones but I can't tell you if they have any rooms with big beds. I was just too grateful, for getting into a room early, to ask. The rooms are small but adequate with funky lighting. We were on the first floor and I was amazed that it was not noisy (apart from the bin men in the morning). 

Another amazing member of staff was Patrik who helped us get our luggage from the car and also park our car. He was exceptionally helpful and considerate with amazing manners. He really looked after us. At our departure an equally helpful man named Igor helped us get our car loaded again with our numerous pieces of luggage. 

So overall a great hotel for the right audience- not so for families- but the lovely staff helped us to forget about that!",4,2018,01,04
125,Excellence in Leicester Square,"Stayed for a week over NYE with adult children. 2 wonderful loft rooms an we were not disappointed.
Good position, impeccable decor, and attention to detail.
Staff were helpful and more than willing to keep us happy.
Daniele Berardi the Front Desk Manager went beyond what was expected to make our holiday comfortable and a success.
We would recommend this boutique hotel, and intend to stay again upon our next visit to London.",5,2018,01,03
125,"Modern, sensibly priced boutique hotel with a good gym in a great location","The rooms are small, there was actually more room in the en suite than there in the room but the finish was to a good standard, the bed was comfortable and the TV had a decent Sky package.
 
Location is fantastic, a 2 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus tube. If you‚Äôre planning on driving consider the parking challenges - there‚Äôs good secure underground parking just around the corner but it will set you back $50 for 24 hours
 
Access to the gym next door is handy and it‚Äôs straightforward to use ‚Äì just show your room key and sign a disclaimer.
 
It‚Äôs also worth mentioning the hotel restaurant and the late night wine bar with sensible prices.
 
We‚Äôd stay again.",4,2018,01,03
125,Thank you for a wonderful stay ...,"My husband and I visited St Martins Lane for the second time in December 2017 for our wedding anniversary.  It surpassed our expectations and was made extra special yet again by Belle, Guest Experience Manager, she is the jewel in the crown at St Martins Lane and she made our anniversary just that bit more special by the touches she brought to our experience. We would not choose any other hotel in London, this is perfect for our needs and central for everywhere you might want to visit in London.",5,2018,01,02
125,New Year's Eve,"We checked in just after 3pm on NYE with a friendly receptionist and were given room 126 at the back on the first floor. Mid-size room all in white with adjustable lighting, minimalist decor, comfy bed, desk, chair and stool, fridge-style minibar, kettle and mugs. Lots of charging points and USBs either side of the bed and wifi was free and fairly quick. The bathroom was small with an excellent shower, separate WC, lighting on a dimmer switch. No bathrobes, but they happily and quickly provided toothpaste when we realised we'd forgotten ours!
The room was a little bit noisy both from the street and other rooms, but considering it was New Year's Eve, not too bad. 
The location was good for the NYE fireworks, which is why we were there.",4,2018,01,01
125,Disapointed,Disapointed with the way That reception treated the method of  credicard h√°s and the payment I expected to use which is normal in most of hot√©ls World Wide. I had to found another way to pay the hotel and Also I spent Almost 40 minutes in an internacional call to solve it by myself,3,2018,01,01
125,Wonderful  stay. ,"Thank you to all the wonderful  staff for the Service.  This Place is very well maintained  and clean. Would love  to return for my next visit.  
Very good bed and washroom. 
Food was delicious. 
Wish you all the very Success in your future  progress  ",5,2017,12,30
125,Fabulous stay,"I have stayed at St Martins Lane several times, and have throughly enjoyed each and every visit. Great location and super stylish hotel. The staff are fabulous, really friendly and upbeat. Service in the Blindspot was also excellent. Received an upgrade on my room, which is a wonderful thing to offer to returning guests. Keep up the good work! Can't wait to come back",5,2017,12,30
125,"Location, Location, Location!","The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to two tube stations for shopping, strolling about, eating and enjoying entertainment in the heart of London City! Along with the historic book shops and esoteric services that have long been the staple of the area, the skinny alleys and side streets offer a wonderful opportunity to step back into history and envision how life was back then. The calmness of the hotel comfortably balances the busy, bustling reality outside.",4,2017,12,30
125,Good value for a decent hotel,"We had a family trip to winter wonderland ( huge crowds, unbelievably expensive and huge queues ) and booked a family room at St. Martins Lane Hotel.
Great location, so close to some great shops and Covent Garden, so I was pleasantly surprised that we got an immediate and free upgrade to a huge room with 2 double beds.
The decor was modern and immaculate and the toiletries were in abundance.
There was an iron and ironing board in the room, tea and coffee making facilities - basically everything you could need .
We did not use the mini bar ( as usual- massively overpriced ) nor did we take up the offer of breakfast at ¬£18 per head- there are so many great places to eat within 2-3 minutes walk, at normal prices, and there is an M+S and a Tesco with 5 minutes walk  to get any food or drinks for the room without getting a bank loan.
They would have got a 5 star rating had it not been for in-room drink and snack prices, but I know that is how all these places make their money- I just don‚Äôt agree with it -
Will definitely book here again, due to :
Location
Price
Quality
Staff friendliness ",4,2017,12,29
125,Great hotel at great location!,"We were a group of 3 ladies staying in a Studio room fit for 3. 
The room was satisfactory large, very clean and well designed, and the extra bed was very comfortable (unlike many other places).

The only downside of the room is that the bathroom area has no door, which is problematic if you are not a couple or have high level of intimacy.... The shower has a door, but when you want to get dry and dressed afterwards or just change your clothes it is a bit uncomfortable. Another door or at least a curtain at the bathroom entrance should be placed there, as they offer this room for 3 adults. 

Other than that, the hotel is great! 
The location of the hotel is perfect, centrally located and very close to 2 underground stations. The crew is professional and helpful, accommodating every request we had quickly and with a big smile. 

Prices are not cheap, but the hotel is well worth the money when considering room size, service and centrality of the hotel. We booked it directly on the hotel website a few months prior to our visit and so were able to get good prices. 

We would definitely stay there again when in London and would highly recommend it to others.",5,2017,12,22
125,Best location in London,"Because I was on vacation with my 16-year-old granddaughter I decided to look for something more modern and traditional for a short stay in London.  St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel was perfect. It was Right in the heart of Covent Gardens, 10 minutes walk from the theatre district, Boots the chemist, Tesco, lots of restaurants and pubs and a fabulous Covent Gardens. The hotel itself was beautiful. Modern with all amenities. The staff were ultra pleasant and helpful and the restaurants and bars are young and trendy. It was a pricey hotel but worth the spend bearing in mind its location.  We saved lots on taxi by being able to walk everywhere. For longer trips Leicester Square Underground was just a few minutes walk away. Highly recommend this hotel.
",5,2017,12,22
125,One Night Stay in an Urban Oasis,"I was lucky enough to spend one night in this Gem of a hotel on Friday the 15th December 2017 and what an absolute delight it was too. It was a joint business/social visit to London and the staff could not have been more accommodating in every aspect especially the Concierge team of Mike, Giacomo and Diogo. It was my second visit to the hotel, my previous stay was about 5 years ago and they have updated the interior decor to highest standard with many beautiful artistic features throughout the communal areas. Located in the very heart of the West End and surrounded by the many beautiful theatres of Theatre Land and within a short stroll from the second to none shopping districts of Covent Garden, Mayfair and Oxford Street. I am planning my next visit to London and will definitely be staying at the St Martins Lane Hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,21
125,Festive afternoon tea,"We came here for the christmas afternoon tea and it was lovely! So many amazing cakes and really unusual (but lovely) sandwiches. The service was great and they even gave us some complimentary prosecco. The room was looking really nice and festive, although it was quite dark so I would've preferred it to a bit lighter",4,2017,12,21
125,St MArtins Lane Hotel,Fabulous stay at this hotel in West End. Perfect location.... We went to see a show in Covent garden which was next door. Perfect for a walk down to Trafalgar Square too. You have to try the Asia de Cuba restaurant which is actually in the hotel.. Fantastic food. (try the steak for 2 ) Awesome x,5,2017,12,20
125,Always enjoy staying here,"Ive stayed here several times over many years, and it never disappoints. It's in a prefect location, the staff are always helpful and the rooms are cool and comfy. I always recommend my friends to stay here.",5,2017,12,19
125,Lovely Stay at St Martins Hotel,"Great stay with lovely staff taking care of all your needs - always with a smile and grace. Would have given a 5 rating but as lovely as our room was its a bit worn down at the heels. Light bulb gone in bathroom, lock on loo broken -  a few knobs dropping off. Just wear and tear issues really and it wont stop us from staying again, but a bit more attention/polish to details in the rooms would make St Martins a smash hit with us.",4,2017,12,19
125,FANTASTIC HOTEL!,"I recently stayed here for business with a group of people.  Right from the start the hotel staff were accommodating and wonderful.
The location is perfect, the rooms are clean, comfy and with fun lighting.
Larissa and Samm who helped me figure out all the group bookings etc were responsive and took amazing care of us.
The meeting rooms are perfect. Rafa who helps run the meeting rooms could not be more helpful.
I LOVE THIS HOTEL!!!!",5,2017,12,18
125,"Location, location, location","We had a good time at St Martins Lane. Really loved the location. Trafalgar Square, Picadilly Circus, Carnaby Street, Westminster etc are all only a few footsteps away. At night it can get very loud but after walking through the city all day long we slept pretty good. I really loved the light design and the bathroom at the superior room.",4,2017,12,18
125,"A little different hotel, but fun place to stay","It's a great location and from the moment you arrive it feels more like an experience than just a place to sleep. The decor is challenging, probably not every bodies style, but I felt it was making a statement and so interesting.

Check in was good though the receptionist pointed in one direction toward the lifts and I struggled to find. Eventually found them and realised that the hotel was not the easiest to navigate. My room was up a few floors, along a corridor and then into what is best described as a small section off the main corridor. The room was London sized small, but quirky decor continued. It had all I needed including excellent free wifi. Despite being compact I liked the room and most importantly the bed was comfortable.

I went out for dinner, but before we did we went to what I think was the lobby bar, but only found it when a colleague who was also staying showed me the door that leads to it. Not sure how you find it unaided as it felt like a hidden room. Table service was good before we went out and when we got back. Liked the trio of ladies on stage singing when we got back. Very entertaining.

There was a little noise in the night from noisey guests in the corridor, but nothing worth complaining about. Breakfast was excellent. Had one of the best omelettes I have ever had and service was very attentive. Overall a good stay made better due to the hotel being interesting.",4,2017,12,17
125,Attention to detail - personal touch,"We arrived very early morning to the hotel - the reception staff were very welcoming and professional. We had no expectation that our room would be ready and were more than happy to drop off our luggage into a secure area to allow us to shop luggage free. The receptionist offered to call us as soon as the room was available. 
When we eventually made it back to the room late afternoon, we were so impressed with the extra cool room and even more with the personal message that Belle, had left for us. Clearly Belle, had gone to the trouble of finding out our reason for visiting and had reflected this in the note and bubbly left for us - simple but very effective! Thank you, Belle! 

I would highly recommend this hotel - as well as the Secret Club (you will need to reserve in advance).",5,2017,12,17
125,Huge disappointment. Over priced ,"Searched 5 star got this! Awful poky little room with just a double bed (really?? These days?) but at a huge cost. Down unwelcoming claustrophobic corridors. Only consolation the people we were with got a bit bigger room.  Not worth what we paid. Been to far better. Although staff friendly and its clean.. I think you're paying for the location. I suggest Premier Inn, big rooms big bed and cost much less! This shocked us after other nearby places  we've been to, also with great location.  At nearly ¬£400 per night room point we felt seriously short changed.  ",2,2017,12,13
125,Can‚Äôt wait to go back!,"From the moment I arrived, to the moment I left, I had a truly great time at this hotel. When I arrived I was offered a complimentary upgrade which was very unexpected (and very welcome!) so I had a Garden room, which was fabulous! Having outside space was such a wonderful addition. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom has one of the best showers I‚Äôve ever had!
The staff were wonderful- the heavy snow meant my train home was cancelled and when I explained to the lovely receptionist that I was essentially ‚Äòsnowed out‚Äô of my village, she arranged for me to stay in the same room, for the cost of their standard room, which made a stressful situation a lot better- not having to move out of that lovely room made the whole thing much better! 
I‚Äôm already thinking I may have to plan a return trip in the New Year.....! ",5,2017,12,11
125,Cool spot,"Stayed for 1 week, on a business trip. Loved the environment, loved the music in the lobby and lifts. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Bedroom as spacious, comfortable and very clean. Didnt eat at the hotel, so cannot say anything about the food. Negative: Wireless keeps disconnecting if you dont use your device for 5 mins. 
Cant beat this location if you like the theater and west end. Loved, loved, loved my stay and will definitely return.",4,2017,12,08
125,Still has the wow factor ! ,"This stylish and modern hotel is in an extremely convenient location near Trafalgar square. So discreet externally that you would not know it is a hotel. Have not stayed here for a number of years but this return visit did not disappoint. The hotel lobby and in house bar and restaurant still have the wow factor as to the bedrooms which provide mood lighting and much more from your finger tips. Staff are efficient, helpful and friendly across all areas of hotel. ",5,2017,12,07
125,excellent weekend at st martins lane hotel,Luxurious hotel with exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.Lovely large bedroom .Great meal in Asia de Cuba restaurant and fab afternoon tea.Great location just off Trafalgar Square but quiet and relaxing.Will definitely return.,5,2017,12,05
125,Great business hotel in the heart of Covent Garden,"I just spent four days in London on business. St Martins Lane Hotel had almost everything right: super-fast checkin and checkout; generous sized room with bathroom well separated from bedroom and a great in-room dining menu. Made my stay uncomplicated, easy and enjoyable. ",5,2017,12,05
125,Amazing place to have a little coffee ,Friendly and dedicated waiters service. They cleaned the table with detail when I sat down and that is to be appreciated. Pleasant and comfortable music. Well done guys. It‚Äôs a good area and close to the main places of Leicester Square ,5,2017,12,04
125,Great hotel,"After a cock up by last minute.com with my booking I was starting to think we wouldn't be staying, but the very helpful reservation team helped sort the problem. Then even though it wasn't their fault upgraded us and chucked in a couple of cocktails for our troubles, which was very kind of them.
The room was ultra modern with soft changeable led lighting well stocked mini bar super comfortable bed large shower room with great quality shower products. We had breakfast in the Cuba de Aisa restaurant the following morning which was tasty but nothing special,  no apple juice just orange and grapefruit so if that was my only gripe it can't be that bad.
Will stay there again the location  if you want west end is unbeatable Leicester sq station 30 seconds away.

Well worth a visit. ",5,2017,12,03
125,Never Disappoints,"Much as I love to follow St. Martins Lane London Hotel on Instagram, it makes me sad that I am not there --- but still love seeing the pictures.
Was there in late November with my partner.  From the moment you walk in the lobby and smell the signature aroma, you know it is a special place.  Efficient check in and then we were off to the apartment room on the 6th floor.  Clean, spacious, and modern -- what I love in a hotel room.  Had no issues with noise at all but never have when staying there.
The bathroom is one of the nicest that I have ever had in any hotel -- domestic or international.  The Malin and Goetz products also add to the experience.
Televisions are topnotch -- and it isn't one of those hotels where you spend time trying to find switches or how to function -- it is very user friendly.
The location makes getting around London a piece of cake -- near tube stations and also near so many attractions it is just a short time to get wherever you want to go.
So if you are looking for a top notch hotel in London you can't do better than St. Martins Lane.",5,2017,12,03
125,Great hotel in the center of the city,I went there for a business meeting and stayed 3 days. The hotel is clean and somewhat fancy. The staff is very friendly and supportive. The ‚Äûhidden‚Äú bar is very special. Just go straight after you enter the lobby and open the ‚Äûhandshake‚Äú door at the right. ,4,2017,12,03
125,Hip and aging,"If you indulged in illegal substances in the 90s, partied all night and woke up with a stranger in your bed, you might have stumbled through the large evolving door of this modern chic hotel.  In this decade, colorful mood lighting, minimalist and cold decor, were all the rage.  Nothing wrong with that if you feel nostalgic at heart but we‚Äôve long traded the feeling of disinfectant on veneer furniture for aromatherapy and antiques.  Like its sibling S.. Hotel in Fitzrovia, or The Standard in Hollywood, or the Shore Club in Miami, St Martin‚Äôs Lane tries so hard to be cool, it forgot to comfortable.  The beds are stiff, the light switches a bother and the walls thin enough to feel like your neighbors‚Äô celebration of the flesh sound close enough to partake in.
On my first stay they gave me the wrong room, a standard instead of a studio suite. Mistakes happen. A came back a week later and having notified them of the error they courteously had checked me in the proper suite.  This time though, the bathtub's faucet sprayed across the bathroom when turned on.  Beers as a sorry note were a nice touch but wine would have been classier. Despite this, the studio room, surrounded by windows and at the corner of the building, were nicer aside of the aging carpeting. But the street's cacophony carries you to bed and here too, high heels clacking and high pitch moaning make it a hotel better suited to drunken slobber than mindful rest.
Sure it‚Äôs in the theatre district and yes it‚Äôs clean. True the staff is professional and welcoming. Fair, the restaurant is actually good and better designed.  But do yourself a favor and spend a bit more for some english flair at nearby Haymarket Hotel or even better, Covent Garden Hotel.",3,2017,12,02
125,Another excellent stay,"Once again a fabulous stay at St Martins Lane.
From the minute we arrived nothing was too much bother for the tremendous staff.
Our room was very spacious and luxurious.
The food, both breakfast and in the restaurant was delicious.
Could not fault.",5,2017,12,02
125,excellent stay,"I have stayed in this great Hotel for 3 nights in a superior double double room. the experience we had was perfect from the start. the staff at the reception desk was nice and helpful. also the rest of the staff (restaurant, bar) were lovely!
i look forward to stay there again!",5,2017,12,01
125,Lunch @ Asia De Cuba,"The Food Is Sublime!
Loved every morsel - not a smidgen left on a single plate!
Recommendation: Tunapica Tartare ¬£14.00 enough to share - 
Rocoto-Glazed Black Cod - between two with the Plantain Fried Rice  (¬£38.00 + ¬£8.00)

Perfect pre. Theatre Venue ",5,2017,11,29
125,Takes luxury service to new levels,"Right in the heart of theatre land, this luxurious hotel offers a central London location with a modern, very stylish focus. Extraordinarily attentive and courteous staff make this hotel a memorable experience. 
Evening entertainment in the wonderful cocktail lounge and a brilliant restaurant in Asia de Cuba combine to make this the place to stay in London. 
Perfect!",5,2017,11,29
125,"Amazing Honeymoon Location...Thank You, Belle!!!!!!","It was indeed the stuff fairy tales are made of...our Honeymoon was unforgettable on the London leg of our journey.  The team at St. Martin's Lane is top notch.  Truly outstanding service; from the Bell Team to the Arrivals/Reception area...they always remembered our names and made us feel very welcome.  But just brilliant on all levels.      
     Our Honeymoon experience was created by the above and beyond, Belle...She and her teams were on point! Every need we had was taken care of before we really even knew it...Belle was just lovely before, during, and after our visit.  What a tremendous Leader for your Company.
     Very special shout out to Michael at Concierge--stellar guy who took very good care of us (and our friends).
     I highly, highly recommend visiting St. Martin's Lane.  You will be tremendously impressed with the level of service.  Special thanks to Belle, Michael, and the entire team at SML...We will be back and we will let everyone we know about St. Martin's Lane!!",5,2017,11,27
125,Another excellent weekend at St Martins Lane,"Great hotel - love the room with it's crisp white sheets, extremely clean and cosy and powerful shower.  All staff have an smile and time to make sure your visit is a success.
Great location - we had the best time around the Covent Garden area - theatre, amazing restaurants and fun cocktail bars.  We loved St Martins Lane and will definitely be back when visiting London again.
",5,2017,11,27
125,London adventure,Stayed at St Martins lane Hotel for our show at the Garrick theatre. Everything was spotless and modern. Staff were extremely pleasant and thorough. The room had mood lighting that you could set. (From outside you could see all of the different colours of the guest windows from the lighting). The blind spot with the DJ and the cocktails wereexpensive but worth it. Very popular may need to book.,5,2017,11,27
125,"Ugly, pretentious and over-priced","We stayed there last night, as it was close to a function we were attending.  The building itself is almost unbelievably ugly outside, with soulless, tasteless d√©cor inside.  We found the staff unfriendly and unhelpful.  To be honest, we didn't really want to ask for anything, as the impression given was that absolutely anything would result in a significant additional expense.  The room was tiny, and very poorly designed, so as to make the worst possible use of such little space as there was.  The hotel is also designed so that rooms look directly into one another, and we found the extremely loud, unruly people in the next room to us doing just that - peering in to stare at us.  This was a shame, as our room would otherwise have had a decent view of the Post Office Tower and surroundings, but we had to shut the curtains, even at 4 in the afternoon - to sniggers from the people next door - so we missed any view.  The hidden cocktail bar is just irritating, and the lights kept so low that it was almost impossible to read the tiny print on the overly, needlessly large menu.  Breakfast was OK, but not great and cost a whopping ¬£30 per head!  And for that, they don't even offer you toast.  There are hotels not too far from here that are half the price of this one and twice as good.  If you don't mind a bit more of a trek, the Zetter in Clerkenwell, for instance.  We'll stay there another time.",1,2017,11,23
125,Pure comfort in fantastic location,"Modern hotel with quirky touches. Lovely bathroom or should say shower room, one of the most comfortable beds we have had in a hotel with lovely pillows. The location is exceptional, in the heart of theatre land, next door to the Colosseum. Covent Garden in easy walking distance, as are Tottenham Court Road & Oxford Street. Leicester Square tube a minute away. Considering the location, the rooms are surprisingly quiet. The hidden cocktail bar is interesting, but be prepared for the bill! One of the best things is the staff. All very helpful & friendly. A very special thank you to them, as they were very supportive & kind when I couldn‚Äôt find a piece of jewellery I had misplaced.",4,2017,11,22
125,Another great stay,We come to London for the theatre every year at this time and have stayed here recently. The rooms are great modern and airy. The location is great both for the theatre and shopping. The staff is friendly and helpful.,5,2017,11,22
125,Best Location and service,This is the third time we stayed at this lovely hotel. This time we traveled with a group of 7 and had 3 rooms. We were taken care of in an excellent manner as always. This a great place in the heart of everything. A Must!,5,2017,11,21
125,Loft Suite Heaven ,"I booked a deluxe garden room for Saturday night. Upon arrival I was told we had been upgraded to a loft suite. The room was beautiful, spacious with floor to ceiling windows. 
The location of the hotel is great, walking distance to Covent Garden, Oxford Street and the theatre's.
We used the underground car park which is a fifty second walk to the hotel, the hotel has reserved spaces so just let the attendant know you are staying at the hotel. ",5,2017,11,20
125,Fabulous,"Would recommend to anyone, felt very welcome! The staff were friendly and rooms comfortable and beautifully designed. In a great location for what we were in the area for. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ",5,2017,11,19
125,Another amazing stay,"An expertly run hotel with just about the friendliest staff you could ask for. We stayed for just the one night and also had lunch in The Den, the food was fabulous. Would highly recommend the Meze Selection and also the ‚ÄúOver and Under‚Äù G&T. Cant wait to return! ",5,2017,11,18
125,Great Stay!,"From the outside you have no idea how good this hotel is.....
Fantastic stay at this hotel - very clean, pleasant staff and great breakfast.
Secret bar is a great place to relax after a show
Used the gym next door and again great staff",5,2017,11,16
125,VERY comfortable bed! ,"We checked in very late, nearly midnight, and were greeted by very friendly staff. We were told our room had been upgraded which was a nice surprise. The room was very clean, and very white! The bed was INCREDIBLY comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. 

The only downside was the tea and coffee ‚Äòfacilities‚Äô in the room (actually, the tray was in the bathroom/dressing room!?) For a 5* hotel, in a room that costs nearly ¬£300 per night, you would expect something A LOT better than sachets of instant coffee and TUBES OF UHT MILK!! REALLY? Even Hotel Du Vin in Bristol has a Nespresso machine! Apart from that, great nights stay. ",4,2017,11,15
125,Ideally located little gem with superb service and services,"A very comfortable cozy boutique hotel ideally and centrally located in the West End theater district next to Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Chinatown, Soho, Regent Street, tube station with Piccadilly line direct to/from Heathrow etc. Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, the Mall, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, the Big wheel etc etc. Wonderful service from warm helpful staff (eg. Igor at the entrance or Jemima in housekeeping or Miko at reception and everyone at the concierge desk) who go out of their way to remember your name and preferences. Has a very good restaurant, Asia de Cuba (panAsian cuisine), and a very trendy bar. Rooms in the front on St Martins Lane can be noisy on weekends, higher rooms at the back (eg. 519 or 520) are probably the best choices. Consider booking all your ""hard to get"" reservations like dinner at Gymkhana or breakfast/brunch at Sketch through the concierge desk before arriving, they have the connections to get them for you and you may decide to work off the calories in the free access fully equipped gym next door the day after your enjoyable meal. ~15 stays and never disappointed.",5,2017,11,14
125,Fabulous funky rooms!,"We had a great room which was spacious, clean and bright with exciting lighting options. The bar and restaurant was closed all evening for a private party, so disappointingly we couldn‚Äôt even get a drink. Good buffet breakfast. Great location for theatres and Trafalgar Square not far away.",5,2017,11,13
125,Still Good,"Returned for a weekend to St Martins after a decade absence.  It continues to be hip, have a great vibe and offer straight forward rooms in a highly modern mode.  The rooms are not big, but comparable to other London hotels in the price range.  The breakfast was good.  Best part of the hotel is the location (steps from Trafalgar Square and museums and theaters) and access to the gym in the building, which is excellent.  Perfect for a couple on a romantic weekend or a single traveller who wants a bit of fun.  The model crafted a decade ago still works.",5,2017,11,12
125,Convenient&Trendy,Overly modern hotel. Decent staff. Deluxe room had good bath and king bed but not as nice as we expected. No sofa or upholstered chair. Would stay here for the location. Hallways upstairs reminded me of a White monastery. IÔ∏è prefer a more traditional decor. ,4,2017,11,10
125,Excellent Hotel,"First time I have stayed here (why haven't I stayed here before), staff friendly and very helpful, fantastic room large and clean, comfortable bed,asia de cuba was worth the visit  ,great location for shopping and  theaters. ",5,2017,11,09
125,After Theatre Meal,"I think we timed it just right, this very popular restaurant was able to seat us immediately we left the theatre! Polite attentive hard working staff! Excellent food and good value for money! The red wine was delicious!",5,2017,11,07
125,One night in London ,"Superb service ! Huge bathroom ( UK standards ) big room , Very comfortable bed ! I love the private phone given to guests with WiFi . Michael in concierge was so helpful ! Will definitely be back ! 

Cheers ! ",4,2017,11,06
125,Very comfortable and pleasant stay !,"The hotel offered me a clean and beautiful room with a great view as well as a delicious breakfast. Located centrally in London, which makes it ideal for either leisure or business trips. I would definitely recommend it!",5,2017,11,06
125,Concierge,"Such an amazing concierge Giacommo found us all the best places in town!Best restaurants ( japanese fusion I highly recommand it wonderful experience) and really friendly, hotel with a nice design and the golden hand bar is amazing
",5,2017,11,05
125,A perfect birthday celebration,We were warmly welcomed by the reception staff and checked in quickly. Our room on the fifth floor was clean and quiet. Very modern decor and loved the mood lighting! Comfortable king size bed. The hotel is perfectly placed for all the restaurants and theatres around Covent Garden. ,5,2017,11,04
125,Exceptional,I had a lovely afternoon tea with complimentary Prosecco in the Den last Wednesday. We had the new menu and everything we ate was absolutely delicious.  A particular favourite of mine was the Broccoli and Parma Ham swirl although I couldn‚Äôt fault anything on the menu. The wonderful array of sweets went down well and the scone was lovely and light. We had exceptional service by Michelle and Melinda who could not have been more accommodating. The Den was the perfect venue ‚Äì comfy seats and a nice ambience. I especially loved the unique artwork. It was a great way to spend an afternoon ‚Äì one of the best afternoon teas I have ever had and I hope to visit again in the near future.,5,2017,10,31
125,Fabulous short stay & great hotel,"This hotel is minamalist & trendy. Furnishings are modern & quite wacky!
Lovely room with adequate storage but would probably be a bit cramped for more than a couple of nights.
The WiFi was difficult to connect to & we were without connection over night only managing to connect the morning we left this could have caused problems if we had needed it for business.
Great location this isn't a cheap hotel but it is convenient for theatres & galleries with lots of bars etc... Within walking distance.",5,2017,10,30
125,Brilliant hotel,"Fantastic visit with family for a birthday celebration - Loft Loft Double room was perfect for our needs.

Reception staff were brilliant and all wished me a happy birthday, and there were additional unexpected birthday treats from the hotel!

All the staff we met were very friendly, positive and efficient, couldn't fault anything!
DJ playing in Blindspot was a nice touch.

We had stayed at the Mondrian in the past (same hotel group) so were aware of the high standards, our expectations were fully met at St Martins Lane!
Thank you.
",5,2017,10,30
125,Good allround,"Paid ¬£540 for two rooms (eek) but around corner from National Gallery and Lyceum Theatre
Tried to rip off ¬£55 taxi from hotel got on Uber for ¬£14 otherwise good experience
Efficient front desk and really comfortable beds 
Unusually no tissues in room needed because air-con a tad severe
Avoid pricey mini bar and limited tv channels but nicely designed room and was asked if room was clean by housekeeper (it was) 
Not quiet 5 but certainly 4 star and would return ",4,2017,10,29
125,Utterly fabulous hotel,"Hi. Just stay at least a night here. Rooms are quirky, very clean, fully equipped with both mini bar and bits-I-forgot tray, great bed and thoughtful touches
Bar was fabulous, again very different and drinks orders taken and delivered quickly and without fuss.
Didn't try the Restaurent as we were booked elsewhere but we will....
We had a ""garden-room"" which allowed us to sit out side with a glass or two of bubbles before dinner. Just lovely idea, very private and an open air oasis in central London
Bella went out of her way to add a little extra that went a long way to enhancing our experience -  thank you xxxxx

Overall a very very very enjoyable hotel and experience, one we will return to and would encourage you to try too",5,2017,10,29
125,Nice hotel,"Easy check in. In the room there was good water pressure in the shower and nice bath products - it was spotlessly clean - very comfortable bed. They have a mobile device you can check out if you want which should be placed elsewhere as it lights up/ shows an annoying glow when it is dark. I threw some clothing over it in the end. There is also an annoying green light on the thermostat. The in room safe didn't seem to work.
They turned down the beds and they had a bottle of complimentary water which is nice. It was close to where we were going, so that was ideal. We went to the bar late and it was very nice, its a bit pricey but it has a good atmosphere and we enjoyed ourself. The service at the bar was very good. The breakfast was nice - good service again. There was some art video in the lift - in one of the lifts it wasn't working on two screens. The lobby is very clean - the female toilets in the lobby were dusty. 
On balance I will stay again - we enjoyed ourselves.",4,2017,10,28
125,Great location for theatreland,"Part of the SBE group so quirky interior design which we loved. Very modern feel. Location was superb for theatres, Covent Garden, Leicester Square.  Staff very friendly and attentive.  Loads of restaurants within walking distance.  Fumo a couple of doors down was really nice - Italian tapas. ",5,2017,10,23
125,Fabulous !,"The room was fantastic, the staff were helpful and courteous, the food was superb and the cocktails excellent ! Thank you - can‚Äôt wait to come back . 
We‚Äôve been staying at The Sanderson for a few years now but will split our time between the two in future . Please thank Belle for the macaroons - delicious treat ! 
C",5,2017,10,21
125,Another great stay at this hotel,"We keep coming back to this hotel when visiting London. A lot of it is due to the perfect location, turn left and you are at Trafalgar Square, thin right you are in Covent Garden, straight across and you are at Leicester Square. Walking distance from to theatres as well.
We were booked in a loft double double, 2 large beds, great for me and my 2 teenage daughters.
Lovely bathroom with bathtub and shower. We will definitely return again.",5,2017,10,20
125,Enjoyable,"Visited in august for a 3 night stay, rooms were nice and spacious and staff were rather friendly but we didn't spend a lot of time around the hotel and instead went out sightseeing, I would recommend this hotel though",3,2017,10,16
125,Afternoon Tea in the Den,"What a surprise! My friend found this afternoon tea and asked if I'd like to go; I admittedly kept forgetting where we were going when people would ask - won't forget now. 

An absolute bargain in terms of price and what we received. The sandwiches were great, different from the usuals. I asked for a banana cake to be replaced, which was no trouble (more chocolates, which I in turn took home because there was just so much food). Scones were great. My friend had a gin cocktail, while I had a glass of prosecco.

Our server was brand new; we must have been some of her friends customers but she was absolutely lovely. She was being helped by a more senior server, who did come out to apologise to us for her ""being new"", but it really wasn't necessary - everyone has to start somewhere.

The room itself is a fun little gallery with quirky pieces of art. I especially liked ""Off With Her Head."" Ask for your menu back as there is an art map in it. Furthermore it's small and can't seat that many people so it stays quiet and exclusive.

The foyer of the hotel is fun to walk into, and the washrooms were gorgeous and clean.

I would highly recommend and will definitely be back.",5,2017,10,16
125,Absolutley stunning.,"Came here with my other half. Definitely worth the price. Absolutley beautiful. We stayed in a lovely room with lights that you could change the colour of the room, and everything was so clean and so relaxing. Even the breakfast in the morning was to die for! The eggs Benedict were just the best! All the staff were so attentive and even booked us a taxi to the train station. It was also just ariund the corner from Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. Perfect for us. Will return without a second thought.",5,2017,10,15
125,"Great contemporary hotel, fantastic location & fun, helpful staff - shame there's not more space for guests in the bars","We stayed for one night on 7th October. 

The staff were great; welcoming, engaging and helpful (even though we booked via a last minute website we got a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe - which made the stay excellent value for money)  

The room was excellent, well designed, spacious and with exceptionally comfortable beds. Lots of power points, including USB, colour change lighting and plenty of connectivity (including a mobile phone that guests can apparently use across London) mean it's great for gadget heads or business travellers. 

However, access to hotel facilities very difficult, The Den was booked out for a private function when we arrived, once Blind Spot opened we were told we could only have a table for 45 minutes because of prior bookings (possibly part of the same event). Although we received 2 complimentary drinks (for a party of 4) when we returned after an evening elsewhere it's a big shame that the hotel's facilities are not more accessible for guests, especially as the cocktails were great. Had this not been an issue I would have no problems awarding 5 stars, but it was a dent on an otherwise top class contemporary hotel.",3,2017,10,13
125,Excellent hotel," St. Martin lanes hotel is an excelent hotel, great location near Covent Garden and has a very friendly staff. Nice rooms and very good service. The hotel's restuarant Asia Cuba has a very good quality food. ",5,2017,10,12
125,Quality,"Excellent hotel.  Stayed here and used the meeting spaces as well.  Great service, staff were excellent and the hotel is in a brilliant location as we walked up to Covent Garden in a matter of minutes to restaurants.  The meeting space is really cool and the staff really did everything they could to make the meeting go well.  Really couldn't fault it.",5,2017,10,11
125,Trip to St Martins Lane Hotel,A really lovely centrally based hotel. Close to China town and just about everything you would need for either a busness trip or leisure stay. The hotel is very different and quite quirky which is what I like about it. The restaurant was a little slow in serving our food which was rectified as soon as I asked. I will stay again when in London to experience the good old fashioned genuine customer care. Well done St Martins..,5,2017,10,09
125,"Nice room, dreadful breakfast experience","Great location, lovely modern room but no bath just a shower.  As others have commented you can hear doors banging and guests in next door bedrooms.

We had a dreadful breakfast experience - Lots of tables not being cleared - people had left uneaten food at a table next to us and it was still there after we had finished our breakfast.  Difficult to find somewhere  clean to sit.  The buffet breakfast - a lot of food running out and no-one replenishing.  It took 15 minutes for someone to come offer coffee. We ordered off the al la carte menu but when the food turned up it was cold and my muffin was burnt. Poor value for the money we spent.",2,2017,10,08
125,"Nice hotel, but...","Stayed here on Saturday 30th Sept to enjoy the local sights - clean, comfortable and well presented. There is a 'but'... after leaving my credit card details as security against the mini-bar (my girlfriend had booked / paid for the room as a surprise) I have been unpleasantly surprised to find I have been charged ¬£100. Called today and eventually (second time round) once I became aware, to be advised that this is standard practice and would be credited back to my card 'up to seven days afterwards' but that I could speak to a duty manager if I wished. So, I was transferred through to a number that just rang out. Not impressed with the customer care and makes me seriously question if I would bother to stay here again. I will iterate that at no time was I told a standard charge would be made against the card and refunded at a later date.",4,2017,10,06
125,Nice Hotel. But trying too hard.,"We selected this hotel as it was close to the West End.The hotel isn't overly attractive from the outside but once inside it's quite nice. The reception staff were very welcoming and attentive and looked after us. The rooms were very pleasant with nice decor. It took a while though to work out how to turn the multi-coloured mood lighting off. Although we couldn't work out how to turn the blue lighting off that shines from under the TV, which was quite bright and a bit annoying during the night. It would be nice to have a proper door on the bathroom, rather than a frosted glass surround on the loo. The large pillows were very very soft, so ask for firm ones before you retire for the night. The room we had was at the back of the hotel, so was nice and quiet.
On returning from our show in the West End we fancied a drink, but couldn't find the bar. We asked a member of staff who pointed us to a plain door with a gold hand for a door handle. Upon entry it was very dark and very loud. It was so dark it was a struggle to read the drinks menu. The very loud music from the DJ was totally unnecessary and added nothing, apart from ear ache. The cocktails weren't that cheap and weren't very good. My wife's Mojito tasted like it had hardly any alcohol in it, it had no sugar either and tasted like lime juice and soda over crushed ice, so was pretty sharp. My Madagascar was ok, but not outstanding. We had just the one drink here then went to the pub across the road. 
I think the hotel is trying too hard and some things need some work.",4,2017,10,03
125,Great place to stay,"Stayed for a weekend, customer service was awesome and were all very helpful and friendly. Rooms were clean with all the bells and whistle and cool mood lighting. Highly recommend a couple of drinks in the cocktail lounge. The free bicycle hire was helpful as well. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,09,28
125,Home sweet home,"Since 2001 my ""home in London"". I am regularly staying at St. Martins Lane. Perfectly located, modern and nice, full of great professional people always ready to help. Nice rooms, good service and excellent food.",5,2017,09,27
125,Efficient !,"Usually not a fan of Philippe Starck design for hotels and restaurants, but here at St Martin's Lane it remains soft and elegant. 
The best is the location, perfectly central. Rooms are not very big, but if you can get a corner room you'll get a long corridor with windows offering beautiful city views all along, an that is great.",4,2017,09,26
125,Perfect,"I love this hotel! Clean room, friendly staff, and excellent location. The complementary phone with free wifi and travel guide really came in handy.I look forward to staying here again the next time I visit LondonüôÇ",5,2017,09,24
125,Pure indulgence ,"This is my favourite hotel in London! It's always fresh & cool inside with staff that are always right there to help you with anything! 
As a treat my son and I stayed here for a long weekend and we had a blast! The beds are so comfy you can barely get up in the morning! Also the location is amazingly centred in the heart of London with an abundance of restaurants, cafes and multiple entertainment places to visit - theatre & cinema. It's totally worth the cost! ",5,2017,09,22
125,Trendy hotel,"I chose the St Martins Lane hotel for a 2 days mid-week escape with my husband, not disappointed. What has been striking me the most has been the kindness and attention of everyone working here: from the moment of checking in to the check out, everything has been smooth and full of smiles. The room was a standard one, cosy and clean. You can tell is not a new hotel , but you can tell there is a good attention to maintenance.
Good breakfast, even if the friday morning was very busy and the buffet was quite empty- we waited a little for refurbish but then we had to go beforehand. 
I recommend this hotel!",4,2017,09,21
125,Great experience!,"I stayed in the St. Martin lane twice over the past few months while working on a film and have had a great experience both times.  First and foremost, the staff are wonderful - Daniela at the front desk was super helpful and friendly and Dorota helped us organize the board room for a last-minute meeting.  Thanks again!  

The room was spacious, and had nice views and plenty of space to work. The bath products and complimentary gym laundry service were added niceties‚Ä¶ Only thing to point out is that the bathroom doesn‚Äôt have a door which isn‚Äôt ideal for privacy.  

PS- Definitely take advantage of the complimentary breakfast!",5,2017,09,20
125,Hands down the best hotel in London!,"Had the most wonderful stay of 3 nights at St Martins Lane Hotel. The rooms were modern, spacious and in every possible way just perfect. The superb colorful lighting around the bed, very nice and spacious bathroom with separate shower and toilet cabinets making it easy to keep the business separated :) 

Breakfast was a blast, great buffet and lots of things to order from the menu. Location is a walking distance from both Charing Cross tube and Leicester Square tube stations. The shopping options are big, just around the corner there is the LEGO and M&M mega stores and a bit further and you get the Regent St. 

I can't find anything to complain and it is the first for a London hotel! Give these guys a try and you won't regret it!",5,2017,09,20
125,Great hotel to stay in,"Excellent location, excellent food, and great design. This hotel feels like home and I like to stay there during my work related travel. Excellent service, close to the theatres and the galleries and the shops of soho.",5,2017,09,19
125,St. Martins Lane Hotel,"Overall, a great hotel. Perfect location & accommodations. The staff, especially Belle & Nick, were so attentive & friendly. Clean & modern rooms. The restaurant in the hotel was absolutely delicious, nice added bonus. Would stay here again for sure :)",5,2017,09,18
125,Absolutely amazing!,"Every stay at St. Martins Lane has been perfect but this stay was out of this world. My reservation was looked after by Isabel who saw to every detail to make sure we were treated like royalty. We arrived on my son's 12th birthday and from the moment he walked in the door he was celebrated. Our room was huge and so beautiful, the beds were comfy and my son loved the lights. We enjoyed returning to our perfectly clean room after being out all day and the nightly turn down service was appreciated. The room service menu is just what you want and the food is amazing! We had breakfast and dinner at Asia de Cuba and lunch & drinks at The Den, all our food and drinks were delicious. This was my son's first trip to London and the location of the hotel is ideal, we walked to all the sights we wanted to see. I love staying at St Martins Lane...it's perfect! Big thank you to Isabel!",5,2017,09,18
125,Small things but otherwise a great hotel ,"We had a good 7 nights stay at the hotel. Location is the best ever out of some 10+ hotels we have stayed so far, only minutes to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, China Town, and many theaters. Coffee shops and good restaurants everywhere. Love the room, fresh towels. A few small things can be better but does not lower the overall rating. 
- House keeping needs improvement. Shower and toilet not cleaned. I had to mop myself. 
- We were told we could have 4 bottles of complimentary water. But everyday, we had to call, and they deliver only 2, unless I asked for 4. 
- Friendly concierge but the boys always try and hook you up with their cab drivers whom they have deals with. I was shocked when I was asked for ¬£75 in cash for taxi to Heathrow. I said yes because I was in a hurry and forgot to order in advance. But really, best make your own arrangement or simply take a black cab that runs on meter. It does not cost 75 pounds  
- Lobby music far too loud.

125,Amazing Concierge and staff!,"Never mind that the d√©cor in the lobby was cool and child friendly, or that the room d√©cor was so modern, convenient and had changing colored lighting at your fingertips, Michael ""the concierge"" was amazing!  Michael took care of every need we had, gave us great suggestions and was so fun and energetic.  The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. If you are new to a London visit or just want a change of venue, this is the place!",5,2017,09,12
125,Great Location & Service,"I book a night at the hotel to celebrate my wife's birthday and it didn't disappoint. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  We received a room upgrade and that was a nice surprise.  The team also delivered a birthday treat to our room in the shape of a Brownie which was well received.

The hotel is located in the heart of the West End with in easy reach of the theatres and Ronnie Scott's.  the room was very quiet, even in the busy period at night when the local restaurants, theatres and pubs are closing we didn't hear any loins noise.

Breakfast was excellent with a great choice.  Would most definitely stay at the hotel again without hesitation.

Thanks to all of the staff at the hotel for making it a very pleasurable experience",5,2017,09,12
125,Great Night in London,"Came here for our honeymoon and stayed here for one night while we were in London and have no regrets and had a comfortable stay.

HOTEL
The hotel is ultra modern with special features which generally is not offered at hotels. You can change the lighting color in your room and even offers you a local cellphone you can take around if you're a tourist (side note: we were unable to work it though). The hotel is well maintained and very clean. Rooms are on the smaller side but I think this is standard for London.

SERVICE
Great great great! From the front desk check in lady to the luggage/transportation guy, everyone was so wonderful and helpful. However, there was one lady at the front who really could use another session of training. 

1st encounter:
Us:Do you know where this street is?
Her: *blank stare* no.
We asked the luggage guy and he took us out to the street and pointed literally like 50 ft away. 
Ok....

2nd encounter:
We borrowed the umbrella they offered in the rooms but because we already checked out (and was planning to return for our luggage later) they said it was fine (great service). When we came to return it, we returned it back to the same girl who didn't know the street 50 ft away. She said thanks and put the umbrella away. 

My husband: ""don't you need to know which room were from so you can note that we returned it?""
Her: ""oh yeah. what was your room number?""
Wow. 

3rd encounter:
Our driver who came to pick us up from the airport came and told the front desk he was here. 15 minutes later, we realize the driver was already here. We asked him ""were you waiting long?"" He says ""about 15 minutes... told the girl in the front I was here to pick you guys up"" After conversing with him, we realized that it's the same lady who doesn't know anything.

If it wasn't for the SPECTACULAR service from everyone else at that hotel, this girl alone could've brought this rating/review down but seriously, everyone else was so great. 

LOCATION
This hotel is about half a mile to west end and covenant garden so that was a plus. We took a train to Buckingham Palace because it's a bit further but fortunately the train station is very close to the hotel! There is a Starbucks right across the street for those from America (lol) and a lot of restaurants nearby. 

BAR
The bar has such a cool ambiance to it. Try finding the bar in your own, because it has such a cool and discreet entrance! The lady who checked us in was so sweet, she provided vouchers to the bar since we told her it was our honeymoon :)

Overall this place was great and i would recommend this hotel if you are considering it!",5,2017,09,10
125,Wow,"If you want a hotel that's out of the ordinary then this is the place for you.......try a room with a garden yes a garden in central London mind blowing !!!! The restaurant is exceptional Asia de Cuba a real treat !!
Great bar as well can't wait for the next visit !!!",5,2017,09,07
125,Luvley Hotel,My Wife and I decided to splash out on a Decent hotel for a one night stay In the West End as we were going to a Show. Our room was fantastic and we had a meal in the restaurant which was superb and Breakfast in the morning was the best I have had in a long time....We came back to the hotel after midnight and Asked for a night cap and was shown into a Lounge music bar whish was just the job to finish a great night off. The whole night was pretty expensive but We only do this once and a while and I really enjoyed it all. The staff were really friendly and when I can afford it again ...We will go back.,5,2017,09,06
125,Sexy hip hotel,"This hotel is perfect for couples (especially very naughty couples). The lobby is very big with a modern hip look and a special scent. There is also a nice restaurant in the lobby called Asia De Cuba. I tried it from room service and it was pretty good.

The room was big enough for me. It had different lighting hues as well (red if you wanna feel like you're in the Red Light District of Amsterdam, purple if you're feeling some intimacy and love, green if you're feeling refreshed, blue if you, uh, want to feel like you're swimming in the Indian ocean). Also, in the room, there is a special kind of cellphone that you can take with you to access the internet and look up some tourist sites. I thought that was a cool touch, but I also thought that nobody is gonna use that phone because of the many inconveniences of not relying on your own personal phone when you go out.

Finally, I just wanna say that the location is just amazing, especially if you're looking for nightlife or if you wanna spend some time around Piccadilly or Covent Garden.

Overall, deserves five stars. 5/5.
",5,2017,09,04
125,My second home,"I do love this hotel - it feels like my second home in london. The last years when I was traveling to London - I stayed at this trendy gem of a hotel. I like the central location in the midst of London with quiet and tranquil rooms on the other hand. The beds are so comfortable, that when I was buying a new bed for my flat, the beds of this hotel were the inspiring example. The Staff is very friendly, attentive and helpful. I always feel very welcomed and I'm enjoying my stay A LOT. Can't wait for my next London trip!",5,2017,09,04
125,A great hotel. A great area,"I'm in London often for work...and I hate business hotels. I found St Martin's Lane several years ago and I'm so glad I did. The hotel is cool and chic, the bar is fantastic and the service is always great. The beds are amazing...as is the bath products. I've stayed 15+ times and keep going back. 

I also love the neighborhood - Covent Garden! It's full of life, restaurants and pubs. Not to mention the theaters... there is also gym next door to the hotel. 

If you like modern, cool and chic - check it out. I haven't been disappointed yet.",4,2017,09,04
125,First Class Hotel with First Class Management in First Class Central Location,"The St. Martins Lane Hotel is an excellent First Class hotel with 10 star management team. Daniele Berardi has transformed a good hotel into a great hotel with the most accomodating First Class service which rivals all others. Located in the Covent Garden area of Central London, this trendy and accomodating First Class hotel has everything even the most discerning travelers may request. Not only is the hotel centrally located in the theatre district and walking distance to Trafalgar Square, the rooms are large, bright and immaculate! Words alone can not describe how fantastic warm and welcoming The St. Martins Lane Hotel is! Please go and experience this brilliant gem personally! You will be glad you did!",5,2017,09,03
125,Afternoon Tea,"Den in St Martins Lane does a wonderful afternoon tea. Great value for money and wonderful service. Highly recommend it over many other London venues that I have had afternoon tea in.
Good variety of sandwiches and cakes. So much I couldn't finish my scones.",5,2017,08,31
125,Director,"Excellent location, staff really friendly and interesting architecture. Tech a bit primitive and TV screen in far corner of room. 

Good value, friendly and will use again.

Took some great photos of outback guest in the magistrates chair",4,2017,08,31
125,Still my favourite,I keep coming back here. Excellent service and always the best nights sleep of my trips. Yes the restaurant is a little expensive but the food is good and the attention to detail appreciated. The rooms are very Phillipe Starck and the corridors atmospherically dark. The night light colour spectrum options are always amusing. Great location and quiet once you are in your room. As always another great experience here and I recommend it highly.,5,2017,08,31
125,Not sure it's 5 star... check in certainly wasn't,"Currently staying here.
When checking in to a 5 star hotel, I do expect a nice welcome. On this occasion however, our first visit, check in was really disappointing. It was merely a transaction nothing more and I think I've felt more welcome in a Premier Lodge.

Rooms are a good size, bathrooms are very nice. Beds were two doubles in our room.

It's not quite as good as I expected it would be, I've stayed in 4 star hotels
Which were equivalent. 

Location is fantastic and can't be beaten.",4,2017,08,30
125,Superb service and great atmosphere for a lovely afternoon tea,"Arranged for an afternoon tea for a special occasion and was not disappointed. The Den was quirky, had a lovely relaxed atmosphere but was suitably British for my overseas guests. The service was excellent and the staff very attentive. A special mention to Inesa, who ensured everything was to our requirements and helped explain both the setting and the menu options. The food was beautifully presented and had there was more than enough resulting in us getting take home boxes. If you like traditional sandwiches then this isn't for you. The sweet options were excellent, the only thing I could possibly fault was that the savoury pastry was a little dry. Overall a fantastic experience and definitely would recommend it.",5,2017,08,30
125,Just as good as the first time.,"I met my husband here ten years ago in the bar. We have stayed here in the past and have always loved it. Have just visited and I have to say this hotel has not lost its magic.
The service was incredible from everyone we met. The bar although refurbished still is dark and intimate. The rooms were superb. I just love everything about this place and look forward to a return visit soon.",5,2017,08,30
125,Laid Back Luxury,"Booked here very last minute at a decent rate for the location and was pleasantly surprised. It's a laid back and relaxed hotel in comparison to other five star competitors (i.e. not at all pretentious). 

Friendly and welcoming staff, quirky modern interiors and a comfy bed made it an enjoyable stay. Communal areas could do with some TLC in my opinion and the prices are pretty steep for food and drink as expected (cola almost costs the same as beer). Room service breakfast was good, but obvious touches like condiments were missing.

Overall, recommended if it's a good deal.",4,2017,08,29
125,Amazing stay,"Had a couple of nights at the wonderful St Martins Lane , staying In a deluxe Garden room , 
I think  the hotel is in top form, from the warm welcome from the Front Desk to the first class and prompt Room Service ... even when I had exhausted the supply of Whispering Angel there were creditable alternatives
As ever my stay was made very special by the seemingly omnipresent Isabelle Fowkes who seems to anticipate your every need , she and her team make the difference! 
Finally I thought the breakfast at Asia D Cuba was very good and some really interesting alternatives to the traditional ""full English""",5,2017,08,29
125,"Cool, centrally located place to stay","My husband and I spent the August Bank holiday weekend at St Martin's Lane and were really pleased with the quality of accommodation and friendliness of the staff. Our room was clean and bright, with a minimalist modern design which had everything that we needed with a smart, clean, contemporary feel. The king size bed was very comfortable and the bed linen and towels were of very good quality. We even enjoyed the mood lighting above the bed; a bit quirky. Excellent power shower with no leaks over the bathroom floor. Very nice complimentary toiletry products, and other items which you might need, including a well stocked mini bar, with clear pricing. Really good air conditioning in the room and throughout the hotel. Breakfast in the restaurant was very enjoyable and served by the most cheerful and friendly staff. We did venture one evening into the bar behind the restaurant but, although this would possibly suit people of a livelier disposition, was not quite our thing, a little dark and noisy.However, the room itself was perfectly quiet even though we were right in the heart of theatre land. This was one of the great things about this hotel, as we had booked 2 shows and were able to stroll to each of the theatres and back later. There are also plenty of bars and restaurants immediately around the hotel, and easy access to the tube. We also visited Buckingham Palace which was only a 30 minute stroll away through St James Park. Check in and check out were simple, speedy processes and the hotel was happy to store our luggage until later in the day so that we could make the most of our final day in London.",5,2017,08,29
125,Wonderful afternoon tea!,"A friend and I visited the St Martin's Lane on Friday for an afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday. The online booking process was super simple and we booked via AfternoonTea.com where we got a free glass of prosecco each.

We were greeted in The Den by a lovely waitress (I'm sorry I didn't get your name!) who looked after us exceptionally throughout. We chose to eat on the terrace, which was perfect on a sunny day. The Den looked very nice inside but was atmospherically dark and we didn't want to miss the lovely weather!

We had the terrace pretty much to ourselves so it was lovely and peaceful. The processo was served promptly along with our choice of tea in stunning Ted Baker crockery.  The food then arrived, which all looked stunning! Each element was explained in detail. which was really nice and a detail which is often overlooked. Our lovely waitress also recommended which sweet treats would travel well if we ended up being too full and needing some boxed up. Again - a lovely touch!

The mushroom brioche was my favourite savoury, but it was all really delicious. The scones were absolutely spot on and truly delicious. I even ate half of mine without butter and jam because it was so light and tasty. The cakes/pastries were also really excellent and we had to have several boxed up to take home. Even this element was executed perfectly and despite being taken to the theatre, to several bars and then on the train home, they still looked perfect when we finished them at home much later in the evening!

We have already recommended the hotel to several friends and family and will definitely be returning!",5,2017,08,29
125,St Martins,"Stayed for a night out at The Coliseum...location was perfect...staff were very helpful and friendly making you feel at ease immediately. The gentleman who loojed afterus was superb (reservation mgr I think? DANIELE)
Room was spacioys, modern and room service after midnight was excellent quality and value.
The hotel was booked as an after thought to our theatre trip, but I was very impressed and it will be my first thought for any future stays in London. ",5,2017,08,27
125,Ice cool hotel in perfect location,"This was my wife's first ever visit to the UK so I wanted to make sure her first impressions were good, and I am glad to say we were not disappointed. SML is a wonderful little oasis in London's bustling tourist hubbub - everything is soooo cool, from the friendly and stylishly attired reception staff to the funky Philippe Starck designed bedrooms. Even the loos have a touch sensitive flush, although I have to say the flush was rather noisy - would have preferred a normal loo with a quiet flush; then with the money saved they could have added a shaving mirror in the bathroom?

Breakfast is good but we felt the buffet was a bit average, although when we stayed they were offering a ¬£15 per person breakfast which included one freshly cooked item from the a la carte menu.

Not a cheap place to stay but definitely worth it if you want to splurge in the centre of theatre land for a couple of nights. Also J.Sheekey is just round the corner - I hadn't been there for many years so it was nice to see that it hadn't changed and was as lovely as ever.",5,2017,08,24
125,"A warm, fun, and hospitable place to stay","Amazing hotel in every sense. Clean, up to date, beautiful and really high energy. Strongly recommend for business (you can chill out after a long day of work), and for vacationers, as it is very central to the best attractions of London. You walk to almost anywhere, and you also have 2 options of tube stations very near by. ",5,2017,08,22
125,Efficient hotel in good location,"I stayed here just for one night on business - great location within walking distance of good bars and restaurants.  The rooms are very ""white"" and minimalist, but still stylish, i found them comfortable and with everything I needed.  They have a ""hidden"" bar which is cute.  Breakfast was very good.

Hotel has been around for a long time, but it still delivers.",4,2017,08,18
125,Location can't be beaten,"This was our 2nd stay here after absolutely loving it last year. This time the place just felt a bit unloved and a bit of Googling out of curiosity at the changes showed that the hotel has changed ownership since our last visit. 

The decor was not kept quite as immaculate but more noticeable was the drop in service level. Breakfast on Sunday morning was so poor. It took me 25 minutes from sitting down to getting a cup of coffee, and then it was one small cup - no pot or hope of a refill. It wasn't that busy  but just totally disorganised. Monday morning was much better but no hot food on the buffet on this day. 

We stayed on Sunday night. The cocktail bar was not open even though the website states that it is. We decided to have a drink in the snug. Absolutely impossible to get service there even after asking at reception. Just gave up and had a cup of tea in the room. 

Rooms are good and the location is amazing but I am also paying for the experience of being in a luxury hotel and St Martins Lane fell short this time for us. ",4,2017,08,14
125,Amazing stay!,"This is our 2nd visit to St Martins Lane hotel and we loved it even more than the first time.
We were visiting London for our daughters 12th birthday and booked a 2 night break in the loft double double room. Wow what a room! Spacious, clean, modern with amazing views. I booked the room through the lovely Belle who really did make our daughters birthday extra special. Our room was ready much earlier than expected and when we got to the room it was decorated with balloons, a card a birthday cake and some wonderful gifts for her, she was literally over the moon so thank you so much Belle you really are a credit to the hotel. 
The hotel location really is the best, so close to everything. We went to see Matilda (fabulous musical, thoroughly recommend) which was a 5 minute walk away. 
Just wanted to add the bar staff in Asia de Cuba were fantastic as were the guys on the door.
Thank you all for making our stay so very special. 
We will definitely be back. üòä

125,Silver Anniversary Celebration,"Fabulous hotel in well located in the West End with easy access to Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square and all London attractions

Really good breakfast, young and attentive staff. Beautiful large bedroom with excellent views over London, 

Will definitely stay again",5,2017,08,14
125,Birthday celebrations at st martins lane,"My wife and I stayed at St Martins Lane for her 30th birthday celebrations. The hotel was absolutely amazing. It had a great location between Covent Garden and Leicester Square which was great for us as we had a meal and theatre tickets, meaning we were walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go.

The staff throughout were amazing, from booking the room, checking in, concierge to arranging a special treat for my wife. Due to it being my wife's birthday they couldn't have done more and arranged champagne and birthday cake in our room, which went down really well!!

We stayed in the loft room which was such a fantastic room, and far more spacious than I thought it would be with spectacular views across London. The room truly made the trip memorable.

The staff throughout really made it such an enjoyable, unforgettable experience and we can't wait until our next night away, where we will most definitely be visiting again.",5,2017,08,12
125,Fragrant chic,"It was Kate's birthday on the eighth so I booked a night at the hotel to coincide with a visit to the Lyceum theatre just yards away .id mentioned it was Kate's birthday to the lady who took my booking and when we arrived the reception staff wished kate a happy birthday along with vouchers for free cocktails in The Den ,splendid .but then ,later in the afternoon a waiter brought a chilled bottle of prosecco to our room .oh ,if only all hotels were like this !wonderful rooms ,fabulous ambiance ,lovely breakfast .heaven ,don't hesitate ,book now !

125,"Good food, very central London hotel, you do pay a price for this","Friendly staff and modern d√©cor hotel. Food is very nice if not a pretentious menu wise. Rooms are well furnished and clean. Shower rooms are specious and the  toiletries are lovely. The rooms are a bit bland, plain white, but perfect for sleeping in as they have very comfortable mattress'.",4,2017,08,11
125,Price isn't necessarily a measure of quality ...,"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for...But it is also said that price isn't necessarily a measure of quality.  In this case, it's amazing how well treated you are staying here!  The staff were all very friendly.  The styling might not be to everyone's taste, but I love it.  You cannot beat its fantastic location in the heart of Covent Garden.  The Blind Spot Bar is excellent and worth visiting of itself.",5,2017,08,11
125,"Awesome place, clean, excellent location!!","I stayed with my wife and two small kids this July 2017. 
Absolutely great hotel; very clean (room, lobby, restaurant..), it feels new, especially bathroom in our room looked awesome. Room was ok standard size, we had two queen beds so it felt smaller than it really is. View was ok. Breakfast was part of the deal; 15 GBP per adult and kids eat free! Breakfast was btw amazing, great menu you can choose from and food was delicious. There is gym next to the hotel (not part of the hotel) with free access to hotel guests. Best part is the location, between Leicester Sq and Trafalgar Sq and 1 minute away from Covent Garden, it was ideal for us. Really great place, nothing bad to say about it. My wife and I highly recommend it and will be back next time we're in London. ",5,2017,08,09
125,Day away,This wasnt as good as we thought it would be especially for the price. We had a look on a website but we now feel was misleading. The room i felt was to clinical looking. The bedroom wasnt very big at all. They said it had a bathroom but it was a shower cubicle. I love a nice bath. So i was disappointed. The hotel smelt lovely and the staff were really nice and polite. And i can recommend there full english breakfast. Just not for us and wont be returning.üòï,3,2017,08,09
125,"Great location, friendly and stylish","Situated just off Leicester Square, St Martins Lane is an ideal location for a theatre based London trip such as ours was. It's cool, stylish, modern and minimalist, yet the staff are extremely friendly, helpful and go out of their way to accommodate early arrivals, room upgrades etc. Our room was on the 5th floor and was very well designed: the interior door separating the bedroom from the lovely bathroom, shower and dressing area also made the room extremely quiet. We may have been staying in one of the busiest nightspots in London but our room was a haven of peace and quiet. The minibar was well stocked but fairly pricy.

There are literally hundreds of restaurants of all budgets around the hotel, but the catering here is superb, although quite expensive. My breakfast was a crunchy potato waffle with a generous helping of smoked salmon, 2 poached eggs and a spoonful of crushed avocado, delicious. My wife had haloumi, flatbread, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms and avocado. The espresso was perfectly decent, if not outstanding and there was a great selection of pastries, bread, fruit and yoghurts etc. We also had supper in Asia de Cuba (see separate review) and we would not hesitate in recommending this hotel as a perfect London getaway, Can't wait for our next visit.",5,2017,08,08
125,Cool Vibes in London,"We had a wonderful time at St. Martins. The service was outstanding. The door men couldn't have been more helpful. The rooms are very modern and have an edgy vibe- reminded me of W Hotels but better. The housekeepers were great and very attentive. Lastly, the location is outstanding. You are a few minutes to Covent Gardens, the Theatre district, Picadilly Circus to name a few. The hotel is located by a few different subway lines. Even though you are in the middle of everything, the rooms are very quiet. I can't recommend this hotel enough! We will be back!",5,2017,08,07
125,Another great stay at St. Martins Lane,"Stayed this weekend as part of a birthday treat for my daughter.  I've stayed here a few times now. This is one of my favourite hotels in London; chic decor, immaculate rooms and warm friendly service.  Location is second to none for the theatre district.  Thank you to Belle, Sonia and the whole front of house team for going the extra mile to ensure we had a great time.",5,2017,08,07
125,Central and modern,"This hotel is right in the centre of theatre district with restaurants everywhere.
The rooms are bright, clean and comfortable.  The staff are excellent, very friendly and helpful.  There is a relaxed atmosphere around the hotel and I was made to feel very welcome.   Would definitely use again.",5,2017,08,06
125,Very modern,"I stayed here with my son, we had to have separate rooms as they have no twin rooms.
The view from the room was over roof tops, and I had a lovely view of someone's washing.The rooms are clean and very quite, but style wise very modern, a little too so for me, also small,we went to the bar on our 1st evening, it was sooo dark I couldn't read the menu I was given, When I commented on,This the staff just said yes it is so. I ordered a Woods Rum setting I have not seen for years, what I got was white bicardi.
I will not be going back not 1for me.",3,2017,08,04
125,Hotel design in central London,"We were there for a week and everything was just as we expected. A wonderfully designed hotel by Ph. Stark. we had a suite room on a calm angle of the hotel on the 5th floor. Enjoyable large room with all the comfort one could ask for. The hotel ameneties are all there and it is few steps away from Leicester Square tube station. The service great and the welcome very warm. Loved every minute of it, cleanliness calm attention service staff everything one can expect from a hotel of its category. One thing to remember absolutly is a British convertion charger for any electrical device you might use not made in Britain, although the 2 UBS charger by the bed very appeciated.",5,2017,08,03
125,Upscale hotel convenient to Covent Garden and Theatre District,"We booked 3 nights having previously stayed at a sister property across the river.  We were familiar with the Mondrian brand and this location did not disappoint.  It is very hip and modern with a tough to find entrance.  Hint:  its between the two trees.  Fortunately London cabbies know what they are doing.

The rooms are very comfortable, but small.  If you have large luggage it can be a challenge figuring out a way to store it.  However, the amenities and location make up for the size of the rooms.  This is very convenient to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Theatre, SOHO and Bloomsbury. The on site restaurant is Asia de Cuba.  We had an amazing and expensive meal there.  

We found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful.  They booked a taxi for us to the airport for the morning of our departure.  Please note that when you book a taxi in advance you are paying a set rate for a private hire taxi.  You do not pay the meter rate.  Our taxi left the hotel at 5:50 am and cost 75 pounds to go to Heathrow.  This seemed fair, although with little traffic at that hour a metered rate probably would have cost less.",5,2017,08,03
125,Lovely stay!,"Spent three nights at the St Martin's Lane hotel and loved it.  Our friends were traveling with us and this was their second stay at the hotel.  I understand why!  The rooms were spacious and decorated perfectly.  The bathroom is an odd open concept space which made it a little difficult with our kids but we managed.  The room is clean, comfortable, and the lights behind the beds were so fun. We had afternoon tea in the den downstairs and it was fantastic.  All in all, a wonderful hotel, perfect location and great stay.",5,2017,08,02
125,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here weekend Adele concert got cancelled.  Fantastic service, got a room upgrade and a couple of cocktails on the house.  They were so nice to us, would definitely stay here again. Great location, great hotel, hopefully be back again. ",5,2017,08,02
125,Very good place to stay,"Stayed here for a couple of nights with my wife for our wedding anniversary. Very impressed with this hotel and all of the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.  As it was our anniversary, it was a very pleasant surprise to be given a complimentary bottle of champagne by the hotel staff after our daughter had secretly phoned them to tell them it was our anniversary!  Did not eat any meals in the hotel apart from breakfast which was excellent.  Location is ideal for exploring around the Trafalgar Square area, plus Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and Covent Garden.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,08,02
125,Afternoon tea,Thoroughly recommend the Afternoon tea. Amazing cakes and savouries. Quirky bar. Friendly staff. Would happily come again. Thank you so much for looking after us so well. Even had a 'doggie bag' to take some uneaten cakes home with us.,5,2017,07,30
125,Fantastic hotel! Highly recommended ,"What a great hotel! From the moment you walk in you are greeted with an amazing sent and opulent surroundings.  

The rooms are equally as glamorous with cool lighting, stainless steel fittings and an amazing bathroom. Best shower I've ever had.  Bed very comfortable and with s check out time of 12noon who could ask for more! ",5,2017,07,29
125,Worth every penny,"This is a gem of a hotel. It is located within walking distance of great London attractions from theatre to Buckingham Palace, National Gallery and more. Rooms are clean and quiet with windows that open. Go for the breakfast deal at 15 pounds you can eat well and skip lunch. ",5,2017,07,28
125,A+ across the board.,"Excellent staff, very attentive to detail, restaurants and room service both as good as it gets for value and quality.  The area continues to provide great finds for restaurants, easy to find an exhibit at a nearby museum or catch one of a hundred different plays nearby.  If this isn't the heart of London, I don't know what is.",5,2017,07,25
125,Nice hotel and location,"My family and I arrived at the hotel in the morning after an overnight flight.  The front desk was pleasant and accommodating and allowed us to check in early once the room was ready.  The room, a ""double-double loft"" was a quiet corner room with two comfortable double beds, large bathroom with walk-in shower and separate tub, floor to ceiling windows; a good lodging option for a family (parents and up to two kids) without the need for a second room, rollaway bed, or sofa bed.  Great location within walking distance to theaters, restaurants, and museums. The rates are somewhat lower for comparable hotels in the area. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,24
125,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Modern, quirky but really comfortable hotel.  Rooms are great and the service is friendly, relaxed (all first names here) but still impeccable.  Bar serves amazing cocktails and is a real hidden treasure.  Can't beat the location, right in the very heart of things.  My new favourite hotel if I am in town to see a show.",5,2017,07,23
125,Odd but great,"What a strange place - the entrance is like an office really and the set up in the lobby is equally very unlike any hotel I've ever been to. But it all works - bizarrely.
 
I booked the room same day on the last minute .com 'secret bookings' thing where you choose a star rating - in this case five - and you get a basic description of a handful of hotels that fit your search filters but not the name as the rate is heavily discounted. If you don't mind where you stay within an area its brilliant value. When I paid the name was revealed and I must say I probably wouldn't have booked looking at the room d√©cor. But again it does actually work and I ended up really liking the minimalist scheme in the room and hotel generally. 

Room was super clean and the sheets on the bed crisp and fresh. It was their standard room - it was absolutely fine. I was in 520 and the view was good and incredibly quiet for Central London.

The hotel itself is in a fantastic position. Very safe with loads of restaurants cafes gallaries etc within 1 minute. Staff all very friendly and informal for a five star - which I like. 

Just a couple of negatives though which stopped it getting a 5 star review. The corridors are very dark - all part of the styling I know but none the less a bit too dim. 

Also, I needed to stay another night so asked reservations if they could do the same rate or close and I'll stay another night. They could only do a rate that worked out to be double what I had paid the night before. I declined. They did confirm they had no other booking for the room - they obviously would prefer an empty room. Anyway, I went back on the last minute thing and did the same exercise and got the Hyatt Churchill - another 5 star - for actually less than I paid the night before for this place!",4,2017,07,22
125,Afternoon Tea,"I booked this via the internet with no prior info and was really pleased. A very modern afternoon tea with a great selection. If anything too much, but they did box up what we left to bring home. The staff were very knowledgable and friendly. A great looking boutique hotel just minutes from theatre land and Covent Garden.",5,2017,07,19
125,Great location! Fantastic value for money ,"This is the second time we are staying here for a week. We got two room at the corner facing each other, a convenience arrangement.  It has been recently renovated, however  Philippe Starcks' works are still strongly present. I love boutique hotel like this that offer intimacy in style with confident. Breakfast at the Asia Cuba resturant is delicious and healthy. If London does not have enough activities to engage you, there's also a gym, hair saloon and music bar. Small but compact. The most priceless point is its strategic location in the West ends, we could walk to the Big Ben, National Gallery, Soho, Trafalgar Square, plus all the major shopping areas, attractions and theatres. A short stroll after the performances we could find plentiful great resturant. Highly recommended! ",5,2017,07,19
125,Super location,"This hotel is incredibly well located in Covent Garden, walking distance from theaters, restaurants and other attractions. 

It is very modern and comfortable, with warm welcoming personnel. The Asia de Cuba restaurant is also excellent. ",5,2017,07,19
125,Stylish hotel ,"Overall we had a good experience at this hotel - there were only a few negative elements which made this a 4 star rather than a 5 star rating. 
The hotel is very stylish but also practical. Whilst our room was modern and sleek, there were plenty of plug outlets (in areas that made sense e.g. by the mirrors so you could easily do your hair), and lots of lamps and spotlights so you could control how bright/dark you wanted your room. The bed and linens were of a high quality and extremely comfortable - I had a great sleep for all 5 nights of my stay. 
The bathroom was beautiful and was my favourite area of the hotel room - it was spacious, clean, and the shower had great water pressure. 
Housekeeping was thorough and we came back to a spotless room every day. 
The negatives - I had requested a room on a high floor. I was contacted prior to my stay to ask if I wanted to pay an upgrade for a better room. I went ahead and paid, assuming that this would mean a better chance of a room on a high floor.  However, when we checked in, we found out the room was on the first floor. Not only that, after we'd been in the room for a while, we noticed an overwhelming smell of smoke. It was only later that I found out the first floor used to be a 'smoking floor', and even though this isn't the case now, the limited smoking rooms they do currently offer are all on the first floor. The manager (Sameena) did a great job of resolving this though - she moved us to another (larger) room at no extra cost with apologies and no fuss. I was very impressed by her level of customer service. 
The other negative was at checkout. After leaving, I noticed that I had been overcharged. However, after I contacted the hotel the error was quickly corrected. Overall we had a great experience and I'd recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,07,18
125,Stylish and modern hotel in a brilliant location,"we had stayed here regularly up until about 10 years ago, when we started to get bored with the minimalist clean lines and dark bars.

It has clearly been refurbished since our previous visits.  The chic bar has been replaced by the Den, which is an overly dark cocktail bar.  The drinks are excellent as were the staff.

The room was comfortable and we slept well.  It was nice having USB charger sockets in useful places (by both the table and bed).  Everything was clean and worked as it should, the shower was nice.  But, the curtains were nearly impossible to close, as you need lean right over the desk and TV to get them to close (try doing that are a few Den cocktails).  Also the windows had built in Venetian blinds, but you could control them or roll them up - which obscured the view....I am sure, blinds/curtains used to motorised (or am I thinking of somewhere else?)

We would stay again if we had the need to be in that location, but we prefer the sister hotel The Sanderson

Location is spot on",4,2017,07,17
125,Stylish hotel with great service ,"In a fantastic location this hotel is really impressive on arrival - quirky, modern decor (love the stools!) and great service. 
The rooms are a decent size & well designed (plug sockets in all the right places, a rare find!) and the bathroom is spacious with an amazing shower. 
Didn't eat in the restaurant however we did have a drink in the hidden bar at the back which is worth a visit. Again, great service and good selection of drinks. 
The only thing I felt let this place down was the breakfast. It wasn't bad by any means but it really wasn't anything special. A basic, self service selection of the traditional English breakfast options and a few pastries but I really expected more from such a nice hotel. ",4,2017,07,16
125,Simply The Best - A Real Gem In The Crown Of London,"The staff service and in particular the service the manager provided us with was simply exemplary, the best experience we have had staying in London. 
We stay in London quite a lot for both business and pleasure - this will be our go to hotel and we have also added to our business list because of the amazing service.
We had to book here at short notice as a pretentious and unreliable hotel on the South Bank decided to give our room away leaving us stranded.
The manager went above and beyond the necessary service to help us with everything to ensure that we had a memorable stay for the right reasons.
The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and fresh; accessibility to the middle of London is second to none.

A truly exceptional hotel and team.",5,2017,07,15
125,Noce and quite but close the curtains ,"Very nice and modern hotel! The restaurant and the lounge are good too serving good drinks and food! Very bright and clean Rooms but be careful, close the curtains if you don't want the rest of the buildings to see you when you are in your private place! ",4,2017,07,13
125,Great Location & Style,"Great location, rooms are reasonably nice but stay away from the 1st floor if you're sensitive to smoke. There's a bit of a lingering smell, likely a hangover from the somewhat recent conversion to a nonskoking floor. We changed rooms but they were kind enough to upgrade us for the inconvenience.
Ahmet was great and always going out of his way to make sure our stay was comfortable. 
They did mess up our bill when we checked out but corrected the error. A little inconvenient. 
We would go back.",4,2017,07,13
125,Luxury accommodations  at reasonable prices,"I booked the St. Martin's because we made our travel plans at the last minute and the price listed was reasonable. The hotel was one of the best I've been to. The rooms were beautifully appointed, clean, spacious and quiet. The hotel served an amazing breakfast that was included in the room price, and the staff were incredibly helpful and cordial. I would go back to London just to stay at St. Martin's.",5,2017,07,13
125,Perfectly romantic ,"Having finally decided to book a last minute hotel for our 12th wedding anniversary, we were bowled over by the warm reception we received from all the staff at the St Martin. It was the first anniversary we actually decided to spoil ourselves, and whilst checking in we were asked our reason for the last minute booking . By the time we returned to the hotel from dinner we had a surprise complementary bottle of bubbly in our room! Thank you to all the staff especially to Sameena for the wonderful stay. Will be back soon!",5,2017,07,13
125,One of my favorites in West End,"Perfect for a short stay when you need to be central and don't mind the Wend Est buzz. Very vibrant, fun and different to most stiff Mayfair establishments. We enjoyed everything, from service to decor to the surrounding area.",5,2017,07,11
125,Perfect location,Ideal location to visit all the main attractions by foot. The best restaurants are all nearby too but the hidden cocktail bar in the hotel is a true gem for a relaxing night cap. Daniela at the front desk couldn't have been more helpful throughout our stay. A real pleasure to deal with. Keep up the great work.,5,2017,07,09
125,Modern hotel,"Modern style great reception area, fully staffed and no waiting, great restaurant and two lovely bar areas. We stayed in  a garden room ultra modern set up huge amount of sockets and charger power! Nice shower room and an interesting garden area.
Nicely situated near the Coliseum  theatre",4,2017,07,09
125,New to London,Great location and service.  The garden room was spacious and what one would expect from a Morgan's hotel. Concierge (Biken) was outstanding!  The restaurant was very good.  Free gym next door was awesome.  Perfect for someone new to London.,5,2017,07,08
125,Swanky!,"St. Martin's is a great hotel if you like modern places to stay. The rooms all feature beautiful open windows that give great light to the clean, white rooms. Layout was a little weird in our room - there was a long hallway, and a shorter sleeping area, but overall it felt large enough for two people. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and helped us to arrange an outing to Windsor Castle. My only negative feedback was that there were tiny gnats in the room - none of them bit us, but it still felt a bit unnerving. Aside from the room itself, you're in a great location - central to everything tourist, while still having access to tons of great restaurants and shows in the neighborhood. Absolutely would stay there again!",4,2017,07,05
125,Upmarket minimalism,"Stayed here for the first time and can certainly recommend it. It was suggested to us by a friend, who said it was different to the run of the mill London  hotels (good though they might be) and that we would enjoy it. He was right we did. The staff were all helpful but managed to be so with a relaxed, almost laid back vibe. We were very happy with the room which was huge and very modern and uncluttered. The bathroom was in proportion to the room, so also huge and very luxurious having a large free standing tub in addition to a walk in shower. Breakfast was also very enjoyable with a good selection of food on offer. Whilst it was not a factor for us, for anyone wanting a base from which to explore London this would fit the bill, being just a short walk from Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden.",5,2017,07,05
125,Fabulous Hotel!,"My friends and I recently stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel and we all LOVED it! The location could not be better. Its right next to great shops, both big name stores (plus Covent Garden) and there are great quirky indpendant shops on the doorstep too. Plus theatres, bars and eating places a plenty.
We were really impressed by the hotel itself - lovely lobby - bright, spacious and very modern. The staff at reception were extremely friendly and helpful - nothing seemed like too much trouble. It was my friends birthday and there was a bottle of fizz with a best wishes message left in the room which I thought was a lovely touch.

Our corner room was lovely - cool white, spacious funky lighting and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was big and really comfortable. The bathroom was also really spacious with a stand alone luxury bath that I wish I had at home. 

There was a great choice for breakfast - lots of things to choose from at the buffet (fab fruit salad and choice of breads!) and the breakfast menu choice was refreshingly different from the normal bog standard hotel breakfast menus. 

We had late night drinks in the hotel bar and the atmosphere was realy good - the DJ played soul/funk so not too clubby.

We all really liked the overall vibe of the hotel - young,modern, friendly, cool, amazing location - and I highly recommend it for a London stay if you want to make the most of the city.",5,2017,07,05
125,It's ok,"I think this hotel is overpriced the service is good and if you are a techy you would probably be impressed but I wasn't.  So ¬£500 a night no extras location is good but apart from that ??????  That's all I have to say!                                   
                                    

",3,2017,07,04
125,"Loved the staff and the room, very good base for site seeing","The Hotel is just a few doors down from the Coliseum Theatre, a short walk to Covent Garden , in a very good position for site seeing and getting a good feel of London.  Can't praise the staff enough, they made our stay very welcoming, nothing was too much trouble.  The room was very clean, modern and welcoming .",5,2017,07,03
125,Faultless!,"We stayed in the Deluxe Garden room for the first time and it was fantastic. We even had breakfast in the Garden! Considering location, room size and quality, the price was very reasonable. Thanks for another fantastic stay. Tip: The Mojito's in BlindSpot are great.",5,2017,06,29
125,Nice hotel with banging doors!!,"The hotel has a really great location, friendly staff and my room and bathroom were modern and spacious. 

BUT, the doors kept on banging in the hall way (would seem that staff have little respect for guests wanting to rest or just chill). Walls have very poor insulation and every tap against the next door room wall is clearly heard. When room doors are banged non-stop, it becomes a nightmare! Very irritating and a pitty what could have been ≈Ñ very nice hotel. 

Unless management address this problem urgently, we will not be back.",2,2017,06,29
125,Amazing hotel in an superb location!,I've been staying at St Martins Lane Hotel since 2005 and I usually stay there 4 to 5 times per year. I just love this hotel. The staff is great and makes me feel at home. The location is just fabulous and the design is gorgeous. I truly recommend this hotel!,5,2017,06,28
125,"Very central, superb breakfast","The hotel is located very centrally, with very nice areas for walking, eating out and shopping as soon as you step out the door. The breakfast in this hotel is amazing, superb, fantastic.... if you have a package that includes the separate orders.",5,2017,06,26
125," Modern Delight","Modern hotel in the heart of the West End.  Great modern decor, very clean, good facilities and excellent staff and service. Rooms are a little small... but in-line with most other central London hotels in this price range. My new favorite hotel for stays in a London. ",5,2017,06,23
125,Fantastic Stay,As I travel extensively on business I can be critical about hotels but this one is very special with amazing very friendly service. Location is excellent and good value for money. I will always stay here in future when in London ,5,2017,06,21
125,A night at st martins lane hotel with afternoon tea,"I booked a night away sometime ago and selected the hotel as it was close to the theatre where we were to see The Mouse Trap, afternoon tea was booked later and we were not disappointed.
Finding the hotel can be difficult there does not appear to be a name over the door just look for the two tall potted bay trees (bay, I think!) the hotel is contemporary and from the moment you enter you know the hotel is quite special, we were early and left our bags and wandered around Soho and China town that and Covent Garden are so close it is ideally situated for the theatres shopping or just chilling.
Once we got our key the room did not disappoint spacious and well fitted with. A great bathroom,coffee making facilities and one of the most comfortable beds we have slept in. Really the room could not be faulted and we heard no other guests during the night not indeed during the day.
Afternoon tea was less than ¬£30 but was as good as many we have paid almost twic as much for and what we couldn't eat we took away in a small bag. The staff were extremely attentive without being overbearing and we really enjoyed the
experience the fact that we were given a free glass of bubbly and a cocktail was unexpected but a great bonus.
We were also given, upon arrival, vouchers for a cocktail in the bar, ok you pay for them in the Pom rate but it was a nice touch and the hidden bar is worth finding, look for the hand directly in front of you when you enter the hotel.
Great location and great hotel it really is worth giving it a go, I am sure you won't be disappointed. 
We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but that is by choice, we always look for a little cafe for breakfast.",5,2017,06,21
125,Modern comfort,"Great location right in the middle of where you want to be, theatre, restaurants, Covent Garden is a great choice, especially when, like us we were trying to fit it all into a long weekend.
Modern hotel, stunning views from our bedroom, everything is done well from the comfortable nights sleep to the amazing gym here.
Celebrating a milestone we were very glad we stayed here, instead of the usual more famed suspects, the service here was impeccable.
Superb weekend.",5,2017,06,21
125,Excellent Rooms and Great Staff,"Stayed at The St Martins Lane Hotel last weekend and what a Great stay it was. We had a Queen room which had its own small but boutique garden just off the bathroom area.

The room itself is of moderate size but is so well designed that it felt quite spacious.

Karolina on Reception was very helpful and always approachable as was Ricardo. Also the Asia De Cuba restaurant where we had Breakfast was lovely, especially with the excellent and professional assistance from Anthony.

Finally with a bit of a twist, their is a secret hidden bar which is brilliant. Perfect size great ambience and managed by a great team with lots of knowledge and advice towards Cocktails and all the drinks available.

Overall great Hotel and brilliant Team... Don't Miss out on this ideally located Hotel",5,2017,06,20
125,In the heart of the West End of London ,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay here, the staff were friendly and attentive. The reception was large with quirky furniture.
Our room was very modern and had a good view and was comfortable.
 Thank you to Belle for the cake!!

125,Des R,"St Martins Lane Hotel is a modern Hotel in the area of Leicester Square, the staff are very helpful and obliging, we were invited to the Hotel for an AGM which included a buffet lunch, the buffet was a cold Chinese dishes which some of the guests could not eat and the staff quickly asked the chefs to prepare some hot dishes which were delicious. The Desert was hot miniature doughnuts in sauce. The Hotel Gents toilet in the foyer needs to have better lighting as inside it was extremely dark.",4,2017,06,19
125,Great Hotel in Central London,Excellent hotel in the heart of London.  Modern funky and chic!  Great staff and excellent service always.  The gym below the hotel (Gym Box) is fabulous and the hotel also launder your gym kit as part of the excellent service,5,2017,06,19
125,Good location and helpful staff,"This hotel is near the Leicester Sq underground stop several cafes, a theatre across the street.and Covent Garden close by. Check the room size when booking. Some are quite small but this is central London and prices are high. Hotel selection in London will depend on what one wants to be near. For us, it's Covent Garden, the Theatre district and the Underground. For these, the SM Hotel is ideal.",5,2017,06,18
125,Light and Dark!,"Business overnight stay with meetings on both days. Staff are faultless and very efficient. What was however alittle unnerving were the very dark corridors lit only by room numbers situated on the skirting boards and the most subdued energy efficiency bulbs l have ever experienced - actually needed the torch on my phone at one point. The bedroom was however lovely and light - super big shower room and a well filled mini bar. Meeting in the bar for group drinks was an experience l will not repeat. Horribly crowded, very noisy, not enough staff for the number of guests and frankly tiny for the size of the hotel. No external Windows, very dark decor so very claustrophobic. Toilets equality dark. Breakfast would have suited any taste and the meeting room was lovely and light. It's an interesting hotel with great staff in a superb location but not without some peculiarities. ",4,2017,06,18
125,Fab afternoon tea,"Visited with friends for afternoon tea. Super friendly but relaxed staff. Amazing food, only ""complaint"" was there was so much we couldn't manage it. Have added photos, each tea comes with 3 savouries, scones, and 5 other deserts. I only wish that I'd stuck to my initial idea and skipped the sandwiches so I could sample more of rest. Also came with a complimentary glass of fizz.",5,2017,06,17
125,Great place,"Trendy and great hotel with excellent location - very central and close to restaurants and touristic areas. 
The staff was great, helpful and friendly. 
The room was very small. 
The free access to the gym box near by was a great surprise, including also free laundry for my gym outfit. ",4,2017,06,14
125,A location thats hard to beat -,"I regularily stay in London with my job and like to try different hotels - I normally opt for the Atheneum but tried this one for a change - 
Pros - the staff are friendly and efficient but not over friendly .
The location is brilliant - right in the heart of Covent Garden/Leicester Square etc 
Lovely little snug bar with quirky pictures 
clean rooms and bathrooms a decent size
Cons - rooms are snug - so much so its hard to pass each other lol - 
lack of hanging space for 2 peoples for a weeks stay 

I would def stay here again with work or for a special occasion and if you can afford to upgrade that might help :-)",4,2017,06,07
125,Fabulous location ,"From the outside you would not know what a great hotel lies within!  Very friendly staff especially Annie from Sunderland.  Rooms are minimalistic but spacious and comfortable.  Quirky dark den bar.  So easy to walk to Covent Garden, and theatres.  Trafalgar Square is a hundred yards away.  Would recommend this Hotel ",4,2017,06,06
125,Fantastic afternoon tea,"Having been lucky enough to sample quite a few afternoon teas in London hotels, I can say that this ranks high up there! Lots of variety & 'sizeable' for a start. The Den is a cosy little place in which to enjoy it all - enjoy the quirky artwork.  Brilliant service from Inesa. Highly recommend.",5,2017,06,06
125,Lovely boutique hotel in the middle of the West-End.,"I've stayed here many times on business trips and each time, it's always been a pleasure. The rooms are always well appointed and the layouts are simple, minimalist and amazingly well thought out (the USB ports on either side of the bed are so convenient).

Guests have access to Gym Box to workout and sign up for more specialized classes (like kettle bells, boxing, etc.) and you can take all that good exercise back with the breakfast buffet. It's not the best breakfast food in London but it's still pretty great.

As more and more people find out about this hotel, it's become more and more expensive to stay but if the budget works, it's always my first choice.",4,2017,06,01
125,Fantastic hotel in the middle of the West-End!,"St Martin's Lane is part of the Morgan's Hotel Group and it shows!
Everything is top notch: the location is unbeatable, the foyer breath taking, their Asia de Cuba restaurant is very well known and rightly so, as it's their bar with the quirky ""hand"" handle.
We had possibly one of the best rrom in the building, I think it was 620, definitely worth asking for an upgrade if possible.
If you can afford it, go for it, it's delightful""",5,2017,05,29
125,Quirky!,"We stayed here with friends on a Saturday night. The hotel is amazing, it has some very quirky touches and you need to think outside of the box to work them out, especially in the lounge area, just off of the main reception. We had a bed and breakfast package and couldn't fault anything at all. The staff are friendly and helpful, we were even able to check into our room at just after 11am instead of the advertised 3pm; this was very convenient, as we could drop off our luggage and take a short stroll to Covent Garden for lunch. The rooms in the hotel were clean, comfortable, spacious and well equipped.
The breakfast the following morning was a delicious and plentiful buffet. All in all a great stay in the buzzing centre of London.",5,2017,05,29
125,"Ok, but could be a lot better","Potentially a lovely hotel, but unfortunately lots of little things were not quite right. My room wasn't serviced throughout my stay and the toilet and shower had plumbing problems.  Great location, but definitely not 5 star. Must add I did let the hotel know that I wasn't happy and I was offered a discounted stay if I wanted to stay again, buy unfortunately I don't feel like spending more money on this hotel to give it ""another go"". ",2,2017,05,28
125,Afternoon tea,"Best afternoon tea yet. Wonderful food, fab cakes, excellent service by lovely people. Better than gleneagles Hotel even!! If your in town just do it. Champagne great too. Very understated Hotel but individual and fun just loved it and right in the centre of London.",5,2017,05,28
125,Hen weekend,"Had a  two night stay here with a number of other ladies on a hen weekend.  My room was upgraded to include a bath which I was very happy about.  Lovely big room, comfy bed and nice bath.  Very noisy outside all night but that is just the situation and nothing hotel can do about that.  Had a kitkat and bottle of water from mini bar and was charged ¬£9 !!!  Ridiculous.",4,2017,05,28
125,Great location Great hotel,"I booked a 2 night stay here after reading some excellent reviews and I was not disappointed. The hotel was in a great location a few minutes walk away from Leicester Square tube station and in the heart of the theatre world. Our deluxe room was on the third floor and looked out over the London Coliseum, the room was the best that I have ever stayed in, lovely big bed with crisp cotton sheets, a flat screen TV, tea and coffee making facilities, iron/board and a separate room that had a modern sink, toilet, walk in shower and an open space with a draw curtain to hang/store your clothing. Breakfast was help your self to continental and choose one dish from the resteraunts breakfast menu - lovely. We did not take advantage of the mini bar or the hotels cocktail bar as were quite pricey which is only to be expected in a 5 star hotel in London. The staff were very friendly and nothing was to much trouble, our room was attended to twice a day with clean towels each time. I would definatly recommend this hotel and will definatly stay here again.",5,2017,05,24
125,Good,Expensive but good. Excellent breakfast. Too average lunch and dinner we found kind of superficial asiaticists (to be improved!). Pretty and clean rooms. Proper public areas missing. Service: attentive (sometimes a bit relaxed? ).,4,2017,05,24
125,Well-situated Boutique Hotel in Central London,"I stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel for six nights in May. The hotel is part of the SBE Morgan's chain of boutique-style hotels that have a modern appeal to them. From the glass-clad outside to the edgy, contemporary inside, the hotel shouts modernity -- in a good way. The spacious lobby that flows into the bar and the Latin fusion restaurant, all are pleasing to the eye and functional.

The staff were friendly and attentive, without being intrusive. I was pleasantly surprised that the room was bigger (not big) than is commonly found in refurbished older hotels in central London. The room amenities were up-to-date (e.g. USB charging ports in the wall!) as was the bathroom.

One of the best features of the hotel is its location. Close to Leicester Square and Charing Cross stations, right by Covent Garden, in the midst of the theater district, and with numerous restaurant choices all around, this is a perfect spot to be.",4,2017,05,23
125,Formerly cool place in need of TLC,"Have stayed at this hotel a couple of years back. Unfortunately the wear & tear has been significant and the attempts to freshen it up has not been to a professional standard. Paint on sockets, signs, fixes in bathroom to cover holes etc. 

However -  location is great! So are the staff and the bar. We did not  try the restaurant.  

We had a standard room this time. Staff tried to convince us to upgrade (upsell). Room was very small, it is easy to hear what the neighbourgs do in their rooms. Not to mention that in a small room - you do hear exactly what your loved one do - in the bathroom. Not my thing...

The hotel is seriously overpriced for the quality and so is the breakfast and prices in the bar. ",3,2017,05,23
125,Keep coming back,This is my 4th time to the hotel and it is still a winner.  You cannot beat the location and the staff welcome you back like you are family.  Everything you want to go to is either a quick walk or an easy tube ride back.   Rooms have been updated and the toiletries are fantastic.  Worth the cost for a slightly larger room.,5,2017,05,22
125,Another great experience,"This is my favourite London hotel.
The location is superb, the rooms/ suites provide everything I require, the bar and restaurant are lively and the food in Asia di Cuba is excellent. The most important thing however is the staff who go out of their way to make my stay enjoyable and try to anticipate all my needs!",5,2017,05,22
125,Great location ,"Very central location in the heart of theatre land with great facilities and value for money. Great for bars and restaurants and shaftbury avenue theatres.
Also easy reach by soho and Leicester Square. ",5,2017,05,20
125,Location and room quality,"I stayed at this hotel some years ago when it was new and had few decent competitors, I was curious to see how it had stood the test of time. 

The answer is very well, the bedrooms are spacious for a central hotel and still have a sharp, fresh feel to them. 

Location is of course one of the very best in London, you are in the centre of the action.

I had an issue with the shower, a design fault that resulted in a flooded bathroom floor. The reception team forgot my request to mop whilst I was out at dinner which meant coming back to a wet bathroom and wet towels. The feedback was handled impeccably by the duty manager in the morning - bravo for service recovery.",4,2017,05,18
125,When does a trendsetter become a classic?,"I was booked at St Martin's Lane last week for a conference.  Had a few trepidations as it had been 15 years and at least one ownership change since I had stayed there, when it was the hottest hotel in London.  Shouldn't have worried as the genius of Phillippe Starck still shines brightly the moment you pass through those enormous, yellow-tinted revolving doors.  The hotel still has the power to surprise and charm, and service is probably more attentive than it was during the days of Cool Britannia.  And considering how hard this type of hotel lives, everything still looks remarkably well-maintained. Shame they can't do anything about those long, dark corridors though.  Would happily return on my next visit to the city, for another comforting shot of 90s nostalgia.",4,2017,05,17
125,Outstanding Service & Staff,"I really St Martins and the staff go out of their way to help.  In particular, I was very lucky to have the assistance of Sameena Desai and Karolina Kucxkowska who were so helpful to me.  Having staff who go out of their way to help is so important for my business needs and these members of staff were really fantastic.  The hotel is so impressive I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.",5,2017,05,15
125,Bottomless brunch brilliance,Fantastic value. ¬£35 and as many cocktails as you can drink with a lovely meal too! Our waitress Vicky was so friendly and the barman made the most delicious Bloody Mary's. We had the best afternoon. Can't recommend it enough. ,5,2017,05,14
125,"Excellent location, helpful staff","Excellent helpful staff, very responsive to all we asked, room was fine and comfortable, excellent internet, decor of hotel interesting and offbeat, good meeting rooms, food above average, location ideal for museums, we will return ",5,2017,05,12
125,Great Location,"The hotel was in a great location for easy walking to nice cafes, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square and there are tube stations really close by to access the rest of the city. The hotel room was clean but a little clinical and not what I expected from a highly rated hotel. The lighting in the room was weird/gimmicky and was pretty hard to read/apply make up under. The bed was comfortable and the amenities were high quality. If the location wasn't so great I would of given a lower rating.",4,2017,05,12
125,Some improvements since last visit,"Last visit there was no tea/coffee in the room, I am glad to say there was on my recent visit so they have heard my comments - thank you. The only comment I have to make is they need to get their 'paper confirmations' in order! You have to be careful as it does not state either 'room only' or 'including breakfast'. On previous visits breakfast was included but on my recent visit I found out that the room was 'room only' and I had to pay for breakfast on top which I was not expecting. Always check as it is not clear! It spoilt my stay with them as I have stayed regularly with them, I don't know in the future",3,2017,05,08
125,Not bad!,"Hotel is in a really central location, and very nice,  but I had a standard room that was more like a cupboard, couldn't swing a cat round......probably the smallest room I've stayed in in London, and for which I thought was very expensive, so my advice would be to pay even more money to get a larger one!",4,2017,05,07
125,A Very Nice Stay in London,"We chose to stay in Saint Martins Lane hotel as we planned to watch a show at the Noel Coward Theatre which was just 3-4 minutes walk away. Apart from its proximity to the Noel Coward Theatre, the hotel's location is very central and we found it generally very convenient to be there. 
The hotel is modern and clean and we found the staff very helpful and efficient. Our room was compact but very nice, with ample USB charging points! We stayed only one night in the hotel and did not make use of their dining facilities. But it was a very nice stay and we will certainly consider staying there again the next time we are in London.",5,2017,05,06
125,Exceptional,"2 days in London for birthday celebrations. Staff could not have been more helpful with upgrades, complimentary drinks and booking restaurants. Fantastic room on top floor,very quiet and comfortable. Loved every moment.",5,2017,05,05
125,Contemporary at its best,"Friendliest hotel staff on all levels. Concierge Mike works miracles on restaurant reservations. Cool minimalistic design. Six (!) USB outlets in our room. Great exercising at Gym Box. Very central location. We stayed here for the first time, and plan to return soon.",5,2017,05,04
125,Central London Hotel,"5 Star treatment for the whole weekend. 

Location is amazing just metres from Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Covent Garden & Soho.

The speak easy cocktail bar with superb DJ really made the visit rememberable.

Definitely look for this hotel again when we return to London.",5,2017,05,04
125,Overpriced,"I booked to be near an evening venue, as my wife is disabled. In terms of access to the venue it was perfect, but what I got for the price I paid was unsatisfactory. I have booked hotels in Europe and the USA over many years in business and this has to be the worst I have been in.",2,2017,05,03
125,Fabulous Anniversary,"I booked the hotel and restaurant as a surprise for my husband for our anniversary. We checked in and was told that they had upgraded our room for the occassion, to our surprise when entering the room they had scattered rose petals leading from the door to the bedroom and over the bed. There was also a bottle of Prosecco on ice with a lovely note welcoming and congratulating us along with a love note and chocolate hearts on the bed. Further roses scattered in the bathroom, it was wonderful.
We went downstairs to dinner and was offered a further complimentary drink and had a lovely 5 course meal. It was our 4th visit to the restaurant and it has never failed to impress. After dinner we went for an evening walk around trafalgar/picadilly to walk of the large satisfying meal before heading back.

I would like to thank the hotel staff for making our day special they were amazing.",5,2017,05,02
125,Trip to London,Hotel staff were helpful and room was clean as expected. Stay was good and as relaxing as London can be. Location is very good too for the newest end. Close to some main sites and near to tubes as well,5,2017,05,01
125,Loved it ...,"My wife booked this for my birthday weekend (plus dinner and a show).  Great location, good sized room with cool lighting, great bathroom, free wifi, good bar snacks and great staff.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,04,30
125,Superb for business and pleasure,"The St Martins Lane was a really nice positive surprise. It was an excellent 2 night stay when in town for business. Front desk and other staff helpful to the very limit of what you can wish and the rooms clean, modern, great facilities, shower excellent and an amazingly comfortable bed. For in hotel dining - just saying - Asia De Cuba in da House!!

Highly recommendable hotel",5,2017,04,29
125,Couldn't choose a better one,"Initially I was VERY confused by all the great hotel choices London offers. Couldn't decide if I wanted to stay in Knightsbridge for its calm surroundings, in Sanderson for the design, in Shard for the views...but eventually chose this one for its location since we were only comming for 2 nights. It was an excellent choice! We upgraded upon arrival to a studio and the view was just amazing! The room was bright, spotless, bed very comfy (my husband hates 95% of hotel beds but slept very well on this one - not too firm not too soft), lighting interesting. The breakfast included in our rate was tasty, shame we werent told by our waiter that there was a menu we could chose from (that includes avocado toast for example) and not only the heavy english breakfast buffet we have eaten off of. The secret bar had a great music, drinks and vibe on a saturday night, would most certainly return even if I werent staying in the hotel. We were here for our anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised by a bottle of champagne (no prosecco) waiting for us in our room. What a lovely touch! Everything is super close - theaters, restaurants (loved the Fumo few meters away), Starbucks right opposite the entrance if you need a quick caffeine fix. My husband decided to relax for an hour and I could easily use that time to quickly hop off to National Gallery (1 min walking) to see the latest Michalangelo exhibition. Couldnt have done that in Knightsbridge or  the City. It was the perfect city break in a perfect location. We will definitely stay here again! ",5,2017,04,27
125,Faultless,"From arriving at reception and being greeted warmly to leaving, couldn't fault a thing. The room was lovely with an exceptionally large bed. Very clean and towels changed daily
Great location. We will definitely be returning",5,2017,04,26
125,Perfect !,"Stayed for just the one night. Receptionists were very charming and helpful as so were all the staff we dealt with. The rooms were immaculate and very comfortable. The bind spot bar was very atmospheric and tucked away behind a secret door. 
Thankyou all for a great stay",5,2017,04,26
125,Awesomeness under a roof.....,"Absolutley loved my stay here at the weekend, and at short notice too. Everything about this hotel is fantastic, rooms, dining, locations and more importantly the team from front of house to security. Nothing  was too much effort, I stayed alongside friends who were running the marathon...what a fantastic recommendation. I arrived at 6.10am from Cornwall and thought I'd have to hang around to the official check in time, nope I was taken by security to the car park entrance which they opened for me (usually opens at 7am)...parked...then checked into my room at 6.30am....brilliant service and very customer focussed. Just want to thank Isobelle and the team for making this an absolutely brilliant first stay...will now stay here when back in London...superb superb superb...Many thanks JD",5,2017,04,25
125,Second Visit Still Fabulous,"Second stay in this wonderful hotel lived well up to expectations. Rooms are very well appointed, comfortable and relaxing. I cannot think of anything which is not provided. A very great bonus was the private smoking terrace!!! The hotel is so conveniently located and the staff are efficient , friendly and helpful. I shall stay nowhere else when I visit London.",5,2017,04,24
125,Could be a great hotel but service too patchy,"Welcome was great, lovely room. Lots of nice, small touches and well laid out if somewhat compact.

Had an awful experience in the ground floor toilet. Very dark in the cubicles so I didn't notice how wet the floor was so my trousers ended up damp with water (at least I hope it was water). If it wasn't so dark in there I might have avoided the problem. I sincerely hope it was a one-off incident and toilets are checked regularly.

Food at lunch was nice but the staff became invisible. No one to ask for a refill of our water glasses so everyone was looking a bit lost by the end of lunch. The staff in the restaurant aren't as friendly as elsewhere in the hotel and many of them were very inexperienced. Brought out sharing dishes but no serving spoons or forks until we requested some with the third course. An experienced supervisor would have spotted these two basic issues but clearly management processes were absent on this occasion.",3,2017,04,24
125,"Excellent location, attentive staff and clean facilities.","A splendid hotel in every way. From our early check-in to the extremely clean room to the very central location, we can't say enough positive things about our stay at St Martins Lane.

Leicester Square, Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square are all within a few minutes walk of the hotel as are dozens of theatres, restaurants, pubs and book shops.

We can't wait to return!",5,2017,04,23
125,Smiles & comfort on St. Martin's Lane,"From arrival to departure the staff were smiling and helpful and inviting. We don't remember everyone's names. But, we do remember that we loved walking through the Lobby to the ever friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is modern and the rooms are quiet and actually quite spacious for London. The bathroom was a real treat. Allergy-free bedding was no problem and checked before the Reception staff gave us our room early, as it was ready. Overall we enjoyed the walking proximity to museums and restaurants and so many lovely sites in the center of London.",5,2017,04,23
125,"Cool hotel, fantastic location ","Stayed for two nights. Cool setting, very friendly service, great breakfast but the best thing of all is the location. 3 mins walk from Trafalgar Square, 5 mins from Covent Garden, 15 mins from the British Museum. Worth the stay. ",4,2017,04,22
125,Awesome Stay,"Great friendly staff, attentive and very efficient. 

Decor of the hotel and rooms are modern and clean. Rooms are very well furnished, large bathroom with separate shower, full height windows and lovely comfy beds.

Great breakfast in the morning too.

Location is perfect for the West End, Chinatown, Convent Garden, Oxford St & Piccadilly areas all within walking distance.

Looking forward to returning again soon.",5,2017,04,21
125,Very hip hotel in the thick of things in London,A very modern structure with quirky design features. The hotel is in the heart of London theatre land and close to most major London attractions. There are many bars and restaurants in easy walking distance and Leicester Square tube is a couple of minutes away. Check out the cocktail bar which is somewhat hidden from view.,5,2017,04,20
125,Great visit to a stylish modern boutique hotel in London's Coven Garden,"We had a great stay at this hotel. We booked a standard room (forth floor) the room is not big but big enough for two. the hotel is really nicely decorated, modern and stylish. the rooms are fairly quiet. completely quiet from the outside. the staff was super nice and super helpful with anything we asked. i highly recommend this hotel and the location was just perfect (a block away from two underground stations.) latterly 10 minutes walk from numerous tourists attractions and five minutes walk from most theaters.",5,2017,04,20
125,Super cool hotel,"This was our second stay at St Martins Lane. The first time was as a couple, this time we had our two year old with us. Having stayed there before, I was worried the hotel was too cool for a young family, but no-one seemed to mind our two year old (she's pretty cute, but still...). The hotel is modern and well fitted out, with super comfortable beds and pillows, large bathrooms (no baths in standard rooms), Malin + Goetz toiletries, contemporary decor and lighting, a cool restaurant downstairs, and complimentary use of the gym next door. Unfortunately we didn't get to use the hotels facilities aside from the restaurant for breakfast (which was excellent by the way) during either stay, and they were fairly well hidden (on purpose), but the location, friendly concierge and doormen, yummy breakfast and comfortable beds were fantastic. I'd recommend it more for couples and young people, but it was still great for us one a part-business/part-family trip.",5,2017,04,20
125,A hidden gem,"This is a modern funky styled hotel situated in St Martins Lane right in the heart of theatreland.
Conveniently located near Leicester Square underground station virtually every theatre or popular restaurant is within walking distance.
Friendly compendent staff will help you throughout your visit.
The hotel has a modern styled restaurant with a good choice of food.
Breakfast is served here in the morning with an A la carte option.
The hotel has a quiet bar area for a night cap or two. 
There is a wide choice of restaurants and pubs right outside the hotels front door 
you will be spoilt for choice.
The hotel bedrooms have a modern feel,bright and cheery with everything you might want including a hangover kit for the morning after!
(It's not free)",5,2017,04,18
125,Excellent Hotel with a Few Caveats,"Right off the top, this place is just cool.  The lobby vibe is amazing, and our check-in was seamless.  The location is ideal, with a tube stop just a block away, and within walking distance to many attractions. We stayed in a studio room on the 5th floor, with amazing views of the Coliseum Theatre and Trafalgar Square in the distance.  The room was very well appointed, and the floor to ceiling windows provided wonderful light and sense of openness.  The bath, shower, and toiletries were top notch.  The bed was comfortable and inviting without being fussy.  The LED mood lighting was a fun addition.  Housekeeping did an incredible job as our room was spotless throughout our stay.  Nightly turn-down service was also provided, as was the occasional delivery of complementary fruit bowls and daily bottled water. 

Use of The GymBox next door is included free with your stay, which provided a much better experience and range of equipment compared to the fitness centers in most hotels.

The restaurant for breakfast was just okay, it seemed understaffed and service was a bit slow.  The Blind Spot bar however--fabulous and amazing.  Seriously the best drinks we've ever had and well worth the cost.  The vibe and music were top notch and the service incredible.  Plus the most adorable, accommodating, and dapper host/manager just topped it off!  (Seriously, visit just for him, even if you're not staying here).

Other perks during our stay included 2 articles of laundry free per-day, plus free laundry for gym clothes.  Upgraded high-speed WiFi was included for us as well, but only available 5 of the 7 nights we stayed, which was disappointing.  The standard service was adequate, but did stutter when dialing VOIP calls. 

There were a few disappointments:  One that's rather unavoidable is the street noise, even 6 levels above the street the noise is loud, you will hear it through the very thick double pane windows.  This just comes with the location (many theaters and pubs within walking distance) and we quickly adjusted, but it may be a larger turn off on lower levels.

As previously mentioned the service the restaurant was slow and understaffed.  Food arrived after a long wait and coffee/tea arrived after that.  The food was good, not great, and the buffet looked disappointing and seemed over-priced for what was on offer.

There was ONE amazing and incredibly knowledgeable concierge named Michael.  He was wonderful and extremely helpful, with a great memory and personality. Unfortunately, he is one person and not there all the time.  Other concierges, not so good.  Reverting to google for simple requests (""What's a good area for antique shopping?"", ""Is there an area with a lot of art galleries?"", ""Can you recommend a casual place for a late dinner with table service and good food?"").  Also, often the concierge on duty is working the front desk at busy times.  For the price point of this hotel, I think a dedicated concierge is expected.",5,2017,04,18
125,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Warm welcome by front desk. Room ready slightly before check in time. Was taken aback by how dimly lit the corridors were but after a while got the reasoning behind it in that when we entered the bedroom it added to the wow factor of minimalist design with lashings of white, nice idea.

We chose a garden terrace room as when I booked I was smoking but now touch wood I have ficked the addiction but for those smokers this is a better option to most hotels which have you smoking outside feeling awkward.

The room had everything needed including good quality toiletries but as some other reviewers point out the clothes storage space is a bit limited but was adequate for our 3 night stay.

Went to explore the locality and i must say thay in over 40 years visiting London this must be the best location I can remember. Covent Garden itself is very nice with good shops without the crowds of say Oxford Street.  Just round the corner and you are in Leicester Square, perfect for nightlife and lots of West End Shows.

Did not eat an Evening Meal in the hotel but it did seem popular. Finished our nights out in the Secret Bar which was excellent with fantastic service from the waitress I wish I had got her name to put on here (we stayed over Easter).

Breakfast was a bit mixed. On the first two days it was a self service buffet and some of the items were a bit lukewarm. I commented to my partner this was the only thing that let the stay down. Low and behold on our last morning the buffet had gone and replaced by an a la carte menu, perfect.

Overall this is to be our London hotel of choice provided the rate remains competitive.",5,2017,04,18
125,Best location!!!,"Even our taxi driver thinks this hotel is in the best location when visiting London.  We walked to museums, Big Ben even from Harrods department store stopping at  Buckingham Palace.  Very modern hotel and friendly staff.  Almost too modern it took us awhile to figure out how lightings and faucet worked.  Many shops and good restaurants nearby.  Only four stars for lacking personal touch.  However if we visit London again we will stay here.  It was a bit pricy but couldn't be any better location.",4,2017,04,16
125,Beautiful ,"Very excellent boutique hotel with first class customer service, rooms are very comfortable and tasty breakfast in the morning, will definitely look to stop here on our next visit to London.
Oh and the secret cocktail bar for guests was great !!! ",5,2017,04,16
125,St. Martin's Lane March trip,"Great hotel in a great location, excellent restaurants within walking distance.  Tube service close by so you can navigate around the city without needing to only use taxis.  Asia de Cuba a very good restaurant in the hotel so you can entertain and don't have to go out if pressed for time.",4,2017,04,13
125,Continues to exceed expectations,"My favorite hotel in London!
Excellent location, beautiful decor, clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff.
Convenient for the London Coliseum, Covent Garden, Royal Opera House, Trafalgar Square, National Portrait Gallery and more...",5,2017,04,13
125,Rather quirky,The hotel certainly has a quirky 'minimalist' feel to it but is very comfortable.  The 'hidden' cocktail bar is very nice with a good choice of cocktails.  We didn't partake of the breakfast as it was rather expensive but just down the street there are so many other places for food.  The hotel is in a great location.  The staff are really nice and very helpful.  Rooms are comfortable with very nice bathroom and toiletries.  Liked it and would visit again.,4,2017,04,13
125,"Five star location, service and staff","Stayed whilst up in London for a show and stayed at this wonderfully situated hotel in the heart of London's theatre land and next door to Covent Garden. We booked this through Voyage prive and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel and the deluxe room we had on the second floor. I had requested an early book in as we were meeting friends for lunch to celebrate my partners 60th. We arrived at 11.30am and our room was available thanks to Karolina in reservations. We opened the door to our room and was surprised at the size and light airy feel of the room, low coloured lighting choice over the king size bed, separate sofa and large foot rest. Bathroom had a separate shower and stand alone bath, beautifully appointed, add in the ceiling to floor windows with blinds and we did not want to leave our room! Just as we were, there was a knock at the door were we were met with processco, chocolate brownies, strawberries and raspberries and a message of happy birthday from Karolina, a wonderful gesture. We had a great nights sleep and the following morning at breakfast we had a freshly cooked breakfast of omelette for my partner and poached eggs and sausages for me. The restaurant manager Katolina engaged with us over breakfast which was really nice and we were offered a glass of champagne on the house as a farewell end to the birthday celebrations. We would definetly return to this hotel as all staff were professional and friendly without being over bearing. The hotel is modern and funky and has a great cocktail bar, there is also use of gymbox next door to the hotel if you are feeling energetic. Thankyou agin to Karolina and Katolina and all the staff we encountered.",5,2017,04,12
125,Quirky hotel but it works,"As a slightly older couple I wasn't initially sure about the ultra clean lines and modernistic deco BUT it works. We had a garden suite - where else in this part of London can you have a room with a garden?  Everything works well from the separate toilet and shower to the mood lighting, comfy bed, toiletries etc. The staff are ultra efficient but also friendly. We can't wait to return. ",5,2017,04,11
125,Very modern,"St martins lane hotel has very modern decor and I think it feels quite cold and not very inviting. The location is good, you can walk to a lot of London landmarks but it is not one of our favourites and would not go back.",3,2017,04,11
125,"location, location, location + style",We visited London for a short family vacation. This hotel was perfect for us with its central location and amenities.  We were traveling with both kids and grandparents so it was a big help that you can get to all the main tourist destinations quickly and easily. The rooms are clean and have a lot of nice details that give them personality. There are color mood light fixtures and wonderful smelling Malin & Goetz bath products. The lobby has the signature Ian Schrager playfulness with wacky chairs and giant chess pieces. There is also a hidden bar just inside the lobby with fabulous cocktails that you can really appreciate if you've been herding kids and grandparents through central London all day.,4,2017,04,11
125,"Comfort and Great Location, and Not Overpriced","In brief, the hotel location is wonderful (a two minute walk to the National Portrait Gallery, Trafalgar Square, the Tube, and theaters). Front desk is pleasant-enough and efficient. Room is very comfortable and well-appointed with USB ports by the bed for charging. Bed is great as well. I've stayed here multiple times and I never had a problem. Breakfast is a bit pricey for the buffet, but you can also order a la carte. My only comment is that the decor is getting a bit dated and may need to be updated in order to compete with other hotels of this caliber. I'll continue to keep coming back because it's comfortable and overall a good value for a hotel in the heart of the city.",4,2017,04,09
125,Great location,"Have been to London many times but have never stayed in this part of town as thought it would be too hectic. So glad we tried it and very happy with our choice of hotel. We had a couple of plays booked and it was great to just walk to the theatre rather than contend with rush hour on the tube. There are so many great restaurant choices in the area it is hard to choose. The central location meant that we were walking distance to so many sights. This let us get a real feel for London rather than having to rely on the tube all the time. The hotel room was modern, clean and with a large bathroom and a lot of light though the large windows. Bed was extremely comfortable and it was very quiet which was unexpected considering the central location. Downstairs the restaurant was terrific, especially the pre theatre dinners they provided. Access to the gym next door was easy. The secret bar off the lobby was lovely. There is nothing I could fault and very happy to return there. ",5,2017,04,06
125,Good,"It was 3 of us staying in London for 3nights. 
Enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Nothing to complain about. Good value of money, friendly staff. Great location will definitely enjoy the hotel  and it clean facilities. Thank you!
",5,2017,04,06
125,Great hotel for theatreland,"My husband and I plus family stayed here last weekend.
We have stayed at this hotel a few times over the years as it is a great base for visiting the theatre.
The hotel is efficient, the rooms are good and the hotel d√©cor lovely and quirky. 
The only point I would make is about breakfast.
Although there is a buffet, you can order whatever you want and if you look at the in room breakfast menu, it is extremely extensive.
There is no menu at breakfast so you might assume that what you see is only what is available. Just ask as the staff are very helpful and willing.",5,2017,04,06
125,I love this place!,"Another stay in London's best hotel. Emailed Belle beforehand for some special requests & a reservation. Welcomed as a long lost friend on arrival & some welcome cold beers on ice in my room, was a welcome surprise.
Luxurious, modern rooms, comfy beds & nothing too much trouble. A world class hotel.",5,2017,04,03
125,Afternoon tea in the den at St Martins Lane hotel,"My daughter booked afternoon tea at the Den as a Mother's Day treat, the place has a nice ambiance the staff are pleasant and helpful. You have a 2 hour slot and its unlimited water, tea or coffee.  Great treat but a little surprise came when we paid the bill it's 12 and half% service charge, no problem but was not aware of this at time of booking.",4,2017,04,03
125,Too modern clincial and cold,"We arrived for a one night stay at this hotel. Our room was not ready, which we accepted and were told this would be 30minutes.As we had decided not wait in the hotel we were told we would receive a telephone call to say the room was ready.3 hours later we had still not recevied a call.When we went back to the hotel  the receptionist said she had called but maybe it wasn't our number??!! and then she said the room was not yet ready could we wait 20 minutes.This time we stayed IN the hotel.
The corridor to the rooms was dark, with doors like prison cells.The room was clincial,sparce with cold decor, more fitting in an operating theatre.the room was very small for the price and the toilet was small also.The shower was good and the bed and pillow comfortable.The location was good,but we felt the hotel was very overated and over priced for what you actually get.The hotel toilets were so dark it was hard to see,even to wash your hands!.Wont be staying again.",2,2017,04,02
125,Not quite there ,"Firstly the weekend in the hotel overall was good but with a top 5 star hotel you really expect most if not everything to be perfect and it wasn't. We had a garden room which frankly was pointless the garden part was tiny and really served no purpose unless you smoked. Clearly many people were smoking in their garden rooms as in the middle of the night our air con started pumping cigarette smoke into our room. There were no tea and coffee making facilities, you could order them if required which we did but they had to be replenished a number of times as the offering was fairly sparse. It's the only 5 star I've stayed in where you have to request these facilities, should really be a given. The breakfast wasn't great, there was a limited buffet and an a la carte breakfast which was fairly similar to the buffet.  Overall a nice hotel, certainly not one of the more luxurious hotels I've stayed in, service was ok but I feel slightly style over substance. ",3,2017,04,02
125,Perfect base to see London,"We spent a week at this wonderful hotel with our daughter for spring break.  The rooms are clean, beds comfortable and staff was efficient and friendly.  Great coffee shops next door for breakfast (even a Starbucks across the street if you need it!).  Awesome restaurants all around within walking distance--try Fumo a great Italian restaurant just steps away.  St. Martins is also perfectly situated for walking to all of Londons great sights; a couple of minutes to Trafalgar Square,  10 minutes to Big Ben, 20 minutes to Buckingham Palace,  right next to theatres and a tube stop.  There could not be a better place to stay to see London!",4,2017,04,02
125,"Location great, service only 3 star","Visited last time the Sandersons, which was better. This hotel has a better location, maybe one of the best in London. But the service is lazy and impersonal. The 2-3 star hotels in London could be graduated in the same level in service ( and we all know the level of service in London is usually a bad joke). The hotel  was clean and the room was nice, in the 1st floor (my room is more comfortable). The opera and other activities are near. Several good restaurants are there.
 I never got the taxi I ordered after I checked off.. you know St Martins Lane is not the lane the taxis use..
I really wish they could make their service something.",4,2017,04,01
125,Love love love this place,"Great location, friendly staff and the deal with Gymbox makes all the difference.  The restaurant is top notch.  They have a new service where they will launder your gym clothes for free and get them back the next day. No more schlepping sweaty clothes home.  Brilliant!",5,2017,03,31
125,Great boutique hotel,Terrific personnel who take care of you.  In a great location with good bars and an eclectic restaurant. It's like home from home so we keep going back for TLC and we feel part of a family.  One of our all time favourites around the world.   Hard to beat,5,2017,03,29
125,"Ultra modern, stylish stay.","I booked St Martins Lane Hotel as part of my husbands birthday treat.  It is not our usual style of hotel, but he had wanted to stay here, to stay somewhere 'different' (for us).  It's sleek, trendy, stylish and modern, and strangely, we liked it! (we normally prefer character properties).  Check in was efficient and we were upgraded to a room with a odd 'internal' patio - no view, but a table and chairs outside - you could see the sky above, but you could only see into your room or look at two walls.  Quirky.  Wasn't offered a tea & coffee tray on check-in, which our friends were (they checked in later on), would really have liked this to have been offered as I could have murdered a cup of tea on arrival (I went out for one).  However, I did ask when I realised and a tray was in the room when we got back from our night out.  I was told that breakfast was not included in our rate, and I was made to feel a bit as if I was ""trying it on"" when I insisted it was.  When I provided proof later - once I had found the information, it was added.
The room was comfortable, ultra modern and very clean, and as mentioned before, it did have a very trendy outside area.  Although I personally probably would have preferred a view as I am quite claustrophobic, but it was a lovely room and perfect for a single night in town.  Great shower room with all the amenities you need - powerful shower and large sink, separate toilet.  The only downside was it was quite noisy during the night - we could hear music - not loudly, but could hear it.  No idea where it was coming from, indeed if it was coming from the bar, which we think was below us? It could have been coming from an adjoining room. Anyway, we were bone tired so eventually slept through it.  Bed was super comfy though!
We went to the bar in the hotel after our meal out and theatre visit (Blind Spot).  It was very very dark (we had to read the cocktail menu by a torch on our phone!) but it was sumptuously decorated and the tables and chairs were very comfortable.  Service was excellent and the cocktails delicious.  A DJ provided the music and was pretty good.  We spent 2 hours in there and loved it.  Bar bill was steep though, but it is London.
Breakfast the next day was great.  Great service and a good choice.  Glad it was included!!  
Sadly we had to leave early to get back home, but would have liked to have stayed a bit longer and lingered over breakfast and maybe had lunch later on in the afternoon.  We have eaten in Restaurant before and loved it.

Great place to stay - really good location, friendly service.  Small niggles, but overall stay was pretty good.",5,2017,03,28
125,First Class,"What a great hotel in a perfect position. We loved the contemporary style and quirky decor in the reception, bar and dining room. Our bedroom was great too, pure white walls, full height windows and spacious bathroom. The multi-coloured mood lighting  was a novelty too. Could not fault the staff, very professional and friendly.
The icing on the cake is the position of this hotel, lots of London attractions are easily accessible on foot not to mention the wide selection of quality restaurants nearby.
All in all a great experience.
A special thank you to Daniele who went that ""extra mile"" for us.",5,2017,03,27
125,One of my favorite WW hotels,The SML Hotel is always a great experience. Atmosphere and mood are contemporary cool and modern sophisticated.  Team is highly professional . The location is fantastic. I recommend the cubal asian bar restaurant. ,5,2017,03,26
125,Uplifting style and service,"I have visited London about 15 times and stayed at different hotels each time. After this visit, I have found my favourite hotel so far: St Martin's Lane Hotel. I felt I liked its modern, clean, distinct style upon entering the lobby, and that feeling was reinforced when seeing more of the hotel, including the room. Fresh, clean, stylish with interesting, fun features all around. The service was furthermore excellent, from check-in, to the cleaning, to the bar and to the breakfast. It is correct but relaxed. The wifi system is excellent: one simple login needed for a weekend stay, and it was always fast, reliable and free. I particularly liked the (standard) room: Great style (again), with nice products interior design. The location is, lastly, ideal for any visit to central London, with a five-minute walk to the Leicester Sq. tube station. I warmly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,03,26
125,St Martins Hotel,Nothing fantastic about this hotel-overpriced. Rom was clean. Some staff were nice-some weren't so. Breakfast was edible but again nothing to rave about. Location was the best thing as very near the theatres,2,2017,03,25
125,"Great location and fun, light-filled design","We really enjoyed the fun design and hip-nature of this hotel (without it's being pretentious at all).  The location is excellent... just steps away from London's theatres, and a short 2-3min walk to the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery.  
The design of the rooms is very nice, light, and airy.  We recommend getting a room with a city view on a higher floor for sure (Floor 6 is the highest).
Suggestions for improvement:  please put coffee / tea machines in the rooms. What up-scale hotel rooms don't offer this service anymore?",4,2017,03,24
125,Couldn't fault it - birthday stay,"We loved our stay here. Great location, just minutes from the tube with loads of places to eat and drink nearby. Also close to Covent Garden for some good shopping, and the theatres (not that we went). We loved our garden room with outside space, and it was spacious and well equipped. The beds were comfortable, and the 2 doors to shut out noise were great. Shower was super powerful too! Staff were friendly and attentive. Cocktails in The Blind Spot were great (as is the door handle to get in!). Beds were comfy, breakfast was good (including 'breakfast in bed' on one morning!). Hotel is contemporary but always clean and never seemed busy. We really couldnt fault anything. So much so, that we intend to return next year - and maybe even ask for the same room!",5,2017,03,23
125,Not 'too cool for school',"I stayed here for one night with my teenage daughter - a last minute booking at a very good rate. It's in a perfect position for exploring convent garden and surrounding areas by foot. The room was small but had all we needed, especially when I asked for a kettle! 
What I liked the most is that all the staff were friendly and helpful even if they all looked like they must be models in their spare time! Nothing was too much trouble. 
Would love to return if the price was right. Thanks especially to Isabelle on reception and the brilliant and very good looking door staff :) ",5,2017,03,22
125,Weekend visit ,"This is the third time we have stopped at this hotel and it didn't disappoint. 

This hotel gave us the ideal base location for the weekend - walking distance to so many places! The rooms were clean and well thought out and surprisingly quiet for a London hotel! 

The restaurant was brilliant for both food and service. 

Thank you for a lovely weekend. ",5,2017,03,22
125,When you want to feel  home in Central London,"The hotel is the perfect spot where to relax in central London where the amazing team is going to look after you more than everwhere else.The rooms are bright comfrotable and extremely quiet! 
You can sleep beautifully and if you get the chance to be on the top floor you can enjoy a breathtaking view of London all day long but sunirse and sunset are going to be definitely the best moments.
Food is excellent and service perefectly in time,also for breakfast.
Give a try as soon as you can! ",5,2017,03,21
125,Anniversary Stay Where It All Began,"For our five year anniversary we decided to stay at St. Martins Lane just as we had done when we first met each other. 

Check in was very speedy and we had a good sized room, with a brilliant bathroom which included a large free standing bath. We had a street view room which is absolutely no problem as you cannot hear any outside noise whilst the windows are closed!!

We had a couple of drinks in the discrete cocktail bar, there was good choice on the drinks menu with prices very comparative for the area of London that the hotel is situated in. However, I did feel that the service in the bar wasn't as high as I would have expected it to be. 

We did not eat at the hotel at all throughout our two night stay due to prior bookings at other venues. 

On the Saturday evening before we left for dinner, we were disappointed with not being able to use the bar for a drink due to a prior room booking. We were advised that we could go into another room where we would be served. To us, this looked simply like a meeting room and lacked any type of atmosphere etc. 

Overall, a very enjoyable stay for our anniversary!",4,2017,03,20
125,Lovely rooms and great position,"One of the nicest areas to stay in London and the hotel provides very modern accommodation in a related atmosphere.  Very trendy hangouts in the bar and restaurant with young courteous staff. The rooms are finished to a high standard making it a very comfortable stay. The hotel is in the same group as the Covent Garden Hotel which I had stayed in a few months ago. The CGH is more traditional and probably better suited to those like me (over 50), but this one is very good.",4,2017,03,18
125,Anniversary stay,"Hotel was very modern and chic . Corridors to rooms were a little dark but all adds to the contemporary style of the hotel.   Lovely bright room which had been beautifully decorated on Rose petals  and prosecco left for us. We love covent garden and Leicester Square and this is perfectly situated with only a few mins walk to each.   We've never stayed 5 star before so had no idea what to expect.  Receptionist could have been a little more helpful on check in as was given a key and wished a lovely stay. We had to ask which way to go and where then told where the lifts were. We wernt told anything about the hotel and the restaurants, gym next door or the vip bar.  There are no tea making facilities in the room which was a little disappointing after a long shopping spree and first thing in the morning.
we would stay again purely for where the hotel is situated  but I do think it would have been nice if we had some info on the hotel and what was available at check in",4,2017,03,13
125,"Top notch, Great location","If you are visiting London for the Theatre, Museum's or just generally, this is a great location, 

The Hotel itself I've walk past maybe 100 times and I didn't realise it was a hotel, step inside and you have a different story, excellent service, nice cocktail bar/breakfast room/and a quieter lounge area. 

The room was impeccable, with nice sized shower room, and well sized bedrooms, great tasteful furnishings. 

Staff very professional and helpful.   

I stayed 1 night only, I plan on returning.",5,2017,03,13
125,Just Perfect,"We arrived @ St Martins Lane yesterday lunchtime. Have stayed at the Sanderson & Mondrian in the same group before & loved them.
As soon as we arrived the valet men (& may I say super smartly dressed, knowledgeable & handsome!) parked the car for us.
The lovely Isabelle upgraded us to a superior room (gorgeous corner light filled room 524). Super comfy bed & pillows. Great shower & products.
Later on we had a bottle of prosecco delivered to the room compliments of the hotel for our wedding anniversary.
We had a drink in the bar before dinner elsewhere. Check out was 12pm, which was fabulous as we had escaped children to relax for 24 hours!!
All in all every member of staff we encountered were polite & helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay & would not hesitate to book again. Thank you all for making our anniversary perfect x",5,2017,03,13
125,The best hotel in London from our experience.,A very hip space to stay in with excellent service.  The hotel is centrally located and very close to the theater area.  We've stayed there at least 3 or 4 times in the past 10 years and will make it our first hotel choice in our future annual visits to London to catch up on the theater and art scenes.,5,2017,03,12
125,A very cool hotel,"If you're after quirky, cool and baffling,  this is the place for you. If you just want a spacious room which makes sense, it's probably not.

Small lift and corridors which were gloomy and rather sinister feeling. Room numbers at floor level, which is handy.

We stayed for one night. Paid a small amount for an upgrade to a deluxe garden room. The garden was a glass box, open to the elements (obviously) which was overlooked by several other rooms. Clearly designed to accommodate smokers as it couldn't really be of much use for anything else. Separate toilet. Sink in the corridor - also overlooked by previously mentioned rooms - and separate shower. Getting ready to go out was a marathon effort, trekking between three separate spaces!  Just have a flipping bathroom! Bedroom was small.

No wardrobe doors, just something which looked like an airline curtain used to separate the plebs from business class. 

Plant pot on the wall at a perfect height to bang my head on. No visible means to close blinds and no black out curtains. Tea making had to be requested which is very annoying. Everything very sleek and white apart from a bizarre, African -inspired stool.

Doors could be closed to separate bedroom from rest of the room. Sadly, this uncovered the control panel for the air con which had a searing green light - perfect for shining on the person on the right side of the bed.

Rooms on first floor were quite noisy with Street noise throughout the night and early hours.

Asia de Cuba bar was OK. Didn't have breakfast. 

On the plus side, room was ready at 11am when I arrived, lots of plugs, USB chargers and pretty pink lights. ",3,2017,03,11
125,Fantastic experience,"Hotel was recommended by our son and his partner and exceeded our expectations. Staff were superb, extremely helpful and attentive.
We were on the 5th floor and had good views .
The hotel is well situated for traveling around the city.
The Blindspot was very intimate and provided non-alcoholic cocktails. The mixed nuts were fantastic as well.",5,2017,03,11
125,Simply the best,"We stayed here as part of my partners birthday celebration. From the moment we booked we were looked after like royalty. We were contacted by their concierge to see if there was anything they could help us with. 
On arrival, as usual, a swift and effortless check in. Our room was on a high floor with an iconic view of London. 
A wonderful surprise treat awaited us in our room. 
Immediately down to blind spot for a wonderful cocktail. 
Breakfast as usual was wonderful and a hearty start to the day. 
I would love to commend one exceptional member of staff, but they were all fantastic. 
We chose St Martins Lane as we were only in the capital for two days and its location for the west end and theatre district is second to none. 
We are back in May and its a tough choice between here and the sister hotel The Sanderson. 
Either way, both are highly recommended. ",5,2017,03,09
125,Especially good hotel in perfect location for the West End,"This was our first stay at St Martins Lane Hotel and enjoyed it immensely. The location is so central that we only used the tube getting to and from the station on our arrival and departure. All the staff that we had interaction were genuinely friendly and helpful. 
The room was bright and light with interesting and unusual ""mood"" lighting which was fun. The aircon was easy to adjust so enabling a cool room to sleep in. The bed was large and super comfortable with crisp white cotton bedlinen and plenty of soft, sumptuous pillows. The shower wins our ""hotel shower of the year"" award - it is rare to get a hotel shower that even matches the one we have at home - this one really ticked the box! Another plus point for anyone who likes to dry their hair after showering, the hairdryer was a 'proper' hairdryer, there was a large mirror with a socket next to the mirror. Double USB sockets on each side of the bed for charging the multitude of small electronic devices that we all seem to be slaves to, along with more by the desk. 
We enjoyed a cocktail in The Blindspot before going out to eat in the evening - very friendly service, lovely cocktails and the serving of deep fried calamari that we had to ""put us on"" till dinner was to be highly recommended!
All in all, this hotel ticks all the boxes for us, we will definitely return!",5,2017,03,06
125,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"No need to trawl through looking at any other hotel reviews - just book this one and you won't be disappointed.  Amazing rooms, fabulous food, perfect location and the best staff ever!
We stayed in a Loft Room Suite with roof top views of London - going to sleep with a view of the London Eye lit up was fabulous.  Don't forget to make time for a cocktail in the Blind Spot - Little Star is a personal favourite and always delivered with first class service.",5,2017,03,05
125,Romantic getaway ,"Great location, some staff were great others not so good , breakfast was nice but we were sat down with no instruction what to do then was told the breakfast wasn't included then after checking it was so bit unorganised.felt like the staff members at the Asian de Cuba desk looked down on you and not interested, rooms weren't very  nice , bit cold and ikea like ( expensive furniture I know but just not very inviting) no tea or coffee in rooms either , we had the garden room and although it's in a great location I doubt I'll be staying again.",3,2017,03,05
125,Nice family getaway,"Very nice to be able to stay the whole family in one room (superior double double). Lovely amenities from Malin & Goetz, nice breakfast (the possibility to order breakfast from the a la carte menu was wonderful, and a nice way to start each day) and clean, modern rooms. Loved the location in the Covent Garden!",5,2017,03,04
125,Ok I have a new favorite hotel in London. You have to try this.,"As anyone who has seen my reviews knows I travel a lot and pass through London fairly regularly. On this occasion I had a one night stay to meet some old work colleagues and wanted to be near the meeting place in trafalger square, and ever since this hotel opened I wanted an excuse to stay and here was the perfect opportunity. What a place, from being greeted on the curb side to the immediate modern tranquility of reception, the superbly efficient front desk staff to the room it was a pleasure to check in. Then the room, compared with many central city hotels it was spacious, beautifully designed with a huge bed, dressing area, then the bathroom. The amenities were abundant even allowing you to purchase a Gillette razor from the shelf if you had forgotten yours. I am often disappointed with water pressure and showers in hotels, not St Martin's the huge soak tub (complete with bubble bath provided) filled in a minute. I can not enthuse about this hotel much more except to say the bed was heavenly, large and meant the best nights sleep in over a week of travels. I will be back without hesitation.",5,2017,03,04
125,Constantly excellent,"Stayed here a year ago, and could not resist when I was offered a very decent price at this hotel.
The superior room (602) with a bathtub was almost identical to the one I had last year. But on 6th floor and a very nice view. Could see Lord Nelson on his column! 
A very decent sized room, but only one chair. I did not need two, but what if two are staying in this double room?
The granola at breakfast just as delicious as last!
Always very nice people in the reception, and the best service!
Thank you again, all of you. If the price is not too bad, I will love to come back!",5,2017,03,02
125,Brilliant location and luxury facilities,I stayed here with my husband on 25 February and the hotel was perfect! The staff were so friendly and our room was immaculate. The bed was extremely comfortable with lovely pillows. The bathroom was lovely with a great shower and luxury toiletries. There was a large mirror that was ideal for applying makeup and plenty of lighting. The Blind Spot downstairs was brilliant with delicious cocktails in a speakeasy style bar. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was quite expensive but the restaurant looked lovely from the outside. I'd definitely return to this hotel. ,5,2017,03,02
125,Great Stay,"I stayed at this hotel and enjoyed my stay. The lobby was nice and clean. The service at the front desk was good. The rooms were modern, nice and clean. The only issue I had was that the room was a bit small. Other than that I enjoyed my stay.",4,2017,03,01
125,Great option for London,"Very good and modern (Philippe Stark) hotel in central London. Location is great and allows you to walk to most places (and if not there is always a tube or a bus nearby). It has become my preferred choice for London recently. Accommodation in the capital can be random and prices very high so this is somehow a compromise. It is not cheap but at least you will not be disappointed. 

The rooms are good (although the small ones can be very small!), beds and pillows very comfortable and the big windows always a pleasure in a city where the weather tends to be grey. There is no noise even if you are in the middle of the city. Wifi works nicely and the food is good. Staff are generally friendly and helpful.",4,2017,03,01
125,"Not bad, not terrific.","Because we planned two opera visits in two days at the Royal Opera House, we looked for a hotel really close to the Opera, so we ended up in the St. Martins Lane Hotel.
The location is really great and we liked the lobby, and we loved the beds, but the room (the ambiance) itself felt 'cold' and we didn't really like the view (garden patio). Somehow this view gave us a ""locked in"" feeling. 
When we booked the hotel I asked specifically if there was a coffee machine in the room, and they said yes. Not knowing that the English call a ""kettle"" a coffee machine ;)
In almost every hotel we stay, there are nespresso machines in the room, but in London they still use a kettle!
Anyway, the overall feeling was okay, not bad and not terrific.",3,2017,02,27
125,Excellent - look out for the deals,"Stylish hotel, lovely rooms, excellent staff, fantastic breakfast. I can't praise it highly enough. Excellent central location too. On top of all this look at for the celebs who stay here in the plusher suites (¬£10K plus per night!). 
The room rates vary quite a bit dependent upon occupancy so if you want a London break and can be flexible on your dates there are some excellent deals to be had. We paid ¬£175 per room B&B which was less than half what it had been the week before. 
One other tip - take the postcode and the fact it's 45 St Martins Lane. There isn't much if any exterior signage and the cabby had never been there before and couldn't find it.",5,2017,02,27
125,Theatre Weekend,"We frequently stay in London for theatre and 'history' weekends and over the years have stayed in many of the well known, traditionally styled hotels. On this occasion we decided to break with tradition and stay in the ultra modern St Martins Lane Hotel, a decision we did not regret. The hotel is light and modern, with a friendly informal atmosphere. The staff are extremely helpful and attentive to customers' needs. The Cuban themed restaurant is equally good - varied menu, excellent food and service. Score 10/10 - we will definitely be staying at this hotel again and soon.

",5,2017,02,27
125,All very good once again,"I have used this hotel several times in the past, so when another trip to London beckoned, I booked two rooms for myself and a friend who were meeting up with friends.  We returned late to the hotel, and used the bar for a nightcap, which was suitably lively!  The rooms were everything we wanted, clean, orderly and well stocked, with a lovely ensuite shower and comfortable bed and pillows.  Breakfast in the restaurant in the morning was just what was needed, before heading out for another day's sightseeing.",5,2017,02,25
125,The Den Lounge Bar at St Martins,"We decided to have some bubbly to round off our lovely full day.  St Martins Lane Hotel is so comfortable, modern and nicely laid out as been before to their other bar which was fully booked for Valentines celebration.  The Den was very relaxed, comfy, ideal for any occasion and great location. The Den's artwork is of great interest too and would definitely visit again.",5,2017,02,24
125,Modern and lovely,"After a decidedly average night out at Clos Maggiore, staying at St Martins for Valentine's felt wonderfully luxurious and romantic. I booked a room with a garden patio, it made a difference having that little bit of extra space. 

I've stayed at the Sanderson before, therefore knew the beds would be amazingly comfortable, and oh boy they were !!. So glad I got a late checkout, well worth the extra snuggle time !. Staff were pleasant and engaging at all times, and if you manage to find The Blind Spot, it's worth spending some time in there !. It can get noisy because of the bar(s) downstairs, that's the only downside. We stayed on the first floor and didn't really get any noise pollution in our room.

It's a stone throw from Leicester Square station, about 2-3 min walk. A perfect location for experiencing the buzzing atmosphere of that part of town.

Just a fabulously comfortable hotel, what more can you ask for when you are treating that special lady in your life !.",5,2017,02,23
125,Wonderful location ,"Stayed for 2 nights, fabulous position between Leicester Square and Covent Garden.
Very smart , modern hotel with a fabulously comfortable bed.
Room very quiet too , didn't hear any noise at all!
Breakfast delicious with wonderful service too!
Already looking at revisiting again in April.
Highly recommended.",5,2017,02,21
125,Absolutely lovely ,"Spent 2 nights here and absolutely loved it. We had a garden room which was simply perfect. Great size bedroom with equally a lovely big bathroom. This is my favourite place to stay in London. Fabulous location, great friendly staff. One definitely not to be missed . ",5,2017,02,19
125,"""Top class hotel in great location""",This was our second visit to this hotel and we were not disappointed. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was in the corner of the hotel so was very quite and spacious. The hotel is in a great location and the hidden cocktail bar is very special. We really enjoyed our stay and will be returning as certainly our favourite hotel in London.,5,2017,02,19
125,Luxury theatre hotel,"Luxury hotel but look out for offers as makes this affordable. Staff were excellent and room was great with nice bed, fantastic walk in shower and dressing area making it feel really special. The lighting and furniture in room were definitely touch above!",5,2017,02,19
125,"Good boutique hotel, well located but small rooms","I've stayed on 3 occasions at the St. Martins lane hotel in the past couple of years. It has a modern feel to it and very well located. The food is good at Asia de Cuba, and I love the music they play there during breakfast - makes the start to the day feel energetic. Only drawback is the rooms feel a bit too compact. Overall a good one.",4,2017,02,18
125,"Very Interesting Hotel - Hip, Modern, Fun yet not too stuffy. Love it!","We had an unexpected night at the St Martin's Lane London Hotel after we realized we messed up our travel plans to Ireland, and needed one extra night in London. We booked 15 minutes before we checked in and the hotel was great! Check-in was a breeze, and the room was ready VERY early (10AM).

The room was very interesting - like 1970's hipster meets modern art. It's hard to describe, but we really enjoyed it. The hidden bar was great too. Have fun trying to find it in the lobby! 

The service was decent, though we only really interacted with the staff at check-in, but they were friendly, welcoming and answered some of our questions. The Hotel is in a great location, beside the National Portrait Gallery and a few theaters. It's also very close to one of our favorite restaurants, Dishoom. 

The bed was comfy, the bathroom was a decent size, the showerhead was good, and the bed had USB ports right next to the headboard, which was welcome as well. For the price paid, we definitely enjoyed our stay! It was certainly a unique hotel. I'm on the fence as to whether we would return; the rooms were a bit on the small side, and almost claustrophobicly so We almost struggled to find room for our 3 bags.. But I would certainly consider it because everything else was great!",5,2017,02,18
125,Hidden Gem,"My stay at St. Martins Lane Hotel was excellent from beginning to end.  Coming on the heels of a demanding business trip to London, I extended my stay to enjoy the city and the St. Martins Lane Hotel was the best decision: perfect location, luxurious but fun vibe (very SoHo/Tribeca NYC), access to an awesome gym and excellent service.  In fact, the hotel concierge (Biken) went above and beyond by recommending a nearby tapas restaurant for dinner, personally guiding me there and even offering suggestions on the menu.  Wow!  That's just incredible attention to detail and a level of service on par with the best hotels.  I will definitely stay at St. Martins Lane Hotel again and I plan to tell all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay there!",5,2017,02,18
125,That rare hotel: creative modern decor but really comfortable!,"I love the modern decor at this hotel: it is innovative and fashionably cutting-edge with more than the odd hint of whimsy, yet comfortable and practical. How unusual to find any hotel that meets and exceeds my wife's reasonable expectation for a good combination of mirrors and lighting for hair and make-up, let alone one that offers such a post-Starck feast for the eyes. ",5,2017,02,16
125,Birthday treat!,"Having to delay my romantic birthday night in London due to unforeseen circumstances, resulted in said romantic night being spent with my eldest daughter instead! I HAVE to say, when you're greeted with such physical beauty on the door and at reception, you want to hate them and assume a vacuous space behind such aesthetics, however, the reality was something else, completely delightful, helpful, professional, welcoming and frankly all round excellence. That's the bonus of this hotel, the beauty isn't skin deep it goes right through every aspect of the experience. A stunning afternoon tea, a gorgeous garden room, a delicious evening meal plus cocktails and a little birthday cake on the house delivered to our room. Thank you extremely beautiful people for the equally beautiful stay!",5,2017,02,13
125,Great central location ,"If your looking for a great central hotel this is perfect. In the heart of Covent Garden and Leicester Square you are near to all the best places in London. 
The Asia d Cuba restaurant has excellent food with a nice vibe.
The rooms are very nice, modern, simple and I like that you can change the lighting colour to suit your mood! Wifi is very good and easy to join. 
I think the bar maybe lacks a bit of atmosphere but I prefer something with a view than just a room! 
But over all I would highly recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,02,13
125,Expensive but this is London!,"This was expensive - but the hotel had a good size room and the staff were brilliant.
The layout of the rooms are a little quirky and it took some time to workout which light switch worked what. But I guess that was part of the fun. The bed was seriously comfortable. We did miss  coffee/tea making facilities and had to purchase these via room service - which felt a little harsh when we had paid so much for the room itself. Rooms were spacious and modern.
Having said this the staff were excellent and as it was my wife's birthday they made it extra special -Thank you Rene(?).
if you are looking for a seriously well placed London hotel - look no further - right in the middle of theatre land and Covent Garden is moments away and 2 minutes form Leicester Square tube station.

125,Fantastic location near Covent Garden and Soho,"Hotel in a great location, next to Travalgar Square, Covent Garden, Soho etc.  Very trendy and upbeat but lobby very noisy.  The snug is very nice but difficult to get place over the weekend.  There was a great choice at breakfast and service was quick.  The bedroom was very clean and modern, if only a tad small.  There is a chair in the room but not enough space to use it comfortably.  The door to the bathroom is badly placed and bangs when you close it at night.  The bed is comfortable but should have ordered a kingsize room as double is really just a double!  Although the lobby is noisy the rooms are very quiet.  It advertises itself as a boutique hotel, but the long lowly lit corridors do not give this impression.  ",4,2017,02,12
125,Funky and so well placed,"A boutique hotel in the heart of the west end of London will never be an inexpensive choice, and so they have to be absolutely perfect in every way. St Martin's Lane could not be better positioned - 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Leicester Square, surrounded by theatres and restaurants, you can walk everywhere and avoid the crowded tube. 
We were greeted by Belle who was friendly, welcoming and helpful in checking us in, a standard met by all the other staff we encountered during our stay. 
The room was exceptionally 'funky', the standard by which we rate boutique hotels. Spacious, light and well-equipped, the decor and lighting help the room slip effortlessly between vibrant and intimate - essential when you've been married for 25 years!
Breakfast was extensive, fresh and very high quality. 
So all the major boxes are ticked - location, staff, room and food. As for price? Book well ahead and look for the deals. It's not 'cheap' but it's by no means outrageous considering all of the above. Heartily recommended ",5,2017,02,12
125,Afternoon tea,"Thank you to Inessa at the Den for making my mum's birthday so special and memorable. I would recommend afternoon tea there - a lovely selection of food, in particular perfect scones. The surroundings are lovely - comfortable and smart without being too grand - and the staff are exceptional. ",5,2017,02,11
125,Lovely hotel in a great location!,"We love this hotel, and it's the second time we have been back!
The rooms are modern but the best thing is the location, as you can walk to all the best bits of London. 
The reception staff are really friendly and gave us some vouchers for free cocktails because it was my birthday. 
The room was a tad on the small size but still lovely. Great secret cocktail bar and lovely breakfast with lots of choice.
I'm sure we will be back again in the future!",4,2017,02,11
125,Hidden Gem,"Everytime I come into London from Morocco, I make it my business to pop into at least one of the Morgans hotels for a drink. On this occasion it was the Blind Spot (first visit since it changed from Light bar) at st Martins lane, I was greeted by a very smiley hostess who took me to my table and presented me with the  arty ornate menu. Within a couple of minutes the lovely Beta came to take my order and even gave a very good recommendation for wine. I also saw my favourite security guy Martin and had a nice chat,and the Dj was playing pretty cool music too. All in all out of all the Morgans hotels i've had a drink in from Miami to London, I think Blind Spot is my new favourite .",5,2017,02,10
125,Amazing night away,"I felt compelled to write a review about my exceptional stay at the St Martins Lane Hotel. From the minute we checked in everything was first class. Nothing was ever too much to ask. The service we received from Sameena and Izabel at reception was very professional, and they made every effort to make our stay special. 
A special mention must be made for Mike the hotel Concierge, who answered all our questions with patience and humour and his knowledge of the London restaurant scene is second to none. We will definitely be returning.",5,2017,02,06
125,Fabulous Boutique Hotel!,"5th floor room with great view. Small but very well designed. Modern chic decor with gorgeous shower room, great use of space. Hairdryer, iron and board all provided - would just have benefited from coffee making facilities. Couldn't be better placed in terms of location - even use of the gym next door. Oh - and do ask about the well hidden bar - The Blind Spot - fabulous for cocktails :-)",5,2017,02,06
125,An interesting hotel behind an unpreposessing exterior,"The hotel, which I seem to recall was an office building in a previous life, will not win any awards for architectural excellence so far as the outside is concerned; however, this somewhat ordinary exterior hides an interesting hotel that is well worth a visit.  Inside it has a vibrant and far from ordinary look.  We used two of its bars: The Den and 'Blind Spot'  Both excellent and very different from each other.  The room was cleverly designed and well furnished.  We chose a room on the ground floor with a courtyard garden - in itself a novel feature for a central London hotel - as one of us was a smoker.  We did not make that much use of this space as it was a cold and wet February weekend but in the Summer this would be a very useful and enjoyable feature of the room. ",4,2017,02,06
125,Great atmosphere ,We where invited to the hotels bar through the door with the golden hand ! Great service and choice of drinks cocktails all staff had a good knowledge of the menu very comfortable chilled vibe with dimmed lighting all adding to the intrigue will definitely return  ,5,2017,02,05
125,Averagw,"This was the cheapest 5* available on the date of our stay so for the price we paid was good value. However if we had paid full price would of been very disappointed compared to other 5* in the Westminster/theatre land area.
On arrival first impressions are good. The check in desk was friendly and quick. I had hoped to email ahead to request a couple of things as we were celebrating a birthday but couldn't find an email address online. I mentioned this at check in as I also wanted to book a table for drinks in the blind spot and we were given complimentary drink vouchers. Nice touch. The lobby smells incredible when you first walk in; funnily I didn't smell it again at any other point of our short stay but noticed you can purchase the signature scented candle in the room.
We made our way up to the 5th floor where the scent of the luxurious lobby below quickly leaves you. The corridors are low lit and have a faint stale smell, not dissimilar to cheap budget hotels. When we reached our room down the hall we were pleased to open the door to a bright and clean room. 
We stayed in a standard room so didn't expect loads of space but love the cleverly designed layout and hidden doors that divide the immediate entrance of the room and closet space from the bedroom itself. The bathroom is a really good spacious size and it didn't leave the two of us fighting over getting ready for a night out. Lots of power points for gadgets which I have found to be lacking in other 5* hotels.
One small niggle with the shower, you can't move the head and the angle it's fitted wasn't working well for me.  Stepping out the shower I realised we only had two towels between us. I have very long hair which the hand towel was far too inferior to deal with and using both of the large ones would mean my poor man using a damp leftover after his shower. I thought I'd use a dressing gown instead but to my surprise no dressing gowns or slippers provided? Maybe I've been spoilt but this is the first 5* hotel I've stayed in where I had to call housekeeping to request them. 
Once we were ready for our night out we went down to blind spot to have some pre drinks. The bar is very ambient, nicely furnished and the cocktails we tried were delicious.
On return to our room we settled down to sleep under a nice warm and puffy duvet. Annoyingly the other half fell asleep holding a bottle of water and subsequently spilled it everywhere so we had to call housekeeping for a new duvet which they delivered to us nice and quickly.
Little tip - Be careful of the mattress sliding around on its base!! 
Morning time I felt refreshed after sleeping like a baby. And we've a decent check out time of 12 we didn't feel rushed to pack up and go. We strolled down to the restaurant for breakfast which was delicious and good value too as it wasn't included in our room rate. Served by a really pleasant guy who also gave us some freebie croissants.
Check out was easy and as we sat and waited for a taxi to the train station we got to observe a bit more of the lobby, it was looking a bit tired and dated and in need of some TLC.
I wouldn't not stay here again if it was at the same price we had booked it for but at full rate on their website I can think of much better places to stay nearby.
",3,2017,02,05
125,"Swish, but relaxing","We've just had a lovely stay at St Martins. A friendly welcome followed by a lovely room on the 5th floor. Great location very near to Leicester Square Tube station. Beautiful breakfast. Highly recommended if you can afford the price-tag. 

We stayed a year ago when it was undergoing refurbishment. It looks all the better for it.",5,2017,02,05
125,My stay at SML,"Had the best stay here, the location is perfect as we went to the Royal Opera House just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The best thing about our stay was the amazing concierge Mike. He has such a lovely way with people and sorted our dinner and opera tickets. Very generous with his time and he is a seriously funny guy. 
The front desk reception staff are all excellent, special mention to Sameena and Izabel who made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. 
I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and I am already planning my next trip. ",5,2017,02,04
125,"Great location, small rooms.","Loved the location, a few minutes away from Trafalgar Square and Covent Gardens. Very convenient! We walked pretty much everywhere from the hotel. We didn't notice any signs outside the hotel, so when we arrived in our Uber ride, we were doubtful of whether we were in right place. 

Staff were warm & welcoming. Lovely lobby, interesting looking restaurant and a pretty stylish hidden speakeasy-ish kind of bar. Which we didn't know existed till our last night. Great ambiance and we would have gone more frequently had we discovered it earlier. 

Rooms were a little small though, the bathroom door was impossible to close without making a huge bang, waking up your room mate should you need to use the toilet in the middle of the night. ",4,2017,02,03
125,Lovely stay after a check in hiccup. ,"We stayed here for 4 nights for our 20th wedding anniversary. We arrived early so went for food in The Den which was nice, I had a lovely glass of champagne which was wonderful. We wanted to get into the room at 3 (check in time) as we were out in the evening so wanted a nap. We booked a studio room, I had requested when I initially booked that I wanted the room to be on the highest possible floor. When we tried to check in at 3 we were told our room still hadn't been cleaned so we could either take a room on the 2nd floor or wait 20 minutes for the 4th floor room, we decided to wait. 50 minutes later and our room still wasn't ready! By this stage we both felt disappointed so asked to speak to the manager. She handled the situation very well and assured us it would be ready within 5 minutes which it was, she then offered us a complimentary bottle of champagne, lovely!
Our studio room didn't disappoint (I recommend spending the extra) very spacious and light with a fantastic bathroom and really comfy bed, along with a sofa to chill out on. 
We used room service on two occasions, which was quick and the food was great.
We went into the blind spot which we thought was brilliant, lovely cocktails, great atmosphere and a cracking DJ.
The hotel was in fab location, so central to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square. The staff, service and overall feel off the hotel made our visit very special.
We will definitely be back.
I wish I could give a 5 star but couldn't because of the late check in. 
",4,2017,02,03
125,Superb Position ,"If you need a central London hotel you cannot go wrong here, most of what you need is in walking distance. This hotel was cutting edge in hotel design when it opened quite a few years ago and really set the trend. Of course newer properties have opened but this place still ticks all the boxes, though some might consider the look a little dated. Quiet, very comfortable beds, good shower and obliging staff. Good breakfast though usual rather sad luke warm hot breakfast buffet items, a common problem with hotel buffets, no facilities for making toast and none offered, minor niggles, but means only gets very good from me. Definitely a hotel I would return to.",4,2017,02,03
125,"Great hotel, grest staff, great location","Excellent stay, from start to finish.  Staff were friendly, efficient and proficient.  Room was as described, very clean and comfortable.  Good wi-fi.  Excellent location, just minutes from Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, and Covent Garden.  Did not use room service or in-house restaurants as there are too many good options nearby.",5,2017,01,30
125,Very close to a 4! ,"The hotel it's self is really nice, well designed and has a great location and great staff. The only down sides are they only give one small bottle of water, everything else has a ridiculous charge. Very noisy during the night, you can hear when other people use the toilet etc ... for the price of this 5* hotel. I don't think it's good value for money. ",3,2017,01,30
125,Too hip for me,"The room looked great, but it was too small and too fashionable/impractical.  Let me count the problems.  First, there's no place to put luggage.  You either have to clog a walkway or use the desk.  Second, not enough strategicallly located plugs.  Third, you can close off the bathroom with a massive door, but you can't close the door without the magnetic closure making a loud CLICK.  So much for not waking your partner.  No tea service in the room.  When we kept asking for hot water, someone finally brought us an electric tea kettle. Who knew to ask?  And the gym is next door so you have to go outside to get there.  We had lots of problems with the facility.  Service was okay, however, and the location is great.  Lighting is mostly good.  Bathroom was adequate, but our room had no tub.  Wi-fi worked, but was not overly fast.",3,2017,01,29
125,Love this hotel,"Whenever we go to London we stay at this hotel. It's location is second to none. Located in the Covent Garden/West End, everything is in walking distance whether its to a pub, restaurant, theatre show, Trafalgar Square, great shopping, or the tube. Lovely fresh, uncluttered modern rooms with comfortable beds. On the ground floor at the back of the lobby is a secret bar with a dark, luxurious feel serving great cocktails.
The foyer is ultra modern, and as we were early for check-in we were able to leave our
bags whilst we went shopping. Lovely selection at breakfast. All in all a really lovely place to stay with friendly service.",5,2017,01,27
125,Great Hotel and service ,"Stayed at St. Martin's Lane for 6 nights and don't regret paying the premium price.

The location is prime, the rooms are spacious for London hotels and the service was wonderful.

Very recommended. I would stay there again.",5,2017,01,27
125,Favorite hotel in London,"I love this hotel.  I find the service to be the best of any hotel I have ever stayed with.  The rooms are nice sized (I stayed in the Deluxe), modern and the location is incredible as a tourist.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a modern hotel with great customer service in the heart of London.

The only downside I've experienced is that I consistently have trouble with booking reservations.  This is my third time staying at hotel.  I find it difficult to make sure you are getting the best rate.  Often their website advertises a deal, but on click through says it's no longer available.  Also, they sometimes have multiple offers but not clear which one is best.  If you call to discuss I find that they do not offer you the best rate, you are better of shopping around online yourself (Had the person on the phone twice tell me what the best rate was only to find a better rate on the hotel's actual website).  They also don't seem to care about loyalty.  So my advice is stay here if you can shop around and find a great rate- but make sure you shop around.",4,2017,01,26
125,IMPRESSIVE,"We stayed here on the 7th January 2017 for the occasion of my daughters 21st Birthday...We had an excellent time due to the competence of the staff, They really understand the importance of customer needs and customer satisfaction...The hotel is clean, contemporary and minimalistic, There is a wonderful bar area to the rear of the hotel called The Blind Spot,,,, it is dark ...romantic and has a luxurious feel to it, the bar gets very busy at the weekends and during the week probably,,,,so we reserved a table  which i believe is quite normal,   Very nice indeed.. The room we stayed in was on the 3rd floor, Nice view and everything was there .... toiletries ...iron...hairdryer,,an alarm clock and a really well stocked mini bar...You are one minute walk away from Trafalgar Square and you are in the heart of London and extremely close to many popular Theatres and beautiful restaurants. This hotel is a must to visit and an experience within itself. To finish our stay here we had a wonderful breakfast,,plenty to choose from.....Once again Brilliant staff... a pleasing experience to say the least....Children welcome and wheelchair access is good. Well done ST MARTINS STAFF  A WELL EARNED FIVE STAR  FROM US.",5,2017,01,26
125,"Great location, very cool hotel and outstanding gym","Located in the heart of the west end two minutes from Leicester Square tube.  Couldn't get any more central!

Hotel is very modern, chic and cool.  Decor in the rooms is minimal with a very modern feel.  Rooms are comfy, quirky and have everything you need including usb charging points!

Communal areas bars and restaurants are very nice servicing pan Asian food and quality drinks.  I had room service and whilst the food was good was a little on the prices side for a room service option.

They have gym box next door which guests can use whilst they stay and has to be the best gym I have used.  Abundance of cardio, weight training, boxing and class facilities.

Definitely recommended and worth looking out for deals on this hotel and indeed others in the Morgan hotel chain. ",4,2017,01,25
125,Wonderful hotel and staff,"A big thank you to all the staff at St Martins Lane. From the guys at the door, to the awesome reception staff, the lovely ladies at Blind, and of course housekeeping and room service. We have travelled to London as a quick getaway after a sad event at home. You guys didn't know that, but it was almost like you did! We felt looked after ((which we were - and needed), and can't thank you all enough. When next in London we'll certainly be staying with you again. In the words of one your staff, "" we have to be kind to each other"". Thankyou again.",5,2017,01,24
125,Home away from home but way more posh!,"I have been staying at SML for all trips to London for several years and would never go anywhere else.  Yes, it is pricey, but the location is completely unbeatable and the rooms are really nice, well-maintained, and well-decorated.  I always get breakfast included in my rate and the breakfast at Asia de Cuba restaurant (in the hotel) is fantastic.

What really makes this hotel stand out, however, is the amazing personal service provided by every single staff member, from housekeeping and the doormen to the reception staff and concierges, as well as the restaurant staff.  They go way far out of their way to welcome me as a returning visitor, and even send me little treats up to my room.  They remember things that I mention to them and ask about them the next time they see me.  When I leave, I am always loaded down with luggage, and a doorman always walks me all the way to the Tube, down the stairs, and right to the turnstiles.  The concierges and doormen in particular have incredible personalities and are warm, genuine, and so eager to be helpful.  I consider this hotel to be like my second home (way fancier than my actual home and I don't have to do any cleaning!), and have exceptionally warm feelings toward the staff.  

On my last trip (January 2017), I unfortunately came down with food poisoning (NOT from anything I'd eaten at the hotel!!)  The staff were unbelievable in their helpfulness, returning to my room to check on my multiple times, helping me connect with healthcare, and then for the next week, everyone asked how I was feeling every time I saw them.  I could hardly have been more in love with the staff at this hotel than I had been before, but I was really, really touched by their care and concern.",5,2017,01,23
125,Theatre weekend ,Made all the better by staying here. Very central. Near everything you'd want. Room spacious and quiet for the middle of London. Great minimal decor and has aged well. Hidden bar was fun. Lovely non alcoholic cocktails. Gym next door has everything bar a pool. Would return.,5,2017,01,22
125,Great location,"Stayed for a work event in London, great hotel in a great location. Rooms are bright and comfortable even if the lights are a little confusing to work!! Friendly reception staff who couldn't do more to assist with your stay. Will certainly return when we are back in London. ",5,2017,01,20
125,Great location and superb room,"Love the clean modern chic bedroom and bathroom. Shame no kettle in room ... learnt afterwards could have called reception for one, didn't see any note on desk about this. Although very nice it does not  justify the high price. Staff efficient and friendly.",5,2017,01,20
125,wow! wow! wow!,"the very first time i past this hotel it was getting renovated (not that i stay in this hotel before). so with that we decided that when we next visited London we would stay here.  And we are so glad we did as this hotel is stunning! the rooms are stunning and the ambiance of the whole place is very, very welcoming. 
the only thing i would mark it low on, is the breakfast.  I would expect 5 start treatment of someone taking my order and bringing my breakfast to the table but they don't, you have to help yourself from the buffet.  Still the breakfast was as expected very nice.
I would highly recommend this hotel and yes we will be staying there again.",5,2017,01,20
125,A stylish hotel at the heart of London,"I stayed at this hotel for a business event, and I would love to return for a leisure visit.  It's stylish and characterful, with good food and brilliant staff.  Rooms are modern, comfortable and quiet.  

My only grumble was having to call housekeeping for a kettle so that I could make a cup of tea.  I don't understand why it isn't provided in every room.  They were very quick, but if I need tea, I need it straight away!

I must admit, I don't know how much the hotel cost because I wasn't paying.  I know that my company shopped around to get a good deal.  As this hotel was considered to be the best available, the value for money must have been good.",5,2017,01,16
125,"Fantastic Location, Great Hotel","Stayed here at the weekend and had a De Luxe Garden Room (we've also stayed at the sister hotel, The Sanderson in the past). We love the location and also the coolness of the St Martins Lane, its smart but in a relaxed kind of way. Service is excellent and when we had a request it was attended to quickly. The room was excellent with an outdoor area with table and chairs, bed was king size and very comfortable and the room was very spacious. We had a couple of cocktails in the bar in the early hours of Saturday morning and one round of these was complimentary, a nice touch. Bar had a great ambience, DJ played very good music and we enjoyed ending the evening there. Breakfast was good with a buffet option but also an a la carte option, we chose from the a la carte and again this was very good. We loved staying here and will definitely return. Service, location, room, food, staff all really hit the mark for us and we had a seriously great weekend in London centered around our stay at this hotel. We will return.",5,2017,01,16
125,Amazing hotel.,"We stayed at the hotel on a Saturday evening after a trip to the theatre. Location is amazing. In the heart of covent garden. I love the hotel! So modern and quirky. Staff were amazing so helpful and friendly and even beought up a bottle of prossecco to congratulate us on becoming recently engaged. Our room was incredible with views onto the bustling street, colour changing bed was quirky and fun ! Couldn't recommended it anymore to anyone thinking about staying in London. ",5,2017,01,15
125,Excellent from start to finish (except a tiny niggle),"We stayed one night to celebrate my partners birthday. I emailed to arrange in room massage and had wonderful, helpful exchanges with staff who didn't take more than 24hours to get back to me each time. Our stay itself was fantastic, including the birthday treat sent to our room! 

One dent was that the in-room temperature control resets itself to 20degs at various intervals. Given that the room was far from hot or warm when this happened, we had to keep monitoring it and turn it up. Other than that, the room was beautiful, staff were fantastic and we would easily go back again and again.

Thank you all for a great experence.",4,2017,01,15
125,A lovely place to stay in Central London,"A brilliant find. Subtle & anonymouse but bang on the mark in terms of quality. The cuban influence for the cuisine was not our taste but loom very good. Staff were professional, polite & nice people. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,01,14
125,Love this place.,"I have stayed at many hotels in london as i have to visit for work. 
This was my first stay at the St Martins Lane and I will definetly be going back. 
Loved my room, and the bed, and the sheets are great...the location is amazing and there is a really good gym that is available. What made it extra special however was the professional and friendly service. Everyone that works there  seemed genuinely happy and happy to make ones stay as comfortable as possible, Even the bell men were great. Honestly I look forward to my next visit. This is a great hotel with real authentic 5 star service.",5,2017,01,13
125,This hotel has it all.,"My daughter and I booked this hotel early Fall for a 5 day visit to London.  We were so happy with our choice.  The hotel itself was modern and had a fresh, modern feel.  The central location allowed us to walk to the theatre, the many fine neighbourhood restaurants, galleries and other attractions.  It is also in walking distance to the luxury shopping on Bond and Conduit.  There is also a ""tube"" station around the corner.
However the staff is possibly its biggest asset.  All were so very professional and helpful from the gentlemen on the door to the bar staff.  Our ""go to"" concierge Mike F was a wealth of information and made our short stay so much more interesting. What an asset to the hotel!
We began each day at the dining room for breakfast.  Loved the buffet choices!  We tried something new each day from the menu and was never disappointed.  All staff were welcoming and helpful.  Our many thanks to Agnes who made sure that every breakfast was a pleasant experience.
I would highly recommend Asia de Cuba for a great dining experience.  A little pricey but worth.
We will be back and have recommended it to many!",5,2017,01,11
125,What a discovery!,"Slightly trepidatious of our stay. Would it be too fashionable for the over 40s? We need not have worried. Staff were excellent. The room was ready for our early arrival and very spacious, clean and attractive. Great bathrooms and a wonderfully comfortable bed. Noisy guests next door resulted in a rapid room change for us late on Saturday night - and this was handled brilliantly by front desk. Breakfast buffet was outstanding. We've found somewhere in London that's really good value, well located in theatre land and we'll definitely return. Great for singles, couples and families!",5,2017,01,10
125,Excellent hotel,"The hotel's location is great and effected all our stay. Theatres, pubs, points of interest. The staff was welcoming. The hotel is lovely and has a warm and welcoming touch to it. This is the hotel we will defenitely go to when traveling to London.",5,2017,01,10

125,Exceeded our already high expectations,"We truly enjoyed our time at this great London hotel. Very stylish and clean, amazing location, and fantastic staff. Special mention goes to the Concierge Biken, who was very informative and super friendly. He managed to get us tickets for a show that had been sold out for months! Don't miss any of his recommendations for restaurants, bars and museums. We will definitely be back at St Martins Lane Hotel!""",5,2017,01,09

Overall absolutely fine for a 4 star",4,2017,01,09
125,Impromptu stay,"We checked into a standard double room because of the tube strike and we missed our train home.  Loved the style given the age of the building and everything was exceptionally clean.  Very comfy bed, room size was perfect.  Bathroom is off a small corridor which in turn is separated from the bedroom by a door so great to have some privacy in an en suite.  Most staff were very friendly although the check out gentleman was very demure.  You need to be organised as soon as you get into your room though.  Familiarise yourself with the heating thermostat (we needed to put plasters over a bright green light on ours), it can get very warm at night.  There is also no tea and coffee making facilities, these need to be asked for, as does more water.",4,2017,01,09
125,Delicious Afternoon Tea,"My family and I have been to The Den twice now for afternoon tea and have loved it each time! Each time the menu was a little different and the food was great. They were even happy to switch one of the items for my mom because she didn't care for it. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. I would highly recommend coming here! It is very filling, so go hungry!",5,2017,01,09
125,London stay,Exceptional service. Very friendly staff. Throughly  enjoyed our stay. Excellent breakfast. Great array of cocktails in the Blind Spot. Will definitely return. A good price for a central London hotel. Thanks to all who made our stay special. ,5,2017,01,08
125,A very clean and well organised hotel,"This hotel is bright, clean and had a good night sleep.  Use this hotel for it,s location close to the Strand.  The staff were helpful and checkin and checkout was fast and no issues. Would recommend this hotel to friends. ",5,2017,01,08
125,5 star treatment,"Stayed here for  one night after New Year to celebrate my husband's special birthday. Received a lovely warm welcome from staff who were interested in your conversation. Gorgeous, spacious room with amazing lighting. Complimentary tea/coffee sent up immediately by another polite and smiley member of staff. Belle surprised us with cake and bubbly for the special birthday that blew us away! Nothing was too much trouble and we loved the hidden 'gem'....won't spoil the surprise!
Trafalgar Square 1 minute away...theatres opposite and within minutes....a perfect location. I will be returning and staying longer next time! Absolutely gorgeous from top to toe.",5,2017,01,08
125,Above and beyond! ,"Myself and my husband had booked a room here for New Years Eve so that we could go to the fireworks to which we had tickets. It turned out however we could not attend due to unexpected mobility issues. We rang a few weeks before to ask where our room was in the hotel and if there were any rooms that faced the firework display and explained our situation. The reception explained that our room was at the back of the Hotel and unfortunately the only rooms available with a view were premium room that had an additional charge of ¬£600!! We did not take them up on this offer due to the cost. We decided to just keep our booking and go to dinner and forget about the fireworks! However, when we arrived at the hotel to check-in, a lady at reception told us she had remembered our call and that she managed to get us a standard room at the corner of the hotel which would have a restricted view of the fireworks. There would be no extra charge for this. We were delighted. We were even more delighted to find that we actually had a full on view of the fireworks that night, it couldn't have been better! Massive thank you for arranging this as it made our New Years Eve. ",5,2017,01,07
125,Charming hotel,"We spent four days in St Martins Lane hotel this Christmas. It was a really nice experience. The breakfast is extraordinary and the new year eve dinner was incredible, including the Cuban band which was playing during the night. 

The two concierge helped us to get really good tickets for theatres and recommended trendy restaurants. The hotel staff was friendly. 

For sure, we strongly recommend it and will repite again.",5,2017,01,07
125,Great stay,"We spent 10 nights here over Christmas and felt totally comfortable and at home.  The funky theme didn't really appeal to us.  It didn't feel like a typical 5 star and the dark corridors and low ceiling didn't help.    The room was quiet (room 623 facing back lane), spotless, bright, spacious, so was the bath area and shower room.  Excellent sleep and best shower ever.  We didn't have a bath tub but at least we didn't have to stand in one to take a shower.   The TV channels were really not easy to locate or select.  The room could do with an espresso machine which these days seem to be the norm for hotels of this calibre and pricing.  

Front office staff were efficient albeit a little curt and not too friendly.  Patrick who brought us to our room,  was supposed to check on something but never got back to us and we never saw him again throughout our 10 days there.  

Isabelle is amazing! Most helpful and friendly person we encountered.  Thank you so much for taking the time!

Biggest plus is the location especially during the holidays when there wasn't any public transport.  Not a problem, we're 10 minutes walk to all our favourite spots.  Altogether a great stay.  Isabelle we will be in contact soon.",4,2017,01,05
125,Funky,"Balcony Room was funky, comfortable and handy for sneaking a smoke.
The amenities were pretty good, and Housekeeping very decent.
The Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment, with high prices and not quite enough attention to the quality of the food.",4,2017,01,04
125,"Friendly and accommodating staff, beautiful decor, excellent location!","We traveled to London from the U.S. We arrived early at the hotel, given the overnight flight. Even though our room wasn't ready, staff member ""Patrik"" made both of our children comfortable in the hotel's den area with blankets and pillows until our room was ready. That set the tone for our stay. Every staff member was accommodating and friendly, ensuring we had everything we needed during our three-night stay. The hotel has a partnership with the gym next door, making exercise during your trip extremely convenient. And the hotel's location is excellent - within walking distance to many theaters and sites. The Asia de Cuba restaurant housed inside the restaurant serves delicious meals and drinks! The rooms are modern, and we all loved the lighting and bathroom finishes. As many have said, the rooms are small, but everything is well organized. There's plenty of space to store four pieces of luggage and multiple shoes and coats! We will definitely be back on our next visit. Thanks to the entire staff for making our stay pleasant!",5,2017,01,04
125,Great Hotel,"Had a short stay here in December. Excellent restaurant and loved the bar! Obviously brilliant location for the theatre which was opposite the front door. Very friendly and professional staff, no fuss just good service! Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would be delighted to stay again anytime.",5,2017,01,04
125,This is a very special place!,"If you want to celebrate and make your visit to London special then this is the place. The hotel is in such a brilliant position for all landmarks and great for Theatre land. I had no idea how handy it would be and need to let others know about this fabulous hotel.
",5,2017,01,04
125,Love this trendy hotel,"We arrived early (9am) and expected to have to wait to check in but the very kind receptionist helped us to get our room ready early so we were able to get into the shower immediately!  Great after a 12 hour flight, overnight.

Everything was perfect and thoughtful (e.g. many clothes hooks on walls, shelves, storage for luggage under the bed etc).  

Service was friendly and efficient as well.

The room was a little bit on the small side, but it was acceptable, given the top notch location.  

Would stay here again, easily.",5,2017,01,04
125,Our best ever stay!,"Stayed here for one night, booked through Time Out Secret Escapes, to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was possibly the best hotel experience we have ever had! The Blind Spot is a hidden gem - I won't give the game away! - the staff were ALL exceptional, with a particular mention for Belle, and wished my wife a 'happy birthday' on more than one occasion, and the stylish decor, inspiring. The wine in the room was complimentary as they knew it was my wife's birthday!

Thank you so much for making our stay so special and memorable!",5,2017,01,04
125,Fabulous hotel with lots of little touches that make for a fabulous stay,"I stayed at St Martin's Lane hotel in December in a King room on the 6th floor. The room was spacious with an exceptionally comfortable bed. The complimentary laundry of gym gear is an excellent touch and the service was excellent at all times. I would also highly recommend a rate that includes breakfast as it is delicious! The location for me was perfect with Covent Garden, Embankment and Westminster all within walking distance.",5,2017,01,04
125,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","I try to stay in or around Covent Garden every time I'm in London, and tried this hotel for the first time on my last trip. While the room was a bit small (as they tend to be in the city), the location more than made up for it. We sprung for the included breakfast buffet, which was absolutely delicious. I can't quite say it was worth the price, but we did enjoy it!

The hotel is a few minutes from the Leicester Square stop on the Underground (which is on the Piccadilly line, and very convenient to reach from Heathrow if you are inclined to take the Tube in from the airport.) All of the hotel staff we met was very friendly, but I'd like to take an extra second to thank Patrick for walking my Mom and me to the Underground on our last day. We had very heavy luggage thanks to all the souvenirs we bought, and he went out of his way to walk us to the stop (in a light rain!) and carry our bags down the stairs for us. Exceptional service! 

If you're looking for a nice place to stay that's central to Westminster (we walked most everywhere, including the Houses of Parliament, Covent Garden, St James Park, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Trafalgar Square), then this hotel will work for you!",5,2017,01,03
125,Consistently Faultless,"We‚Äôve been staying at St Martins Lane every year for the past 6 years to celebrate mine and my partner‚Äôs anniversary in December. This year was special in that I was going to propose to my girlfriend. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail of the proposal - but would like to point out the exemplary amount of effort that was put in from the team at the hotel to make our weekend an extremely special one and to help co-ordinate the big plan for the proposal. As for the hotel itself, the facilities were immaculate, clean, and absolutely stunning, and the staff were always helpful and polite. This stands not just for this one trip to St Martins Lane but during nearly 10 stays over the past 6 years. 

St Martins Lane achieves everything you would want from a high end luxury hotel but most importantly, without feeling pompous. A hotel that everyone can feel comfortable in, which for us now feels like a home from home. Without a doubt our most favourite hotel in the UK, which we will be returning to for many future trips.

Jack",5,2017,01,03
125,Perfect in every way,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. My partner and I travel to London once a year for holiday and always stay at this hotel. It's centrally located with a short walk to Covent Garden, 2 central tube stops, Trafalgar Square and Soho. The hotel uses Malin &  Goetz products which we now use at home. The water pressure in the showers is incredible as is the service at the hotel. The decor is very modern including lights behind the bed that you can control (different colours). We are already looking forward to our 2017 London trip!",5,2017,01,01
125,Fab hotel but a little disappointing ,"We booked this hotel for New Year's Eve it is in a brilliant spot new trafalger square. We could not fault the room it was beautiful and modern. my only disappointments are 1) no free tea or coffee if your paying ¬£295 a night you expect a complimentary beverage and not just 1 bottle of water, and 2) if your booking through booking. Com be aware as the hotel demand ¬£100 for a deposit when you check in, this is no way mentioned by the hotel in either an email or on there website (luckily we had it spare) apart from that it was fab ",4,2017,01,01
125,"Location, location, location","A chic and modern hotel with all the basics that a London visitor needs.

An extremely central location for shopping, musical & ballet hopping, sightseeing, as well as for eating. Especially useful after all the eating is a nice place for exercise which was right next door, GymBox!

Just next door there are several coffee shops with hot meals. Not to mention the different cuisines just down the street. So we didn't have an opportunity to try their nice restaurants. 

Leicester Square, Covent Garden, and Trafalgar Square are a stone's throw away. A 15-minute walk, or 10 minutes if you are an eager shopper, brings you to Oxford/Regent street.",5,2016,12,31
125,A marvellous experience!,"We found the hotel by searching the internet. It is very conveniently located near Trafalgar, Covent Garden and Leicester Square. The room was equipped with all modern comfort, and very well isolated! The Asia de Cuba restaurant serves a genuine fusion of Asian and Latin American food and flavours: highly recommended!",5,2016,12,29
125,Luxury in the heart of the West End,"I stayed at St Martins Lane for the second Christmas in a row and enjoyed the friendly and warm atmosphere. The staff are fantastic!
The restaurant, Asia de Cuba, the cocktail bar and the lounge are fantastic facilities.
The room and bathroom were exceptionally comfortable and everything worked perfectly. ",5,2016,12,29
125,Great celebratory weekend,"We stayed in early Nov 2016, for a couple of nights to celebrate a big birthday and our wedding anniversary. The location is fantastic, easy walking distance to Leicester sq, Chinatown, Covent Garden and more. We ate in Asia de Cuba and lobster mash remains my favourite along with the lovely & very naughty doughnuts and dips!  Breakfast was also excellent with plenty of traditional and unusual options and open until late so you really can relax and not rush in the morning.  Lovely stay, great room and facilities would recommend.",5,2016,12,29
125,"Great, Humane, Warm Service ! Best hotel and best staff !","How you differentiate a good service from a great service? That's the mail I got from the St Martins Lane London.
 Incredible hotel ! Incredible, humane and warm service !
 Thank you very much for your help and your care !

125,Base to explore London,"Great location. Nice room. Never ate at the hotel restaurant because there were so many options around within 2min walk.

Friendly staff. Slight hiccup on arrival when they can't find our booking. But the manager apologized and send us a bottle of wine to makeup.  Bribery does work!",4,2016,12,25
125,"Excellent in-house team, clean, great location","Second stay here and the efficient staff recognised this and new I required early checkin from a 24 hours flight. Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Well always try and stay here overtime I visit London.  ",4,2016,12,24
125,Outstanding Hotel,"I have wanted to stay at this hotel since it opened and it didn't disappoint.

From the moment we stepped out the taxi at the front door the staff were attentive and accommodating. 

The decor and furniture still look fresh and modern and the views are amazing. We stayed in a King room on the top floor - there is enough room for two people and an amazing view of the skyline including the wheel.

The bar downstairs is hidden away behind a secret door and serves amazing cocktails. Breakfast in the restaurant is either buffet, my recommendation, or a la crate if you enjoy cooked breakfasts.

I will definitely be staying here again on my next London visit.",5,2016,12,22
125,Always Excellent ,"Stayed for two nights in December. Booking handled by Krystian who is a real asset to the hotel. Very helpful and was able to help me with a few special requests. The hotel is immaculate. Breakfast is fab and the cocktail bar serves THE BEST Mojitos. The rooms are modern and a great spec. The bathtub is a must. 
Thanks for another lovely stay. Thanks Krystian, hope to return soon. ",5,2016,12,20
125,Super location and wonderful service ,"Stayed 3 nights at this trendy, extremely well located hotel. 

Stayed at many locations but will say this is one of the best. 

From the check-in , front door assistants to check out, it was one of the best stays ever in London.  Concierge was informative and super friendly. 
Will definitely look forward to returning. 

Within walking distance to most popular sites. Trafalgar square, Piccadilly Circus, Chinatown , covent garden, regent street etc

Rooms are functional and spacious. Modern design and has a very nice bar. 
Many dining options close by and lots to entertain as you are right in the theatre district. 

Thank you for the wonderful, warm and friendly service. 

",5,2016,12,18
125,Just Perfect,From the moment we walked through the revolving door of the hotel and seeing all the staff smiling and welcoming us we knew we would enjoy our stay. I booked a Superior room for myself and girlfriend for her birthday. Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we were given complimentary cocktails in the Asia de Cuba restaurant. The restaurant was buzzing and there was a brilliant atmosphere. When we got to our rooms we were impressed with the cleanliness and views. The mood lighting above the bed really finished the room off nicely..... we went out for dinner and during the evening I proposed to my girlfriend in Trafalgar Square!!! When we got back to the room there was champagne waiting!! I hadn't told the hotel it was my 'now' fianc√©e birthday or that I was going to propose to her! We're now trying to figure out who told the hotel out of our friends and family! A special thank you to Isabella on the front desk for providing the champagne and for your brilliant customer service! The bar was gorgeous also and the cocktails were to die for! All in all we absolutely loved our stay!!! We only wish we could of stayed longer!! Thank you! ,5,2016,12,18
125,Very central,"Room was not large but no hotel room in London will be large. Modern interior. Led mood lighting did not do it for me. Good shower and quite a large bathroom for a small room. Nice Malin Goetz amenities. We did not like the bed, matress uncomfortable but that is a personal choice. We asked if they had another matress to try and they did change them and we were given 2 vouchers for a drink in the bar. The overall service was very good. They were very helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was included and we could choose from the buffet and order an a la carte dish as well. ",4,2016,12,18
125,Love this hotel,"I live in London and I love the odd hotel treat and this did not disappoint. You have have a whole evening out just at the hotel!
From the great restaurant to the secret bar.
Best to find deals on hotel websites rather than booking direct with hotel",5,2016,12,18
125,Consistently fabulous,"This was my third trip to St Martins Lane Hotel this year, having discovered it during the summer ... and it is now most definitely my London hotel of choice for comfort, ambience, style and location.  I plan to visit many more times in 2017!",5,2016,12,17
125,Very nice hotel,"Great location, within walking distance to many areas and tube. Great little coffee shop down the street (Scores). Rooms were well decorated despite needing a search light in the dark hallways to find the room. Very comfortable bed, great washroom, just a little frustrated with the temperature control. 
Staff were friendly, despite needing a secret password to get into the bar. (Behind a closed manned door)
Hipsters welcome!  Would stay again. ",4,2016,12,17
125,Perfect central London hotel,"Absolutely perfect location for theatres and shopping. Very attentive, friendly and professional service from all members of staff. Superb room with every facility. Great atmosphere in both the Den and the Blind Spot. Couldn't have asked for more - a very relaxing and enjoyable stay. ",5,2016,12,15
125,Very trendy and modern hotel,"We stayed one night for our sons graduation.  
Ideal location as to where we wanted to be, within walking distances.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Love the decor.
Everything clean, modern and chic.
Breakfast was wonderful.  A good selection to choose from. 
Definitely come back one day.",5,2016,12,15
125,Trendy boutique hotel in superb location,"Great location. Incredibly central to SoHo and theatre district. We walked everywhere. Starbucks right opposite. Really fantastic for central London shopping and sightseeing. 

Lobby is cool and modern and checkin was fast and friendly and people offered to help with bags. It even smelt lovely. 

Corridors were typical for this type of hotel; dark and moody. The room however was excellent. We didn't have the cheapest room but it was relatively cheap for the hotel overall. Maybe the second cheapest? It was large, with a seat and desk and table. It also had a small transitional room between the bedroom and bathroom where you could store bags and keep and the room itself clean and tidy. 

The bathroom felt luxurious, with the typical Morgan's group toiletries. The bed was comfy and very clean and crisp and we liked being able to play with the LED mood lighting. 

We had drinks at the hotel bar which were fantastic as was the service and atmosphere. The little salty nibbles were addictive and had a great hour sat chatting with friends. Note, it's advisable to book, even at 7pm it was pretty busy. (Not a cheap drink though... ¬£15-¬£20 a drink?)

Well worth a stay here. I'd love to return if there is a deal on in the future. ",4,2016,12,13
125,Fab hotel! Excellent staff. ,"We stayed for one night at the hotel. The valet parking on arrival and departure was excellent. Flawless in fact. Ricardo and another gentleman who's name we didn't catch, were bright, helpful and happy. Everything you want from great hotel staff.  Check in was not quite so 'bright, helpful and happy' but I'm sure the staff were very busy. 
Our room was impeccably clean. Some of the lighting and features were a fun, funky add on to the room....though the random plant fixed to the wall did seem a little superfluous. 
A fantastic nights sleep. There's clearly excellent sound proofing. 
Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. Our only gripe here? The fairly miserable staff shoe horned us and another two sets of guests into a booth area. The restaurant was essentially empty (we are breakfast at 11.15) and it was clear (because I heard them say) that the staff only wanted to wait on one area. That was a bit of a shame really. 
Overall. Excellent hotel. Location is perfect. Absolutely recommend. ",5,2016,12,12
125,Amazing weekend - Faultless experience,"We really enjoyed our London weekend staying at the St Martins Lane Hotel. It started from the friendly welcome at the desk on arrival, the excellent valet parking service, and the quality of the accommodation. We only had a standard room, so didn't expect 'large', but it was more than adequate and the bathroom was generously proportioned. We loved everything about the minimalist decor, the quirky lighting and the wealth of guest services on offer. 
We didn't breakfast in the hotel, so have no comment on that, but we had after dinner drinks in The Den, and a fabulous meal in Asia de Cuba (separately reviewed). 
The hotel has a wealth of quirky design features, and clearly attracts a fashionable crowd. The lobby area has a real buzz about it, with sounds of music and loud chatter, but after a long day of Christmas shopping, the bedroom was an oasis of calm.
Fabulous hotel - definitely will be back. Did I mention location? Nowhere better in London in my opinion. And the staff? All on happy pills and all the better for it!",5,2016,12,11
125,I would never stay here again,"We stayed in room 315. The bathroom was for a disabled traveller as had rails/no bath and had a large shower room with a powerful shower that pointed at the shower door. The shower door was not sealed and the water ran out at a great rate on to the floor of the bathroom getting all my clothes really wet. We needed to use 4 towels to soak it up. The basin was a joke. The tap just went over the edge of the basin bowl so you could not wash your hands completely just your fingers! Really poor design and function. When we complained and asked for a new set of towels I felt it was brushed off quickly as a small issue, this is not what I would expect from this standard of hotel in London.",1,2016,12,11
125,Wonderful hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel whilst in London for a trip to the theatre.  We could not fault it.  From the moment we checked in, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  
The room was lovely and very comfortable, we slept really well.
The location of the hotel is fantastic, just two minutes from Covent Garden.
We have to mention Daniele, on reception, who was genuinely concerned that we had enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel.
We had, thank you Daniele.  We will not hesitate to stay here again, in the not too distant future, hopefully.",5,2016,12,10
125,"Modern, stylish and central","I was attending an awards ball and conference at the Savoy. This hotel was close by. 
The hotel is very stylish and you should make sure you visit the secret bar. 
Room are compact but we'll equipped. Breakfast is on the pricey side and not really that good, but what do you expect for central London",4,2016,12,10
125,Lovely night in central london,"Bought a great auction prize for charity of a night at
 st martins lane hotel plus theatre vouchers. Went to see An Inspector Calls at the Playhouse. Brilliant play. Hotel was lovely. Very smart room, beautiful bathroom, comfy bed and colourful lights that we just about managed to work! Service good. Ate dinner elsewhere (Orso in Covent Garden. Lovely Italian, not fancy), had a drink and dessert at an Italian wine bar in Covent Garden then back to hotel for drinks. Main bar was closed for private event (shame) but we had a nice bar table in the restaurant area which was very lively. Very enjoyable. Breakfast lovely, made lovelier by warm service from Vicky. Thanks to all. Great stay.",5,2016,12,10
125,"Modern hotel, a bit funky, disappointing breakfast service",Clean modern room.  Comfy bed and linen.   Decent bathroom with walk-in shower but no bath.   Reception staff friendly and helpful.   Drinks in the bar and the room are very expensive.  Went for a quick breakfast at 7am and wanted a coffee and pastry.  Told host it had to be quick.  Staff all in a meeting huddled together at end of restaurant and no food order taken or coffee provided.  Host was surprised when I left 15 minutes later without anything.  Real let down for a business hotel.,4,2016,12,09
125,Delicious afternoon tea!,"I am really pleased we found this gem for afternoon tea. The food was delicious, the staff were excellent and accommodated us even though their bookings system hasn't captured our booking correctly. It was a brilliant location and excellent value.",4,2016,12,09
125,Great Hideaway in the Heart of London,This boutique hotel delivers attentive guest services in a great location.  What else would you ask for on a getaway to London?  St Martin's Lane Hotel will continue to be my number one choice in London,5,2016,12,08
125,Custom lighting and modern elegant room,"I had the occasion to be in London to attend a conference at the Savoy Hotel and all delegates were placed at St Martin's Lane Hotel near Covent Garden. From a location perspective it was brilliant! Close to all the regular London sights - Trafalgar Square, Picadillay Circus, houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, London Eye, Tower Bridge - the works!

The room itself was spacious (although I really did not need 2 queen sized beds for one person....), modern and had the means to change the lighting to suit my mood (or not). The staff was helpful and reception efficient. Of course, it is pricey but that is probably justified by its location. Not recommended for a family holiday on a budget though!",4,2016,12,08
125,Great location,"Me and my sister had a 'Superior Double Double' Room and all these types of rooms are located on the 1st floor. We found it to be way too noisy for us as we could hear music (and the bass pumping) all night long. The next morning we asked for a quiet room. Without a problem we were moved to the 3rd floor. The service was good, the location could not have been better and the rooms had perfect layout.",4,2016,12,08
125,Afternoon Tea in Wonderful Surroundings,"Enjoyed a unique afternoon tea in pleasant and comfortable surroundings.  The difference to other afternoon teas I had enjoyed was that, instead of sandwiches, the savouries were extra special and so delicious: one of which was a brioche with spinach, chorizo and pine nuts - wow! 

The scones and pastries were excellent - the pastry chef, Ludovik, enjoys adding surprises to his dishes.

I would highly recommend this treat for special occasions and I am already planning a return visit.",5,2016,12,07
125,great stay,while looking for a place to stay on our annual trip to London for the theatre and shopping i saw this hotel and decided to give it a try. It is a wonderful experience . the people are great and they exceed our expectations in all categories. look forward to return next year.,5,2016,12,07
125,Lovely experience,We used the hotel because friends had recommended it and it was going to be very convenient for our plans. It was very special...a great room which was an upgrade. The facilities in the room were excellent and we enjoyed the space.,5,2016,12,06
125,Better than imagined,"After reading the numerous amazing reviews of St. Martins Lane Hotel I was so excited to actually experience it, and what an experience it was.  The hotel is immaculate with every staff member smiling and polite and happy to assist. We had a deluxe room, which covered all the bases and when an issue arose with our TV system we were moved to a higher category room without any hesitation.  Really the only thing you need to know is this is a fantastic, hip, perfectly located, immaculate hotel for anyone to experience.  We stayed for 8 nights and can't wait to come again.  Thank you to Belle and all her staff for making this experience perfect.",5,2016,12,06
125,A fab place to stay! ,A wonderful experience staying here....attention to detail is incredible....Breakfast was superb....fantastic Location ....right in the heart of Covent Garden & a stones throw from Leicester Square.....will be back ! ,5,2016,12,06
125,Loved this hotel!!,"A friend and I booked St Martins lane hotel for a girlie christmas weekend in London. We were extremely impressed. The staff were very helpful and pleasant when booking in. We asked for early check in and the hotel were able to get our room ready for 12pm which was so convenient. The hotel was lovely and comfortable with an amazing restaurant. 
We also loved the bar... which you wouldn't know was there as its hidden behind a secret door. I am looking forward to staying here again next year.",5,2016,12,05
125,Love the location of this hotel,"A contemporary and unstuffy hotel right in the centre of London's lively nightlife. Great pubs, huge range of restaurants, theatres, cinemas traditional pubs, and interesting bars & clubs all within a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Go for one of the suites. The space and bathrooms are particularly well done. But even the more standard rooms are done to a high standard (although as per most hotels in London - here not the most generous on space)

Hotel gives free access to the next door 'Gym Box' with many more facilities, classes and vibe than a normal hotel gym.

Hotel is always my little perch when I come to London",5,2016,12,05
125,Fantastick to be back again,"We love to stay at St Martins Lane London Hotel due to the design and the wonderful atmosphere from the ground floor to the top. 
The staff people you meet are always very engage in your situation and willing to try  everything to make your stay exceptional. 
The other guests appreciate the same things as we do making the stay even more pleasant. 
Being in London and at St Martins is really something we look forward to and leave with the thought of planning the next stay.",5,2016,12,05
125,"Great hotel, fantastic location, but avoid the restaurant","Always wanted to stay in this hotel and it didn't disappoint - amazing location in the centre of the west-end, unique d√©cor and good sized, bright rooms with free wifi.  Would definitely return!!
Avoid Asia de Cuba though - breakfasts is expensive, service is slow and not worth it.",4,2016,12,05
125,Ideally positioned for Leicester Square,Nice funky hotel with a really big bar area upstairs. The hotel seems to attract a younger crowd which is no doubt due to its vibe. Rooms were satisfactory equipped. Staff helpful but not too attentive or overbearing. Not sure as I would return though as I have stayed in better places at a similar cost. ,3,2016,12,04
125,"Very good location, very hip, but missing on comfort and finesse","I stayed here for one night on a business trip - the location is excellent, although good luck getting to the door in a rush hour with a taxi;) - there is a Starbucks across the street, so I could grab my latte on the go as I did not have time for a breakfast. But I am not so sure about the windows and the pink luminescent lights in the room - feels a bit like in an operation room. I found the rooms modern but very cold and not cosy. Housekeeper hair in my bathroom... Brrrr.
The hotel is really trying to be a W Hotel, with all this party-style loud music in the lobby, very informal staff - but sorry, they are just not...
The restaurant Asia de Cuba, although was recommended to me by a couple of colleagues, did not make such a great impression. The food is good but a bit overly fancy. And yes, very expensive for what you get - I am saying this as I am from Zurich, so trust me I am not easily impressed when it comes to prices. 
Anyway, it is probably a hotel for a drink rather than for a stay of longer than one night. It lacks the finesse.
But to each his own;)",3,2016,12,02
125,Good but very expensive,"Great hotel very modern but at ¬£430 for one night it was very expensive. For that kind of price you world expect real luxury. Room was very contemporary, nice bathroom. Reception staff very polite and well trained. There is better value for money elsewhere in central London.",3,2016,12,01
125,Fantastic,"Awesome hotel. Brilliantly equipped clean modern and cool. Great wifi. Superb location for central London. We stopped 2 nights and found it convenient for oxford street theatre land Covent Garden and st James palace which were all on our agenda, and all in easy reach on foot. ",5,2016,11,29
125,Romantic Sunday gettaway,"My love surprised me with a stay here. It was most romantic gift ever! The hotel is beautiful, mysterious, and I must say, the staff goes beyond the call of duty to make your dream come true! Thank you so much for the special room to Karolina, Dorota and Sameena, who are like Christmas elfs: You rarely see them, but they work add that extra special miracle. Also thanks to Gianluca and Sabina on the reception are the most welcoming people you'll ever meet! We also ventured in to the mysterious bar in the lobby, where the darkness, the music and those amazing cocktails just the cream on the cake! (Thank you for the recommendations Winnie!) Oh and don‚Äôt forget Asia de Cuba. What and amazing food!! Both in the evening and for breakfast! Unfortunately I only remember the name of Ashley and Kata, but they really made the dining experience memorable! Thank you all! I had the most amazing night ever!",5,2016,11,29
125,Modern simplicity,"I have stayed at the St Martin's lane several times.  The hotel is thoughtfully designed and quite comfortable.  The bathrooms are quite large and modern.  The hotel location is ideal for visiting London, though the on weekends the street can be quite crowded.  Overall a great chic choice.",5,2016,11,28
125,"Great location, quirky style","You can't beat the location of this hotel, between Trafalgar and Leicester squares.  The building is a '60s vintage block of concrete, which gave the interior designers license to go wild.  In the room, formica and mood lighting create a funky throwback atmosphere.  I liked it, but was kind of a shock at first.  My room, facing the rear of the hotel, was extremely quiet, which is nice after the bustle of the local area.  The gymbox gym next door is a big plus - you just show your room key to use it, and it's very well equipped.",5,2016,11,28
125,Excellent!,This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and it was equally as brilliant as the first.  All the staff are extremely attentive and efficient and go the extra mile to ensure your stay is just perfect.  It's location is fabulous for exploring London.  The rooms are heavenly and always immaculate.   I will only stay in this hotel when in London.,5,2016,11,28
125,Charming place,One of my best hotel in London. I love the atmosphere. Meals are good (asia de cuba). The concierge is nice and helful. The reservation was OK but a bit long. I will come back at this hotel next year. Designed by stark,4,2016,11,27
125,I love the Modern feel of this special place. ,"It was the 2nd time I stayed here and the staff were once again so helpful and the location  superb. My accommodation was fantastic, albeit quite small and the bed super comfortable. I loved the modern quirky touches in the room. I was surprised to hear from my friends that they had a bath in their bathroom which I have never had in my last 2 stays. I shall request one next time.  I shall be back",4,2016,11,27
125,Take a little getting used to but really good for one person for 2 week long stay,"Several colleagues and I stayed in July 2016 for 15 days for business. The neon ambient light in all the rooms were strange and we all ended up shutting ours down every night. We were ""upgraded"" to our king-bed rooms because we were all staying for 2 weeks. The room wasn't large but it was quite comfortable for one person. The bathroom is open (no doors to the closet and the bathroom area--but there were doors to the toilet and to the shower. The water pressure in the shower was good. However, if there's more than 1 person staying in the room, there is no privacy to be found. 
The closet is on either side of the bathroom entrance and is covered by curtains. I guess good use of small space but it was a bit annoying in the beginning.

The long stay provided us with some amenities--a welcome fruit platter and a nice bottle of sparkling water, daily bottle of flat water, daily laundry allowance of 2 articles of clothing, free hispeed wifi (normally 10 GBP/day), access to gymbox and free continental breakfast. All these amenities were excellent--especially the breakfast. The continental breakfast includes many of the cured meats, sausages, scrambled eggs and good coffee/tea and is served in Asia de Cuba, their signature restaurant.

Asia de Cuba was a really good restaurant--we ate there a couple of times and also ordered room service from it. I got a bit sick of the food after the second time though. The duck isn't good--but the tuna tartar tacos was great--reminds me of tuna poke.

The bar was nice and I heard there's performances there from time to time.

The high speed wifi logged you out each morning and you had to re-login each day. Very annoying as if you forget to do so, you don't have internet service and you don't get your emails/messages. I believe the slower free wifi is open and you do not need to login daily.

Overall, I enjoyed the stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Concierge, not so much.

The proximity to Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square, National Museum, all the metro stations, etc. is great.

I just can't imagine staying there with someone I am not super comfortable with due to the lack of privacy in the restroom area.",4,2016,11,26
125,Beyond the usual,"We stayed here in the summer for our wedding anniversary. It's a beautiful, stylish hotel seconds from Trafalgar Square, and our visit was made even better when they upgraded us to a (massive) suite with floor to ceiling windows and gave us a bottle of champagne on the house and free cocktails in the bar to toast our day. If  you're looking for somewhere to celebrate, I couldn't recommend it more highly. We will be back.",5,2016,11,24
125,My new Hotel when I stay in London,"Great location, close to everything. Very friendly and helpful staff: Hotel has a hip vipe (same owners as The Delano in South Beach) and there is a great gym that is free for Hotel guests. They even clean three pieces of gym clothes for free each day. If you want to be in walking distance to great shopping, dining, sightseeing and nightlife - this is the place to be.",5,2016,11,23
125,Great afternoon tea in an quirky location,"the afternoon tea here is great, with a nice range of different food times, in an interesting and well designed location.

Couldn't finish the tea with two people, and required a couple of boxes to take everything home in as well!

Great service from our host, Kinga, and made for a really special afternoon!",5,2016,11,23
125,Always Friendly & Easy,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times now and I am never disappointed. 
I always book the Garden room, and whilst it could do with some updated garden furniture it is lovely and well appointed.

The bathrooms and bed are comfortable and clean. The entire hotel is spotless. All of the staff are very welcoming and helpful, the cocktails are amazing and the food is also very good and great value. 

The location is perfect.

I preferred the bar before they refurbished it but it still has an inviting atmosphere. They need to put the China back on the cocktail menu! ",5,2016,11,22
125,Great Location,"Check in - Very easy and prompt, room wasn't ready but we were early, so they stored our luggage whilst we went out and about, asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, and issued us with a free cocktail voucher each, nice touch.
Rooms - spotlessly clean, lovely bed linen, huge bed, lovely big bath towels, bathroom superb, plenty of hanging space, a real bonus for me was a proper hairdryer to use. didn't need to open the mini bar so cant comment. a few previous guest had reviewed that it was noisy , for us our room was very quiet.
Breakfast - Well where do I start, very disappointing, sat on a table as far away from the breakfast as they could possibly put us, self service breakfast so by the time you had put your breakfast onto a cold plate carried it back to the table it was not hot enough, had to ask 3 times for our coffee and tea order , they had obviously forgotten it. wasn't asked if we would like toast, again I had to ask for it, this is basic customer service, the breakfast ie bacon, scrambled eggs, were not replaced quickly enough when they needed to be. overall I would not recommend breakfast plenty of nearby cafes which would be much better , our room rate included breakfast which is why we stayed.
Check out - very quick , bill correct, 
To sum up, great location, great room, staff good, breakfast a disappointment.",4,2016,11,21
125,Quirky and fun,"The hotel is very unassuming from the street, and you wouldn't know the hotel inside awaits from curb side! 

The hotel was very clean, the rooms well appointed with most of the things you need. The Mini fridge is packed with extremely overpriced drinks and snacks, so we didn't partake.

The bedroom was small, well appointed however. Throughout the room there are a number of products strategically placed to tempt you into buying - including razors, creams and a ¬£38 candle in a box. This was one of the reasons it doesn't get 5 stars. There was also no dressing gown and slippers with a ¬£260 standard room rate, (room only) you would expect them to go the extra mile. There was also no tea/ coffee making facilities? Disappointing.

Breakfast was ¬£25 per head so we went to Cote Brasserie next door for their equivalent breakfast at ¬£8.50. It's just too much on top of an expensive room! 

The Cocktail bar was great albeit as everything else in the hotel - very expensive. 

The staff were very well presented and helpful - well done all!

I stay in hotels every week in London, all the above are reasons why I wouldn't stay here as a business traveller. If you are looking for something different and fun, this place is ideal for a one off! ",3,2016,11,20
125,Good for disabled people,"Came in wheelchair - exceedingly good staff who always jumped up to open the doors for me. Our room had a wet room but it was a disaster! The drain was actually slightly higher than the floor(!) so the entire bathroom was under water by the end of a shower. We had to use every towel and flannel but they just ended up sodden and lots of water left. This was really late at night when I was exhausted so went to bed, but it meant that all through the night when I was up for the loo I was having to be very careful not to slip! We also had trouble on reserving a parking space. The person on Chat did not seem to understand that I couldn't stay unless I knew I could park (valet) and Judy kept saying we don't reserve spaces. However an email to the hotel asking for decaf tea and coffee, and just happening to mention I was disabled elicitated a would you like us to reserve you a car parking space which was somewhat ironic(!). Apart from silly things like no milk in the room, then the next day not refilling our teas and coffees but leaving 3 uht milk only - the room was great
 Rooms are never as large as you would like, especially with a wheelchair, but it was clean and comfy. I enjoyed the hotel and we had excellent room service and drinks in the bar. We really found the staff great and they made it for us.",5,2016,11,17
125,Location,"Great hotel in fantastic location, easy walking to all theatres, Covent Garden &Trafalgar Square.
The room was spotless, bed extremely comfortable, very good breakfast.
All the staff were friendly and ensured we had all we needed - definitely recommended and would stay here again",5,2016,11,17
125,Smart modern hotel ,"Stayed for 2 nights on business and as always really enjoyed. Smart modern rooms generally white with mood lighting, great bathrooms with ultra powerful showers. The staff are friendly and helpful. Great area, near tube and Leicester Square. Restaurant and bar good but need to book to guarantee s seat ( yes even the bar) ",5,2016,11,16
125,Fantastic hotel in a great locaiton,"We couldn't have been happier with our experience at St Martins lane. It's in an excellent central location that's easily walkable from Covent Garden and Soho. The immediate neighborhood around the hotel is full of great restaurants and pubs as well which is great after a long day of exploring the city. In short, we'd stay here again if we're ever lucky enough to get back to London.",5,2016,11,16
125,Inattentive Staff who customers are obviously an inconvenience to,Not the easiest hotel to find but when you do the rude staff obviously feel that anything is too much trouble and will find every reason not to be off assistance. Bars and restaurants too booked for hotel guests to use yet a large lobby that was not full. Personal service this was not as we were treated with complete disdain and no assistance ever offered. Visit at your peril. Breakfast uninspiring at best,1,2016,11,15
125,social business trip,"The rook was very pleasant, although smaller than the last time I stayed in this hotel it was perfectly adequate. breakfast service was not so good, range of food on offer was limited and the coffee in an earn was dreadful, could not gey anyone to bring us any fresh brewed coffee in a pot..",4,2016,11,14
125,Central Place,"This Hotel is very central. Breakfast expensive. But in front of the hotel you have a Starbucks. subway just in the corner. The room was very modern. No complains. I found the staff not close to the guests. But this didn't make any difference. The hotel is very beautiful. The concierge - they change but they are so special... When he knew I was from Rio de Janeiro, he chated a lot as he came for a Carnaval, and had a wonderful time. Very good to have this exchange and warm people. He suggested Columbia Market, Brick Lane, and I had a wonderful day. I forgot his name..",5,2016,11,12
125,My favourite London hotel!,"It's always a real treat staying here. Warm welcome as a returning guest, tip top service, nothing is too much trouble. My 'loft' room was spacious, with a great view across London rooftops to the London Eye.
I stay in hotels regularly &  this place is among the best.",5,2016,11,12
125,Lives up to its superb reputation,"Highly unusual and very modern/artistic hotel in a superb location near Covent Garden. Outstanding staff, who are superbly friendly and attentive at every opportunity. Classy interior which has obviously been meticulously designed in every feature. Comfortable bedrooms with excellent facilities. Great breakfast. Top-class in every aspect!",5,2016,11,11
125,"Absolutely amazing hotel, will definitly visit again","Me and my partner visited for one night on the 4th November in celebration of his birthday. With him being 21 and me 20 we don't tend to stay in hotels as pricey as this and usually book a last minute travel lodge with little planning. However after experiencing a hotel of such high standard we will definitely be paying that little bit more. The room itself is identical to the pictures advertised- clean, sophisticated and packed with little quirks like mood lighting and bluetooth connectivity. The den bar was fabulous, and we even ended up spending  our whole night here, despite planning on going to a few bars in Covent Garden. There is all good things to say about the breakfast, with both of us saying it was the best we had ever experienced- the full english being non greasy and cooked to perfection, great for us after a heavy night. 

Overall there are no complaints whatsoever, the service was amazing, the hotel was amazing and the free champagne brought to our hotel room in celebration of my boyfriends birthday was a great added touch. Will 10000000% be visiting this hotel every time we are in London.",5,2016,11,10
125,Trendy hotel in great location ,"Pros
Fab location 5 minutes from Covent Garden
Trendy decor 
Fabulous cocktails in the bar
Very helpful front desk 
Really nice vibe and feel 

Cons
No bath or bath robes 
No tea or coffee making facilities in room 

Main issue was our breakfast waitress who told us is was just the buffet - which was fine until we saw the next table to us eating eggs Benedict and pancakes. We asked if there was additional choices and after making some comment she brought out s menu with no explanation of if this was included in our room rate or not. 

This took the edge off what had been a great stay but I would still happily return. 

",4,2016,11,09
125,Very cool in more ways than one,"A triumph of style over substance? Maybe. Let's be objective. Check in was easy for me, I had been upgraded apparently, always a good start. I found my room after feeling my way along the dimly lit labyrinthine corridors. As a talking point it was blessed with a small courtyard garden. Interesting. 
It had all you need for a one night stay. The small room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the TV worked and the environment was quiet. So what's not to like?
The comedy cost mini bar and the room was chilly. Despite the best efforts of the hi tech air conditioning, the room remained chilly. I asked and got help but to no avail.
So if this seems a little ungrateful particularly after receiving a welcome gift I apologise but no one enjoys being cold.
The location is great for theatres, galleries and shopping. 
My colleagues all went into the mystery cocktail bar but I didn't so cannot report.
So, for me, almost a winner, very cool but in more ways than one. Another one that deserves more than an average rating but not quite very good.",3,2016,11,09
125,Perfect for couples.,My partner and I stayed here to celebrate an anniversary. I emailed ahead of time and Isabelle ensured that we had the most amazing stay. Nothing was too much for her.  I will not hesitate to book this hotel when we're due another staycation.,5,2016,11,09
125,Exceptional! ,"I had booked St Martins Lane Hotel as the base for a surprise birthday celebration for my wife. Two other couples were joining us and from around a month before our stay I had been in email contact several times with Belle, Guest Experiences Manager, to arrange all of the moving parts involved with 6 people arriving at different times from all over the country as well as keeping the surprise top secret on arrival with my wife. 

So, Saturday was the big day and on arrival as my wife was sent to look around the foyer, I checked us in and was discreetly assured by the chap on reception all was in hand and that our guests were safely booked in and out of sight. The hotel itself is stunning. Cool without being pretentious and a warm welcome from all members of staff. We went up to our room and were knocked out by the natural light flooding in as well as the cleanness of the design and space around us. The rooms are really that good - a proper fully stocked mini bar, Arab bed, a great telly and tonnes of settings for any lighting mood you might be in. 

We met our friends across the road in a good old fashioned pub called the Salisbury and the surprise was landed. An afternoon of swally then back to the hotel to change and delivered to the room was a complimentary bottle of champagne and plate of cake from the hotel. A lovely touch. We went out for dinner but ended up back in the hotel at the hidden, but fabulous, Blind Spot cocktail bar-cum-speakeasy where we stayed until kicking out time at 1:30am but not until we'd enjoyed a great sing along and dance with the resident DJ. It finished the night off perfectly. Drinks aren't cheap (¬£14) but are pretty top notch as far as cocktails go. 

Next morning we all had breakfast and the selection of buffet items was great and would've been enough but we added to it with the a la carte menu which had an extensive list of items to choose from ie eggs any way you want, Mexican tortilla with chorizo etc   

Rarely do I feel so compelled to write a review but for the St Martins Lane Hotel it was a necessity. It is that good trust me. I travel all over the world and will hold this place up with anywhere I've stayed. Location, looks, comfort, choice, service and care are in abundance. Well done to all involved, to the team in the hotel, but most especially to Belle who made it all happen for us. Thank you! ",5,2016,11,08
125,Gem in London,"Conveniently situated for lively West End, have no hesitation in choosing to stay there in the future. Very attentive staff throughout our stay where politeness and customer service were always at the top of their agenda!",5,2016,11,08
125,Weekend In London,"This was my first time at St. Martins Lane Hotel and I was very impressed.  I've stayed at quite a few of the 5* hotels in London and have to say, I prefer this hotel.  From the moment you walk in to reception, you pick up on the amazing vibe within.  The staff are friendly and efficient and can't do enough for you.  The rooms here are very modern and funky and with great bathrooms.  Everywhere is spotless!  The bar has a fantastic atmosphere and well worth a visit.  Breakfast was predominantly buffet with an option of a la carte, it was excellent.  I thought the price of the rooms was fair and well worth it.  This hotel would suit any kind of stay, business or leisure, singles, family or couples.
",5,2016,11,05
125,Quirky bar,"We went for drinks before going up the road for lunch at Tredwells. It was pouring with rain but my mood was lifted by the charming man who opened the door. The lobby is stylish & spacious. I was shown to ""The Den"" which has some amusing artwork on the walls. Take a good look at each piece.
We enjoyed 2 glasses of champagne each, served elegantly in long flutes. The service was friendly & efficient. No nibbles though. Usually at a posh hotel you'd get some olives or nuts, however, that is a minor quibble 
I can't comment on anything else except the bar but thought it worth a mention",5,2016,11,05
125,very nice,"The hotel was very nice, centrally located, clean and friendly .
We had a very pleasant stay.
Location was perfect, we had a lovely breakfast which was included. The staff was helpful and pleasant.
Would definitly go back!",5,2016,11,04
125,Such a treat,"Wow how lucky were we? Upgrade to a suite at the back of the hotel, so no noise from revellers in St Martin's Lane!

Loved the clean white decor. The space was filled with simple but elegant furniture. Nothing was out of place  and the mood lighting was simply stunning. Loved the stand alone bath as well as a fantastic shower room.",5,2016,11,03
125,Weekend stay,"Perfectly located for sightseeing/theatres.  Bedroom stunning and the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. No tea/coffee making facilities in room, but just had to call housekeeping and a tray was brought to our room within 5 mins. Breakfast was first class. All in all a fabulous place to stay in central London.  Highly recommend it.",5,2016,11,03
125,far from the madding crowd,"A couple of blocks from Trafalgar Square,steps to theatres,a short walk to 3 tube stations you cannot beat St Martins Lane for location and being in the heart of the action.Yet when you step into your room you enter a peaceful,quiet,calming space.You would never know there were thousands of people roaring away just below.
Our room was spacious even with the king size bed.Plenty of room for suitcases to be stored out of the way.The bathroom is luxurious,great shower. 
The best aspect of the hotel is however the friendly,charming,welcoming staff.Quite often at a ""cool"" hotel the staff are as well.This is not the case at St Martins Lane. From the moment we first walked in we were welcomed with smiles and introductions to the staff behind the desk and the concierge who all clearly wanted nothing more than to ensure we had a marvelous stay and they succeeded.
We hadn't planned on returning to London again for a few years but now we are making plans to return next year because now we have friends in London,at the St Martins Lane Hotel.",5,2016,11,02
125,Business Trip,"I appreciated this hotel which is located very close to Picadilly - the room is very quiet, clean and convenient.
I do recommand this hotel either for business or leisure.

Mr Concierge is ressourcefull to help you to find a restaurant even late.

a good stay",5,2016,11,02
125,Brilliant Hotel,"Lovely restaurant, food, cocktails and service all excellent.
Bedrooms are stunning with the most comfortable bed and pillows , best mini bar I've ever seen!!
Great location too for theatres, restaurants and shops.",5,2016,11,01
125,Weekend break,"We stayed at the St Martins Lane London hotel last weekend and can say that we thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms had ambient lighting, which was relaxing. The rooms were clean and the bathroom spacious. It was refreshing to have a hairdryer that worked well and was powerful. When we checked in we spoke to Mike the concierge who was lovely and made time to chat to us about the hotel and took an interest in what we were going to do in London. He has an extremely personable manner and is a huge asset to the hotel. The hotel is in a great area to access the theatres, Covent Garden and tube. We will definitely stay at this hotel again and can't recommend it enough.",5,2016,11,01
125,Boutique Hotel in Covent Garden,Do not think about any other Hotel in the Covent Garden Area a perfect location in the centre of the Theatre District ALL the staff went the extra mile we have stayed in many hotels in London St Martins lane exceeded them all!,5,2016,11,01
125,Unbeatable location!!,"St martins lane is definitely the place to stay when exploring London. It couldn't be in a better location. The hotel is in the perfect place, five minutes away from Leicester Square tube station and a seven to eight minute walk from Covent Garden. You can even walk to regents street, Piccadilly Circus and soho. It's not far at all! 

The checkin was very efficient and fast, can't remember who assisted me but she was great! 

The room is very interesting, I booked a deluxe room but felt like the room wasn't extremely big. It was a decent size but a slightly larger room would have been better. The mood lights were a cool touch but it would've been good if we could change the mood lights to a normal colour. The bathroom was very large. One thing I could not stand was the smell of the water. It felt like I was bathing in a swimming pool, the water smelt of chlorine and just wasn't very pleasant.

Another thing that was rather annoying was the noise from the streets. Every night I was woken up by someone yelling on the streets or the noise coming from the street. It would've been better if the rooms were a little more soundproof.

Other than that, I would definitely recommend this hotel! Thought it met my expectations and I would come back again on another occasion given my positive experience here.",4,2016,10,31
125,Wonderful location ,"The location and the service we received on a recent trip to London at the St. Martin's Lane Hotel was absolutely wonderful.  The room was well appointed and the shower was exceptional (I especially enjoyed the peppermint shampoo!).  We practically fell out of the hotel into everything we wanted to do that weekend.  Room service breakfast each morning was great! And for a city hotel it was remarkably quiet!

If I had one thing I would like management to address it was the odd (not pleasant) odour that seemed to be in the 4th floor hallway...it almost smelled like doggy pee.  And for a hotel that seemed very keen on ""signature scent"" this struck me as counter productive.

We enjoyed ourselves though and appreciated the stay!
",4,2016,10,31
125,A wonderful hotel,"Totally fab and central setting in a wonderful hotel, with really helpful staff and very comfortable rooms. A total delight , can't wait to go there again. Highly recommended for calm, luxury and total relaxation. ",5,2016,10,30
125,Amazing St Martins Lane,"St Martins Lane hotel could not be in a better location and the hotel standard and design is excellent. Staff were very helpful, Deluxe Room extremely comfortable and great value. This will become our new home in London!!",5,2016,10,30
125,Another great stay at St Martins,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic.  I received a consistent experience across every touch point, highlighting a great culture within their team.  I dined at Asia De Cuba and visited the Blind Spot on multiple occasions, and food/ service were excellent every time.  Hat's off to the team - I will be back for sure!",5,2016,10,30
125,"Well located, modern and friendly","Stayed for one night with my wife. On arriving, very friendly staff made check in simple and offered a choice of room. Went for a corner room, well worth it for the view of Theatreland.
The hidden bar was great plus we're given two free cocktail tokens!
A great location for a night in London plus very modern decor - highly recommend.",5,2016,10,29
125,"Had a bad check in but the rest of the stay was amazing. Great room, view, breakfast and management","We had a bad start because our check in experience was frustrating as our room was not ready when we requested an early check in. Following this the manager arranged to meet us and wanted to personally apologise, fix our issue and see where the hotel can improve. Daniele, the manager was very helpful and handled the situation professionally. He was pleasant and totally changed our experience at this hotel! Great hotel and location! Great breakfast, and great restaurant in the hotel Asia de Cuba. Hotel was quiet too so we could sleep in.",4,2016,10,29
125,Excellent stay at St Martins Lane,"We booked the hotel for my sisters birthday, as it is very central. We arrived at hotel a little past 3 and our rooms were not ready. We were given two free drinks vouchers while we waited. So we went to 'The Den' which is a small lounge like place. Really cool atmosphere, comfortable seats. People were having afternoon tea, we had a beer each and it was fine. The two people serving were very friendly and polite. 

When we got up to the room, it was spotless. We had a twin room, and it was two double beds, which was lovely. Room was really cool, could change the colour of the lighting. Massive mirror in the room, plug sockets right next to the bed for phone charging! Bathroom was good too, shower was powerful. Couldn't hear any noises from the other rooms which was nice. They left a bottle of prosecco and a dessert in honour of my sisters birthday, which was lovely. I had only written a small note on the booking, so wasn't actually expecting anything. 

We went to the blindspot bar and used our drinks vouchers for 2 cocktails, which were amazing. Then we went out for the night, walked to the theatre and a few bars and walked home again. Great that this hotel is so central.

I would stay here again, already planning our trip for next year. My only criticism is that the bars, hallway, rooms are all a little dark. This adds to the atmosphere and didn't bother us at all, in fact i quite liked it.  But may bother other people, some people were using the lights on their phones to read the menu in the bar!

125,Two business days @ St Martin's Lane,"Nice hotel, attentive service, very good location within London. Spacy room on a quiet courtyard. Very good breakfast (both in restaurant and in room). Efficient desk and very helpful concierge. Very nice stay.",5,2016,10,28
125,Wonderful - Again!,"Our second stay here and we were certainly not disappointed. Great staff throughout the hotel make you feel welcome and at home. We visited this time with our son and both rooms were excellent and spotlessly clean as you would expect, equipped with everything you need. I find the beds extremely comfortable and the rooms very quiet.
Location is brilliant. From St Martin's Lane you can walk to so many places with ease and tubes stations are aplenty if you need them.
We ate in Aisa De Cuba on the first night of our stay and found the food to be really good - and the waitress looking after us was so lovely. They fitted us in at short notice and yet nothing was too much trouble.
Breakfasts are served until 11.30am which I really like as it allows you to relax in the morning should you choose to do so. They are now serving a buffet style on the weekend but you can also choose from their weekday breakfast menu which I prefer as it gives more veggie options. Food was consistently to a high standard and great service again.
All in all a great stay and a hotel we would highly recommend. We'll definitely look to book here again when next in London.",5,2016,10,27
125,Location location ,"Close to trafalgar and national galery in the heart of theater heaven, close to pubs restaurants and fun fun fun civents garden and leicster sq. Great service and clean rooms. On the smaller side but includes all amenities and comforts of 5 star hotel.....the minimalsm in decor is a bit too much. ...but not taking from quality. 
I reccommend!!!
.",5,2016,10,27
125,"Good, but not excellent","Location is the main attraction, being situated only yards from Trafalgar square. Stayed for two nights in middle October in superior room with garden space. Room was large with walk-in shower in bathroom and excellent large and comfortable bed, spotlessly clean, shame no bedside tables. The few niggles we had were with breakfast on second day taking nearly 30 minutes for a fried egg to appear after finishing the rest of the good self service buffet, secondly no draught beer only Japanese bottled beer at ¬£5+ a bottle.
As mentioned in other reviews the music is too loud in reception. Staff were friendly and efficient especially the doormen. Would stay again only if getting a good deal.",4,2016,10,24
125,Great vibe and stylish ,Overnight stay in London. Outstanding staff who make you feel like a friend. Blind Spot bar live DJ and cocktails with punch. Spacious and modern. Asia de Cuba restaurant was great atmosphere but second course was 40 minutes to wait but they said sorry and didn't charge. Room could have done with Bluetooth music device to keep the mood. Would definitely go back. ,4,2016,10,23
125,Visiting family ,"Central enough hotel.
Rooms pokey !! Beds like concrete! 
Washroom tight ! 
Doors didn't work! 
To top it 15% service charge !! 
And some other charge !! 
Can't remember as I crossed them out .
So only one drink!! 
Plus they ran out of pale ale !!!
It's ok but not 5 * perhaps a 3 * 
Also noisy !! By the road !! 
",3,2016,10,23
125,Good hotel,"Hotel super-central in London, quite expensive.
Room are very nice, good design, mine was also with an internal little garden.
Gym not available but you can use the next door one, super nice and trendy.
Nice cocktail bar

I don't rate 5 just for the breakfast, which is average continental breakfast, ok but not at the level for this hotel
",4,2016,10,21
125,Still a favourite,"Understated, comfortable, great location and excellent staff - what more could you ask. My home away from home in London. Comfortable beds and quality sleep - that is what you want on a business trip!",5,2016,10,21
125,5 Stars!,"Great hotel! Only stayed here for a short break but I'm sure it will be more than comfortable for a long stay too!

Rooms are clean, modern and a great size. The bathroom and toiletries are luxurious and the location is fantastic. Lobby and downstairs bar is also very good. Couldn't ask for anything better!",5,2016,10,18
125,Great location with friendly staff,"Stayed for birthday weekend. We were made feel very welcome the moment we arrived. We were given complimentary cocktail vouchers and later a bottle of prosecco was delivered to each room. Rooms are minimalistic but very clean and spacious with comfortable beds. The Den was unusual and comfortable but a little more light would be helpful, it was difficult to read the menus. The hotel is brilliantly situated, easy to walk to Soho, Covent Garden and the West End theatres and bars. Trafalgar Square is two minutes walk away.",4,2016,10,18
125,Never lets us down!,"I have lost count of the amount of times my wife and i have stayed at this fabulous hotel and even though Asia De Cuba, the inhouse restaurant is still one of my favourites, the hotel now has Fumo just a couple of doors away which is an awesome tapas style Italian restaurant...Even more reasons for staying at SML hotel, not that we needed any :) #discflipper",5,2016,10,18
125,"Wonderful service, great location","The first time I stayed here, I thought it was working a little too hard at being ""cool"". Now, after several visits, I've come to appreciate this place for what it is.
It's fairly small. Staying here is not an impersonal experience. People remember you from visit to visit. That doesn't happen at, say, a Hyatt.
They will go to great lengths to make you happy. Like not only getting a reservation at a popular restaurant, but changing it twice because your associates can't tell time. Bringing fresh fruit to your room. 
The restaurant (Asia de Cuba) is NOT a typical hotel restaurant. The food is exceptional, in a town not known for its food. The staff apparently has little turnover, I've seen the same people here for years. That says a lot.
And the location! 5 minutes to walk to Big Ben, or Covent Garden. The Thames is right here. So is the Tube. You can walk to some of the best museums in the world. You are in the middle of one of the oldest theatre districts in the western world.
St. Martins is not the cheapest hotel in town, but it's a great value.",5,2016,10,18
125,Avant-garde hotel in the London Theatre District,"Hotel has an artsy feel, great staff that made us feel like we were special guests during our week-long stay.  We loved our breakfast server, Agnes!  Our concierges were also wonderful---Biken and Mike.  Housekeeping was accommodating to our schedule, and they were very prompt with the daily laundry we left for them.  All in all a fantastic experience.  The location of the hotel was also very good---we saw 4 plays, and we were able to walk to every one of them.",5,2016,10,17
125,Comfortable and perfectly situated,"We stayed in Saint Martin Lane hotel in October 2016 and it was a very nice experience. Superior rooms are spacious and cozy, with convenient bed and full equipped bathroom, including a huge bathtub. Hotel situation is great, close to Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square, with lots of restaurants and pubs around.",4,2016,10,17
125,Right in the Heart of the Action,I was there with a group but when I checked the price of the rooms I knew what we were paying for. Breakfast was excellent and the location can't be beat. You can walk to Leicester Square for half price tickets which you need after paying for your room. That isn't fair- London is expensive and the hotel is very nice.,5,2016,10,16
125,Beautiful ideal central location ,"We have just stayed at the ST Martins Lane hotel and could not fault it ! On arrival we were accommodated with early check in and had a comfortable room with excellent facilities. 

The breakfast was delicious and the 'blind spot' bar was a pleasant experience with good cocktails and music. 

I found the hotel location perfect for shopping, eating and casino play ! 
I would recommend The Ivy and Harrods steak bar for lunch or dinner both were outstanding. We came as a couple and my husband went to Ruffians barbers where he had a wet shave and hair cut mean while I went to the BLOW for hair both within walking distance of the hotel. 

We will defiantly be back to this hotel and Covent Garden before the year is up !! Outstanding and highly recommended. üòÑ",5,2016,10,16
125,What an absolute treat !!,"My family and I had the best London trip ever by staying here.

Best features:

- location, location, location ! You couldn't be more central 
- relatively newly refurbished, Philip Stark design
- amongst the best staff on the London scene 
- we had corner rooms looking inside: facing South - amazing !!! Big rooms, the perfect balance of high tech (not too little and not too much), enormous bathroom, everything you need and could wish for
- cool foyer: please visit the lounge area to the right at the entrance and notice all the quirkiness of the room and it's pictures !!!
- fab restaurant, perfect for all occasions: breakfast, lunch and dinner
- super cool bar: you'll be spoiled beyond belief.

From now on, this will be my one and only hotel choice in London, no matter the occasion:
Business, family, love or ... solo (!)

Enjoy it all - can't wait to go back myself !",5,2016,10,15
125,St Martins lane,"Great central position for enjoying the city. Hotel has the wow factor with  the staff being both relaxed and professional. Wifi fastest I've experienced in a hotel. Room impeccably presented. Mini bar costs consistent with experience. Didn't have chance to eat in but would go back to try. Worth pointing out that the bathroom floods very easily due to design. Brings a whole new meaning to 'wet room'. Overall, 5 stars",5,2016,10,11
125,Lovely Hotel,"Love this hotel, the location is accessible to any place.There are a lot of restaurants beside it.The interior decor is superb. Room was modern style and each corners is very functional. We had a great time",5,2016,10,11
125,The best afternoon tea experience!,"We had the best afternoon tea experience in London. This was made possible by the excellent customer care delivered by Kinga. She made us feel welcomed and was proactive, checking for any dietary requirement and ensured we receive the best service at our table. I recommend afternoon tea at st Martins Hotel!",5,2016,10,09
125,Afternoon tea,"We came here for afternoon tea for a hen party. Service was extremely good from the moment we walked in. 
We had pre ordered afternoon tea with prosecco. The savoury food was delicious and the desserts were totally amazing. Tea and coffee were freely flowing and we were regularly offered more. There was a lot of food so if you decide to go, go in hungry!! Thank you for a lovely visit, would definitely recommend ",5,2016,10,09
125,"Clean, comfy & chic","Located a stone's throw from Leicester and Trafalgar Squares, and in the heart of the West End, this hotel is a gem.  Beautiful again after its renovation, it is still chic, stylish and modern, with lovely staff who go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible.
The bedrooms are delightful, especially with the ambient lighting and gorgeous light fixtures.",5,2016,10,08
125,Treated Like Royalty!,"My 1st visit to London couldn't have been any better without the delightful staff from the St. Martins Lane Hotel. Upon the arrival of myself and my friend, from New York, Sabine and Isabel welcomed and accommodated us with much warmth. Ricardo and Charlie were swift to assist us with our luggage, making us feel comfortable before even entering our room. The concierge staff, Biken, Giacomo, and Mike were absolute dolls! They went above and beyond to make sure we didn't miss an event. Joey, the concierge staff at the Sanderson Hotel, was another amazing employee, and was just all around extremely genial. Saving the best for last, Magda, the assistant manager at Asia de Cuba, was the ultimate sweetheart. Her exceptional service made us feel like we were dining as royal queens. Her smile and hospitality truly made us feel like family. 

The St. Martins Lane Hotel and its sister hotels have my highest recommendations!!!",5,2016,10,04
125,A great hotel in a lovely part of London,"We had a very enjoyable stay in St. Martins Lane. The area is quite pretty with Covent Garden just around the corner, a perfect and very central hotel for all sight seeing. The staff in the hotel and restaurant were very helpful and friendly, the service was great. It was our anniversary during our stay and a bottle of Prosecco was left in our room with a nice little note.
Although the rooms are small, they are well designed, beds comfortable and quiet. The lounge is a fun place to enjoy a cocktail or two. We would definitely recommend 
St. Martins Lane.
Thank you for a lovely stay!
Robin & Katie Jeffries",5,2016,10,04
125,"great location, great gym","This is my go-to hotel for business trips. The gym next door is outstanding if you are serious about work outs. The hallways could do with some updating (musty) but the rooms and amenities are great, very clean. Easy access to anywhere in London by Tube. ",4,2016,10,04
125,4 day London trip,"I went to London to see the sights and to see the Colts play at Wembley Stadium.  It was one of the best trips I have ever had.  The St. Martins Lane London Hotel is so centrally located that you can walk to almost anything you want: Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben, The London Eye, Trafalgar SQ and Piccadilly Circus.",5,2016,10,04
125,"Fabulous location, great customer service","We recently stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel and were very impressed. The Hotel is in an extremely good location for shopping, sight seeing or even a business stay.
It couldn't be in a better location, right in the heart of things and surrounded by tube stations, restaurants, bars, shows and shops.
The reception staff are excellent, being friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. They will point you in the right direction to enable you to find where ever or what ever it is you are looking for. Will give you public transport advice and get you a cab should you need one.
Our room was enormous, furnished with a six seater sofa, large table with two chairs, a huge bed, gigantic footstool and large flat screen TV. The bathroom incorporates a lovely double ended bath, great power shower cubicle and separate toilet with luxurious toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bubble bath and moisturiser) not to mention  the largest most sumptuous fluffy towels to suit every size. There are bath robes available, naturally a hairdryer, slippers and even an umbrella, should the weather be inclement. Extra toiletries are available, which are not free, in case you have forgotten your razor etc.
Breakfast is a choice of 1 cooked breakfast each, of which the choice is ample. Full English of course or smashed avocado, scrambled eggs on toast, salmon etc. There is an impressive continental breakfast which is in addition to or instead of your cooked breakfast and includes a multitude of breads, toasts, pastries, jams, marmalades, fruits and cereal. The coffee, teas and fruit juices available are of good quality as is the produce in the cooked and continental breakfast. The staff are eager to fulfil every dietary requirement and are very attentive and accommodating.
The rooms and hotel are extremely clean and it is very difficult to find any fault of this Hotel or indeed their staff.
 The left luggage facility is well organised and again the staff are extremely accommodating. The mini bar is well stocked with a multitude of drinks and nibbles available, the room service is excellent, but as most hotels a little pricey.
My only very small and extremely irrelevant quibble is that I could find no tea and coffee facilities in the room, naturally one could order refreshment and a multitude of meals from room service. 
I would definitely stay here again and wish I had stayed more than one night
I will be making a return visit if not several.",5,2016,10,04
125,Solid choice,Stayed in a queen bed which was comfortable with good pillows.  Excellent shower pressure and good bath products with quality towels.  On the downside asked housekeeping for an extra towel and pillow but did not receive.  Turndown the first night had some nice delicacies but only on the first night.  For what you pay here I would recommend more than first night.  Cuba was good for breakfast.  Front desk service was very good.  Hotel is in a very convenient location.  Overall a good 4* stay.  ,4,2016,10,03
125,Lovely afternoon tea ,Booked their afternoon tea for our first wedding anniversary and also received free glass of prosecco. It was perfect and much better than I'd expected it to bed. Comfortable and relaxing too. Food was delicious probably the best afternoon tea I've had. Would definitely recommend and shall definitely be booking to go here again. ,5,2016,10,03
125,Beautiful hotel......but noisy!,"I am sitting in my bed having not actually left the hotel yet but wanted to write my review while I have the time. I booked in yesterday last minute for an overnight stay as I was going to the theatre. I booked a double double for myself and my daughter as a treat as we have stayed here before and she loved it.  At check-in we were upgraded to a double double loft room which was lovely and a very nice surprise. Thank you St Martin's. The room is huge for a London hotel. Pleasant views over the roof tops and the BT tower. However, all I can hear behind my head is the rumbling and clunking of the elevators. It has been constant from when I got into bed last night with a brief respite between 3-4am when it started up again.  It is a shame especially since I asked for a quiet room! Another small criticism is the lack of tea making facilities in the room. There is a card in the room saying that you can call room service and ask for one but I decided against that as it seemed like a hassle. Never mind. All in all a pleasant stay. Would I come again? Yes I would.",4,2016,10,02
125,Really looked after us,"We met friends here to celebrate my husband's 50th. We had seven rooms between us and, without exception, they were fantastic. The rooms are spotless, very stylish but just slightly quirky which was great. We ate in the restaurant and spent time - probably too long - in the bar. The staff were very helpful and the little birthday treat was a really nice touch. We had a great stay: quality service, quality rooms, quality food and drink ; all round, a fantastic trip that we hope to repeat soon.",5,2016,10,01
125,Great place to stay,"My wife and I were in London and loved this hotel.  Great location, clean and modern rooms and a wonderful staff.  The hotel was very comfortable.  We would highly recommend staying here and can't wait to return.",5,2016,10,01
125,Luxury hotel in great location,"Loved our stay here.  Stayed for 2 weeks and had experience staying in both the Superior and Deluxe rooms.  Beds were comfortable and luxurious, huge baths in both rooms.  The Deluxe room had the larger bed and way more space- nice for a couple staying in the same room.  The hotel location cannot be beat - steps away from SOHO, amazing restaurants, shows, great for tourists.  Enjoyed the free access to professional Gym right next door as well. Hotel restaurant was a bit pricey for breakfast and not quite worth it in my opinion.  Room service was pretty reasonable and the donuts (Available 24 hours) are a great late night snack.  Will definitely try to stay here again.",5,2016,09,28
125,One of the best in SOHO,"Excellent place, staff is perfect. The food is good and i will come back in this hotel, when i will be in London. the advices of the concierge was perfect. The studio room that i had, was very nice.
Thanks  ",5,2016,09,27
125,Extraordinary Service,"Hands down one of the best service I've had throughout my traveling years. Thanks to the wonderful staff who made my stay one to remember. Charlie and Ricardo welcomed me with such warmth at the front door; I knew I was off to a great start.Sabina and Isabel at the front desk were polite and made sure I was comfortable during my stay. The concierge team is to die for. Joey. Bikem, Gio, and Mike are some of the best in the game- extremely knowledgeable. Saving the best for last- Magda OH MAGDA!!!! She blew my mind away. Her service is priceless. Asia de Cuba is lucky to have her. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. My new home in London!",5,2016,09,27
125,Style over substance,"In the surface this place is amazing. However....no drinks after 11pm due to bar closure and a private party, a soggy wet bedroom carpet and a corridor that smells of cat wee...all for a bargain price of ¬£290 a night. Verdict:avoid ",2,2016,09,26
125,Amazing Stay at a Phenomenal Property!,"I just enjoyed an amazing 2 week stay at St Martins Lane!  This hotel is perfect in every way from the location to the decor to the staff.  The staff are friendly and attentive and are wonderfully accommodating.  After ordering tea from room service my first 3 mornings there, I arrived back to my room after being out for the day to find a fancy electric kettle with everything I need to make myself tea, each morning.  I had wonderful conversations with so many of the staff, too.  Everyone was very nice and happy to engage.  Mike from the concierge team was so lovely and helped arrange a car service back to the airport for me and provided me with the car's info via email so I could let the airline know.  Mike was so helpful and very lovely to talk to!  The door staff was always attentive and up for a chat as I arrived and left the hotel, each day.  On the morning I left, one of the door staff was even kind enough to walk me to an ATM at 5:15 AM so I did not have to walk alone.  The hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The rooms were also incredibly clean, which is great.  The location cannot be beat as you are right in the center of London.  It is close to good tube lines and bus routes.  Also close to theatres, restaurants, and shopping.  I spent a glorious 15 nights here and could not have had a better experience!  This is my 2nd visit to St Martins Lane (the last visit was 2 years ago, for 4 nights) and I plan on staying there, again.",5,2016,09,26
125,Luxury trendy hotel in London,"Luxurious and superb decor for chic hypsy young clientele. Highly recommended bar with delicious cocktail, great breakfast venue, well informed concierge for best restaurants booking. Great location near time square.",5,2016,09,26
125,London hotel - easy access to Trifalger Sqaure and Theater district,"I was on a 5 day business trip to London, and wanted something different than the last 3 visits.  Plus others from my team were staying at this hotel - so this was a good choice.  This a new, modern hotel - it has latest, cool feel with very clean rooms, nice bathrooms with full stand-up showers and all the modern amenities that you would expect include USB charging ports.  I liked the way the hotel smelled everytime I walked into the lobby and walked the hallway to my room.  It is right in the middle of the theater district, and Trifalger square and the nation gallery museum are less than 5 mins walk away, and the Leceister tube station 2 mins away.  Chinatown is also less than a 5 min walk away.  So lots of advantages in this location.",4,2016,09,26
125,Lunch,"We were served by the lovely Agnes from Hungary, who was both knowledgeable & charming.

The food was inspiring & such a pleasant surprise.

Atmosphere in the restaurant was mellow.

Highly recommend this oasis that harks back to old school Cuba.",5,2016,09,26
125,Swanky digs in Coventry Garden,"I spent 3 nights in September at the St. Martins Lane Hotel and it couldn't have been a better place to end our European vacation.

First thing to note is the location. You are in the middle of everything in Central London. The Leicester Square tube station is a 5 minute walk, Covent Garden shops another 5 min walk, and West End theaters within walking distance. It was ultra convenient.

The room was quite comfortable for 2 people by London standards. Huge double beds (not the camp size twin beds we endured at some hotels). The bathroom was spacious and the shower had excellent water pressure. The high end toiletries of Malin + Goetz were highly coveted by us and the cleaner made sure to stock two of each for us each day. 

Extras like the free gym clothes laundering, access to the hip Gymbox and water bottles were nice touches. All the staff we interacted with were pleasant, helpful and attentive. We one day forgot to take the do not disturb sign off the door and they were still able to clean our room in the early evening.

I would recommend dining at Asia de Cuba for dinner. We did the pre-theatre selection and it was delicious (get the ceviche and cumin dusted tuna dish). Again, super convenient to walk downstairs for dinner and then walk to the theater in time for the show. Other notable dining spots nearby are Frenchie for dinner and Bill's Covent Garden for breakfast.

We loved our stay at the St. Martins Lane. Pricey but if you're looking for a memorable experience with top notch service, you can't go wrong. I can't wait to go back!",5,2016,09,25
125,Excellent hotel,"Staff are fantastic, the room was great (we had a superior Queen), the floor to ceiling windows are lovely and the decor is modern. The room felt very clean and well looked after. The location of the hotel is perfect for The Cambridge theater. In my daughters words ""best birthday ever""",5,2016,09,25
125,Weekend Theatre Trip,"Wanted to treat my daughter to a cool funky hotel for a long awaited birthday treat.  This hotel didn't let me down was greeted by Christian on the front desk with friendliness and efficiency.  We just had a standard double which was great for a one night stay, loved the mood lighting and the fact that as a mother and daughter with long hair a proper hair dryer not fixed into a draw with a thoughtful extension lead if required, so ladies don't have the issue of thinking about packing a decent hair dryer.  It's the small things like this that make a difference.  Got back late from theatre and ordered room service which was quick in arriving and very tasty.  Would I recommend this hotel definetly and would love to return for a grown up weekend and sample the bar etc at the hotel!! Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2016,09,25
125,Fantastic hotel in a fab location,"We have just come back from a two day stay in London. This hotel is in the best location and the staff were all very polite and extremely welcoming. Will be staying here again, it made our weekend away !",5,2016,09,25
125,Birthday afternoon tea,"My husband and daughter took me for a surprise birthday treat of afternoon tea in the lovely quirky lounge. It was a wonderful experience and throughly enjoyable afternoon. The sandwiches were not your usual bulk standard bread and were delicious. The cakes looked too beautiful to eat but we gave it a go and they were the best I have ever tasted. The staff, Kinga and Yannis, were happy and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  I would recommend anyone to try this gem in St Martins Land, thank you for making my birthday so special.",5,2016,09,24
125,Great weekend in London,"It is a beautiful hotel and the rooms have been well thought out by a good designer. Rooms are spacious and modern and I would not hesitate to go back there. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is right in central London, walking distance of Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square and good shopping in Regent Street. The only comment I would make is that there are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms, you can call reception to order one but it is not the same as just making a cuppa when you want it. The corridors to the rooms were a little dark, perhaps a little more lighting",4,2016,09,22
125,Another great stay!!!,"I love this hotel. The location is perfect, the hotel is modern, the rooms are large (by London standards) I visit London every couple of months and nearly always stay here. I am always welcomed back by the lovely reception staff. On my visit last week I have an early flight and was delighted to get an 11am check in. I didn't have breakfast this time but I do recommend it,  along with great cocktails in the evening ; ).",5,2016,09,21
125,The Perfect Place for  a London getaway.,"I was traveling to London for a business trip and wanted a convenient location. 
I had never stayed @ St. Martin's Lane before, but had heard great things. 

From the arrival experience early in the morning after a long red-eye, to a sleek library room to conduce small meetings in, this hotel was perfect. 

The service was amazing, the drinks were well balanced and the GymBox next door was a nick perk to the stay.",5,2016,09,19
125,not so cool anymore,"The last time I stayed here was years ago and the experience was much better.This visit the staff were(mostly) not nice or helpful, the lobby was not inviting (no electricity sockets at all). The room was fine, comfortable and minimalist. Just didn't have a great stay",3,2016,09,19
125,birthday tea,"I went for a birthday tea celebration here yesterday. The staff were superb and bent over backwards to accommodate us, especially as I'm a vegan but hadn't forwarned them. Inesa, in particular,  was very kind, helpful and attentive. 

Thank you Inesa!",5,2016,09,19
125,"Fabulous Sunny Romance Home in London""",Just walking into this Morgan Hotel will want you stay home on vacation. Superb service hands to customer service of this beautiful place in London. A true must stay as in the heart of everything! We loved it!,5,2016,09,18
125,Fabulous afternoon tea!,"Ooh ooh - found a new place for afternoon tea. Modern edgy hotel with artwork so brilliantly funny and clever it's worth going for that alone. Full Afternoon Tea for ¬£25pp or ¬£37.00 with a glass of champagne is astonishingly good value for central london and there was so much - we had to bring loads of it home. It's served in The Den - a dimly lit, library type room. Very comfortable and only a dozen or so tables with arm chairs. Service is attentive and friendly and also very unhurried and everything we had utterly delicious. They were happy to substitute the ham savoury for an extra salmon one ( I emailed in advance) and whatever hot drink you choose is bottomless. They do some great gin cocktails. Thoroughly recommend! ",5,2016,09,18
125,Perfect location.,"The hotel reminds me of the W hotels and ""The Standard Hotel"" in LA. Ultra modern, simple and hip, but no soul. 

I guess quite ""normal"" for Central London- the rooms were simple and tiny (couldn't even open 1 suitcase up on the suitcase rack without blocking any walk way in the room. They were a bit tight on the complimentary water only providing 1 for 2 people staying there. There was no attention to any detail or didn't experience anything above and beyond during our 7 day stay. If you like to workout during your holidays, the free membership to the commercial gym next door is really handy. The customer service by the concierge and welcoming door staff was top notch. I would only recommend this place if the location was your top priority.",4,2016,09,18
125,Can't see what all the fuss is about,"We stayed at the hotel for 1 night on a Sunday. The location is very central, near Covent Garden and on a street that has 20+ different restaurants and eateries. 

The hotel itself is quite unique, with a foyer area consisting of numerous different types of chairs, some giant chess pieces and a display of about 30 different jars filled with unidentified grains of some sort. The staff dress in black jeans and t-shirts so they sort of look like bouncers working on Clapham high street on a Friday night.

We arrived a little early so we dropped our bags without any fuss and we were called an hour or 2 later to be told our room was ready.

The rooms are quite hard to describe, I want to say modern but it had a clinically feel to it, everything was white and plastic. We had a superior room which was quite small, the bed was comfortable but the pillows were poor. There was a random flower pot attached to the wall in ours! The minibar was well stocked but there was only 1 complimentary tiny bottle of water between 2 people which I thought was tight. The bathroom had a brilliant power shower but again the decor was quite ""plastically"" 

The bar / restaurant downstairs was nice although a cocktail was circa ¬£15 which was a bit punchy. Breakfast at ¬£25 seems high when I looked at the menu, but I can't comment on the quality as we didn't have it. There's tons of other places on the street that served food if you don't want to have it at the hotel.

The reason why these areas have been picked out is due to the price. Staying on a Sunday (¬£250) was about half the price of a Saturday (¬£500) which is very expensive. I know it's central London and I have no problem paying these prices for quality, but the price did not justify this at all. I'm not sure other than the location what we actually paid for that made it worthwhile. If the rooms were cheaper we would have no problem rating 4 or 5 stars.

Overall, a good hotel but for the money, I can't see what all the fuss is about.",3,2016,09,16
125,Wedding Anniversary - superb hotel.,"Stayed 1 night at the end of August. Arrived early, left bags and ventured out.

All staff were unfailing polite but particular mention to the lady on reception who at check in and checkout was so lovely! It's a small thing but being greeted with a smile sets the scene, so many hotels make the first impression a bad one - not here!

I liked being called by my Christian name, I'm not a Sir and dislike the use of the word in all walks of life, it sounds so insincere.

Room was a decent size for London, immaculately clean and great fixtures and fittings. Extremely comfortable bed and a proper power shower!

We enjoyed a nightcap in the hidden bar, excellent service.

Lovely touch retuning to the room after visiting the theatre to find a bottle of Prosecco chilling as an anniversary treat - thanks you! 

Breakfast was plentiful and of high quality, also the extended time to sit down was welcomed, no rushing in this hotel.

Sadly we only stayed one night but this hotel is 5star in every aspect. Great location but more importantly the ambiance, decor and staff make it to be first class.",5,2016,09,13
125,outstanding holiday,"Stayed in this Hotel over the weekend, wow, beautiful, outstanding.  Met by door staff so friendly and helpful.  Room out of this world.  Location central to everything/Breakfast really good well presented and well cooked.  Staff outstanding so friendly , short of feeding you themselves they could not do enough for you. The friendliness must overlap onto the guests as I have never spoken to so many people in London, everyone was happy and friendly 

I would highly recommend this hotel to stay at well done you",5,2016,09,13
125,Yet another romantic weekend,"Chose this hotel due to its central location, less than 200 metres from Covent garden. We arrived by car and the porter greeted us, took our overnight bags inside and went and parked our car. The hotel reception is modern and cool and provides a glimpse of their restaurant which was busy from a lunchtime sitting. We had opted for one of their signature garden rooms where (as the website picture shows) you have a very nice looking private walled garden at the foot of your bedroom, a very unique view in a packed London area. When we got to our room we were a little disappointed. Despite its very clean and sharp look, the garden was immediately on our left as we entered the room...the result of which is that the garden was behind the bedroom area and hidden from view, rather defeating the object and contrary to the lovely website picture. We asked to be moved and the staff were vert attentive and moved us immediately to a room that reflected our anticipated vision. It was a lovely room, good size, exceptionally clean and a great bathroom with everything that you could ask for. We decided to borrow the hotels bicycles which the front desk got ready for us and off we went. We cycled down the Mall and onto Hyde Park which was great fun. After a fun night in Covent garden we settled back in to our room and enjoyed a great nights sleep. Breakfast was a disappointment, a very below average spread of cereals, fruit, etc and when we ordered poached eggs we waited 30 minutes for them only to receive cold eggs on burnt toast....we had run out of patience to send them back so just signed out and left. All in all, a well located, cool hotel with great rooms....just be specific if you go for the garden room. Skip the breakfast and go out in to Covent Garden where you'll have plenty of good choice to enjoy.",4,2016,09,13
125,hip,"hip hotel as most morgan group hotels
ive stayed in morgan hotels in NY and Miami, and this one is no different.
i stayed in the Garden terrace room.
very lovely room with plenty of sun coming from the garden section.
bed is comfortable but wish if it was larger.
room and bath amenities are premium branded.
tv channels are nice but wish there were movies channels.
Location, location, location...

it is close to everything

theatres, cinemas, endless choice of restaurants and cafes and close to shopping areas such as covent graden market and the popular oxford street
i would rate it
8/10",4,2016,09,13
125,"Stylish, clean, comfortable","Loved this hotel, so stylish, reasonable in price and central location. The room was perfect, incredibly clean and fresh. We also loved the cocktail bar. We had breakfast there but no other meals. The restaurant was great though. Attentive staff throughout.",5,2016,09,12
125,Afternoon tea ,"Got a good deal on an afternoon tea website - the  prosecco, tea, sandwiches and cakes were delicious. The service was also good and they were attentive without being over the top. Happy to accommodate specific dietary requirements too. Would return. ",5,2016,09,11
125,Stunning corner suite,"I stayed here when travelling solo five years ago, and when my husband and I planned a trip together, I knew I had to come back. The location is supreme......a lively neighborhood central to all things: Historical landmarks, museums, theatre, great shops and eateries. We splurged....choosing between a room with private garden or a corner suite.  Given the London inclement weather, we are super happy with choosing the corner room.....spacious and the views are fantastic.  We did have to get a bit creative with fitting all of our clothes as we were continuing on from here after a week....we utilized mini bar and bathroom space and reorganized a bit.  The front desk was pleasant and the concierge is well connected and knowledgeable. I need to come back regularly! ",5,2016,09,10
125,West End Summer,"This hotel is a modern oasis located in the heart of the theatre district, around the corner from Covent Gardens and in a hotbed of great small eateries. A true gem it's a stones throw from Chinatown and Piccadilly Circus.
Our room was clean in its design with floor to ceiling windows, thoughtfully appointed with all the necessities (Never a fan of over cluttered guest rooms no such problem here)",4,2016,09,09
125,Not overly impressed,"We went for a long weekend for our hooneymoon so spashed out on a luxury 5* hotel recomended and booked by trivago.
This is not a 5* hotel I've stayed in 3* with more class. The prices are 5* but it lacks that 5* feel that you get in a proper hotel. There is nothing that Shout's at you but its the little things that makes the difference, isn't it?
Such as our toilet seat was broke, the toilet door didn't lock, and the doormen looked  and dressed like bouncers. As i say nothing major just the feeling i expected more for my money. ",3,2016,09,09
125,Wonderful afternoon tea,"A friend and I booked the afternoon tea (with free glass of Prosecco for ¬£25 each) through afternoontea.co.uk and it was fabulous. The waitress, Kinga, was very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. She explained the menu, that we could have tea, coffee or both, and when the food arrived went into great detail about each delicacy on the plate. I have to say that everything was delicious (although I couldn't finish it all) and we didn't feel at all rushed, staying well over 2 hours. A lovely experience and I would definitely return.",5,2016,09,09
125,Amazing stay,"I stayed at the Deluxe room for 5 nights. Check in was fast and efficient. The check in staff and the doorman were very friendly. The room was large with a floor to ceiling windows. It was nice and bright. The bed was very comfortable. There was a large mirror in the room. The mood lighting was awesome. The blackout curtains worked well. There was a large concealed door which separated the bathroom from the bedroom. The separate shower and the toilet cubicle had their own door too. There was plenty of space. The in-room safe was large enough to even fit my 15"" laptop. They even provided an umbrella in the room. The breakfast was really good. I could have the buffet and/or the a la carte menu as part of the room offer. The cuban benedict was really good. The concierge, Giacomo was awesome and managed to get me a table at the Mad Hatter afternoon tea on Saturday, even though it was full when I tried to book a table myself. The location was fantastic and close to Covent Gardens, Soho, etc. I would definitely come back again.",5,2016,09,09
125,Great place if you can get a good deal,"We stayed here as a secret hotel deal from Last Minute and it was excellent value for money.  The staff was friendly, the room funky and the bathroom clean.  Nice lighting touches in the bedrooms, funky decor and fast internet.  Bed was a little too soft.  The air con was quiet yet efficient.  Interesting door locking with the magnet!  Nearly got stuck in the bathroom!",5,2016,09,08
125,Superb Boutique Hotel,"I stayed recently for a friend's birthday and my first time to this particular hotel.  I am a big fan of stylish boutique hotels and this did not disappoint.  The reception is funky and the rooms are large, comfortable with some special added touches.  The cool bar hidden behind the white door with the gold hand is very quirky and a lovely place for a night cap.

I will definitely use again and recommend to friends.",4,2016,09,07
125,Great Hotel and Location Location Location!! ,"Resided here for long weekend and were very pleased with everything.
Upgraded from a deluxe room to a loft suite at a charge but loved the room and the floor to ceiling windows. Great Bed and very quiet being at rear and 5 up. Lovely big bathroom and good air con.
The location is the best we have had in London being close to everything. Theatres Bars and Restaurants all on door step. 
Nearest tube Charing X is 3 minutes walk away unfortunately lots of homeless in and around it but they don't bother you!
Trafalgar Square is 2 minutes away and main Covent Garden and Opera house a slow 5 minutes stroll.
Staff all very friendly and overall a cool laid back atmosphere throughout. Nice late speakeasy type bar with great cocktails and good sounds. Only ate breakfast which was good. You also get free access to the Gym Box next door which is a very good well set up Gym.
Also Mr Foggs Victorian Style pub is 30 seconds to the right as you walk out and great for cocktails with a bit period drama thrown in and a Harry Potter film location right next to it if that's your thing!
Would definitely return as it ticked all the boxes for us.",5,2016,09,07
125,Amazing Afternoon Tea!,"My friend and I were amazed by afternoon tea in St Martins Lane Hotel. Our waiter Kinga was very pleasant and lovely and made us enjoy our time there even more. The food was delicious and just the right amount not to eat anything else the rest of the day. All in all, we really enjoyed it and cannot wait to go again!",5,2016,09,07
125,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,What a fantastic afternoon tea. Good value for money. We had a deal that includes a free prosecco. Kinga waitress was very friendly and helpful. We could choose from any type of tea or coffee we wanted. Pastries and scones were very tasteful !!,5,2016,09,06
125,Perfect London Stay,"This was the ideal spot for a short break. The rooms were well designed, really stylish and the lighting was perfect. why other hotels don't have the beds facing the window is beyond me! For once, the bathrooms were well laid out with excellent facilities. The lobby is beautiful and the breakfast restaurant had some great attention to detail. Overall. I would say that this is my best London stay to date",5,2016,09,05
125,Rather disappointing,"My husband and I stayed here for one night last month.  On first impressions the Hotel, which is extremely expensive, looked lovely.  The Reception Hall was gleaming and there was a lovely aroma from the Scented Candles (which they also sell).Someone took our car keys and parked our car for us and at Reception we were welcomed in a friendly and very helpful manner.  We headed for our room - a very long walk along three or four rather dark corridors.  We could not see the room numbers on any of the doors so weren't at all sure whether or not we had passed our room until we suddenly realised that all the room numbers were on the floor within what we had assumed were merely lights to guide us!  At this point we were able to laugh at our mistake but we soon realised that this was just one of the more quirky things we would encounter.  On reaching our room which, for the price we were paying was a lot smaller than many City Hotels in which we have, we found that the bed was so large that it took up most of the room and there was only one chair (which was quite uncomfortable) on which to sit.  There was no tea and coffee making equipment - I thought this was virtually a standard provision in most hotels these days but and we had to ring down to ask for it!  The bathroom was spacious but, when flushed, the toilet equipment made an extremely loud BANG which was annoying at any time but which we knew would be would be even worse during the night!  We were going to see a Matinee at the Theatre and then have Dinner afterwards so would not be spending much time in the room until we went to bed but we had already realised that the Designers of the Decor in the room had really gone ""over the top"" in their attempt at ""twee luxury""!  Everything in the fridge was very over-priced, as were things like the very nice candles we had noticed in Reception - so I didn't buy one!

When we went to bed we found that the Duvet was probably the heaviest Duvet we have ever encountered!  It would have been more use in an Igloo in mid-winter!
 
We always like a cup of tea when we wake in the mornings but when my Husband started to make it he found that there were only 4 or 5 Teabags of which only 1 was a standard Breakfast Tea (which we shared) - all the others were various ""flavours"" none of which we like.

Breakfast was priced at ¬£25.00 per person for a Full English Breakfast or ¬£15.00 per person for a light Croissant and Coffee.  We avoided that and went out to find somewhere to eat.  There was, almost next door to the Hotel, a small Cafe selling a Full English Breakfast, which looked and smelt lovely, for ¬£4.50! We didn't actually want a full breakfast but it shows just how over-priced this Hotel was.  I suspect that they rely mainly on foreign visitors, of which there were many staying when we were there, than they do on local trade.

We ave stayed in many top-class Hotels in the UK and other parts of the world and have never come across a Hotel that was more intent on quirky design than on the comfort of their Guests.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to this one!",3,2016,09,03
125,Afternoon Tea,"We went for afternoon tea today. 

The 'Den' as they say on their website, is their take on a Gentlemen's club.

Personally not to my taste with it's 'modern art' twist. 

However, we were there for afternoon tea. The service was a little show. When we arrived there was no one around to show us to our table.

Once we were seated we were offered water and talked through the menu. Despite not being on the menu we were offered a glass of prosecco (my partner chose orange juice).

The range of teas (or coffee if you preferred) was unlimited.

Although, everything is delivered at once there are three savoury elements and a huge selection of 'sweet elements' - see the pics.

Which you prefer will be personal but my partner said the eclair was the best he'd ever had (and he's French!), so a conniseur of patisserie.

What surprised me was that items I would normally avoid, like the sundried foccacia with 'aubergine caviar' were delicious.

The pastry on the fruit tartlet was perfection.

At ¬£25 a head (plus service) we felt this was great value for money.

It would have got 5 stars but I didn't love the decor and personally don‚Äôt expected waiting staff to be wearing trainers in a very high end establishment.",4,2016,08,31
125,Fantastic hotel,"Loved The St Martin's hotel! 

It is super central (half a block from Trafalgar Sq., 8 min walk to Piccadilly Circus, 16 min walk to Big Ben, etc.). 

In addition to that, the front desk staff is helpful and gracious; the beds are super comfortable; there is great water pressure for showering; it is technologically adept. Very clean and modern design and decor. 

Plus there is a great little bar downstairs with excellent cocktails, and they even had a lovely jazz singer when I was having drinks down there.",5,2016,08,30
125,Weekend sister getaway,"A very lovely hotel which is  perfectly situated right in the throng of London.   The staff are very friendly and helpful and you are greeted at the road and helped with doors and luggage which is very welcome.

125,Great location in theatre land.,"Contemporary hotel. Welcoming staff and no rush to vacate rooms which was a joy. Room was unbelievably quiet in the midst of hustle and bustle of London. Beautifully styled light minimalist rooms, no clutter. Clean to a high standard. Would recommend particularly for location.",5,2016,08,29
125,st martins lane pleasure,"just a quick line to say what a wonderful stay we had at ST Martins lane hotel central location which is perfect to explore London from and something to suit everyone within walking distance. the rooms were perfect and everything worked with fantastic beds , we will be coming back.",5,2016,08,28
125,Great hote!l Great location!,"Stayed here by chance and what a great decision! Clean, modern hotel right in the middle of Covent Gardens. Staff were very helpful, the free access gym next door was excellent and the location was perfect. ",5,2016,08,26
125,The Posh Choice,"Pros: Any hotel that starts off by giving you Starbucks Via as your morning coffee choice, is off to a good start. Room was an excellent size for Central London. Very chic hotel, with an outstanding breakfast buffet, comfortable beds, plush towels and pillows, and excellent room service. Bathroom amenities were Malin + Goetz, very nice. Having a partnership with Gymbox just next door made it perfect for us as fitness enthusiasts. Literally a starbuck right across from the front entrance, and a Pret on the corner. Staff was very friendly and helpful in all respects. They have a lounge for late night drinks which was fantastic, complete with live DJ ‚Äì who was very good. 

Cons: Coffee service at breakfast could be faster. Concierge was slow to get back to us as well as to answer the phone. Hallways are very dim, which makes them feel dated ‚Äì even though they aren‚Äôt; and the elevator is entirely too hot. 

Note: Central London is a tourist hotspot, and you will encounter large crowds of both locals and visitors, which also means there are a lot of homeless people on the streets around the hotel and in the general area. 

Overall: This is the place to stay. We‚Äôll be back.",5,2016,08,25
125,Business trip to london,good room great location in london but very expensive in my opinion - in articular the mini bar is very expensive even for basic things like chocolate -Staff friendly and helpful and breakfast very good,4,2016,08,25
125,"Modern hotel, central location","We were staying here as a family of 3, looking to be close to everything. It is a very nice hotel, with great staff and very nice rooms. The rooms have a few modern touches like free wifi, nice lighting, no clutter, usb charging etc.

It is all very modern, but be warned the most basic rooms are too small for a cot. I would recommend upgrading to the king rooms. The bathrooms are great, with high pressure showers. The breakfast is a little pricey at 25 for the buffet. 

There are only two big negatives as a family. The bar fridge and cupboards are full of booze, so we had little room to store milk and food for the little one. Also, the curtains/windows do not pull shut well enough so the rooms are always full of light. This made it hard for naps/bed time to get the child to sleep.

Altogether though I would recommend the hotel.",4,2016,08,24
125,Edgy hotel in a great location,We stayed one night in a standard room and really enjoyed our stay. Quirky little details and touches abound. The room was bright and spacious with a really comfy bed. Amenities were excellent. Only slight drawback was that there is not a kettle in the room although there is a notice saying to call if you want hot water for tea/coffee. Fab location in the middle of theatre land and plenty to do and see all around this area.,4,2016,08,23
125,Fantastic - close to everything and great accomodations!,"Great location, clean and very stylish.  Staff is very nice and very helpful.  The rooms are amazing.  Highly recommend to anyone with children - PBJ for room service!    Love the shower - high water pressure!",5,2016,08,23
125,Very well situated and great fun. ,"This is a great hotel, the hotel is crisp in design with playful tilt at Cuban culture the lights and music evoke so much of the island life, you step inside the anonymous block and immediately want to Mambo your way to reception to check in. 

The standard rooms are smaller than many but if you upgrade you will not be disappointed.  We upgraded two levels and paid for just one. We took a studio room with city views, it had floor to ceiling Windows on the corner of the building so much light and views over Whitehall, Trafalgar Sq and Theatre Land. The upgrade included breakfast ¬£34 maybe (excellent btw) and a bottle of ¬£70 Champagne. For ¬£108 the room upgrade was almost free.  

Afternoon tea in The Den is a treat with g&t or champagne, we missed dinner in Asia de Cuba but it looked excellent, I only wish I had missed Breakfast at Tiffany's - dreary dialogue and no action.  Late supper in the hotel's hidden 'Blind Spot' bar / music venue was expensive small and cold - average dining at midnight. But the music was good. 

I am delighted to say I also missed the workout at gym box which did look both fun and challenging but I had seen the inside of every boutique in the west end by then and needed the rest.  

I would not normally think of a hotel with a personality but this one does and like your best mates, it's great fun. ",5,2016,08,22
125,Amazing Stay at St. Martins Lane!,"My family and I immediately fell in love with this funky, eclectic hotel as soon as we arrived! The staff was exceptional, the rooms were clean, modern and bright with fun ambient lighting, which our daughter loved!  Room service for breakfast was delivered promptly and was delicious.  The hotel is located close to several theatres and restaurants and just a block from historic Trafalgar Square.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future.",5,2016,08,22
125,Comfortable stay in a perfect location,"Even the standard room I stayed in was spacious (for London, anyway) and highly functional with a nice view over the rooftops. Very clean and modern with quirky lighting, other nice design touches, a very comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom with a nice shower. The location is fantastic, right next to Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square, a short walk from the river. All staff were friendly and helpful. Had a couple of relaxing drinks in the Blind Spot after a long day out and a fantastic late dinner in Asia de Cuba, which is worth a visit even if not staying at the hotel.",5,2016,08,22
125,Covent Garden Weekend,"Very smart, 'cool' hotel with friendly staff and light, bright room. Great position for experiencing this vibrant area. Bathrobes are on request. Concierge not easily identifiable, but apparently does exist, so just ask! I had requested a quiet room, so was on the 6th floor, and it was indeed, very quiet. Difficult to select hand shower water flow, so prepare for a soaking from the overhead one, unless you keep the button pressed and perform ablutions single handedly (or with assistance!). But, that could just have been in my room. Fabulous views from the floor to ceiling windows and very comfy beds!",5,2016,08,21
125,Fun followed by great nights sleep ,"We love this hotel and its sister hotel, The Sanderson they are both a little bit different.

The room sizes vary but the all important bed is always the same, and the bedding is crisp and white. 

Bath or shower the the water pressure is strong and the complimentary products are generous sizes and high quality.

The hotel has a great secret bar behind a little door it's dark sexy and fun.

The breakfast is very good and the poached eggs are perfect.

This area of London is my favourite lots of interesting restaurant choices and places to wander in between the eating and drinking.",5,2016,08,20
125,"Love the refurb, SML is looking gorgeous","I havent been to the SML for a few years and just love what they've done to the hotel.  We upgraded to a deluxe room and it was worth every penny.  Floor to ceiling windows, views over to trafalgar square/london eye over the rooftops.  Crisp white linens and a wonderfully comfortable bed.  Loved all the design touches in the room.  I want to go back just to have the cuban toast for breakfast again!  Great idea having the hidden bar behind the golden hand door too ... Thanks SML team, great stay :-)",5,2016,08,19
125,Perfect spot in Soho,Rooms were small but hotel had a very cool and unique feel. Morgans hotels are always reliable and this was no different. It was very well located on a quiet street in Soho which made it easy to access away from the crowds. Would definitely reccomend staying here again. Staff were great.,5,2016,08,18
125,Amazing!!!,"3rd time at St Martins Lane Hotel and the best ever! Dorota was fantastic helping me sort our room. Upgraded to studios and Prosecco and chocolates in room for my birthday. Excellent location, fab hotel and outstanding service. We will be back!!!!",5,2016,08,17

The rooms are very modern and keept very kleen and everything worked.
WiFi was free for three devices.
A computer was made available for the early chack-in for the plane.",5,2016,08,17
125,Afternoon tea in the den,Booked afternoon tea via afternoontea.co.uk with my Mum and we were not disappointed. The den is quite quirky and staff very friendly. The afternoon tea was lovely and included a complimentary glass of prosecco which we loved. Only negative is we had difficulty finding the hotel as it is not sign written (or didn't appear to be) from the outside. Another table reported similar problems. But once found the hotel we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Would recommend to others.,4,2016,08,16
125,Theatre trip to the West End,The hotel is a fantastic gem in the heart of London. The staff are absolutely excellent and nothing is too much trouble. The hotel has great rooms which are really quiet considering you are in the middle of London,5,2016,08,15
125,Too Trendy for its Own Good,"Great location makes up for a lot of this trendy hotel's shortcomings.

A great deal on Priceline turned out to be less than great when the hotel refused to give my 20-year old daughter and me a room with two beds without paying for an upgrade.  Once we haggled over the cost, we were promised to be in a room in a half hour, then an hour - and finally two hours later we were in our room.

Our nightly upgrade fee magically was waived when a maintenance worker entered the rom without knocking.

The room itself was fine - if you like twin beds and a funky door to the somewhat private bathroom.  Fine for husband and wife, not so great for a businessperson traveling with his daughter.

When I complained about this to the front desk, I never heard another word.  Management just doesn't seem to care.

The hotel is very conscious of image - including the staff attired in all black and a barely noticeable name on the outside of the hotel.  Add an exorbitantly priced breakfast and the whole package is just underwhelming.  

London has many great hotels.  This is not one of them.",3,2016,08,14
125,Trip to the Capitol ,"We booked St Martins via Secret Escapes saving 50%.

On our arrival staff were friendly and polite.  

We stayed in room 411 a Delux room, which was well appointed and very white.  It had all the amenities you would expect of this class of hotel.

Room service was good but like most hotels prices.

Breakfast was included and this was buffet style and a choice of eggs, or variety might have been nice, but it was well cooked and the sausages delicious.

We had a drink in the Den which is hidden away in a darken room behind a door, felt this was a little odd but quaint.  Staff very attentive in here.

The hotel is brilliantly located for the hustle and bustle of the best parts of London night life.  

The only reason we did not mark as excellent is the price not sure we would have chosen to stay at full price 

Would stay again if deal on ",4,2016,08,14
125,Fun funky hotel,"Fun, quirky hotel. Great central location. Fairly pricy but beautiful, clean, big rooms for London. They were unable to honor the room we requested but more than accommodated for it. Great customer service. Delicious full breakfast.",5,2016,08,14
125,Superb hotel,"Excellent location for our visit to London. Room clean and spacious. You have to request coffee and tea making facilities, if you require them.

125,Excellent Hotel! Superb customer service and the best location ,"Without any doubt the best hotel to stay when visiting London! The best location, all Covent Garden restaurants and pubs at walking distance. Quiet street and at the same time 2 blocks away from Trafalgar Sq and 4 from Piccadilly Circus. Customer service is incredible, Patrick, the Spanish bellboy and all the staff always with a smile and willing to help. The restaurant, and specially the blind spot bar are incredible. We stayed in a mid sized room, really big for European standards. Modern, clean, good amenities.  Look no further, this is the hotel to stay. ",5,2016,08,13
125,Location & room size to be recommended for London,"This hotel near the National Portrait Gallery has been recently refurbished. We chose a deluxe room & were not disappointed. The room was modern, stylish & a great size, especially for London. Likewise the bathroom was large & well-equiped. We especially liked the mood lighting above the bed, the colour of which could be changed.The lengthy sofa allowed two of us to recline to watch TV & our feet still did not touch! You do have to request the complimentary tea & coffee- making tray, but this arrived quickly.
The waitress at breakfast was very pleasant & cheery & put a smile on our faces - a good start to the morning. The buffet breakfast itself was a little disappointing with an uninspiring selection of  cold meats & cheeses that were past their best & the filter coffee tasted as if it was from a machine. However, we noted that the restaurant was very popular both lunch-time & evening.",4,2016,08,13
125,"Excellent staff, superb location","My teenage sister, awesome mother and a twenty-something-year myself stayed at St Martin's Lane for our annual girls' weekend away. Upon check-in, we were informed that the room wasn't ready and that ""they were so sorry."" Prejudice as I was, I expected the standard superficial apology and was annoyed that we would be late to explore London. Boy, was I wrong! The lovely Belle, who checked us in, was anything but standard. After informing us that there was going to a bit of a wait for our room to be cleared, she gave us complimentary full breakfast throughout our stay, and offered us late check-out, as a compensation for the room not being ready. Then she walked us to their fascinating bar (you'll understand 'fascinating' when you visit it and study their art) and gave us complimentary drinks of our own choice - the menu being quite extensive, my mother enjoyed (good) champagne, teenage sister an appropriate teenage drink, and myself a cup of tea to make our wait more enjoyable. The cherry on top landed when we returned to our room that evening, and found a bottle of champagne on ice in our room, and a kickass card from Belle, again apologizing for our delayed check-in. 

The breakfast was tended to by other amazing staff (but some also not so invested in their jobs, it seemed, to be honest), but Sofia, in particular, was so attentive and had the best spirit any boss (and customers!) can dream of! My mother had caught a cold, and when Sofia heard her hoarse voice, she made her a whole pot of tea with freshly grated ginger, honey, lemon and a lot of love. The cold cleared up instantly ;-) Gems like Belle and Sofia are the reason hotels do well, and customers return and advice others to stay there. If it hadn't been for them, I suppose this review would look a little different. Belle checked in with us whenever we saw each other, and just made us feel so welcome. If there was anything at all I'd point my finger at, it would be that the room was set up for two people, and not three as our booking was made for; two pillows, two duvets, two sets of towels, etc‚Ä¶ Obviously housekeeping fixed that in a heartbeat, though. Superb location, superb staff - your nose would be pointing really high if you didn't have good time there.",5,2016,08,12
125,Uber Trendy but lacks warmth,"This hotel is located perfectly, it is extremely trendy and fashionable and it is clean and efficient.   We stayed in room 1014 which was a first floor garden deluxe (that we didn't actually book), anyway, where it falls down is as follows:

-  No Tea/Coffee facilities in room, you have to ask for these, which just seems odd!!  I cannot for the life of me see one reason for why this is....we asked for the facilities when we arrived but we were told that they had run out and to call down in the morning which we did and they actually were delivered swiftly but it just seemed like extra work that was unnecessary 

- There are a few gadgets in the room but no instructions anywhere on how to use them.  There were blinds against the window but we couldn't find out how to open or close them.  I couldn't find a remote control or a switch and I'd like to think i was technically savvy.  Perhaps the blinds are not meant to be moved, I have no idea but we couldn't look out of our window which just seemed strange.  

- You feel like you are staying in a supermarket.  Everything is around you such as Moisturisers, Shampoos, Conditioners etc but it seems everything costs extra if you use it.   The only things complimentary we were told were the 3 small containers in the shower but there are items everywhere in the room.  You can even buy the alarm clock which I know for some will be quirky but I think it cheapens a 5 star experience.

- For some reason we felt neglected, we had booked a high up deluxe room but instead received a ground floor garden room.  Not being smokers this seemed a bit pointless.  When we raised this we were told that the hotel was full that day.  No apologies.  The reception area was busy so they then moved on to other guests but it just seemed that there was a lack of warmth or one on one attention.  I wasn't looking for a fanfare and I am a very laid back person but it just seemed a bit dismissive when you had received something you hadn't booked. 
 
- On the morning of departure we had at least 5 people knock on our door to see if we had left, this started as early as 9am.  Surely a sophisticated hotel of this kind has some kind of system that tells them when someone has checked out!!!  It just got comical after the 3rd time.

Breakfast wasn't included in our ¬£260 per night stay, this would have been an extra ¬£50 so I cannot give my review for breakfast at this hotel.  

I am lucky enough to travel the World and stay in some nice 5 star hotels and resorts and this is somewhere near the middle i am afraid.   It was clean and it was tidy, the service was friendly and things like ""check in"" were efficient but it is one of those hotels were you feel as if you are just bedding down rather than an actual ""guest"" and that is the massive difference between this and many 5 star hotels.  My impression is that it used to get around this by being current and fashionable, quirky and contemporary.  Unfortunately 15 years ago that was the case but now many of the features are common place in 3 and 4 star hotels, the lighting, the glass panels, rain showers etc.   It reminds me of the famous sporting phrase ""form is temporary, class is permanent""",3,2016,08,12
125,Fab hotel let down by reception....,"We had a great time here, made us feel 20 years younger..... we booked a garden room, which we really didn't make use of. Reception don't take the customer serious and really didn't care, which is very different to all the other staff we met. The bedrooms are very modern, but cool, breakfast is fantastic and the secret bar offer some great cocktails. love the smell around the hotel, we will be back but they need to improve the service on reception!",4,2016,08,11
125,Minimalist heaven,"Fantastic. Minimal. Clean. Great hotel from the Morgans group. location is spot on, cant fault it, just stayed one night, got a lack check out till 2pm, probably could have gone for 3pm as he asked how long id need the room...Sat in my bed eating a 5guys with cajun fries watching day time tv with the multi coloured lights flashing and the curtains closed. could not have been happier.
asked for more toiletries as we both showered twice in that day, they came back with doubles and dental kits and extra towels in case. DREAMS

THEY GIVE YOU AN IRON AND AN IRONING BOARD!!! not many good hotels do that anymore so thats a big plus! shower was urmayzing.
its expensive but so trendy and so worth it. would stay again.

robes are lush too",5,2016,08,11
125,Loft Junior suite,"Simply the best hotel stay I have experienced.

As soon as I informed the hotel that we were staying as a honeymoon trip, I was contacted by Belle (guest experience manager).
Belle ensured that our room was perfect, and arranged a really nice surprise for my wife. I can't thank her enough for that.
The hotel itself is in an incredible location. Right on the door step to Leicester Square, charring Cross and all the theaters.
The room was immaculate. Bright, clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. 
We we're lucky enough to stay in a loft junior suite. I'd highly recommend spending a little extra for one of these rooms. The view was brilliant with sights of the eye, Nelson's Column and over towards the Gherkin. It was such a nice room, you could quite easily spend all day relaxing in there.
All the staff were very polite and accommodating. When ever we phoned to request anything from reception, it was brought to us in no time. Housekeeping must work very hard as the room was spotless. We even noticed they had been in tidying up whilst we were out in the evening. We also enjoyed the choice at breakfast, which we had brought to our room for a small tray charge.
The whole feel of the hotel was great. I have stayed in 5star hotels before and not enjoyed the atmosphere. But with St Martins Lane; it felt friendly, vibrant and really chilled out. Exactly what we wanted from our stay.",5,2016,08,11
125,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"Receptionist very helpful and friendly. Requested tea & coffee facilities which came within a couple of minutes. No loud air condition units or over bright night lights like in some hotels. Full breakfast excellent, especially the fieldfare vegetarian option. Not cheap but worth paying a little more than many mediocre London hotels. Would have got 5 stars but didn't like the cocktail bar as loud bland music made talking really hard. Otherwise perfect.",4,2016,08,11
125,Genuine and Real Hospitality in an Ideal Spot.,"Being involved in the hospitality industry in the middle east, I know plenty about hospitality and what is expected. The thing is about St.Martins Lane is that the level of hospitality was, well, different. Allow me to explain...

Booking a last minute 'secret' hotel, is a risk and to be honest, without that option, we would not have discovered this little gem. Once booked, we were excited about to see the location and quirks of this place. Upon check in, we were amazed as we struck up a chat with all the staff. The concierge, door staff, waitresses and the check-in staff. Aga at check in had a genuine interest in us and our stay. We divulged that it was an anniversary stay and that we had left our new baby with the in-laws for the first time. Reassuring us, she kindly upgraded our room.

The corner room had some amazing quirks from the seriously funky lighting, rum body wash, leopard print carpet, pot plants and bell lamps. The quirkiness had a clean, crisp and warm feel. We almost decided to stay in for the night.

When we returned later that evening, we discovered a bottle of champagne with a beautifully handwritten note from Aga and the front desk team wishing us a happy anniversary and again reassuring us that we were in good hands and that our son would be fine. An amazing sentiment that was so personal and genuine. 

And that's the thing, the whole experience was genuine and not staged or trained. There was no fake welcomes, no 'Sir, Madam."" It was real, relaxed and honest.

I never stay loyal to hotels and usually skip from major chain hotel to another. Now i have found a hotel that I will visit again and again. The perfect place for a genuine, easy London stay.

Thank you St.Martins Lane. You made an occasion into an experience and I vow to return.

Ryan and Suzanna, Abu Dhabi.",5,2016,08,10
125,Lorraine & Greg,"Ensure you request Tea & coffee making facilities upon arrival and also request extra tea, coffee & milk.  Apart from this little tweak everything was excellent.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but had drinks and cocktails in the Den which was great.  Breakfast was also very nice",5,2016,08,09
125,Amazing weekend at St Martins Lane,"Everything was just perfect, from the moment we checked in and the nice receptionist took us to our amazing room till the moment the doorman walked all the way down the street to get us a taxi which brought us back to the train station and back to reality. Thank you amazing staff of St Martins Lane to make us 9th wedding anniversary great and special thanks to Joey and his team for the excellent restaurant recommendations.",5,2016,08,09
125,A fabulous evening ....,"Once we had found the place, the experience was great. Good service, delicious food, creative cocktails in a very central location. Not cheap but worth it. A great slant on Oriental cookery. Highly recommended!",5,2016,08,08
125,Superb Birthday Stay,"From the moment we arrived, to our Dinner in Asia da Cuba to cocktails in Blind Spot, we were made to feel special.  It was my wife's birthday, we were upgraded and complimentary bottle of 'Bubbly' awaited us in our room upon return from the Theatre.  All the staff are polite, knowlegaeable and the entire experience is of a 'Home from Home'  The St Martins Lane is undoubtadly our Theatreland home from home.",5,2016,08,08
125,Saturday night at St Martins,"An excellent central London hotel - so convenient for a Saturday night out in London.  Super staff.  Clean, comfortable contemporary room.  Asia De Cuba restaurant is a must try experience for dinner and breakfast. Hotel and restaurant definitely recommended and would return.",5,2016,08,08
125,Superb,"Wow. Wow. Wow!! Simply amazing! No other hotel we have stayed at before quite compares to this beauty! Hotel room was spotless, bright, and of a good size. Loved the mood lighting above the bed- nice addition to the room and certainly added to the 'holiday feel'.

Room service was twice a day, so nothing was missed. Plus access to the GymBox was appreciated too. 

One downside is that the bar, the Blind Spot (I think that's what it's called) was shut when we were there so we had to find somewhere else to go, however the staff were happy to make recommendations of other good places. 

Location is great and within easy reach of all the main attractions. We walked everywhere during our stay here, and always managed to get to places without walking for ridiculously long times.

Would 100% recommend a night here as it's amazing. Price of the hotel definitely reflects on its quality. ",5,2016,08,07
125,Love Love Love,"What a fantastic hotel, one of the best in London. Been here 2/3 times now and each time it has been classy, modern and sophisticated. It is gracefully understated from the front and does not try to attract to much attention. The interior is EXTREMELY modern and so are the bedrooms. The room sizes are extremely generous! It may cost you to stay here but it is worth every penny!",5,2016,08,07
125,Perfect Location,"The hotel is in the most convenient location with so many attractions in easy walking distance but amazingly quiet to sleep, which is something I have a problem with in the city. The staff were friendly,efficient and attentive.  Asia de Cuba is a must and I'm already  planning a return stay and a birthday party there next month. ",5,2016,08,07
125,Good overall ,"Modern, clean, rooms a little on the small side but well designed. Fancy pants nightclub in a backroom which you have to be accompanied to through a hidden door, where you sit in the dark in uncomfortable chairs watching other people trying to be cool....2 drinks set us back 30 quid which is way OTT even for London. Location great and compared to others in this area seemed a good deal. Overall satisfied with our visit. ",4,2016,08,07
125,Lovely elegant spacious hotel,"The rooms are decorated to a very high standard, they are refreshing, yet warm and inviting.  Extensive mini bar, beautiful shower room.  The floor to ceiling windows added to the elegance of this hotel.  would definitely go back.  Only downside vegetarians were not really catered for at breakfast.",5,2016,08,07
125,Great hotel ,"I've stayed here twice recently in a Deluxe Garden Room. One of the rooms was better then the other I terms of layout but the courtyard was the reason I booked on both occasions. Ultra modern rooms, mood lighting and what I would call sex packs available to purchase from the very well stocked, albeit expensive minibar. Comfortable beds and great showers. Separate toilet. Great bars too. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again",5,2016,08,04
125,"Absolutely spot on for location, rooms and service","Got a deal from secret escapes, having never heard of the hotel before, but great choice, lovely newly refurbished rooms, and quirky colours and design. Very comfortable room, good bed, and good size bathroom. In the absolute middle of everything, and has become our hotel of choice when staying in london",5,2016,08,04
125,Beautiful - A cut abkve,"Stayed here instead of the usual hotel for work. Will be back. 

Everything was spot on. From the relaxed atmosphere in reception, the subdued lighting in the corridors through to the gorgeous bright and modern rooms and the secret bar! 

Amazing hotel and not ridiculously expensive too for 5 star quality. ",5,2016,08,04
125,Mrs,"We spent 2 nights during a family trip and from check-in to check-out and everything in between, the service was exceptional. The staff from reception to housekeeping could not do enough to help and were always one step ahead of preempting our needs. Special praise to Yvonne and the team in Asia de Cuba, the food was exquisite the service was faultless and we didn't dine anywhere else during our two night stay. If you are looking for imaginative design, comfort and quality with a team wanting to look after your every need genuinely in the heart of theatre land then look no further!",5,2016,08,04
125,Ticks all the Boxes,We stayed here for three nights and were not disappointed. From the first minute the service was top class. We had two bikes with us for RideLondon and the concierge's took them and looked after them without a second thought. The restaurant for dinner was excellent and the breakfast staff were particularly good. On Sunday morning we ordered breakfast to our room at 4.50am and it arrived at exactly 4.50am - small details make all the difference. If you want to stay here for any city center event I would definitely recommend it.,4,2016,08,04
125,"Fantastic hotel, great service, great restaurant ","Spent the night here and absolutely loved it. The staff were incredibly helpful, the room was a studio and it was brilliant, totally to my taste, clean white lines, large bed and great views, the quirky and mood lighting was a lovely touch. The bathroom was very large and very well designed. 

We went to the hotel restaurant and both the food and service were absolutely faultless. The food was really outstanding and the waiter was excellent.

The thing I liked most about this hotel was the ambience, it was very relaxed with an eclectic mix of people. I didn't feel out of place in jeans nor would I have felt out of place in a cocktail dress. This is testament to the hotel, the decor and the uber design could have made it feel full off its own self importance, however it's actually a very welcoming, warm environment, non judgemental and happy.  I really enjoyed the visit. I will be back and hopefully the Jazz players will still be playing in the ultra cool bar. Thanks so much to all. ",5,2016,08,03
125,Always fantastic. ,"I think this is maybe the 4th time we have stayed at this hotel and each time it doesn't disappoint. 
We love the location near Covent Garden. Perfect for shopping and restaurants. 
The rooms are very modern with mood lighting and beds are super comfortable. 
We stay in a Double Double room which has 2 double beds and it fits myself and my husband and 2 kids perfectly.
Breakfast great even though there are many other options on your doorstep. 
My husband loves the access to The Box gym just next door which is a fully equipped large gymnasium. 
The staff always friendly and helpful and the concierge who helps us remembers us every time. 
See you again next year! ",5,2016,08,02
125,Girls Weekend,We stayed at the hotel for a girls weekend. The location is amazing and we cannot recommend highly enough the concierges Diego and Mike who both gave us recommendations of amazing cocktail bars and fabulous places to eat. Their amazing knowledge made our weekend. We can't wait to come again üòÉ,5,2016,08,01
125,"Great hotel, fabulous concierge! Ask for Biken!","Bikin literally changed our trip for the better! My daughter had an allergic reaction during our second night at the hotel. I went downstairs to ask about allergy medicine and quickly found that the local pharmacy was about to close. Bikin gave me directions to the pharmacy but could see from the look on my face that I wasn't likely to find it in time so he literally took me by the hand and ran with me so that I could get the medicine she needed. Not only that but the next day he reviewed our itinerary and made several suggestions that absolutely improved our trip. The man is amazing! Everyone at the hotel was terrific. The rooms were clean and pretty. The location is fantastic. I highly recommend this place! Also, I can be a bit of a fussy traveler and I've never given an excellent rating before so you can trust that this hotel is THE place to stay in London!",5,2016,08,01
125,Lovely hotel in excellent location,"The service in this hotel is impeccable.  I mention it was our anniversary and there was a bottle of Prosecco left in the room with a note.  The standard rooms are small, but beautiful and very comfy.   Breakfast lovely and great location, overall we were made to feel very welcome.  Only slight complaint was the tea and coffee making facilities we requested only had green tea as a choice!",4,2016,07,30
125,11 OUT OF 10!,"Wow. From the moment we booked this hotel earlier in the year and the emails from the concierge team started to arrive, we knew it was going to be a special stay and upon checking in, this place blew us away. We stopped in for one night while in transit between countries during our honeymoon and Belle and her team made us feel so spoiled and lucky with a fantastic room and a champagne delivery at 5pm! 

Everything at this place is amazing. The lifts, the rooms, the service, the decor - it really is the trendiest place we have ever stayed. The location is perfect for exploring the West End and close to Leicester Square tube. 

We booked a very last minute dinner at Asia De Cuba downstairs and the staff made it one of the most memorable dinners we've ever had! The breakfast is fantastic, the gym use is fantastic; everything is fantastic - I cannot fault this place. I would recommend this hotel to EVERYONE! 

I only wish we could have stayed for longer!!!! ",5,2016,07,30

125,Trend-Lovers' Paradise,"Stayed for almost a week with our two teenagers on a London Holiday. Ideally located a stone throw from both Covent Garden and Leicester Square, this hotel is packed with modern chic and vibe, from the ultra-modern reception and lobby to the all-white room interiors and the exterior fluorescent colourful illumination.  
The staff are all extra friendly, professional and seem to genuinely care about your satisfaction, which is not to be taken for granted. 
We found the room we booked online to be too small for us, and switched to have two adjacent rooms with a joined door, which was just perfect for us. All rooms were spotless clean and fully equipped with modern amenities (USB wall outlets - hurray!) and trendy bath supplies.
The concierge (Mike) was extremely helpful during our entire stay and always remembered our preferences and taste :)
With an abundance of dining options around, and kids of conservative (but evolving...) taste, we did not try the hotel restaurant, but with the crowds coming in from outside it looks like an option to go for next time around.
And that will surely come. We have St. Martins Lane on our shortlist now, for business as well as leisure!",5,2016,07,27

Exceptional service by everyone at the hotel; you really get the sense that they are there to go the extra mile to make their guests feel welcome and special.  Functional, comfortable, clean rooms.

St Martin's Lane is on my list as a go-to London hotel in the future.",5,2016,07,26
125,Wonderful boutique hotel,"We had a wonderful stay in this very nice hotel.  The location can't be beat.  It is adjacent to both Covent Garden and Soho and literally around the corner from the Leicester Square tube station and a few block walk, down a charming street, from Covent Garden.  It is near countless restaurants.  We could not have been happier with the location, though you need to look for the hotel entrance.  The street itself was not noisy, though we asked for a quiet room and got it, which blocked outside noise.

Every single aspect of the service in this place was top notch.  The desk staff was wonderful, from giving directions, providing umbrellas to dining suggestions.  The cleaning service was excellent, the people in the restaurant were more than happy to address my wife's need for ice at night, and the concierges were extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

We had booked a standard  room at a promotional price and found as soon as we walked in that it was tiny -- way too small for our needs.  So, the front desk found us a larger room at an upgrade price right away and took us to see it.   It was very spacious, so we grabbed it because there was not a huge price difference despite the double jump in room size. price.    Do yourself a favor and book the larger room.  

The room was very nice and spacious after the move.  It had a nice closet and a very modern bathroom.  The furnishings were very hip -- maybe a little too hip for us at first, but we liked it after we adjusted.  Our room had a nice desk and very good TV service.  The room could not have been cleaner and the hallways, while dark, were nicely maintained.  The internet connection in the room was fine -- it was free with our promotional rate.

We did not eat in the restaurant.  The hotel has a hidden bar off the lobby.  We did not use it, but did peek in.  It is very hip and sleek.

All in all, we were delighted with our stay, based mainly on the great location, service and condition at the hotel.",5,2016,07,25

125,Disappointed.,"I have never updated a review before - but after many stays at the St. Martin's Lane, I was really disappointed with my last stay and will likely find another hotel in London going forward. I have been staying at the hotel 2-3 times per year for the last four years, always for at least seven days at a time. There was a problem with my latest reservation in that it was made for a day earlier than I arrived. When I arrived, the reservation had been cancelled, as the hotel viewed me as a no-show for the first night, and they were able to re-instate it, but indicated I had to be charged for the first night, as the hotel was sold out so they could have rebooked the room. All that is true, and the reservation mistake was on my end, but I am surprised after being a loyal guest for so many years, and the fact that my stays are always at least a week at a time, that the hotel would focus on wanting to collect the lost GBP 250 for one night, rather than the fact that I am still spending almost GBP 1500 here this week, and would clearly come back in the future (as I have been here multiple times every year for the last four years), as well as send colleagues and team members from work. I would have thought that there would be some gesture on the part of the hotel, like a discount for the lost night, meal voucher, free drink (!), but there was really nothing to indicate that they value loyal customers. As such, I will look for another hotel in the future, and encourage others to do the same.",2,2016,07,25
125,Good location and value,"Went there on business. I was actually a bit underwhelmed by the lobby. They put too much of that flower smell and it feel due for an upgrade. I was probably trendy a few years ago, but now it's quiet.

The room was very clean and was stylish enough - a bit cold and techy, but I prefer that than classic and pompous. It is spacious ( for London) and well appointed.

Location was greatest asset for me - amazing neighboorhood, fun for discovery and going out. I will not comment on service as I had very little interaction with any of the staff - but they seemed nice.

Good value. Will come back.

The space was beautiful, with wood panels and strange pictures in the walls (ask about the stories behind them! 
Also the Hotel lobby is amazing!

I couldn¬¥t get any better, servers were amazing, an special mention to Kinga, who looked after us that afternoon, and what to say about the food...

We started with the savouries, our favourite, a focaccia with aubergine a feta cheese... afterwards, the sweets, we started with the meringues and we kept going through it... our palates were delighted with the Ludovic¬¥s Eclair, a masterpiece made with cracking praline inside... delicious!

We finished with the traditional (and massive) scone, with its usual jam and clotted cream...

Definitely a place to come back!",5,2016,07,23
125,"Amazing, but not spotless","Was there on a 3 nights / 2 days business trip. Overall, conveniently located if you gotta go to the City. Amazing location for your dinners, just at the heart of Covent Garden area.
Room was huge compared to London standards, original, clean and comfy. Overlooking the inner yard, it was also silent. 2 spots though. First, walk-in shower in the spacey bathroom: it flooded both the bathroom and the corridor. This is clearly a structural issue and should be solved. After the shower you need a cleaner. Second, quality of mattress could be better.
As for personnel, they were lovely and helpful at check-in, cleaning and room-service. Disappointed at check out, when the guy at the reception just couldn't care less about my shower complaint (and I am sure they regularly get it for that room - 400 something).
So, all in all, would stay there again for both the unique character and high room standard. But would ask upfront whether they have one in which shower doesn't end up flooding the entire room.",4,2016,07,22
125,Excellent experience,"We've been in London on a very special reason,our son's graduation  in high spirits.Hotel choice proved an excellent one.Grate (more than grate )location,modern decoration,spacious lobby a lot state of the art furniture. Rooms are a bit small but adequate . Bars and restaurant are good tasting and leave us content.Special thanks to Vicky and Sofia staff members with a very high sense of what hospitality ment.We've been in London many times before but this time seems to be the bestFor sure we'be back as soon as we can.",5,2016,07,22
125,In hotel like at home,"I went back to St. Martins Lane Hotel for just one night to feel like at home as usual. Hotel rooms are great, people are really there to help you with any wish, great food, lovely environment. During the years a lot was improved and at the moment I can only see positive points and reasons to go back. I strongly recommend St Martins Lane. Perfectly located in the hearth of London and close to so many attractions, is the place to stay for a good experience.",5,2016,07,21
125,Great weekend break in London,"Pretty close to everything, and the room was a nice peaceful respite from the busy summer streets of Covent Garden.  Location is tops and i love the elegant simplicity of the room and bathroom, beautiful and functional.",5,2016,07,19
125,"Great hotel, great stay","I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times a year on average over about a decade, so I am a regular, but not a fixture. Every time I arrive, the door staff greet me like a friend - a welcome that is invariably extended at check-in, the restaurant and the bar. The rooms are very stylish and comfortable and the location close to unbeatable. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,07,18
125,Wonderful,"Lovely hotel, very clean, modern and quiet.

Staff were excellent they honestly could not do enough for you.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Went for my 60th birthday with family and the staff brought me a couple of puddings to share with a birthday candle and all sang happy birthday without being asked.  So sweet.  Definitely recommend to everyone wanting a central (Covent Garden) hotel.",5,2016,07,18
125,Great hotel ,"My wife and I stayed overnight on Saturday. We had booked through the top secret hotels and this was the hotel allocated.  Great location and really nice facilities. 

Room size is reasonable for central London and modern furnishing and lighting creates a lovely ambiance. Bathroom  facilities very nice and bed and shower is top class. Don't miss out the hidden cocktail bar it's a nice way to start or finish the evening.  

Definitely worth a visit.",4,2016,07,17
125,Meeting Relatives,"Where to begin. Great staff, great position, different rules for different guests. BEWARE when booking on line as my deal was not the same as my relatives and friends. They had complimentary champagne, i did not. They had bigger rooms, i did not. They had breakfast included, i did not. In fact i had a saucer full of buffet and a cup of tea and it cost me ¬£23.00, which i think is outrageous. My friend stays here all the time and is now reconsidering future visits...Room 209, 14th & 15th July",4,2016,07,16
125,Ideal Location,"I've stayed here 3 times now and this hotel delivers every time. Staff are friendly and always helpful. A perfect place to stay as it is right near Leicester Square train station. It's also an ideal place to stay for work trips as it quiet, good wi fi and very clean. Close to many great restaurants and coffee shops and not too far away from great shopping.

125,Ultimate modern luzury,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night and was blown away by how stunning it was. Very modern inside and out, couldn't fault the room or the facilities. Lots of little touches which made it memorable. Perfect location for exploring the city, would recommend to anyone. Couples, families, business etc. ",5,2016,07,14
125,Birthday treat,"Had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful hotel was invited by my friend Anna and I have to say it's been the best customer service experience I be ever had in a hotel . I cannot praise O 'Ross Zso and the team of St Martins Lane London hotel enough. Helpful,attentive and very friendly . The attention to detail was second to none . I was there to celebrate my birthday and they went above and beyond to make me feel special . The staff were simply fantastic and could have not done more to make my stay perfect .

125,Great location,"Stayed here when we went to see Madame Butterfly at the Coliseum and the location could not be better. You can look out of the window at the coliseum. 

The room was ready when we checked in at 12.30 so we could freshen up.

The rooms although compact do have everything you need and the lighting is fantastic. 

The bed was really comfy and the room was quiet for such a busy location. 

The bar area was busy and had a great feel apart from the impossibly tall bar stools! 

The staff were great and very helpful regarding taxis etc. 

Overall, a nice hotel, great location and comfy beds but not totally Wow!

At this price range my preference would still be the W on Wardour Street. ",4,2016,07,10
125,Another great stay,"Used  St Martins every time we are in London and it never fails to exceed expectations, location is second to none, rooms are very comfortable & funky and the staff are all very friendly, breakfasts are excellent, it's the only place we consider now, see you next year!!",5,2016,07,09

Will return soon, and also visit the hotel for a night stay 

Thanks guys ",5,2016,07,07
125,The only place to stay,"The only hotel we will ever use in London. Situated right by Trafalgar Square in the center of London. Great welcome in spacious reception, staff happy to do anything. Large comfortable room an unexpected bonus in the center of town at a reasonable ( not cheap)! Priced. Great breakfast. Phillip Stark decor adds humour. ",5,2016,07,07
125,Tip top,"We stayed in this hotel back in April.  Found the whole experience first class.  Good friendly service throughout the, in particular front desk.  Our room was very relaxing and comfy and also had a nice little out door space which we did not expect. Great location too. All in all I would high recommend and will certainly use again when in the city.",5,2016,07,07

125,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Booking this hotel was very straightforward. Rates were competitive as well. 

On arrival, was met by friendly, polite and efficient staff.  Arrangement for valet parking was done with minimum fuss. To quench one‚Äôs thirst having bottled water on hand at reception is a nice touch. Wish to thank Isabelle for all her help in making the booking in process so smooth and hassle free. 

Allocated room was very quiet, bright, clean, spacious and minimalistic in furnishing. Great views as well. The bed was very comfortable which aided a good night sleep. Bathroom was again spacious and well appointed. 

A great location, great staff who made me feel very welcome. Thank you all ever so much. I will certainly be back again very soon.",4,2016,07,04
125,"Excellent staff, smart comfortable room","My partner and I stayed at St Martins Lane for a weekend theatre trip. The check-in staff were extremely friendly, the concierge getting involved in a chat about the production we were in town to see. Throughout our short stay we found all of the staff to be exemplary - perhaps the friendliest and least stuffy 5* we've stayed at.

The decor is contemporary, public spaces are stylish and functional too, although we didn't dine at the hotel on this occasion. The room (Deluxe Garden) was an unusual design with an almost open-plan flow between entrance, bathroom and bedroom. This diversion from a more conventional layout at first seemed like it could suffer form over function, however it worked fine for us. It might have become annoying during a longer stay. The garden was tiny - worthwhile if you're a smoker, less so if you're hoping for an oasis of nature in the West End.

Bedding was good, toiletries good, room amenities slightly below typical 5* standard (in-room tea/coffee facilities absent but available on request, no shoe polishing sponge, well stocked but run of the mill minibar). WiFi delivered the promised 10Mb for free service, 35Mb reportedly available for a fee. I made the mistake of booking through Expedia - as usual a direct booking would have been the same price but with a bunch of extras thrown in. The room rate was very competitive with similar hotels in the area.

Location is excellent for the West End and the concierge was knowledgeable on what to see and do. Like most contemporary London hotels the setup appears to be courting the business of hip young things, but while I'm not sure we fall into that demographic we felt extremely welcome. We'll stay again.",5,2016,07,04
125,Stylish Covent Garden stay,"Rooms are small but immaculate, and the location cannot be beat - close to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, the theater district, Picadilly Circus and more.  We walked everywhere we needed to be, and easy access to three different Tube lines.

The furniture in the rooms was new, the bathroom surpisingly spacious, and they offer the option of bathing your white room in a different neon color each day.  Nice touch having USB ports in the walls instead of plugs and outlets -- made it much easier to plug in if you are visiting from outside the UK and don't have adapters.

Service was good, though not exceptional.",4,2016,07,03
125,Excellent 4 day stay (second visit) - go to hotel in London,"I couldn't be happier with this hotel.  It's new, fresh, clean, modern and sleek.  Service is friendly and excellent, the facilities are good and the location is perfect.  Free wifi, free bottled water, free pass to a nice gym next door and the concierge always had excellent ideas for where to go.  I didn't eat at the restaurant, but the hidden bar and the lounge are top notch.  I recommend to my friends without reservation.",5,2016,07,03
125,Gig weekend London. ,"Usually stay at the ME hotel on the strand when in London but decided on a change. 
St martins lane is a great location and I really like the bar which I often visit even if I am
Not staying there. Rooms are as they have been for a while and are clean, modern and minimalistic. Checked in headed to acdc gig but upon our return their was a stale smell of smoke in the room. This was very unpleasant and we were moved immediately. Staff were faultless but this was inconvenient and the time meant that our Saturday night plans were curtailed somewhat. No complaints but the offer of a drink would have been a nice touch and I felt it lacked a little something. ",4,2016,07,03
125,Family work & play stay,"The vibe here is minimalist but not too austere. 
Had a warm welcome from front desk, arrived at 11am which was earlier than anticipated as our flight from Orlando was a little early and we zipped through passport checks. Very disappointed our room was not available despite requesting early check in for sleepy kids and adults from our overnight flight. Room was not ready till 1pm by which time one child was asleep.
Rooms are London small but well laid out and have surprisingly spacious bathroom. Loved the super strong shower. We had to be within 20 min walk of US embassy and this is one of the handful of hotels with two double beds in a room that meets that criteria.
Our room was super quiet despite being close to theatre and restaurants, beds were dreamy comfortable , towels were extra plush and everything was very clean no mean feat given the white on white decor. Complimentary umbrella came i handy too.
Location is amazing less than 5 minute walk to Trafalgar Sq, Leicester Sq, St James Park, Covent Garden.
Had breakfast each morning of our 3 night stay which was high quality and delicious with a good choice help yourself continental table and a range of delicious cooked items.
All staff were great and made you feel welcome, particularly the door staff.",5,2016,07,02
125,Leisure ,"
Spent one night at this hotel, check in friendly and efficient. Bottles of water on reception- a nice touch . Room spacious, bright and clean. Good quality linen and toiletries. Lovely view from the room. Lots of extras you can purchase if you have forgotten things such as razor etc. We did have a look at gym box although we did not use it this visit.. Great gym, amazing equipment and classes. 
I ate in the restaurant in the evening - brilliant food. Great atmosphere and brilliant staff. Lovely hotel which despite its size is very personal.. Staff are brilliant and friendly and little touches make this hotel well worth a visit. We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,07,02
125,Great location and excellent staff....,"We stayed at the hotel recently and I found everything about the hotel fabulous. i was greeted from my taxi with a warm welcome & escorted into reception. Great first impression! The staff at reception were friendly, polite & although our rooms weren't ready it was not a problem. The staff in the Asia de Cuba restaurant were very helpful whilst I waited for the rest of my party to arrive. We had brunch in Asia de Cuba- excellent food, excellent cocktails & great value for money. Our waitress Sofia was brilliant, so helpful, attentive & she really is a credit to your team. Wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again, set in a great location, a clean, beautiful, quirky hotel with a great team of staff working for them.",5,2016,07,02
125,Marvelous High Tea at the Den,"Though we did not stay at the hotel, we went to get High Tea at the St. Martins Hotel Den. I was absolutely spectacular. For the low price of 25 pounds, we were given 3 salty sandwiches, 5 pastries, a massive scone (with clotted cream and jam, of course), a glass of pressecco and (unlimited) teas of 7 different varieties! All of the food was absolutely delectable, the staff was attentive and had great care for detail and the den itself was intimate, elegant and comfortable! We spent about 3 hours at the den and had a grand old time. If there were to be a complaint it'd be that it was too much scrumptious) food -- though we still managed to eat it all.",5,2016,07,01
125,"Perfect location, super friendly staff...","We stayed in London for a couple of days after a long haul flight. We received a very friendly welcome, broad smiles and lots of help with luggage - very nice. We were also very impressed with the speed of room service during our stay, three minutes for towels, 15 minutes longest wait time for room service breakfasts ( yes...I said 15 minutes...) and when we requested foam pillows they were in the room in five minutes. We have become so accustomed to calling to having to chase up service in hotels, this experience was a very welcome change. The speed and quality of service was really fantastic. 

The rooms were very clean - very compact too - we had a deluxe two bed room and there was very little room for movement. However, the large windows, simple uncluttered design and white linens gave an impression of space. The beds were very comfortable and the linens were good quality. Everything felt fresh and crisp.

The small bathroom had a shower which was really powerful and a great morning wake up. There were lots of bathroom cubbies for storage (we discovered the under bed suitcase storage area just as we were leaving!)

Overall a great location, very very good staff and speedy service. I would definitely return.",4,2016,07,01
125,Best staff in lLondon,"The staff are the best most helpful staff I've ever come across . Nothing and I mean nothing is to much trouble from the door men to reception, and from breakfast to bar staff all smile and offer great hospitality. The most pleasant helpfull member of the hotel staff I come across was a lady working in the little 
coffee / bar area called the Den . Her name was Inesa she made or trip.
 The first time I stayed near this hotel I asked the doorman where such and such a hotel was (which I was stopping at), he said it's just up the road and then picked up my back and carried it to the other hotel for me . First class staff a credit to the hotel and its management. A smile cost nothing..Tony Timmins",5,2016,06,30
125,perfect location and excellent service,"Aside from its interesting design and architecture, this hotel has the best service in London. The staff are extremely friendly. The rooms are perfectly clean and all services are punctual. The location is right in the middle of Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Trafalgar, making it very accessible at all times. Highly recommended!",4,2016,06,28
125,Night away,"Stayed in this hotel a few times as well as the Sanderson.Great modern hotel with some iconic furniture scattered in the lobby, I love the styling of this hotel! Consistently good, rooms are well appointed and spotless. Fantastic bar with great service,cocktails and DJ playing great tunes. Staff- all were efficient and friendly. A most enjoyable stay. I stayed on Friday night. Would recommend.",5,2016,06,28
125,St Martin's Lane,"it's the place to be, well located next to the main activity centers in central London. you can walk to almost every shopping locations drop your bags at the hotel and set off again.
just missed and fresh fruit juice with my English Breakfast without having to pay for the buffet",4,2016,06,27
125,"High end, top location  . . . Just fabulous","I stayed here for two nights after a work trip to Germany as a friend and I were meeting in London and wanted somewhere fancy and cool.

This place hits the mark on both counts.

Located just steps from Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square, this place couldn't be in a better spot.

It's incredibly sleek and modern in an almost pretentious way but it's one of the friendliest places I've stayed in London.

I stayed in the Deluxe room which was huge, and had a massive sofa which was perfect for chilling and watching the world go by.

The bathroom was oversized, and was stocked with amazing products.
Breakfast was included in the rate and was a generous a la crate and buffet affair.

My friend's daughter joined us on the second night for her 21st and the hotel sent up a bottle of decent champagne and a birthday cake, which was a lovely touch.

This is not a budget place by any means. But at its price point I feel it represents marvellous value for money. I've never stayed so close to the heart of the West End before and you can pretty much walk everywhere . . . Although Leicester Sq tube station is probably 200 ms away.

If you fancy some luxury, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,06,26
125,Beautiful view,"We stayed here in early June and, having stayed at hotels in this group before, we knew that we would not be let down. We certainly were not. From friendly and helpful service at reception, to the amazing 5th floor room with views over Trafalgar Square and beyond,  and from an in house Asia de Cuba to the lovely bar, we were very happy! The room was excellent with a beautiful, comfortable bed and toiletries that my wife was very happy with. The location is convenient for the West End, Covent Garden, Soho etc.  Staff all round were friendly and professional. We will definitely return.",5,2016,06,24
125,"self-consciously hip, but decent.","Upside: Clean straight rooms, well thought out and satisfyingly different.  Good room service.  Downside: Tediously on-message (why hang a picture when you can lean it up against a wall etc). Incongruously raucous 70s new wave played in a bar which denoted smoother tones.  10% over priced.",4,2016,06,23
125,"Very posh, great location","Excellent location near London's Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square. This is an interesting hotel, very posh, definitely doesn't look like a traditional, old hotel. The interior is quite original, looks very elegant too. The room was very comfy, quite large which is not very common in central London. I really liked that the room had huge floor-to-ceiling windows. The view (3rd floor) was nice, it wasn't blocked by other buildings. What was also nice about the room is the led lights behind the bed and under the desk, it looks really nice in the evening. The staff is very professional and helpful, quick to respond and help. I definitely recommend this hotel, especially for business trips and for couples.",5,2016,06,22
125,Fab Hotel,"We were a party of 4 girls in London for the weekend so treated ourselves to a nice hotel, and we were not disappointed. It was a little expensive but so worth it. The rooms were amazing, decor fab. There was a cool hidden bar, which we stumbled into at the end of our night out. Would recommend for couples/friends.",5,2016,06,22
125,Consistently great stay in a great location,"Consistently great stay in a great location.  We love all the Morgans Group Hotels and St Martins Lane is consistent with the standard of quality you get across the chain.  Asia de Cuba is also a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",5,2016,06,21
125,Great Bedroom in a Time Warp Hotel,"This is an interesting hotel that feels very dated in the lobby.  I remember seeing this hotel after it first opened but had never stayed here until recently.  The public spaces feel very strange and the whole Philippe Starck design feels so 1990's.  And the concept of colored spaces is contrived so you don't really know what the day looks like as you leave the lobby through the tinted and lit entrance.  However, the simplicity of design is great in the bedrooms.  It's not luxe but the space is generous and the design is clean and it all works well.  Again, I could do without the strange lighting colors but that wasn't a big deal in the bedroom.  Definitely ask for a higher floor because I had a great open London rooftop view where I could see the Nelson statue, the beautiful rotating globe of the top of the Coliseum, and even the London Eye.  Beware that you will have some street noise even high up because St. Martins is a pretty busy street in the evening with drinkers and such.",4,2016,06,20
125,"Great, public areas! all a bit quirky!","I loved this hotel, fantastic location a hop, skip and a jump from Leicester Square and well priced. Really liked the fact it doesn't look like a hotel from the outside. Nice, bright lobby with great staff. The Den is a really quirky area that has its own unique twist on a typical hotel lounge with quirky artwork and furniture. The Bar area, hidden behind a tea shop and more of a ""secret"" is really fun, much better than how it used to look. Breakfast is served in the restaurant which again is decorated in a unique style. Overall presentation of the breakfast and the buffet is exceptional. Typical of the hotel groups that operates it but for a chain hotel it's radically individual. ",5,2016,06,20
125,P Caldwell,"Wonderful hotel, great staff and great cocktail bar. We are planning to stay again. The food in the restaurant was fantastic we had not tried this style before and the waiter recommended some lovely dishes. ",5,2016,06,20
125,Anniversary celebrations,"Wonderful.  Everything was exactly as it should be, attentive staff, nice room, excellent food and drink. It was slightly disappointing we could not use the garden but no one can rely on the English weather.  We ordered room service which was delivered promptly, the food was excellent. ",5,2016,06,20
125,Birthday visit to London,"I can't thank the hotel enough for a fabulous stay! We chose this hotel based on location because we needed to be in Covent Garden to watch Harry Potter and the Cursed Child! It was an ideal location, the show was in two parts and we could walk from the show to th hotel to get food and back to the hotel etc with ease! The hotel is lovely,very clean and decorated with a lovely modern decor and you can use the gym box for free. We loved the floor to ceiling Windows and enormous mirrors and light up wardrobe!

The main compliment I need to give the hotel, is that they went above and beyond to make our stay special! It was my boyfriends birthday and I wanted to make it special as we've had 'one of those years' so I emailed the hotel and was emailed back within minutes. I wasn't charged any extra, it was all taken care of when I arrived. The hotel had our room ready for 11am when we arrived because they knew we had a show, te room was upgraded for free, they came After part one of the show with prosecco on ice for us and when we came back after part two they gave us a lovely creamy fruit cake that said happy birthday on.

I am really grateful to the hotel for making our stay special!",5,2016,06,19
125,Lovely hotel - I let it down by not being trendy enough!,"Very trendy boutique hotel in fabulous location for shows, shopping and sights.  I had booked a show which was just up the street and I also wanted to go to the British museum, so the location of this hotel was perfect for me.  Easily accessed from Leicester Square station, on the Picadilly line, so no need to change trains from Heathrow, the hotel's presence on the street was a little subtle - it certainly didn't stand out.  My room was needlessly cool with an extraordinary lighting scheme - I could change the lights behind my bed into multiple different colours.  The fake potted plant on the wall was a little out of place (and also a little dusty if you looked closely) but the rest was great.  Comfortable bed with an abundance of lovely soft pillows.  The room was small but I was fully aware of that when I booked the standard room.  For just one person it was excellent.  I had a back room so not much of a view but a nice quiet sleep which considering I was there on a busy Saturday night, was excellent.  The bathroom was newly renovated.  REception staff happily organised a late check-out.  My rate included breakfast.  The buffet offerings were fairly minimalist but nice and breakfast included an a la carte selection.  I loved the decor in the breakfast room which was a bit of a contrast to the ultra modern minimalist rest of the place.  I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are seeing a show.
The only complaint I had was the hot water which took a very long time to heat up.  I was on the 6th floor (the highest) so that may not be a problem on lower floors.",5,2016,06,19
125,Best overnight stay in a London hotel,"What can I say about this hotel other than stunning. Our overnight stay here qas perfect right from check in.  
We arrived at the hotel at 11.00am with the intention of dropping off our bags. We were kindly told if we came back nearer to 12pm we could potentially check in. 3 hours early than their normal check in time. As it was we went back at 12.30 and were able to get our room. Our bag was delivered to our room shortly after. 
The room was impeccable. Very white and modern but so very clean and smelt lovely.
We had room 602 with a very big bath lovely to soak in after a day walking a number of miles round london. 
Being so close to Leicester square/Covent garden. We never needed to get a tube train until as we were able to walk to wherever we wanted within a short time. 
I will defintely return to this hotel and highly recommened others do. 
Downside to this, it's not the cheapest. We had the next room up from standard for ¬£196. Plenty big enough and lots of room spare so you're not cramped. 
There is noise from outside but it didnt disturb our sleep overly. Lets face it when staying in the centre of London, you should expect noise wherever you stay. 
",5,2016,06,19
125,As usual a relaxing stay,"Have been there for a weekend with the family and the stay was as previous a good choice.  Large and clean room with everything what you need. The staff was very nice as usual and the location is just perfect - close to underground, restaurants and theaters. I think it was the fifth time to be there and we will go again.",5,2016,06,18
125,"Decent Hotel, Very Problematic Experience","St Martin's Lane Hotel has decent facilities - I booked last minute and got a queen room, which was fine, if small. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was basic but passable, and the view was quite nice. (It is worth noting that everything in the minibar was EXTREMELY old - the chocolate was all white and hardened.) On the whole, the hotel was very underwhelming for the price - I've stayed in far better London hotels for far less.

What made this a very problematic experience for me was that the hotel withdrew $500 more from my account than the statement I had signed at check-in had said they would, leaving me with an overdrawn bank account and no way to buy anything for the last days of my trip. I complained about this at check-out and I was simply told they withdraw an extra ¬£100/night as a deposit, and that, while it was too bad I hadn't been informed of this at check-in and that this had caused me trouble, it was basically my tough luck. I understand that this was probably in the terms and conditions and that I should've read those more carefully, but I'm not used to having the wool pulled over my eyes when patronizing 5-star hotels. I will it be staying here again.",1,2016,06,15
125,Another Successful Visit.,"First ever review,just felt compelled to let fellow travellers know how much we enjoyed the St.Martins Lane Hotel in London.
The rooms are clean and efficient and quite large by London standards,location is great,work out at Gymbox next door a real treat.
The highlight is Michael the Concierge who is the personality of the lobby,his infectious laugh and outgoing personality along with his expertise on all things London helped complete another great trip.
Thanks St.Martins Lane Team,see you in November.",5,2016,06,15
125,"Very good, would recommend","Everything was very good, a little confusion regarding what exactly came complementary with the room, be aware that booking a room on any site other than the official St. Martins lane website does mean you forfeit some of the complementary services, but otherwise a wonderful hotel with very friendly staff and in a good location. ",5,2016,06,15
125,Stay at St Martins Lane,"Fantastic quality hotel, with some great modern features in the rooms.  Despite being right in the centre of London the hotel is very quite and claim.  Hotel staff are all very pleasant and ready to address any issues or queries quickly.  Great location with easy quick access to theatres and other attractionin.",5,2016,06,13
125,Great hotel better staff,"Loved the location and the staff really make the place! I usually stay at the Mondrian but I find it a bit far from the tube stations so I always end up catching cabs and spending way to much on transport. St Martins Lane is right in the middle of the action and close to tubes, restaurants, bars, gym etc.",5,2016,06,13
125,Overnight at st martins lane ,"This is a very easy hotel to like, nice rooms, nice bathrooms, simple , elegant, comfortable, one of us had a conference near by on Monday, so we we booked a room for Sunday night , we drove to the hotel and other than the speed of travel through central London and the one way system around there, it was easy to pull up outside and hand the car over to the staff  and check in, the service on arrival was very smooth. We booked a deluxe room , at check in I asked for tea coffee making , we went down to eat in the hotel restaurant pretty must as soon as we had unpacked, the hotel restaurant  Is really good too . 
The hotel is very convenient for the west end and we went out to see a little of London, when we returned the tea coffee tray had not been delivered but t a free bottle of champagne was awaiting us, which was welcome, and the tea coffee tray was there in under 2 minutes when I called down for it. 
The room is simple, clean, plenty of white, serene even, I turned off led multicolour lighting, that was a bit much, the bathroom is well planned plenty of space and places to put all the usual stuff that we seem to take on even a short trip. 

Didn't  try breakfast ( which is not included) I was off early so just got coffee at the Starbucks conveniently right across the road. I would have liked to have tried the free access to the Gym Box next door but I had too an early appointment. 

The hotel restaurant  serves fusion style food and it was very enjoyable, if you like Japanese you will probably like the food here, it was excellent, well everything except the coffee  which was quite well, average? The staff took a lot of time to explain the menu , which is an unusual mix of dishes, and generally were there when ever needed. They even have a starter and cocktail selection, which is actually a very good way to try a cocktail. The cocktails were very strong , so one was enough. 
Overall we thought both the hotel and the restaurant are good value, they are well worth trying if you want something comfortable and relaxing with a modern feel and good service. ",5,2016,06,12
125,Stylish,"Excellent location and a trendy rather than luxurious hotel. Rooms are modern, have mood lighting and are generously proportioned. Staff are all friendly and helpful, they add to the friendly/informal atmosphere.
We have stayed here twice now so that's a recommendation. 
",4,2016,06,12
125,Afternoon Tea üòçüòç,"I been staying in st martin lane pass many years , lately I had discover the new cafe right by the lobby call the Den , 
Quite but small 

But they mades very wonderful afternoon tea , the Savory pastry are great the sweet are just perfect :>
share one set with 2 if you small eater , or eat the the whole set probably u could skip the dinner . 

Give it a try and the i think it is one of the best afternoon you could find around town 

Will try the small menu next time 

",5,2016,06,11
125,"Stylish hotel, great staff, great rooms, great location","In the heart of theatre-land, this is a great place to stay for a West End show.  The rooms are very modern, very well appointed and very comfortable; and the staff are very efficient and friendly.  One minor issue is that tea/coffee making facilities have to be requested from housekeeping - wish I had seen that notice when we checked in as I was desperate for a drink after getting plastered at the Cafe de Paris!

We would have no hesitation in going back.",5,2016,06,09
125,Modern hotel in a great location,"A very attractive, modern hotel in a great location for visiting central London. We got a very good deal via Secret Escapes for an upgraded room which was lovely. Breakfast was excellent for the price.
I'd recommend to anyone looking for a modern hotel near Covent Garden.",4,2016,06,09
125,Solid hotel in tough hotel city,"Stayed for a week on a work trip in June 2016.  London is a really tough hotel market - hotels are very expensive, rooms are tiny.  On our corporate rate, this was a solid choice, though I'm not sure if it would be as good at full price!

Hotel is modern, which is kind of nice in this old city - room was sunny and bright and though small, was well set up, with all kinds of useful storage places and hooks and shelves.  Fast free internet and very good breakfast was included.

Location is great, right between the theater district and Covent Garden, only 1 block from the Leicester Sq tube.",4,2016,06,08
125,Exemplary service,"Wonderful hotel with great staff.  The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was genuine and sets this hotel apart from others I have stayed at in London. 

Hotel has a lovely ambience and strikes a great balance between being well located and providing a peaceful sanctuary (despite being located in the centre of the West End).  Will certainly be back.",5,2016,06,08
125,Overall disappointing. 5* Really ?,"Stayed for one night to attend the opera next door at the Collesium.
Booked a double-double and received an upgrade to a superior double-double.Very spacious room (437) with floor to ceiling Windows..Five of them in total.Spacious functional bathroom with no door (that's the design) bath,separate shower and toilet cubicles.
Breakfast offerings were varied with table service for cooked items.Sadly our orders took some time to arrive.So much so that we were asked if we were in a rush.When they did arrive,my full English was cold,except for the sausage.At least they managed to get the sausage right. I suspect a 'glitch' in the kitchen,which happens from time to time but the chef(s) in a 5 star hotel should never allow cold, cooked meals out of the kitchen.
The big 'problem' for us as paying guests was the dj music being blasted out all over the ground floor on a Saturday night.There was nowhere to escape to enjoy a post theatre drink.The volume was at 'Spinal Tap 11' level throughout.
The young lady in The Den did ask reception (not at our request I hasten to add) about the volume but nobody was remotely interested seemingly.
This transformation may only take place at weekends,I don't know,but any quality,truly 5* hotel would have a residents lounge/bar where clients would be spared the ear-splitting,mind numbing sound and the sight groups of young women clutching their cocktails and smart phones who frequent the premises on such occasions.No class.
Not for us I'm afraid.Not for pleasure and most certainly not for business.",3,2016,06,05
125,"Great location, fantastic front desk team","Stayed for the weekend for my wife's birthday. The front desk noted the special occasion and after a day out in London a chilled bottle of champagne and a lovely note was waiting for us in our room. Thanks Dorota and the front desk team. 
Stayed in a delux room which was nice and light, clean and spacious. Hotel is in a great location for Covent Garden and theatres all only  a few minutes walk away.",5,2016,06,04
125,Outstanding Service from one of London's best.,"I've always loved eating and drinking at the St Martins Lane, especially since it's renovations which have stayed true to Starck's model.
The service at the hotel is sublime, Isobel, my receptionist, was absolutely charming and welcomed me with such warmth I felt instantly at home. The atmosphere was relaxed despite being such a design led hotel, and it was great knowing I had the approachable Isobel as my first port of call. 
The rooms are compact but have everything you need. I had a great room on the 6th floor which so much light thanks to the huge windows and white linen. Despite it's location, the room was incredibly quiet! Another major perk is access to Gymbox. 
I can't recommend the place enough, its exciting, but relaxed. 
I'm looking forward to the next opportunity I get to stay. Many Thanks!",5,2016,06,04
125,"Terrific Staff, Luxurious Beds, Cool and Sleek Setting","This is a surprising hotel tucked into the theatre district - trendy, fun, lighthearted, but with attention to detail, super comfy beds and huge soft down pillows, along with amazing lighting throughout, including in your room.  The concierge desk is fantastic - a huge shout-out to Mike, who helped us with theatre tickets, and shopping.  We needed a last minute 4-season sleeping bag for our son.  Voila, Mike knew exactly where we should go, gave us directions, and even checked the hours of the store.  Next, when I asked about the gym, he walked me over and introduced me to the front desk staff.  Mike is knowledgeable, helpful, patient, funny, and extremely welcoming.  Our room was a basic 2-bed double and we loved it.  Bright, quiet, plenty of storage space, a cool closet and thick towels, robes and slippers.  You are given a card for a free ""shot"" from the very cool bar ""Blind Spot"" and the food (bar food) is delivered in a very cool box.  There is a Starbucks across the street, so if you feel like getting your own coffee in the morning, it is simple and easy.  The bathroom lighting is terrific and the toiletries from Malin and Goetz are fantastic.  Super shower pressure and plenty of space to place your toiletries on the sink and in the shelving.  A hair dryer with an extension cord is a nice touch.  Love the lighting, creating a variety of atmospheres.  Ordered an extra pillow and it was delivered in minutes. I would definitely return.  Here for 3 nights.",5,2016,06,03
125,Not the best experience,"I expected a 5 star hotel to be just that - 5 stars across the board.  However, that was not our experience.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The bell service was prompt with our bags and check-in was efficient.  The room, was unbelievably small - even for a European boutique hotel!  The bed took up 90% of the space in the room.  The bed was comfortable, and the shower was REALLY GREAT!! 

I think the one thing that kind of blew my mind was the fact that when we opened the mini-bar, there was a half-eaten Kit Kat just sitting there wrapped back up to appear that it hadn't been touched.  It got me thinking that if they overlooked that, what else was overlooked when they finished the room.  Upon check-out when I brought it to the attention of the staff, there was no apology or anything.  Just simply, ""Don't worry.  You won't be charged for it.""  Well I should hope not!! 

It is a nice hotel and a great location, but in my view to be 5-stars you have to be perfect in every way.  This hotel missed the spot this time!",3,2016,06,02
125,Still one of the swankiest venues in town,"A few years since our last visit, top notch service from the front of house, could not have been more helpful, from early check in, to storage of our bags on departure. Slight hitch with our friends room resolved instantly and upshot is we have booked again for a stay in June and we will be back for a weekend break in October.",5,2016,06,02
125,Fantastic stay (again!),"Turned up at hotel before midday and was checked into my room without any problems. As a matter of fact, as a repeat guest the check in took less than two minutes and was wonderfully efficient, just a matter of signature/credit card and confirmation of passport.

Front desk staff was very friendly and despite having more than two large groups to handle after me she was wonderfully cheerful and a great welcome to the hotel.

Rooms are bright and the rare London sunshine made it even more welcoming. My room was on the top floor facing St Martins Lane Street level and was surprising quiet (except when Kit Harrington starring in Doctor Faustus left the theatre opposite the hotel and crowds of groupies screamed at their idol at nighttime, but that is a very minor and amusing interference)   

The bed and pillows are very comfortable and with many lighting options you can make the room into a very cosy atmosphere. I particularly like the USB ports located next to the bed so you can charge your smartphone/tablet without having to use an adaptor. 

The bathroom is another fantastic thought out room. The shower has great water pressure and the toiletries from Malin and Goetz are just a delight to use. 

I would thoroughly recommend you check out this hotel when you visit London and I am already planning a return visit soon!",5,2016,06,02
125,Great experience!,"My husband, young son and I stayed here recently for a few days.  We arrived early after a long overnight flight from the states.  The staff were extremely accommodating with getting us into a room early.  They even offered to allow us to look at a few rooms before selecting as we needed to upgrade for more space with our son tagging along.  In the end we ended up in a room with the most stunning views of London!

For the entire stay, the staff was extremely attentive, helpful and pleasant.  They were also very patient with our very busy 4 year old.  The value of this can't be overstated in my eyes!  

We stayed in several hotels during the course of our travels on this trip, and this one had the most comfortable beds.  In addition, the room service was very quick and the food was tasty.  The toiletries were also great.

Lastly, the location of this hotel is just perfect.  Super quick walk to Trafalger Square, Covent Garden, theatres, tons of restaurants, shops, etc.",5,2016,06,01
125,From Advertising Agency to Top Hotel,"I was really looking forward to my stay here.I worked in the building in the early 70s when it housed Leo Burnett Advertising.Nostalgia tends to grab you as you get older. The agency moved out and the building became a Hotel. However,when we arrived we found things were not what we had expected.We were tired and grumpy . Fortunately ,Ellen the Duty Manager intervened and promptly solved our dilemma ,Ellen is one of those ‚Äúnothing is a problem‚Äù people and this has flowed onto the other staff,pleasant and helpful..With stormy waters now tranquil we moved to our room, a garden deluxe.It has a small courtyard which allows plenty of light into the room which we found very comfortable.Breakfast was in the top end of quality and the room is a nice bar at night .We had booked 4 plays during our weeks stay and the Hotel is ideally 
located to theatre land ,an easy walk to most or a short bus ride.It is close (but not too close) to the buzzy Covent Garden area. 100 metres to Trafalgar Square and another 
100 to Charing Cross station and the Number 23 bus which to my mind is one of Londons best.Starts at Liverpool st ,runs up Regent st into Oxford st and onto Paddington Rail and Tube stations and onto Westbourne park and Notting hill area.
I was not disappointed in my planned visit to my old workplace.",5,2016,06,01
125,Absolutely Fantastic Stay,"I had eaten at Asia de Cuba here several years ago and always wanted to try this hotel.  I booked it for 6 nights and WOW, was I impressed.  Here are a few highlights:

1.  The staff is amazing.  They really go out of their way to help.  The lady who checked me in offered me an upgrade for my room (which I accepted) and since I was staying for so long, included breakfast in my rate;  Inessa in the Den was just a joy to talk to and served such a wonderful tea service; Mike at the Concierge was amazing when I asked where I could a box for my extra luggage.  He had multiple sizes sent up to me, along with tape.  

2.  The food is delicious.  I ate breakfast there several times and tried all different dishes.  The high tea service in the den was one of the most unique presentations I have seen.  The Bar drinks were great and tasty and they will make anything you like.

3.  Location - you can't beat the location.  Steps from Charring Cross Road tube station and Leicester Square, so you have access to multiple lines.  And SOHO is a fantastic area to walk around in.  Covent Garden is 5 minutes away and there are plenty expensive and less expensive place to heat around the hotel.  

4.  The Room - This was the best part.  It is a quiet, peaceful oasis from the hectic London streets.  Bright white, clean, crips and everything you need to make your stay comfortable.  The bed and pillows were great, the shower and tub fantastic, the little amenities and soap/lotion/shampoo/bubble bath soap, all are first rate.  There's an iron in the room and a large enough safe.

I will definitely be back to stay at this hotel and I recommend it to everyone.  The Morgan brand owns three hotels in London, so you might want to check out others.",5,2016,05,31
125,Best hotel in London,"What an amazing hotel experience. Clean, ultra modern, light, comfortable, fab shower, excellent service and great location. Not often all these come together in one hotel. We won't stay anywhere else in London now.",5,2016,05,31
125,Fantastic luxury mini break,"Wonderful hotel and location.  Staff were excellent, every aspect of care was taken to ensure our special stay was truly magical.  The pre-booking was easy and Belle was very efficient and made extra effort as it was husband's birthday.

Great location, didn't need to get cabs or tube and we felt truly special.  A wonderful experience, thank-you",5,2016,05,31
125,great spot great space," Great location, Rooms light and white but do go to black out at night with curtains, Bathroom is a great size with good size shower and fantastic water pressure. Would definitely stay here again and happy to recommend.",4,2016,05,30
125,A chore! Not a holiday! Pretentious is right!,"I should have listened to the one review and all it said was: ""Pretentious."" From the moment I entered, nobody was helpful to any inquiries. If I had a question I was met with such difficulty. Every staff member was a downright diva. I thought it was a London thing, but then the staff working in the poshest hotels/spas/restaurants in Mayfair were humble and polite to me. Never in my life was I met with such rudeness in a hotel.  I stayed here for 6 nights alone as a birthday treat and can count the smiles I received on one hand- one from the housekeeper and two from the doorman. The service is 3 star or less. Best to stay in another five star hotel in Mayfair and get pampered there - avoid this pretentious attitude! I tried the hair salon next door and they were lovely - highly recommend Scott for a haircut.",1,2016,05,30
125,Nice Holiday,"It was a nice short holiday at St. Martins Lane London Hotel. Everything was okay, the employees were friendly and courteous.
The location is good, many places of interest are in a short way distance.",4,2016,05,30
125,Stylish design hotel and a quiet pearl in noisy Westend,"Stayed for two nights in this elegant (and quite expensive) designerhotel that's close to everything in Central London, and still a silent gem in the middle of St. Martins Lane. Service at the reception was impeccable, as was housekeeping. The rooms are stylishly decorated (minimalistic light design), with stylish and quite large bedrooms. 

Only small let-down was the breakfast, which wasn't up to high standard of the rest of the hotel. This, however, is made up for by one of the coolest hotel-bars I've ever been to, in a secluded room in the lobby, and with a DJ on top of his game. 

A place to definetely return to next time in London.",5,2016,05,29
125,Lovely,"We came here for a one night break and had a great time.
We had a Corner suite and it was amazing. Absolutely perfect.
Complimentary fruit bowl and chocolate coated strawberries arrived to our room about an hour after checking in which was a lovely little touch.
The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the location was fab.
We had a few drinks in the bar which were very nice though the bar was very dimly lit so we couldn't really read the menu.
I will recommend this hotel to anybody it was lovely.",5,2016,05,29
125,Special hotel in the best location ,"Thanks to all the team at St Martins Lane who recently looked after us when we were there.  Special mentions for Mike, Belle and Joey.  It's a fab hotel in a great location.  So convenient - you can walk to Covent Garden, many of the theatres, great restaurants and nightlife.  We'll be back.  ",5,2016,05,25
125,lovely experience,everything about this hotel is first class. The staff are welcoming and genuinely want to make your visit a good one. The rooms are lovely. and nothing was too much trouble. breakfast in the room was superb My only criticism would be the there are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room,5,2016,05,25
125,"St. Martin Hotel (Morgan Corp.) - London, UK ","This was my very first time as a single 34yr old visiting London. I really had no expectations about the St. Martin hotel, only that I wanted it to be, modern, clean, & classy. It was that & more! The hotel smelled gnarly throughout, the food was superb, & the staff was more than helpful. The assistant to the Room Service depatt, Tomas was a true gentleman, always found a way to make my stay pleasant & answered my questions about anything, with genuine interest. When I accidentally ordered the wrong dinner item, he didn't hesitate to rectify it & asked me the right questions to be sure that I was getting what i wanted. Also, a lad from Spain who works in the morning as a bellboy, took the initiative to walk me to the tube, grabbed my luggage & made sure I caught the correct train to Heathrow airport upon checking out. He actually walked to the train station with me without even asking me. I wouldn't hesitate on staying here next time & will recommend the St. Martin Hotel, London, to all my friends who want to have an excellent experience in the heart of London's Theatre District. Living in Los Angeles, I'm not always impressed with the glitz and glamour of touristy spots, but this hotel is a must experience if you like to have a modern feel vs. older architecture. ",5,2016,05,23
125,Unbelievable Customer Service,"From the moment I walked around the corner, I knew this hotel was going to be amazing! The building is nestled in the heart of London's theater district. I stayed in London for the weekend for work but can definitely see myself returning for a longer stay in this unforgettable city. 

The morning before I had to depart I wanted to see the sights and the front desk even gave me a handful of cafe's and breakfast spots. On the way to breakfast I, unfortunately, got pick pockets right in Piccadilly Square. After gathering myself I rushed back to the hotel and immediately informed the two gentlemen of what happened. They were nothing but helpful. I was without any money and was in shock. They assisted me in calling my banks and brought me a food to eat since I couldn't buy food. They arranged a London taxi to drive me to the airport for my flight and were able to work with my company to get the cheapest price.

After returning to USA, I received an exciting email from St. Martins Lane that my wallet had been found in the streets and returned to the hotel. Sameena, one of the managers of the hotel, has been so amazingly working with me to get my wallet back in my hands!

I just received my wallet today, and I could not be more thankful for Sameena. She is incredible and so was everyone else at St Martins Lane! If you're going to stay anywhere in London, make sure its here!",5,2016,05,23
125,Great spot. ,"Spent the night and I was truly happy with everything. Room was very cool and clean, staff were fantastic. Great location and I wouldn't hesitate to return. My one small complain, was the pillows were a little flat but that just a personal preference ",5,2016,05,23
125,"Perfect location, wonderful staff","Just steps away from the cities landmarks, this hotel provides a lovely atmosphere to stay. The staff are very kind and helpful. The rooms were  very nice, quiet and clean. The breakfast buffet although not huge provided essentials to start the day. If you plan a lot of sight seeing it is at the perfect spot to stay",5,2016,05,23
125,A quiet bar in the centre of London,"Not having seen my friend for a couple of years, we just wanted a comfy place where we could talk and catch up to our hearts content. Found in ""The Den"" of this hotel, right next to the English National Opera. My friend also mentioned that one of his favourite restaurants is the Asia de Cuba in this hotel. ",4,2016,05,23
125,"Wonderful weekend, great welcome, fab location.  Definitely be back!","From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a lovely warm ambiance and a very simple but classy environment that has a wonderfully subtle but gorgeous aroma that lingers in the air.  You approach the reception desk to be greeted with a smile and then out comes the lovely Belle - lively, charismatic and just so lovely.  You immediately relax.  Michael and Joey the wonderful concierges are there to make sure that you have everything you need to make your trip the best it can possibly be - its just so lovely to experience this level of service.  Robert the doorman is on hand to help you with bags and call taxis whenever you need one.
When you enter your room you are struck by the simple, clean lines and the most wonderful bathroom that has the best design and layout.  You could spend forever in the shower!!
The location of the hotel is the best ever, in fact it is hard believe that many of London's most fabulous landmarks are in walking distance - Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, London Eye etc.... the list goes on.
I will definitely be back.  Chatting to Michael Fitzgerald the Concierge St Martins Lane Hotel offers family a very warm welcome and I will definitely be back with my children as well as with friends.  Could not recommend the staff and hotel more.",5,2016,05,23
125,Smart designed hotel,"Enjoyed the contemporary ambiance. Like baby smelt Devine!
Had excellent evening at the blind spot- the resident bar- well thought out concept.
The only small detail that was a little disappointing was we booked the room through booking.com. Because of this we were told in the morning breakfast was exempt but we were welcome to join for additional cost. Now no where during the booking or check in was this explained. It is a given assumption breakfast is included in any class of hotel establishment (expect a hostel!!)
Think the information process needs reviewing or provide a price which covers breakfasts which should eliminate guest won't be feeling secondary standard",5,2016,05,22
125,Awesome Staff,"Its not only that glorious aroma of the lobby of the St Martins Lane (and the other Morgan Hotels), above all, are the profesional, warm, caring attitude of its staff.
First thing that welcomed me was Ricardo's amazing smile!
And I didn't get the name of this nice Spanish young bellman who got me a cab to the Pancreas Station I could pay with my credit card, when I left the hotel.
The location of course is fantastic, but there are some other things that are even better: Just crossed the street and enjoyed a play (Doctor Fausto) with Kit Harington , getting a ""selfie' afterwards with Lord Commander himself, and making my daughter back home the happiest girl ever.
The truth is that I did not even know who he was a few hours earlier , since Im not a fan of Game of Thrones, but Belle and Giacomo at the concierge desk, were nice enough to let me know, when I inquired about plays to see in the area. (My daughter thanks you, guys!)
My room, in the 3d floor, in the corner, had a post card type of view and the bathroom was fit for this queen! : ) Loved the bed and the convenient lamps, really designed to help read in bed. Just but PLEASE, have coffee facilities in the bedroom, don't make me call for them! : )
Had breakfast in their Asian Cuban restaurant and enjoyed it a lot!
Everything at the St Martins Lane, looks, smells and feels like relaxation. I adored my stay. And definitely coming back, its the perfect hotel for a perfect city.",5,2016,05,22
125,Great location. Amazing staff,"We had a wonderful stay at St.Martin's lane. Ofcourse the location is amazing, but the hotel in itself is charming. They have a very nice reading room and the staff is polite, but with a good sense of humor! Very nice restaurants nearby as well, especially Dishoom.",4,2016,05,19
125,Great location,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Great location to see the sights. 2 minute walk to Trafalgar Square, about 5 minutes to Coventry Garden, 15 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Big Ben. Carried on walking from here to South Bank.
The hotel looks scruffy from the outside but inside it is lovely, very modern. Staff very helpful. Only negative I have is the cost of drinks in the bar are extortionate, 1 beer, gin and Tonic, Bloody Mary and Bacardi and Coke ¬£49 compared to the same in Mr Foggs bar on corner of the street, ¬£30!!! Breakfast is also very expensive  at ¬£25.99 per head! Especially when there are lots of cafes& bars in the same street charging half the price! I would definitely stay here again though for the location and rooms were of a high standard.",4,2016,05,18
125,Perfect central location. Very modern and quirky,"Room was good size for London with 2 doubles and spacious en suite. Very simple modern uncluttered accommodation with funky lighting options,and air-conditioning. Each guest room also features a media hub with USB, bluetooth, HDMI and LAN capabilities and free wifi.Lovely complimentary toiletries but beware the optional luxuries mini bar and snacks... we thought they were very pricy!! It would be nice to have tea/coffee making facilities without having to ring down for them... we purchased our own tea milk and sugar from the very close sainsburys as we love our tea!!  The room was really quiet and peaceful.Staff were very helpful and accommodating ...We will definitely be coming back!",5,2016,05,18
125,Perfect stay for a perfect trip,"We have just come back from London for a two day trip. We were Mum and Daughter staying together to celebrate daughters birthday. We had brunch when we arrived at the hotel and this turned into a boozy affair. We were so well looked after and once they heard birthday celebrations, they brought me a cake with a candle and the plate decorated with Happy Birthday. Our room was amazing. We stayed in the double loft room but paid only a third of the price to what is advertised on website. It was so clean, light and spacious. When we returned to our room after being out of the hotel for a few hours, there was a birthday cake and card left on the table. We visited the cocktail lounge in the evening which was good fun and before we left we had breakfast which again was amazing! I had one last cupcake delivered for my birthday at breakfast! They really looked after you and made us feel special. Location is really convenient, close to covent garden and National gallery but easy to get to underground. Would highly recommend and hope to return soon. ",5,2016,05,17
125,Central location and great service,"A friend and I stayed here for four nights on a girl's trip.  Location is perfect--close to several Underground stations, and a quick walk to Leicester Square, Covent Garden, and Trafalgar Square.  Hotel staff was so friendly and helpful, from the front desk to doormen, to concierge.  We were greeted upon leaving and returning to the hotel and it felt like we knew everyone in just four days!  Room was clean, spacious, and had thoughtful details and amenities.  Hallways are always dark, part of the mood of the hotel, and styling is very modern--not typically my style, but it is very well done.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,05,14
125,Perfect!  Home away from home,"This has by far been the best hotel I've stayed in! The staff were friendly, accommodating and the room was not only modern but also super clean. The location in London is superb, just moments away from Trafalgar Square. I really enjoyed playing with the colored lights behind the bed, and the USB ports were handy when it came to charging my phone (Australian chargers don't fit into the wall very well)! I didn't try food at the restaurant, but the den and hidden cocktail bar both had impeccable service and really tasty drinks - Try the gin. When I come back to London I know where I'm staying! ",5,2016,05,13
125,Short Vacation in London Central,"The staff at the hotel were courteous, professional, friendly and accommodating.  As a constant traveler in the Middle East area I have had my fair share of excellent and poor hotels over my past 40+ years in the oil industry.  However, I can safely say that this is the best hotel, best service, best food offering hotel that my wife and I have had the pleasure of in a long, long time. I shall make it an essential booking on all of my future trips to London.  Whether on business or pleasure.  An excellent team.  Greta job.",5,2016,05,12
125,A perfect stay,"In London for a quick visit and evening at the theatre. Staying at the St. Martin's Lane was simply the best. I love the fact that the hotel has stayed true to its Philippe Starck design. It's meticulously well-kept, staff was super professional, phenomenally nice and genuinely friendly. Food at Asia de Cuba was great. What more could one wish for. Shall be back for sure",5,2016,05,10
125,Must stay hotel; excellent service and rooms ,Stayed here for a weekend after week long Ireland trip. Nothing but the best here. Service was excellent; rooms were comfortable spacious; gym access major perk; central walking distance to all major attractions. First time in London will definitely stay here again and recommend to all my friends. ,5,2016,05,09
125,Great location - slick service - trendt decor,"Could be a chic hotel in any country in Europe but still a great experience. Very smart, very funky and smells great (perfume piped all over the place!) . We had a room on the first floor with an internal courtyard. Lovely on a very sunny day and in the evening. Despite close views of the Coliseum on a Friday, it was very quiet. Lots of facilities (such as blue tooth) and great details. We felt welcome.

Slightly pricey, but recommended if you want to be near Covent Garden, Soho or South Bank. One wrinkle - no tea making facilities in the room. When we called room service we were charged ¬£8 for a tray of hot water and tea bags. A bit naughty!",5,2016,05,08
125,Great desgin hotel in an exzellent location,"Exzellent location within the city of London where you can reach all the touristic points of interest by walking.
The hotel itself shows a special atmosphere because of its design and provides verry good service.",4,2016,05,08
125,Amazing stay,"Frist class from start to finish. A warm welcome from the doorman and reception. Contemporary, clean, well equipped spacious rooms. The staff really can't do enough for you - would highly recommend and will definitely be staying again.",5,2016,05,08
125,great hotel!!,"Arrived for 3 nights,  including breakfast.
 First - the hotel has a great location from every point of view. Near the tube, walking 5 min. distance, restaurants, shopping, and also near many theatres.
Second- the hotel itself is splendid. The inside decoration,  the design, were very uniqe, stylish , modern, and the room was  also superb. Free wifi .
The room was wide, white- that gave a clean feeling, the lights in the room were special and gave a nice feeling when entering the room,and the bathroom was big enough, and smartly designed for use.
It was very clean, all around, changed towels twice daily, mineral water bottles. 
They were very nice at the front desk from the moment you arrived, and also the concierge service, which helped us on finding and reserving  a place for afternoon tea experience at the last moment, on a Saturday.
The breakfast itself, although not very big or with a variety of selections, was tasty and enough, lacking only -the omelets/eggs to those who must have them included. It was served in a very elegant way and in a beautiful room, with a pleasant atmosphere and service.
To sum it up- worth it!!!",5,2016,05,07
125,A very different experience,"I stayed at St Martins Lane for business purposes and the facilities are generally very good. The staff are very friendly, the food is good and the location for getting around central London is perfect. I think the venue is more suited to short breaks or family stays. 

In terms of business use, it's not really ideal in some ways as the meeting rooms don't have Windows and the rooms have long tables which is not suited to meetings. The hotel could also look to improve signage around the place as its not easy to find parts of the hotel.",4,2016,05,07
125,THE BEST LONDON STAY,"You could not pick up a better location.
Service is OUTSTANDING.
We had a corner room with SEVEN floor to ceiling windows !!
The room was HUGE (I think I had taken a De Luxe): talking around 30sqm (over 300 sqft) !
Super modern (Philip Stark) but not overly engineered and complicated - simply perfect balance.
Awesome breakfast (excluded)
Free wifi - needless to say.
One of the coolest bar downstairs, where to stick around in the evening.
Super well attended by the local cool and party crowd.
Check the sitting room: have a close look at the pictures hanging on the walls .... and treat yourself to big smiles !!!
I will definitely go back as soon as I can - it's the only Hotel for me now in London - after 22 years of pilgrims !",5,2016,05,06
125,Very funky and simple ,"A true testament of the Morgan's hotels identity and style. Doesn't disappoint if you are into simple and artistic influences of your stay. 
Really enjoyed such ambience in a such vibrant and full on city like London. Been there couple of times and would go back. Location is one if the best you can get! ",4,2016,05,05
125,London at its best - St Martins Lane,"After having spent a weekend at St Martins Lane Hotel in London we can really give them all our highest recommendations. The ""Double Double Loft"" room was perfect for us (a family of four) - with two comfortable double beds and a spacious bathroom. The room, hotel breakfast and guest service all exceeded our very high expectations. The location was perfect for all types of shopping, restaurants and musicals. A special ""plus"" for their Guest Experience Manager Isabelle Fowkes who personally contributed to make this a truly memorable trip for us.",5,2016,05,03
125,We Can't Wait to Return!,"Such a good experience from start to finish. I thought the interior of this hotel may have been a little too clinical for me but I have to say I absolutely loved it. The bedrooms are just so well designed and give you everything you need. Great bathroom and excellent storage space throughout. You have to request a tea and coffee making tray but it promptly arrived and was replenished daily. Got to say, housekeeping were really on the ball. A barely noticeable presence but everything done beautifully.
In fact all the staff were charming and welcoming, from the guys on the door who always had a smile and a greeting, to the breakfast staff and cocktail bar staff who were professional and very helpful.
We ate breakfast there every morning and were most impressed by the quality and choice. The cooked breakfast was particularly good. Room service was quick and tasty.
I'm struggling to find anything to criticise in all honesty. It really was that good.
Location is primarily why we chose this hotel and that didn't disappoint either.
St. Martin's Lane allows you to walk to so many places: Covent Garden shops, Chinatown, a heap of restaurants and with the added bonus that The National Gallery is literally just a skip away.
So an excellent trip into London for us and we're already planning our next stay here. Looking forward to it already!",5,2016,05,03
125,Good but could be better,"The hotel is in a fabulous location, it is clean and the service good.
I didn't like the hotel taking ¬£100 on my credit card without telling me, I'm used to them taking a swipe of my card in case I use anything from the room, but then having to wait up to 5 days for the refund once I've checked out I think is wrong. 
No tea and coffee facilities in the room - you have to ask and they aren't topped up without asking. No biscuits either! 
It's good, but these little things would make it great. It's quiet and peaceful too. ",4,2016,05,02
125,Very Pleasant stay,"We booked this hotel after reading good reviews,  The hotel is situated in the theater district and is close to National Gallery Trafalgar Square. The room was clean and quiet but small, upgrading would have cost us 30 pounds per night. The only  thing it's size.Our suitcase was at the entrance door. 
The restaurant Asia de Cuba was a good experience and tasting menu would cost per person  60 pounds. Good and efficient staff at reception and the concierge desk. A surprise upon arrival - charge of 100 pounds per day for extras - mini bar restaurant etc., If not used given back. This should be known before to guests when booking. ",5,2016,05,01
125,"Second visit, same quality","My wife and I spent a long weekend at the Saint Martin's Lane hotel in late April, recording our second visit, having originally visited some seven months earlier. The hotel's quality remained undimmed and our stay started excellently with news that we had received a room upgrade. The hotel is brilliantly positioned if you are looking for the Theatreland/restaurants/nightlife/cinema/sights of central London. It is a stone's throw from pretty well all the major theatres, Trafalgar and Leicester Squares and right among the excellent transportation links afforded by the underground and several bus routes.

Our room had a great view over St Martin's Lane itself and was warm and comfortable with the delightful mood lighting and a large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable.

The cocktail bar is terrific with great music and very charming and attentive hostesses (who are all extremely attractive too!). We haven't yet dined in the hotel but ultimately I'm sure we will. Next visit in July -  although we've used some of the big-hitters; The Landmark, the Langham, the Hilton Park Lane, the St. Martin's Lane is securing itself as our default London hotel. Love the place.",5,2016,05,01
125,Great hotel great location,"Good service throughout, door man and reception, good decorations and funky rooms, like the mini bar selections quite unique. loved the residents bar a little too much. Location close to Leicester Square is fantastic. Great to pop out of a coffee across the road if that's all you wanted.",4,2016,04,30
125,We loved it,"St. Martins Lane Hotel met or exceeded all of our expectations. The room was tastefully decorated, fully equipped and spacious enough. Despite its central location, it was remarkably quiet; we didn't hear any internal noise and minimal noise from outside. We slept well each night. The breakfast was excellent, and my picky wife even praised her options. And the location! Right in the heart of Covent Garden, it was an easy walk to restaurants, shopping, tourist attractions and the Leicester Square tube station. We would gladly stay here again. We paid about $330/night including breakfast for 2, which we felt was a nice price given its location and quality.",5,2016,04,30
125,Returned again ,"Returning again and again when on business in London is testament to how I rate the hotel. I just love this place 

The service is smashing and consistent, the rooms are my absolute favourite, along with the breakfast which for me is the jewel in the crown 

Keep it up St Martins Lane 

Thank you  ",5,2016,04,29
125,An absolute must!!,"A little apprehensive as we were taking our friends to a hotel we have not tried before,  but we were not disappointed! The hotel is modern, clean & gorgeously scented. The rooms are also clean & spacious. We had booked the garden room & although the outside area is small, four of us sat around the bistro table having a drink.  In the morning we went down for breakfast, there were lots of choice of fruits, cheeses, salmon & muffins. Not being a fan of cooked breakfast I had the Breakfast in the Fields (I think that was what it was called) it was gorgeous, 2 eggs, on a flat bread, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes & asparagus. It kept me going until evening. Now here is the moan....it's just a small one! The first small cup of coffee came with the breakfast, after that each coffee was ¬£4 each. I have never had to pay for extra coffee in other hotels before! Saying that we would definitely stay again.",5,2016,04,28
125,Superb,Went there on a Tuesday night post red carpet event. The place was magnificent and live band was a top performer too (which they only do every Tuesday). Highly recommend this place. Top class venue for an event or a night out,5,2016,04,27
125,Never disappoints,"This is the perfect hotel. Great staff, amazing service, food and drinks amenities are excellent and comfortable beds. Along with the best location in London. if you are in town for pleasure or business, i can't recommend a better venue that St Martins Hotel.",5,2016,04,26
125,"Boutique,excellent service, FOOD is amazing.  Asian/Cuban influence; breakfast creative, healthy & satisfying","We stayed for 4 days on the top floor at this fantastic hotel. 180 view of London, large bathroom with huge tub, shower and lovely amenities. Service is personalized, responsive and charming. Bar is super cool, lounge is interesting(check out the art, there is a story:) and the Cuba decorations in the restaurant are beautiful and welcoming.",5,2016,04,26
125,Fantastic boutique hotel in best possible location,"Stayed there for 3 nights and can only highly recommend! The location cannot be any better and the room is great and hotel facilities as well. For Gym usage , they offer their next door fantastic city gym",5,2016,04,26
125,Pristinely clean and fantastic location,"Had a lovely stay with family.  One of the few hotels in London with a room with 2 Queen-sized beds - perfect for our family.  The generously-sized Loft Double Double room was comfortable, bright and clean.  I was concerned the location might be too ""in the heart of it all"" but our room was quiet and it was great to be able to walk to pretty much everything we needed.  Convenient to many great restaurants and things to do.",5,2016,04,25
125,The Concierge Mike at this hotel is the best !,"I truly enjoyed my time at this great hotel in London, and thanks to the Concierge Mike we managed to get tickets for tours and attractions that were sold out for months !....don't miss any of Mike's restaurants recommendations as well !",5,2016,04,22
125,Posh Hotel in the Middle of the Town,"Beautyful Hotel with beautyful rooms, beautyful staff and beautyful guests. Fantastic Bar, very nice Cubanlike restaurant - better book in advance. Fantastic Concierge who assist you regardless what you need. From the Hotel its only minutes to Covent Garden, Chinatown and the main theaters.",5,2016,04,22
125,sleek modern design,"We would have walked past the hotel had we not researched its location, maybe this is a way to keep it exclusive?! We loved the cubist d√©cor and the quirky furnishings.  the reception staff were excellent, but felt the waiting staff (in the Den & at breakfast could have been better).  We loved the d√©cor in our room & the bathroom was superb with a generous supply of lovely toiletries.  The location is excellent for a theatre visit.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,04,21
125,Like a Second Home,I returned to St Martin's Lane Hotel on business.  I have to say the staff goes out of their way to make you feel special.  I was warmly greeted by name as I came and went.  Michael and Giacamo helped me immensely with the receiving and shipping of materials for my meetings.  Belle at the front desk is the best - always attending to my needs.  Breakfast in Asia de Cuba is fantastic - great wait staff who remember your likes.  Blind Spot for a night cap is a great.  Even housekeeping was great.  I look forward to my return.,5,2016,04,21
125,Great home base!,"Very fun hotel with a cool vibe. Room was large and pleasant with a large deep tub. Staff is super friendly and the location is fantastic. Very close to tube stop, many restaurants and shops. They offer the access to the gym next door which I thought was pretty unique!",5,2016,04,20
125,5 stars?,"This is a very difficult review for me to write. I wanted to like the St Martin's Lane Hotel. For one the location is ideal, as the only 5-star property in the heart of the theatre district. The staff were all terribly friendly and attentive and among the best I've encountered. My really gripe is the property itself.

For one, it's nearly impossible to find from the outside. There are no signs and the building is quite ordinary; if you didn't know what you were looking for, you might pass right by it. The lobby is bright and relatively efficient, but nothing spectacular. Adjacent, there is a (fantastic) restaurant and two bars -- one of which is hidden and I didn't discover it until the night before check-out. It's quite nice, and I wish someone had pointed it out to me sooner.

When I got off the elevator on my floor, my heart sank. I stepped into a very dark corridor that smelled like a cross between a Motel 6 and a college dorm room. It was supremely depressing (see photos) and in desperate need of refurbishment. My room  had a very strange layout with a terribly inefficient use of space. There was no place for me to put my suitcase (even closed) with blocking the narrow way around the bed. The gimmicky multi-colored LED lights are, I understand, something of  trademark at the St Martin's Lane, but I found them extremely gaudy and tacky. Every time I returned to my room in the evening it was bathed in a new tawdry color that I ultimately learned to control, but no instruction was given. Incidentally, this colored lighting thing isn't limited to the guest rooms; it's pervasive throughout the property. 

Anther complaint is that the venetian blinds are locked between two panes of glass with no way to control them. So, with them perfectly horizontal, I was unable to lift or tilt them so I could have a clear view of the ground below. The closer you get to the window, the worse the view gets.

The bathroom I loved. I thought it was very well done in neutral stone colors, large, with just about the best water pressure I've ever encountered. 

I guess my problem with the hotel is one of expectations. I chose it for the location, and would've been completely satisfied had it been listed as a 4- or even 3-star property. But St Martin's Lane markets itself in the same category as the Savoy, Ritz, and Mandarin Oriental. It's not. If you're ok with the odd, outdated d√©cor then it's not a bad place at all. As I've said, it's perfectly situated in the West End and populated by friendly, helpful staff. It's clean. It's convenient. It has 24-hour room service. But it's no Savoy.",3,2016,04,20
125,good experience,"we particularly appreciated the  staff, the cleanliness and the location, we noted a slightly decreasing choice for breakfast but the quality of food is still very good, the standard room is a bit small for 2 guests especially with large luggage.",5,2016,04,19
125,Design hotel in Central London,"I am a great fan of the Morgan Hotels, in particular of St Martin Lane, for their slick modern design and functionality. The location is great close to the Theatre district, many good restaurants and with good connections for doing my business. ",4,2016,04,19
125,Lovely design hotel in Central London,"Beautifully designed and decorated room. A tad small but every nook and canny has been used to make your stay comfortable and stylish. I can still feel Philippe Starck's strong influence. I'm amazed the hotel was so quiet, not noisy. A perfect place for a luxury weekend getaway. Friendly and efficient staff ensure you have a relaxed stay. See Glenn Close in Sunset Blvd at ENO Coliseum while you can.",4,2016,04,17
125,Absolutely Fantastic,I was staying in St Martins due to business and it was the most perfect experience.  The rooms are so well equipped and the bar and dining room are really fantastic.  The thing that makes this place though is the staff.  I had a medical issue whilst staying here and the staff were simply amazing; special mention must go to Christian and Belle who ensured I was ok and I really want to thank them so much.   The location of the hotel is perfect and I really enjoyed walking around the sights which I could easily do.   Without doubt a truly great hotel and the staff are amazing.,5,2016,04,16
125,Good hotel but nothing fantastic given its price,"- The room was definitely clean and nice, and the checkin/checkout was quick
- It's obviously a great location, very central, but it's too expensive for the value provided.
- I was on the first floor, and there was noise until midnight as there are bars around
- They try to make extra money everywhere, though: internet is pretty average (you need to pay extra for premium speed), as well as all TV films catalogue.",3,2016,04,15
125,Perfect location,"If you want to be in the middle of everything then this is the hotel for you as its within walking distance of lots of the main attractions and a short walk from a tube and mainline railway station. The hotel itself is excellent with very stylish rooms that are very well appointed, the beds are very comfortable. The hotel bar and restaurant is very nice with friendly service. It's a very popular place for locals and can get busy, a very trendy place to hangout. A very nice hotel at the high end of the spectrum.",4,2016,04,15
125,Weekend with my son,"We had a great experience at St Martins Lane Hotel.  The hotel is fabulous, the interior designing is beautiful and stylish.  Our room was spotless and extremely well equipped.  The lighting in the rooms made our chill out time really special.  The staff were top notch - all of them, polite, helpful and extremely friendly.  We will definitely be back.  Thank you very much for a wonderful weekend.",5,2016,04,10
125,Too much bling and no substance,"Staff - seemed indifferent and lacked a personal touch one expects from a good hotel. Good looks do NOT a good staff make!
Room - Much smaller than one would expect but very well planned and the sheets are lovely, unfortunately the mattress is super firm!
LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION - you cannot get a better location - its not in the madness of the W sitting just off side, prefect for zone one.
Fragrance - a lovely touch.",3,2016,04,09
125,Everything you'd expect from this standard of hotel!,"We stayed for one night over a weekend and had a fantastic time.  Staff all more than friendly but not in your face, room was immaculate, light, airy with a great bed and awesome shower.  We had drinks in the cocktail bar service again fantastic, drinks a reasonable price for a hotel bar and full table service. So pleased we decided to stay at St Martins Lane rather than the W.  A great treat! ",5,2016,04,09
125,THE FRAGRANCE IS THE SAME!!!,"I happen to be a regular ""stayer"" at Morgans hotels in NYC and when I got to St Martins Lane I was positively surprised to feel the same fragrance of Morgans in Madison or the Royalton. Impressive marketing.
The hotel is something that I personally like and the staff is great. Isabel was very nice with me.
The area surrounding the hotel is phenomenal since you are walking distance  from some of the best spots of this great city. Yes, because London is really a great city though expensive.
",5,2016,04,03
125,"Cool place to stay, top notch ","Location perfect - walking out to Trafalgar Sq in the sunshine on Sunday morning was lovely. Bedrooms 5 star standard as you would expect - sheets, bedding, pillows all lovely. Breakfast gorgeous. We ate at Soho eating house - the whole experience was perfect.",5,2016,04,03
125,"Chic, Modern, Plush and The Best Location","We stayed one night at St Martin's Lane Hotel, I wish it were for more. Our room was very generous for area, we had heaps of space. The TV was high definition, and pretty cool. The bed, pillows and shower were top notch. Definitely 5 star. Its location is superb, several theatres and Trafalgar square in a few hundred metres. I highly recommend this property for couples and romantic weekends, it has fewer rooms than the Amba, and feels more boutique than the large hotels. The only challenge I had with the hotel was finding it, I was expecting an old building, but it is a glass building, the number 45 is low to left of the front door, sand blasted on glass, i.e not very clear. So I ended up in a cafe and phoning the front desk to get instructions. It's opposite Starbucks.",5,2016,04,03
125,Excellent service,"This was our second visit to London.  We decided to book this hotel for the location, favorable reviews, and (I realize this sounds ridiculous) the Malin and Goetz amenities.

The lobby was clean, a little sparse.  All white decor makes it difficult to hide imperfections.  Check in staff were courteous and capable.

The elevator was small, the hallways were dark, but the room was spacious, bright, and clean.  This hotel excelled in service.  The room was made up twice daily.  The hotel offers free laundry service for gym clothes  While there is no gym in the building, hotel guests have access to a gym next door.

Would definitely return next time we are in London.",5,2016,04,02
125,London fun,Loved the location and the rooms at the St Martin. Could walk to everything and very close to tube. Great concierge that helped with wonderful theater and dinner reservations. Room was a good size for London. Highly recommend it.,5,2016,04,01
125,Great hotel!,"We stayed a week at St Martin's Lane Hotel on family vacation and it was great. The room was very nice, clean, and lighting feature made it more comfortable. The location was amazing, a lot of the sights are just walking distance.",5,2016,03,31
125,5th visit coming up soon!!!,"St Martins lane is everything you would expect of a five star boutique hotel. The fabulous smell when you arrive at reception makes me feel at home. The location is second to none, the service, comfy bed, cocktails and breakfast keep me coming back to this hotel. I can't wait until I am back in April ; )",5,2016,03,25
125,"St Martins Lane is a gem of a hotel for comfort, style and excellent, friendly, attentive staff.","St Martins Lane is a gem of a hotel for comfort, style and excellent, friendly, attentive staff.
The contemporary style, high quality and high standards throughout the hotel was very impressive.
Breakfast was a cut above the average you would find in most London hotels. 
But the best thing about the hotel was its staff who were attentive and warm in both their welcome and genuine hospitality.
Altogether a great place to base your visit to London, very close to Covent Garden, theatres, eateries and central attractions.",5,2016,03,24
125,Some nice improvements,"I've stayed here a few times and usually leave feeling put off by the hotel's unnecessary efforts to be ""cool"". The bar just off the lobby was super noisy and crowded, and the lobby virtually unusable as a lobby. This recent visit shows I must not have been alone. The bar is now ""secret"", tucked away behind a wall. There is the addition of ""The den"" which provides a comfortable place to sit and meet people. These changes make the hotel far more functional for travelers. The rooms are small but comfortable. They also feature weird lit headboards that can change colors. Bonus points if you can figure out how to turn them off.",5,2016,03,24
125,Classy hotel,"Stayed in this place many times,it's the sister hotels to the Mondrian in LA and the Hudson hotel in NY it's part of the Philip stark hotel chain,and you would expect it to be classy just as the other hotels are,the reception area is quite dark,and in my opinion is probably to dark,it's ambient but just to dark,but it's romantic and a great place to stay in London.",4,2016,03,23
125,All you need and a little more,"Great hotel with a super fancy modern interior. Stayed here for 3 nights for business and the location for the hotel was good both getting easy around. 
Big and spacious rooms with great beds.  
Nice hidden bar at the hotel with great drinks, worth a visit. 
Breakfast    ",5,2016,03,22
125,Makes a business trip much more bearable,"Perfectly located on the edge of Covent Garden and handy for all of the main sites.  Rooms are small - but cleverly put together. Mood lighting, lovely toiletries.  There is a large gym (which I didn't avail of), but colleagues were impressed.  Try to find the bar - it's well hidden!  Very contemporary styling, well stocked and fresh breakfast buffet and probably some of the friendliest hotel staff I have ever encountered!  Lunch was prepared for us and was interesting and tasty fusion cuisine and the meeting rooms were ideal.",5,2016,03,20
125,Location Location Location,"At the Trafalgar Square end of St Martin‚Äôs Lane, this is in a perfect location for accessing Theatreland, Covent Garden, the Opera houses and National Gallery.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming and we had an excellent pre-opera dinner at Asia de Cuba restaurant inside the hotel ‚Äì fusion food, delicious but pricey and with a wine list to match.
      We had a lovely corner room flooded with light from its floor-to-ceiling windows, with a view across to the Duke of York Theatre and, to the side, the dome of the Coliseum.  The room was full of typical Philippe Starck design features, some rather baffling such as air con hidden behind a panel which turned out to be the bathroom door, and an inward opening shower door making it difficult to experiment with the controls to work out how to get hot water while avoiding being sprayed from the cold tap and splashing water out onto the floor!  Hands free flush for the loo wins points, promptly deducted by the crashing down of the non-soft-close seat!   Oh, and the coloured lights were a great feature, programmable from behind the bed.  Breakfast wasn‚Äôt included in our price, but we walked to Cote Brasserie, half a minute away, for delicious eggs florentine before walking on to the Portrait Gallery. 
       Verdict:  trendy hotel, trying maybe a little too hard to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù, but you‚Äôre paying to be centrally placed for a great night out.  Tip: ask for a corner room or upgrade to a suite, and grab lunch at the Portrait Restaurant on the roof of the NPG ‚Äì fabulous view.",4,2016,03,19
125,"White, Minimal Covent Garen Hotel","This was the second time staying at the St Martin's Lane hotel, the first since the refurbishment which saw the introduction of the Blind Spot bar. The room was ok in size (A superior room) with a decent size bathroom. The breakfasts are a good size - particularly the English Breakfast! I think for anyone who doesn't know London, this hotel has a good central location which is close to Leicester square, Covent Garden and theatre land (with tube stations close at hand) and so is an excellent choice if you like boutique hotels and want to explore. The outside does look a little dirty (Being a converted office block, I think!) but inside looks the part.",4,2016,03,18
125,Cool spot in Great Area,"St. Martins Lane Hotel is a boutique hotel in a great location with above average amenities.  You are perfectly situated in Covent Garden district with great shopping, restaurants, pubs and the theater steps away.  The National Portrait Gallery is only several blocks away, cool antique book stores, intimate galleries...... 
 
The lobby is nice enough and the staff was very friendly throughout. They have a concierge station that was always staffed with someone knowledgeable and helpful.  They have a rather formal library-type room to sit and chat and to have tea or play board games.   The rest of the hotel tries hard to be trendy and they generally succeed.  The hotel has a full restaurant (Asia de Cuba) that was excellent and the separate bar/nightspot was very classy/cool with live music (jazz singer with strings).  Very nice spot to talk with friends or your companion without yelling along with some people watching.  For fitness, the hotel has an arrangement with GYMBOX;  you need to exit the hotel and walk outside 20 feet to get to the gym but this is a small inconvenience considering the high quality and scale of the gym (gym pass included with room).

The rooms are very cool with an all white motif and blue hued lighting.  The bedding was firm but luxurious with very nice linens.  Technology was good with UBS charging station and your own Bluetooth controlled music played through the room TV.  The standard room was spacious and the minibar was stocked and they had a wide assortment of snacks.  The bathroom was bright and immaculate with great water pressure.  The only real negatives with the room were the close proximity to the next door apartment building (you really needed to keep the shades drawn) and the cool lighting in the room didn't have a switch to turn off the cool and turn on a brighter ambiance if you wanted to do some reading or just wanted brighter light.

All in all a very nice hotel in a perfect location.  I would definitely come back as the small negatives were more than offset by the unique location, the quality of the gym and the overall accommodation.",4,2016,03,18
125,London done right,Great place to stay while in London. Especially if you like mid sized hotels. The service from the minute I walked in was fantastic. The bar and restaurant are both great. The gym is also perfect for those who need the daily fix. ,5,2016,03,15
125,Penthouse Perfection,"Wow. What a treat. We stayed for one night for Valentines Day. After arranging everything with the super professional and wonderful Belle (Guest Relations Manager) we arrived to find we had been given an upgrade. So began 24 hours of absolute perfection. 

From complimentary champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries, handwritten cards, roses on the bed and around the bathtub - it was all beautifully executed and made us feel like we were on a second honeymoon!

The penthouse itself needs no explaining - just look at the pictures. The place is huge, great views of the London skyline and Trafalgar Sq and is decorated to a high standard. Its one of those rooms which makes you want to cancel your plans and just hang out in.

The wonderful service continued through out our stay, the barstaff in Blind Spot mix up tasty cocktails, housekeeping keep the place spotless and room service is prompt and the breakfast delicious!

We really can't recommend this hotel highly enough. If you want to treat someone to an extra special experience - make sure you book the penthouse.

Thank you Belle :)",5,2016,03,15
125,Great hotel in central London!,"Great location, trendy rooms and super service, probably a bit too trendy for me, being an old duffer I struggled to find door handles etc in the dimly lit boudoir of this chic space. Overall though a great experience, and breakfast was an amazing experience.",5,2016,03,14
125,"Great hotel, a shame the booking wasn't clearer","My husband and I booked a stay at the hotel for a rare night away from our children. We were considering a number of hotels within London, but the location of St Martins Lane meant we wouldn't have to worry about getting taxis or the tube to get around.
We booked a deluxe room, and as the booking system didn't offer any extras (such as breakfast), we assumed the booking included bed and breakfast, as is the case with most hotel bookings we make. The booking page also didn't state room rates and bed and breakfast rates. We were just offered a number of room types based on facilities and size (and price).
We arrived at the hotel and they allowed us to check in early, which was great. Our room, whilst fairly small, was very clean and well presented. I was expecting something a little more as we'd opted for the deluxe (rather than the standard or superior rates which were less than the deluxe). 
The bathroom was well equipped and clean. We were overall very happy with our room.
The hotel has a great modern feel and the bar - The Blind Spot was great for our pre-dinner drinks. 
The only thing that really lets down our stay was that we were told upon enquiring with reception, that our booking didn't include breakfast. A) we weren't offered the opportunity to add breakfast to the booking, and so had made the assumption it was included in the price; and B) our booking confirmation didn't state anywhere that the booking was a room rate only.
Upon raising the issue with a member of staff, we were simply told it was a 'corporate issue' with head office and that was that.
So overall, an ok stay at the hotel, it's just a shame the booking was clearer as to what was or wasn't included, and that the hotel didn't make any attempt to fix our disappointment.",4,2016,03,14
125,Ideal Location and Tastefully Down to Earth Environment,"I had a wonderful time at this hotel in London with my parents for a few days in late December. Krystian and Sameera at the front desk really made my stay go form ordinary to extraordinary. 

I highly recommend booking a corner room in this hotel.",5,2016,03,13
125,"Perfect location, wonderful reception","Lucky enough to stay in this super hotel last week. The location is perfect for anyone taking a short break to London, within 5 minutes walk of the main theatres, Covent Garden, Lester Square and Trafalgar Square. Rooms are bright, comfortable and exceptionally presented. To top it off the staff are very welcoming and do their upmost to take care of their guests, they were genuinely interested in making our stay great for us. I look forward to staying in this hotel again.",5,2016,03,12
125,Outstanding in every way!,"Outstanding stay from start to finish. Special thanks to Krystian Robakiewicz (front desk) and (Mike Fitzgerald) for their exceptional service throughout our stay. They made us feel especially welcome and could not do enough for us. The hotel location is walking distance to theatre, shops, great dining, museums and sights. We can't wait to return.",5,2016,03,10
125,Great hotel,"We stayed March 4-7, 2016.  Great location for tourists.  Very nice hotel and wonderful staff.  Excellent quality rooms furnishings, toiletries, etc.  We were surprised to have a view of the London Eye from our roon, too.",5,2016,03,08
125,One of my Fav's,"Love this hotel. Great location, great service, great rooms. 
You really can't beat the location. 
Eaten a few times in Asia de Cuba too... Beautiful food. 
I used the gym next door.... Kinda cool. Very NYC. Brick work / iron, boxing ring, pretty people kinda place...  No spa!!!! Which I missed. Ha!
All in all, I think my first choice hotel in London. 
Love it. 
",5,2016,03,07
125,Fabulous hotel!,"My second visit, and i love this hotel!
My new 'go to'!
The staff are exceptionally nice and helpful, the rooms are beautifully decorated and spotless, having Gymbox downstairs is a definite plus, and you can't beat the location!
Would highly recommend!
And will return!",5,2016,03,07
125,Another great stay,We were staying over with family to see the Motown show.  We all had a great time and the comfort and atmosphere of the hotel was a key part of the experience. It's stylish but relaxed with quality rooms and service.   ,5,2016,03,07
125,Never fails to impress,"This is our 2nd visit to St Martins Lane and it was as excellent as the first.  From the moment we arrived the customer service was as good as we remembered, the facilities superb and our room perfect.  We would have no hesitation in recommending to everyone we know and look forward to finding a reason to visit for a 3rd time.  Thank you",5,2016,03,06
125,Fantastic drinks in Blind Spot -the hotel bar,"It's not very often I write reviews but I feel the staff in this case deserve to be recognised. From the moment my party of four walked in to the Asia de Cuba reception we were treated really well.  I booked a table in the Blind Spot Bar for pre drinks for my friend's 50th birthday.  The greeting made me feel so welcome as the staff immediately recognised my name and took me through the 'secret' door to the buzzy cosy bar.  There was no waiting around for the table (my husband's bug bear) and our waitress cheerily greeted us.  Before we had chosen our drinks we received an 'on the house' surprise which I thought was classy and thoughtful. We received just the right amount of attention during our drinks and towards the end of our time, we received another 'on the house' surprise.  All of this has already made me recommend going there to family and friends and the experience gets a massive thumbs up from us and we will definitely be back.  Thank you for making our night special.",5,2016,03,06
125,Sneaky night away,"This hotel was picked because of its central location. Right next door to Covent Garden and a short still to the theatre district. It didn't disappoint.

Although 1st impressions were that the common areas were looking a little tired the service was faultless and the room was minimal and so cool it hurt.

We had a great overnight stay in a junior suite.",4,2016,03,03
125,"modern, calm and so well located.","Service from the reservation department til the departure is very professional and staff is pleasant. The location is perfect to go out at night around Covent Garden , also hotel area is very calm to get a quiet night.
Room is in a pure style, without heavy embellishment, little bit too small to open a suitcase.",4,2016,03,01
125,Modern comfort with great location,"We really like this hotel because of its close proximity to Covent Garden and Soho.  The rooms are very nicely decorated and clean, surprisingly spacious considering its Central London location.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  We had a great view of the Covent Garden from our room and love the mood lighting. We will definitely be back when next in London - in fact, we've already booked for another stay at Easter.",5,2016,03,01
125,Near Everything,"A return visit to this hotel. We loved the view of the London Eye and Nelson's column from our room. Now that is what I call a central hotel!

We liked this area because it was possible to pop into the National Gallery at any time, and Covent Garden, which is a good spot to have breakfast, is only a ten-minute stroll away. 

Breakfast tips: Pain Quotidien or Balthasar. Do not eat at Cotes beside the hotel. When I was there the service was atrocious and the food overpriced. 

The hotel is also near lots of pubs where English ales and atmosphere are the thing. Also just 5 minutes to eat at Barrafina on Adelaide Street.

The staff were as good as ever. The secret bar was friendly and welcoming - some of these places seem uncomfortably ubercool, but this hit just the right tone. There was excellent live music on the Tuesday night and on the other nights the music was good and not so loud as to stifle conversation.

One issue we had was that our sink made noises after the water flowed out and after the loo was flushed. The noises would go away after about 20 minutes, but still a bit unneccessary. We asked for somebody to see to it, but the problem was not solved.

Nonetheless I would love to stay here every time I visited London. If only...",5,2016,02,28
125,Awesome central location,"a short walk from Charing Cross underground we found St.Martins Lane Hotel. Very modern decor (albeit with odd African artefacts scattered around)... and a very friendly and helpful front of house staff. When we arrived at our rooms, we were met with a very clean room with some funky mood lighting. Room was great... beds comfy... bathroom clean and well stocked. We had 10 days here and rooms always cleaned and restocked. Door staff always happy to assist with any requests (getting taxis, directions etc). I would be VERY happy to recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in central London.",5,2016,02,28
125,Great Central Hotel for Theatreland,"My Husband and I have stayed here a few times since it first opened.
It is ideally located for the Theatres and Covent Garden.
It is value for money considering its position.
We will continue to return.",5,2016,02,24
125,"Location, Location, Location!","Recently stayed for 8 nights and found the experience to be very enjoyable. 

Was travelling with a friend and therefore opted for a double double room which was appropriate. Room was not particularly big but this did not matter as we had many things planned for our week and really only intended on using the hotel to sleep and refresh. Could not fault the housekeeping and turn-down service. Rooms not particularly sound-proof but better than many other hotels I have stayed in. Room was very clean from our arrival and the bathroom was very comfortable. If you were planning on spending more time in-room I would suggest investigating a larger room option. Be prepared for the modern decorating. This caught me off guard initially but definitely grew on me over the course of the stay.

Staff were extremely friendly, including housekeeping staff who always made an effort to say hello in the hallways. Service from the concierge and front door was exceptional and the staff were always willing to assist and go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay. This would be my favourite aspect of the stay as I often feel uncomfortable staying at some hotels with unfriendly and unaccommodating staff. One tip is don't be afraid to ask for anything that you need. The staff here will be more than willing to assist you but they are not mind-readers! (Although they are so attentive at times that you might think they were!)

Not a cheap place to stay and eat (not helped by my county's current poor exchange rate!) and so tended to head out to eat most meals but this is fine as there is an endless supply of eateries within walking distance. That said, the food quality and dining environments were of a high standard and I would recommend checking them out at some stage during your stay.

The location, as almost every other review references, is unbeatable. Not only is there a ridiculous range of places to eat, drink and shop within a stones throw you also have a huge range of theatres and entertainment spots nearby. If you enjoy walking then you will find that most iconic London sights are within a comfortable distance and if you prefer not to walk there are a number of tube lines and bus services accessible within a couple of minutes. Front of house staff were more than happy to assist with planning and accessing transit.

Access to the gym next door and more than adequate wifi were appreciated but really should be considered standard with any modern, up-market hotel. Again, the services available were of a high standard.
  
If you are looking at staying in London, whether it be for work or pleasure, I would highly recommend St Martin's Lane. I am already planning to return at some stage.",5,2016,02,22
125,Great hotel for business trip,"The amenities of the hotel are amazing, the room was super clean and very tidy. The room was rather small though.
The bar is very nice to hang out in the night and have some drinks, although a bit too dark. The breakfast was incredibly good, especially the a la carte dishes. Amazing location!",5,2016,02,22
125,Poor Stay,"No information given on check in, tv not working requiring 2 calls to address, strange smell on corridor leading to room, room itself very small and poky. I had to constantly ask twice for anything needed. The standard of service has dropped considerable and this is no longer a 5 star establishment which would draw in clients seeking a luxurious break.
There are far better 5 star hotels in London.",2,2016,02,22
125,An ideal hotel for cultural as well as working visits,"We had originally booked a superior double which seemed nice enough but were offered an upgrade for a much nicer room, which was worth the expense - the room was lovely and the breakfast wonderful. This is the second time we stay at St Martin's and we were again very satisfied with the hotel, the staff and the sleep quality  - and of course the very central location.",5,2016,02,21
125,Great modern hotel in an amazing location,"I stayed a week in this lovely hotel in a deluxe room. It's very modern and trendy (especially compared to the traditional London hotels), The rooms are not mega huge but more than large enough with a lovely ultra comfortable bed, great technology and style. The bathroom is really really nice , well laid out with great showers with great water pressure. The rooms are well equipped including even the use of a high quality umbrella, well needed in London.

Staff are all very nice and friendly and housekeeping was flawless. I would always ring when i went out and my room was always make up immaculately when i returned.

The location of this hotel couldn't be better, it's amazing ! you are right in the heart of the theatre district where all the action is ! Trafulgar square is a minute away, covent gardens a minute away, leicester square, 30 seconds away, soho 5 minutes away. It's so cool to walk out of your hotel and be in the hustle and bustle of the action. You definitely won't starve with more quality restaurants, bars, nightclubs, casinos (all of London's casinos are a few minutes away) and shops right there.

You can get to anywhere in London from this place.

Very highly recommended hotel",5,2016,02,20
125,Amazing space,"We stayed at St Martins for one night in the city and I was speechless when walked in.
The lobby is big and with amazing taste that almost looks like a gallery. The receptionists were very polite and nice. The room was big and extremely clean with very modern and sleek decor. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows give the room and amazing view of city and sky... depending on the the floor staying. The bathroom was giant very clean and with a really nice vibe.   The location is amazing for underground connections, restaurants, London's night life and entertainment! Would recommend 100% ;)",5,2016,02,20
125,Style over Substance,"Second shot at St Martins Lane due to convenient location, but again, it really fails to deliver a 5 star experience. Hotel is impersonal, drink and food hugely overpriced , bedrooms are small and boxy, and walls so thin we could hear every movement from room next door, and the gurgling of the plumbing was very disturbing. Average shower , that was hard to direct ,no tea and coffee facilities in room ( you can request them if you can be bothered!) , large q at checkout, whilst the lobby was being hoovered ( at eleven 11am??) around us? All in all not an experience I would be in a hurry to repeat.",3,2016,02,20
125,We had a wonderful stay,"I can only comment on the room and reception staff and both have been a very positive experience.  We stayed in the past several times in the hotel and we have never been disappointed.  
The location is just perfect for us but you should check whether the underground connection is what you need otherwise you might experience quite a number of changes of the trains.",5,2016,02,20
125,Discourteous Staff,"I do not recommend Saint Martin's Hotel as I found Its bar staff are discourteous unfriendly towards hotel guests. The kitsch hotel decor masks the lack of friendliness and the staff lack of warmth 

Never Again !",1,2016,02,18
125,Pleasant stay in excellent location.,"Asked for a street view and a bathtub, and got an excellent room facing St Martins Lane with a generously sized bathtub. Very nice room. The hotel is a few steps from Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, and could not have been situated more in the middle of the nave for me. Since I asked for a room facing the street, I knew there could be some noise. However, that was only in the daytime I heard some. Slept like a log in the night.
I must admit the bed was a little too firm for me. But, that is me. Difficult to please everybody in such a matter. And I had a very nice sleep, anyway. 
A calandiva plant on the wall. Nice with a live plant in the room. Not sure about it being so high up, though. 
Very friendly and service minded staff. They were there to please and make sure I had a good stay. 
Breakfast also a nice experience. And their granola was to die for. Simply the best! Perhaps the main reason I had breakfast on the hotel several mornings. I like to breakfast around, when in London. Not so much this time!
Thanks to all of staff who made my stay so comfortable.",5,2016,02,18
125,Morgan Group original and one of the best,"Super luxe cool contemporary hotel. The refurbish is clean sleak and comfortable. Supercool touches like the lighting, comfy huge beds and a luxe bathroom suite. The products are over generous. 

Amazing friendly good looking staff. Thee perfect chic city hotel. Love it and will be back.",5,2016,02,14
125,Romantic Evening ,"A great stay at st martins lane....

Aged 25/30

Was a fantastic evening a great location and the hotel is very very nice.

It was a special night for us due to a proposal for my other half the same night.

Car parking is NCP very expensive but very close was around ¬£29 for about 7 hours.

The bar in the hotel is WoW veryy nice and romantic and classy....also the cocktails were very nice.

Dinner at asia de cuba was lovely aswell staff we're very nice and told us the whole menu and what to recommended.

We had our room decorated by belle and also some nice treats by the hotel.

Huge thanks to belle for a great help.

We stayed in the garden dulexue suite which was very nice.
Was raining slightly but outdoor area is so nice to relax and have a drink.

Overall a great experience definitely recommend this hotel and restaurants.

",5,2016,02,14
125,2nd visit was much more pleasant than the first couldn't fault it! ,After staying at this hotel once before and not having such a good experience our second stay was beautiful and they definitely made up for the first. Check in was smooth with the receptionist giving us directions for the evening and providing us with a map and our stay couldn't have been better. We had champagne waiting in our room on arrival and our room was stunning and had been upgraded to a deluxe double. The room was very modern and had a bath as well as a shower including all necessities at an extra cost. Our stay was wonderful we didn't eat at the restaurants or go to the bar but we did order breakfast on the morning through room service. A lovely modern hotel right in the heart of London with May restaurants and bars on its doorstep would definitely recommend and stay again. ,5,2016,02,13
125,"Fantastic location, gorgeous, cool rooms.","When you turn up at this hotel, you are struck by what an ugly building it is, but as you walk through the revolving doors, and breathe in the gorgeous scent, and spot the quirky furnishings, you soon forget the exterior!
The rooms are small, minimal but beautifully done.bed was too hard  for my liking, so didn't get much sleep, but the shower was great! Shame no tea or coffee making facilities in the room ( you have to ask house keeping). There is a hidden bar, opens at 5.00. Very clever, secret opening! Fab breakfast if a little pricey but would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,02,09
125,A friend in need...,"We live adjacent to this hotel and recently suffered a burst pipe in our flat which left us suddenly without anywhere to stay. St Martins Lane Hotel welcomed us (and the guests who were staying with us at the time) with open arms, and the staff were empathetic and helpful throughout. We stayed there for 10 days and it was our home away from home. We will be visiting Blindspot, Asia de Cuba and the Den regularly in the future.",5,2016,02,07
125,"Friendly, Welcoming, Professional. Excellent service & Superb Restuarant","Having recently stayed at St Martins Lane I cannot praise the hotel staff highly enough. Everyone I encountered were friendly helpful and consummately professional. My room was spacious and lovely with a great shower !! The Asia De Cuba restaurant food was simply superb. Zsolt  the Duty Manager along with Aga, Keystian on the front desk and Rafel in events were all amazing and so helpful.... Thank you!!  Mike the Concierge could not have been more helpful and everyone's attention to detail was duly noted and appreciated. The Bellman Charlie & Sam were brilliant at looking after my guests. Thank you all so much I would not hesitate to come back and will soon  ",5,2016,02,06
125,More 4 star than 5,"Amazing location and a great downstairs lobby, bar and restaurant, but the rooms weren't 'wow' 5 star and neither were the staff.
From the outside it's tired looking and a bit disappointing, but the modern interior is good. No door staff though and there was no one on reception when we arrived, then it was a very bog standard registration and a charge of ¬£200 for 'incidentals' which made it sound like they thought we were going to trash the room.
The room is neon essentially which I found a bit harsh, but the mini bar is amazing and there are plenty of nice additions like USB charging, plug ins for your music and dressing gowns.  Only one bottle of water which I thought was a bit stingey and the mini bar was very expensive, but they did put a little cake in the room as we said it was a birthday treat (although they took it the next day even though we wanted too finish it off!) 
I think I prefer a more traditional 5 star so for me this was a good 4 star...",4,2016,02,06
125,"Loved the Hotel, Location, Minor Feedback 4.0+ rating imho (probably 4.5+)","So first, let me say, I only stayed for one day there so I would have to stay longer to truly give it a 5.

Location: 5 Star... I love this location. You step outside the door and you are literally immediately in a major area of food, shopping, shows etc. I don't mean walk and you are close. I mean you step out the door and you are looking at it. There is also a box Gym like 3 doors (maybe 2) down.

There are all kinds of foods / drink locations / shows to see so I cannot express how wonderful the location is. So much to do and see in this location.

Hotel: 4 Ok I can't really go above a 4. Not because there is anything wrong with the hotel, but because I didn't really get around all of it. However the hotel for what I did see was very clean, the elevators worked, carpets were clean etc. So I saw no reason to not give a 4 (or more if I had stayed longer)

Gym: NA, sorry I didn't use it so I cannot say

Restaurant: NA, I looked at it, seemed cool, but as I didn't eat, I cannot fairly comment on it. Smelled good though :-). Either way there is so much food etc to have it doesn't matter.

Starbucks Literally 15 feet away. Right across the other side of the street. Since these guys are on a side street, you step outside and look in front of you like 15-20 feet and bingo it's there.

Front Staff: 5. The people checking me in were superb and Sam, whom helped me with my bags, getting me cabs etc, was fantastic. I cannot say anything bad and I did hear other employees dealing with customers and it was always great

Getting Cabs: no issues there unlike some places I have seen

Room: (5) Wow, I loved the room. But you better like modern. The room was a king size room and it was about 14 feet wide. Great long desk. Right next to the desk on the wall had HDMI, USB charging plugs, power plugs etc. It was really nice to have all of that honestly. The bed was super comfortable. It was modern, so think large, firm, lights were super cool (even colored). 

Bathroom: (5) awesome. everything was awesome. Large, comfortable, just plain clean as heck. Although it costs money they have shavers and stuff in the room that you can purchase. While I didn't need too, many times I do and its easier than walking around to find them in a pinch. they provide really nice shampoo etc but just tiny thing, the shampoo was peppermint and bothered my asthma a little, but NOT their fault... I could have mentioned it. The soup etc was great

Shower (5) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - holy cow the shower was amazing seriously. I love a lot of water pressure. This shower LOL pretty much was almost too powerful. Just be careful the tiniest of changes and you could get burned, so please watch your kids.

Nice little TV, gave me some free water. It was cool lighting and beautiful big windows. One note on the windows, is that it has built in blinds between the glass. You cannot open / close it more (at least I could not) so the view was not that great, it would have been if I could :-). maybe I should have asked how to do it.

Internet (5) - honestly I only used the Wi-Fi not the high speed (I had the wrong type of cat5 cable). And it was great. I even watched Hulu and Netflix and VPN'd into my work so it worked just great. Now I didn't pay for it, since it was part of my corporate rate, so if you have to pay, I don't know the rate sorry. I do know they provide you an option to upgrade to like 35mbs up / down but  I didn't do that.

AC / Heat (5) totally worked, unlike many other hotels who turn off the AC in the winter time, which I loved because I would have been too hote.

Now for the things I would like to give a little feedback on 

1. They have (in my room at least) two giant doors. I mean literally floor to ceiling doors. One on each side of the main room. One that closes off the bathroom and one that closes off the ""little hallway"" that leads to the door. Helps with noise etc.

NOTE: I mention this because the Thermostat is behind the one for the bathroom and no one mentioned where it was (luckily I found it), although I wish they would have told me originally

2. The shower head doesn't move which is ok, however in the floor there are some... little decorative lines cut in. They are pretty long and deep and about 3/4 inch wide. For me it caused me to have to stand in . on them and it was uncomfortable on my feet. fill them :-) or put down something so it doesn't do this.

3. The rooms are not very... quiet. I had someone next to me who was clearly sick. I could hear them coughing for hours and hours. It sucked big time, but... 

4. The really annoying thing and the reason I cannot give it more than a 4 this time. for absolutely no reason, house keeping came and banged on my door at 8am.. why in God's name did you come to my room at 8 AM. At what point, would that ever been acceptable? He realized I was not happy and apologized, but didn't matter, now I was awake. I also had the do not disturb sign on the door so again, why at 8am, with the sign (which is huge) would you knock on my door.

anyhoo, although there was a snafu, I really did like the hotel a lot.",4,2016,02,04

Restaurant is also very nice decorated but dont like type of cuban style food, main reason our 4 stars",4,2016,01,21
125,Great Staff but billing issues sullied otherwise nice stay,"Hotel delivered a great unique experience.  Has a nice trendy artsy vibe.  Staff was excellent in every area of operation except when trying to resolve a billing issue which never should have arisen in the first place.  Somehow, the front desk/finance department could not resolve an issue where the check out folio showed a shortage of payment on a fully pre-paid room.",4,2016,01,18
125,Gentle calm in the middle of London's busyness,"This hotel is right in the center of London.  Some of the most major attractions are within walking distance, or easily accessed through various Tube stations nearby.  Its location also puts it very close to the Theatre district. Great restaurants, cafes and dining areas are all around you. Beyond the location - its the utter calm and peace of the hotel's rooms stand out. If you are an introvert - that needs a place to get downtime and to relax after a busy day of business meetings and socializing - then the hotel rooms here are perfect.  Calm white decor everywhere - soothing LED lighting.  I would recommend a higher floor or a location away from the front facing street.  The staff are just excellent as well.  Have been at this hotel now for five stays.  Will go back.",5,2016,01,16
125,for the Young at Heart!,"The hotel is very central, in a busy neighborhood. Great if you wanna stroll around Covent Garden, the theaters,...
Design of the hotel: definitely a design for the young at heart! There is music playing everywhere, for the elder it might be too loud. But not for me ;-) . Love the lounge on the right side of the entrance. The restaurant looks nice, but due to the layout there is no daylight which is always nice when having breakfast.
I just adore the bar!!! This is a hidden spot, right in the middle.. Just look for the hand, and you will find the door. The bar is very dark, but for a bar I think that is great! Service: great, same as in the lounge! 
Breakfast: well, there is a very small buffet, most of breakfast is ordered √† la carte, which I 'm not particularly fan of. I prefer a buffet, goes faster, and always nice to have a lot of options in the morning.
Rooms: Ok. Not ""wow"" but ok. For some strange reasons, the hallways gave me the creeps. Too 'cold' (the light blue and white color made it look very cheap to me), and not very 'welcoming'. Felt like in a basement.
The hotel is a great choice for people in their 20'ies, 30'ies, 40'ies, with a very central location.",4,2016,01,14
125,Trendy hotel best location,"We stayed at This hotel as we wanted to be central to everywhere we wanted to go and it was ! 5 min walk to Covent Garden ( a must go ) 2 mins to Leicester square ( nearest tube stop) 7 mins to Piccadily circus and Soho and 15 mins to Oxford st shopping . Hotel swanky , trendy , clean . Rooms spacious and great restaurant Asian/Cuban ($$$$)",5,2016,01,14
125,THIS IS COMFORT AT IT'S FOOLISHNESS,"Everything from the street, in the lift and the floor corridors gives an opinion opposite than what you feel in the room.
The rooms are crazy comfy, and mind resting, spa like
I tried the suites , corner L rooms and all, on personal trips.
I have seldom felt a soothe atmosphere in any other hotel, this one is my little sin.
I always try to upgrade for the same price, and it always work  
I am not a fan of hotel rooms, but I feel at home when in this one.",5,2016,01,12
125,A Great Find,"I loved this hotel!  The rooms must have been designed by a woman. The beds are so comfortable with crisp white clean wonderful sheets, fluffy pillow, comfy duvet. The room has a bit of whimsy edge which I loved, fresh colors and lots and lots of light plus large windows.  The flat surfaces in the bathroom for cosmetics and shelving and great bath products. I travel a lot and have been in many of the finest hotels and I really hated leaving this one. The staff was so helpful and friendly, loved them! Don't miss the tea room with their whimsical art. The location is great too,walking distance to Theatres, St. martins in the Field, Opera house, the Tube. I thought the price was very fair.",5,2016,01,10
125,Fabulous Hotel & Great Location,"We stayed at SML Hotel on Friday night. We arrived before the normal check in time and our room was ready. We had been upgraded to a Loft Room which was very much appreciated. 

The room was huge with floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides. The bathroom with huge bath, an amazing shower and lovely toiletries. 

Despite being just off Leicester Square you could not hear any outside noise whatsoever. It was so peaceful. 

Before leaving the hotel for dinner we took drinks in Blind Spot. The service was excellent, a great bar in the heart of London.  

We returned to Blind Spot for drinks after our dinner where they presented my partner with a ""Happy Birthday"" dessert which we all tucked in to. 

We fell into bed, which was so comfortable. After a good nights sleep we had breakfast. The food and service was excellent.  

After breakfast we checked out, having had an excellent stay. We will certainly return.

Many thanks Belle for looking after us, and for the plate of macaroons!!! ",5,2016,01,10
125,Excellent hotel at a great location!,"I stayed at St. Martins Lane for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend in March 2015, and was more than pleasantly surprised by the experience. This hotel is fresh and posh, yet welcoming, warm and friendly. Even though they were undergoing refurbishing of the lobby area, they had put their best effort to keep the stylish appearance. There was absolutely no noise from the street nor from workers, though our room was facing the busy St. Martins Lane. 

We were met with a room draped in soft light, a bed with crisp sheets and huge pillows, candles lit in the bathroom accompanied by a filled and foamy bath tub, a bottle of Champagne on ice and even a hand written card welcoming us (thanks to the lovely concierge, Mike!). I've never felt more welcome in a hotel ever before! The room was spacious and the bathroom even more so. We also really appreciated the nifty electronic equipment such as bluetooth connection to the stereo speakers and bedside USB-chargers. And of course the mood lighting. 

With the beautiful and exciting city of London just a skip away from the entrance, friendly and proffessional staff, and great value, this is indeed a stay I'll never forget and would like to repeat as soon as possible. I'd point out, however; it's probably best suited for a couple's weekend or a trip with the girls, more than traveling with the family.

Thank you so much for making our weekend very special. We look forward to coming back!",5,2016,01,09
125,Nice Hotel,"Staff at reception were welcoming and friendly, the lady who checked us in explained a few things to us. Lobby of hotel is really nice and quirky. The rooms are well laid out and the different lighting options added a new dimension - haven't seen this use of lighting in any other hotel before.  Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was big.  If you forgot any necessaries (toiletries) you could purchase them there.

We went to the Blindspot which had the right amount of ambience and it was easy to relax here if we weren't going out to the opera I think we would have spent the evening there.

Will certainly be back",5,2016,01,08
125,Quite good,"This is a modern style hotel ( like a W ) right in the heart of the theatre district in London. Handy to everything.

Rooms were small but clean and functional.  Bathroom was very good - good hot water and shower strength. Mini bar etc.

Walls a bit thin, i.e. you can hear what's going on next door if they get a bit carried away at night!!??

A bit pricey but you are in the heart of London.

",4,2016,01,07
125,Beware of thin walls and noisy naughty neighbours!,"We stayed at St Martins Lane London Hotel for 5 days either side of New Years Eve and thought that the location was fantastic.  The rooms are very modern and clean and the staff efficient.  I have to say though that I have never been woken up in the middle of the night by noisy amorous neighbours, I found it very disturbing.......to say the least, and was extremely thankful that my children who were sharing the room on the other side of us were not in our room!!  The walls are so thin!  I did complain the next day to staff and they offered us an upgraded room but we needed to stay close to our children so didn't move.",4,2016,01,05
125,"Extremely clean, convenient location","And Really quiet. Quality not to be underestimated downtown London. It is not the cheapest accommodation you can find in the area, but I would go back there anytime.
The only thing I tend to criticize is that every little extra (internet included after the 3rd day) has a price. Probably unnecessary.
Booking on line good deals are possible directly with their website.",4,2016,01,05
125,Fabulous start to 2016,"My husband and I stayed here for new year. Fabulous hotel. Gorgeous, spotlessly clean room. Staff were very friendly, nothing was to much trouble. 
Visit the secret bar- very quirky. Take a torch though! 
Loved this hotel. Would love to stay again.",5,2016,01,04
125,"Classy, trendy, comfortable","This was my wife and my third stay and it continues to delivery excellent customer service. All staff we interacted with were professional, cheery and aiming to deliver a high standard. 

Excellent in room comfort. Bed was very good. Would have appreciated hot drink making facilities.

Location is excellent. NCP car park round the back. Easy walking distance to Covent Garden, Traf. Sq., Hyde Park.

Highly recommend St Martins Lane Hotel. ",5,2016,01,02
125,Cool excellence,"Nothing negative at St Martins Lane. Perfect position, modern good size rooms. Unique decor. May be a little 'too cool' for some. Was travelling alone for work and would stay elsewhere with the family simply because the clientele is more 20 or 30 somethings. ",4,2016,01,01
125,"Feedback from TOFFOLI, M","Excellent in every way. The staff could not be more courteous, helpful, yet ""not in your face"".  Our room was generous in size and all amenities were in good order. The location is close to theatres, museums, the palace, and many other attractions. 
I will return & recomend you. ",5,2015,12,31
125,Ready to book my next visit,"This is a wonderful, modern style hotel in a superb location for visiting the sights of London. It's location was perfect for us. Covent garden, West End theaters, Leicester Square, etc are all within several minutes walking distance. Our reservations at Clos Maggiore and the Ivy meant we had a 5 - 10 minutes walk for dinner (reviews coming).
The staff is delightful and pleasant. I must comment on the helpfulness of the doorman at check out who had to walk quite a bit from the hotel to secure a taxi for our trip to the station. You know how it can be, taxis everywhere and as soon as you want one, there's no sign ... But thanks to the hotel staff for quickly helping out. 
The hotel style is minimalist and sharp. It does take a while to work out the lighting, and I never did find the switch for one lamp in the room. We had a junior loft suite which was a corner room and just lovely. It was large with lots of floor to ceiling windows and a slight view of the London Eye. The bathroom was large and well designed. The toiletries were nice and always replenished every day. Many times, even at luxury hotels, housekeeping can fail to replenish some of the toiletries, but not here. A good job, housekeeping. The bed was very comfortable too. Overall, a quiet and peaceful night's sleep.
We did not eat at the hotel but had a drink at the very London priced hotel bar. It's a cosy, dark lounge that has a hidden entrance in the lobby. A pleasant place for a drink on arrival but at ¬£14 for a cocktail and ¬£5 for a rather small bottle of beer, we didn't spend too much time there. 
I'd definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again on our next trip to London.",5,2015,12,30
125,Pre Christmas stay in the heart of London,"We returned to St ML after a very enjoyable stay at Easter but before the renovations were finished and wanted to see what the hotel was like. Again we had a wonderful stay with excellent, professional and friendly service. All the staff were great from the bell boys to the room service, from the concierge to the check-in team. We all enjoyed a great combination of breakfasts. 
The location is excellent fro whatever you want to do and with Convent Garden on your doorstep.",5,2015,12,29
125,Comfort and good service in the heart of the west End,"This hotel has really comfortable bedrooms and bathrooms. The breakfast is great and the restaurant, Asia de Cuba serves interesting food brilliantly. Blind Spot is a great cocktail bar and the lounge a relaxing haven in the centre of town.
Above all the staff are exceptionally friendly and efficient.",5,2015,12,29
125,Won't be back ,"Booked this hotel as my usual one was full. I was very disappointed and won't return. 

We booked a large room big enough to fit 4 people (there were 3 of us) yet there were only enough mugs etc for 2 people. 

The room itself was VERY noisy. The walls are so thin you can hear the conversations in the room next to you. We were also next to the lift which was so loud it kept me awake. We did ask to move rooms,however, we were told all the large rooms were next to lifts.

The worst thing about the room was the bathroom. The bathroom has no door therefore if you're coming in or out the shower other people in the room can see you if they walk past. Very uncomfortable and weird! 

The staff at this hotel are also very rude and took ages to accommodate us. I phones for tea and waited about 30 mins. When it had not arrived I phoned again. The tea still hadn't returned but I was greeted by a very rude woman at my door who asked me what exactly I wanted. When I said I had phoned for tea twice she barked at me to call down again. Not very helpful! When the tea finally arrived the mugs had no handles so they were too hot to hold. 

My do not disturb sign was also removed twice which resulted in me being disturbed. Good job I wasn't in the doorless bathroom at the time!!

Overall there are much better hotels in London. Do yourself s favour and avoid this hotel! ",2,2015,12,27
125,Fabulous,"What a great hotel so central to everything, clean friendly with the most amazing secret bar. A must for anyone wanting to walk the west end oh and they employ the most beautiful door men in London. Cuban resturant amazing can't say anything bad about this place",5,2015,12,26
125,Great location great staffs pro,Excellent Hotel. Stylish and quirky with great atmosphere if you have teenagers with you. Location is superb. Managers very professional but with great customer skills and sort problems out rapidly. It's like a bit of LA in London!,5,2015,12,24
125,Two nights in London before Christmas,"Great convenient location.
Very good helpful service
The rooms initially I felt austere - it's a minimalist style but actually very comfortable and extremely well equipped.
I only ate breakfast and it was fine - nothing special - pancakes were hard but coffee very good - buffet nice enough but not a very big selection.
I will stay again and likely to return in January.",4,2015,12,23
125,Most favourite hotel on the planet,"Best hotel.  Consistently fabulous.  Great staff, clean, simple, functional and beautifully decorated rooms.  Can't fault it the accommodation.

The room service is fab - highly recommend the chicken Cesar salad and the NZ Pinot Noir is spot on.  

I always choose to say at St Martin's Lane Hotel when in London - the location is fantastic, central, great shopping, good casual food options and is genuinely safe and central for a woman travelling on her own. ",5,2015,12,22
125,Luxury hotel accommodation in central London location,"Our stay in this very comfortable, luxury hotel in excellent London location on St. Martin's Lane was a joy. The customer service was (almost) faultless, the only exception being a spontaneous drinks and lunch where clearly the staff were overwhelmed by Christmas revellers. However, their attentiveness and professionalism were exceptional and every effort was made to make our stay relaxed and enjoyable.",5,2015,12,21
125,Xmas stay,"Fantastic hotel, with the best staff, centrally located right between Leicester Square Tube and Covent Garden.
The room offered everything you could want, and a quick call to room service and tea and coffee facilities were promptly delivered
Room Service was exceptional, on point!
We will be staying again.",5,2015,12,21
125,St Martin's Lane December '15,"Warm and welcoming.  Contemporary design, rooms stylish and bright with mood lighting.  Tea and coffee making facilities available upon request.  Fabulous bathroom amenities.
Ideally located, minutes walk to Covent Garden and in the heart of Theatreland
",4,2015,12,20
125,Xmas ballet trip,"I booked the hotel for a special trip with my daughter and granddaughter on our trip to see The Nutcracker at ROH.  We stayed in the double double loft suite which was great, comfortable beds, could have done with a menu of pillows though for me.  Everything was good until breakfast which was very lack lustre, eggs over cooked, bacon under cooked, pancakes heavy and lumpen, left uneaten by granddaughter which is almost unheard of and to top it all 2 waitresses who seemed to be schooled in the art of ignore the customer who clearly wants another cup of coffee and has to call out to get her attention!!  I would happily stay here again, but would probably go out for breakfast and avoid the restaurant, sorry to say.",4,2015,12,20
125,Modern trendy hotel but very disappointed with....,"Great location to Covent Garden, Soho, Leicester Square etc. The hotel itself is a modern trendy hotel, loved the bedroom - fantastic decor with very comfortable bedding.
Only one down side of the hotel is the close proximity of the next door apartments and windows - no privacy!
Customer facing staff were all very pleasant and professional. Unfortunately the vegetarian food option was very poor, other than Cesar salad with a slight twist seemed to be the only option. What really annoyed me was the lunch on offer did not have a veg option and therefore I kindly requested the waiter, who I must add was very accommodating and professional, whether the chef could do a simple  cheese/ tomato sandwich for two people ( my colleague sat next to me was also also a vegetarian) nothing more or less.The waiter felt this was feasible and went to the kitchen. A short while later he returned without the said sandwich and replied that the chef said "" the cheese platter is already on the table as well as some bread rolls and therefore I have all I need!"" I demanded that the chef came out to have a chat... ten minutes later a single plate came out with a single sandwich - to be shared!!!. For the hotel rate of this hotel this was not what you would expect. The waitering team felt embarrassed but they were smashing. I ate at the hotel that evening and though the food was well presented the actual taste was not up to the expected standard. 
Shame about",3,2015,12,19
125,"Very friendly, very central...just perfect!","Highly recommended. The staff were great, the rooms amazing. And only a short walk from everything. Will definitely stay there again. I stayed for so nights, and the night staff offered an amazing turn down service, and the daily cleaning was meticulous! Really amazing hotel!!!
Thank you to all the amazing staff there!",5,2015,12,19
125,Maiden but somehow soulless,"Had wanted to visit here and saw an offer so indulged. However not such an indulgence!! Restaurant very noisy - we didn't use our reservation. Bar interesting and dark!! Room soulless.  Ac kept turning itself off so kept waking up very hot.  Had to request tea making facilities and they sent one tea bag!!
Very modern - maybe I'm too old!  Staff were great.  Def  a young trendy place.  It was ok but there are places I would rather go.  Also no EE phone reception!!!",3,2015,12,18
125,Surprisingly quiet!,"I booked this recently for a 3 night stay. I had requested a quiet room, but given the central location of this hotel, I had packed earplugs & fully expected to need them. Our room on the sixth floor, however, was wonderfully quiet. We never heard a sound any of the nights.  We didn't spend much time in our room but it suited us very well. They will bring kettle/coffee/tea to your room, if requested, which we did the first day & the coffee was replenished each day.  Bed was comfortable & bedding/pillows were really comfortable too.

We only ate breakfast in the hotel. Hot food & buffet were nice but the cost can run up quite easily. If you only fancy a coffee & pastry there are plenty coffee places within a short walking distance.

Hotel location was great for what we planned to do. All staff we encountered were pleasant, efficient & friendly.  Very pleasant stay.

Be aware that it can be a bit of a party hotel at weekends. We passed one room on our floor late on a Saturday night & there was clearly a loud party going on indoors. We were glad our room wasnt next door.",4,2015,12,17
125,Modern hotel in fabulous location ,"Absolutely loved my stay at St Martin's Lane. A very short walk to Covent Garden and Soho, close to many fantastic restaurants with Asia de Cuba and a great bar inside the hotel, amazing gym next door and close to the nightlife (theaters, clubs, bars). Highly recommend. ",5,2015,12,16
125,Theatre weekend to the Noel Coward St Martins lane,"Stayed one night as it was our son's birthday first time in a modern hotel probably suited our son and his wife more than my wife and I ..very glad we stayed good clean hotel staff were polite and helpful down side hotel is a bit of a maze seem to have a more laid back approach than more traditional hotels .the room bar is worth seeing expensive  but brilliant,would recommend this hotel just for the experience. great position also parking underneath everything we wanted",4,2015,12,15
125,Love this place!,"The staff here are friendly and kind the rooms are all unique and bright The lounge downstairs is lively and fun, you have access to an amazing gym next-door for free, plus walking distance to many other great restaurants and sites! We love coming back to St. Martin's Lane! And Biata in the lounge is SO friendly kind and genuine and it is so nice when the staff remembers you! Vinny and the bell guys remembered us too, it makes it feel like coming home :)",5,2015,12,15
125,Nice Hotel,"The staff in this hotel were very good.  They worked incredibly hard and were genuinely concerned about out stay.  The breakfasts were spectacular; the have a very talented chef.  It was not cheap, but much better than other 5 star hotels.

The only downside is that, while nice and clean and spacious, the rooms were quite basic in decor and furnishing.  They were more akin to a 4 star hotel.

Still, this is a very good place to stay and is in a great location.  We will stay here again and recommend it to friends.",4,2015,12,14
125,Nice Boutique Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel as it was our office party.  My room was very modern and well equipped.  Bed was comfortable and had good bathroom and working area.  Very modern ""white"" d√©cor and lighting.  I only had breakfast at the hotel which was not cheap ¬£26 but have to say it was very good with main English breakfast cooked fresh and served not the usual buffet!  Also excelled buffet of fuits, meats and breads.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  Recommend this hotel",5,2015,12,13
125,"Fun, central",St Martin's Lane is a fun hotel with a great location. Great alternative to a more traditional hotel--great neighborhood with lots to explore. My favorite is the little bakery around the corner with the 'gelato' sign out front.,4,2015,12,11
125,Incredible Hotel in London ! Maybe the best I've been too !,"Ideally located next to Covent garden this hotel is beautiful and very comfortable.
Design of the lobby and rooms is great !
Maybe expensive but totally worth it !
If not enough budget to sleep at least stop by to have a drink at the bar !

125,Business Trip,"I was recently in London for business & booked into the St Martin Hotel due to its location and good reviews on Tripadvisor.
The hotel is located 2 mins away from Leicester Square Underground station and within 5 mins walk to Picaddily, Trafalga Square & China Town.
Its ideal for quality restaurants, bars & the theatre.
The hotel is modern & vibrant for London.  The staff were very helpful in during my stay.
A special mention should go to the Gym Box next door which you get complimentary access to if you are a hotel guest.  It was amazing, the best gym I have frequented in my life.
If you are in London & want a central location, this hotel is hard to beat.",5,2015,12,11
125,quite good,"Is not a five stars hotel. The body lotion was not included , we HAD to pay separately. It hadn't toothbrush and no toothpaste in our room . Nobody spoke spanish in the reception . Many details they have to improve to be a really five stars hotel.",4,2015,12,10
125,always a brilliant stay :),"When we visit London (once a quarter) we always stay here. Hotel is in a prime spot - the service is always excellent, staff always friendly - special mention to Isobel Ringis who always makes us feel very welcome :)

only negative note - prices in the hotel bar, especially for champagne are well over the odds and you cant see the prices on the price list as it is so dark in there!",5,2015,12,09
125,"Comfortable Hotel, Great Location","I just stayed at St Martin's Lane for 6 nights. The staff were very courteous and helpful - especially the bell staff. My room was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was bigger than I expected and the fact that the shower was hot immediately and the pressure was good, also a plus. Breakfast was included with my room and was quite generous. Do visit the Blind Spot and also the little library for a glass of wine or tea. 
The best part of the hotel is the location - closest to Leicester Square Station, it is easy to get anywhere. Barrafina (amazing tapas) and great gelato are just around the corner. Also very close to the Harp.
I will definitely stay here again.",4,2015,12,08
125,Another fabulous stay at the fabulous St Martins Lane,The garden room was totally awesome. Very big thanks to James from the reservations team for doing absolutely everything to make my trip perfect. Also all the front desk team too - as usual Morgan's group have employed the very best. I can never come to London and stay anywhere other than here or Mondrian. ,5,2015,12,07
125,Excellent family-friendly hotel!,"We stayed here over Thanksgiving week and everything was lovely. The location of this hotel is perfect for easy access to theaters, tube stations, restaurants and shopping. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. Henry and Michael at the concierge desk went above and beyond to give us tips and secure tickets to the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Our room (237) was spacious and CLEAN! We traveled with our daughters (ages 4 and 7) and the room was perfect for us. They loved the ability to change the color of the lighting in the room. Added bonus: the water pressure in the shower was great and the products were fantastic. We will be back; our girls are still raving about our cool ""home while in London"".",5,2015,12,06
125,"A nice hotel, with splendid employees and great location","My favorite in London. Great location, Nice staff. Breakfast has improved. Still on the expencive side. Rooms a Nice, good and clean. And the beds are great. Cool Gym in the basement.

125,Superb December stay!,"Wonderful stay, great rooms,  we were upgraded to stay in the nicest room with the best veiw that I have encountered in London (405). On return we found a lovely surprise birthday cake for my wife as well! Only marked service down as it took forever to get served in blindspot (but it was Friday night so maybe a little harsh!) overall will certainly return. ",4,2015,12,06

125,Luxury stay,We were given a complimentary stay following a flood on a previous visit. Every effort was made to give us a lovely stay and we couldn't have been treated any better. Great room (very comfortable and luxurious) and great service. The lounge bar was a nice alternative to the main bar and breakfast in the restaurant the following morning was good quality. ,5,2015,12,05

125,Modern hotel in the center of London,"All what you need: 
the rooms are clean modern (USB all over) and functional,
breakfast food is great. Reach bars.
Even very good GYM contiguously.
and of course very good location, few minutes walk from all the famous places",5,2015,12,05
125,Perfect Urban Oasis,"We stayed for two nights in one of the Garden Rooms. This was slightly unusual in being on the first floor ‚Äì the ‚Äògarden‚Äô was a topless cube within the room, about 8ft square and well appointed with plants, bistro table and chairs. It also had an ashtray, which was why we‚Äôd booked it.
The rest of the room was small but exceptionally well designed. Not a square inch was wasted, yet the room did not feel cramped. The lighting was flexible and either bright or atmospheric to suit your mood. The shower was brilliant.
Downsides? The bed was only king size. There were no tea/coffee making facilities ‚Äì this would have meant automatically losing two stars in such an expensive room, but the location near Covent Garden meant that coffee could be bought to go from a dozen places within a block‚Äôs walk. There was something about ‚Äòasking‚Äô for a kettle, but that‚Äôs not the point: for that money, I would expect one in the room.
Finally, the staff were superb throughout our stay, and the room was both spotless on arrival and kept that way by room service.",5,2015,12,03
125,Another Fabulous Experience,"We cannot say enough about how much we love this property.  The staff is beyond helpful, they are friendly, fun, and do not hesitate to help with any need.  We had many of our friends and family stay this time for our wedding, and everyone raved.  ",5,2015,12,02
125,Very lovely hotel in brilliant location,We stayed hotel for 1 night in November on a Friday night and the hotel is a great place to stay. Brilliant location to walk to restaurants and shops and there is a lovely cocktail bar which is hidden away where the staff were really friendly and great service.

125,Amazing stay,"1St  time stayed in London and the whole stay was amazing. 
 Beautiful hotel very clean, we had to wait for our room and was pushed for time so we got a free upgrade. They also made my husband extra special by bringing him a cake to our room for his birthday. No faults at all worth the stay, great staff, great location, beautiful hotel!, thank u",5,2015,11,23

125,Day delegate,"Came here for a conference recently. First problem was you couldn't even see the hotel from the outside - taxi driver had to point it out! No one greeted me so I just made my way to the crowd loitering in reception. Conference room was very cramped, you couldn't get your chair out without the person sitting next to you getting up too and had two smallish TV screens which meant presentations were hard to see. All the breaks and the lunch we're really carb heavy with nothing on offer for gluten free. Toilets were strange too - the doors were exceptionally heavy and difficult to open. Overall wasn't that impressed.",3,2015,11,21
125,Asa de Cuba,"the restaurant was delicious, the atmosphere and decor outstanding -  and the service impeccable. call me a dumb american, but i just couldn't figure out how to get into the WC to use the toilet - i had to be shown!!! Would go again in a heartbeat!",4,2015,11,18
125,...few areas for improvement which could have spoilt anniversary weekend.,"We stayed here as part of our anniversary weekend.

On arrival we were greeted warmly, our room wasn't ready (it was 2pm but guarantee check in was 3pm). We had booked the romance package which included a free room upgrade and late check out. We had booked a deluxe room so was expecting an upgrade to  a studio. We were told on arrival this was not available so we had been given a deluxe room on the 8th floor - no apology or refund was offered.

The room itself was lovely, as you would expect at those prices. Room service was quick and efficient.

The next morning we experienced a few issues with our late check out. Twice housekeeping entered the room even thought we had do not disturb highlighted. Then at 1:30 pm we had security at our door asking why we had no left. When I called reception they stated they had nothing to show we had late check out. Again, no apology was offered,

We were also surprised that the hotel bar does not open past 10:30 on a Sunday. We arrived back after dinner and was told we could not order a drink. 

I feel this could have been an amazing stay but instead it just seemed to lack that polished service you expect of the brand. It would be nice if a manager contacted me to discuss this. I should note, Rebecca who works in reservations has to have the worst phone manner I have encountered and I would suggest getting her retrained.",3,2015,11,18
125,Excellent location and hotel,"Brought my family here for a weekend break and enjoyed all the aspects of this hotel.  The room was not quite ready when we arrived (light bulbs were broken so they had them fixed while we waited)   we received complementary drinks at the bar to compensate for what was a very short wait in the end. Room service was excellent as we badgered them several times for minor items during the course of our stay, they always delivered with a smile. We stayed in a junior suite and found the room comfortable and spacious by London standards.  Loved the mattress, and had a very restful nights sleep. 
      ",5,2015,11,16
125,Amazing Hotel and Staff,Was there celebrating my husbands birthday with friends - even before arrival Isabelle Fowkes was so helpful and made sure everything was just as requested and even provided us with little extras that we did not expect - the Blind Spot bar was a hidden gem and when they didn't have the cocktails we had asked for they gave us a complimentary glass of champagne each - the dinner at the restaurant was also amazing although we did order far too much - we will definitely be returning,5,2015,11,16
125,Great experience,"My family (my wife and my twin daughters) enjoyed a lot!
Especially because of the location and my daughters particularly enjoyed the fantastic breakfast!
For sure I will recommend it to my friends and work mates.

125,Fab boutique hotel,I love this hotel. The staff are great. Stress free check in! Location is perfect and the rooms well designed. In fact I think other would agree as the last two occasions I have attempted to stay the hotel has been fully booked! Here's to another stay early 2016 :) ,4,2015,11,16
125,Lovely hotel,"First thing about the hotel is the lovely smell when you enter the reception area.  Check in was simple and our room was lovely, bright, modern and clean.  Both bars are lovely and the staff are very attentive.  We had breakfast in the hotel and it was amazing, not just your run of the mill breakfast but some very interesting dishes. I have to mention the door men, they are very friendly and extremely helpful! We asked for a taxi and the doorman ran away along the street and returned with a taxi for us.  We did have one small problem which has stopped me giving 5 stars, on opening the bottle,of red wine in our mini bar we found it corked, I phoned housekeeping who sent someone immediate who removed the bottle, said they would check it and return with a replacement, I am still waiting.  On check out I told the reception staff and it was immediately taken off the bill. This is a great hotel right in the centre of the city and I would definitely return. ",4,2015,11,15
125,"Funky hotel with fabulously atmospheric ""secret"" bar","Stayed in this hotel on a top secret deal.  It's super funky with mood lighting in the bedrooms but the standard room was small and basic.  Fantastic location in the middle of tourist London - just behind Trafalgar Square.  Don't miss the ""secret"" bar which has one of the moodiest, sexiest atmospheres of any cocktail bar I've ever visited.  If you can't find it, ask a member of staff.  You have to go through a hidden doorway with with a hand for a handle.",4,2015,11,15
125,"Great Hotel, Great People!","What a great hotel - the people really work hard to ensure you have the best service while you're there. The breakfast was delicious, as was every meal I had there.

The location cannot be beat!  ",4,2015,11,11
125,Excellent hotel and location,"My husband and I stayed in St Martins recently and had a great stay overall. Great location in Covent Garden with great restaurants and theatres nearby. Minutes walk to most tourists attractions and underground stops. Good room, although slightly smaller than expected. A special thanks to the front desk staff - Aga and Kirsty who promptly addressed all our queries regarding the bill and helped us to settle it efficiently through multiple modes of payment.",4,2015,11,11
125,Charged twice given someone else's room what else could go possibly wrong!?,After booking this hotel through their website I was charged twice! After calling up reception and being told there was only one booking finally found there were two bookings one on each of my names. Compliments to Valentina who sorted this out and upgraded my room to a deluxe however it did leave me out of pocket for a few days until the problem was rectified. After checking in we were given the wrong room number and once entering realised they had given us someone else's room! All belongings and clothes were everywhere! The least I needed after a long day after going down yet again to complain I was told it was a system glitch. I'd say the service at the sister hotel the Sanderson is a world better than at st martins lane. The room was ok nothing too flash won't be staying here again. ,2,2015,11,10
125,Excellent Central London Hotel,"Fantastic Hotel. We had a 6th floor deluxe room with an amazing view over London towards the eye and Westminster. Room was flawlessly clean. That particular room didn't have a bath but when they found us a room with a bath we opted to stay with the view because it was so brilliant. The service was brilliant and the Blind Spot bar was a great place to chill out after a night spent partying in London.
  
      ",5,2015,11,10
125,A great stay,"The staff is very responsive and welcoming. The location is very good and the total experience and value for money are excellent. The standard rooms might be disappointing (we were upgraded) and the review refers to a studio room. Break fast is also nice.

My teenage daughter loved the coloured mood lights above the bed and now wants a USB charger by her bed!
Will come back definitely if you maintain reasonable rates...",5,2015,11,07
125,My favourite hotel,"St Martins Lane is my favourite hotel. The staff are always polished and friendly, the decor is chic and modern and the new 'den' is a great place to sit and chat for business or with friends. The location is perfect with Leicester Square tube station, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden within a 250m radius. Excellent coffee at the Monmouth Coffee shop, excellent cafe style food at Kopapa and fantastic restaurant food and San Carlo Ciccheti (Wellington Street) to keep you going. It's about a 10 minute walk to Regent Street. I've been staying there for years and am always happy.

125,You can even have fresh air!,"We loved the refurbished room at St Martin's.  They've got rid of the huge thing with the TV in etc and it's now all more sleek.  And there are 2 usb ports at each side of the bed - really good, so you can charge your phone over night and not have the alarm going off on the other side of the room.
I just love this hotel, it's my favourite.  We have a deluxe room which has a large double bed and a bathroom with a great layout.  No bath but a great shower, and a mirror and stand opposite and wash basin for make up and hair etc.  And the lights are in the right places so you can see what you're doing.
 There is now a lounge area near the entrance to the hotel where you can read papers and get tea/coffee and snacks.  This is a great addition.  
We stayed on the 6th floor so you don't get so much noise if you want to sleep with the window open.  We like fresh air rather than air con for sleeping.  But the air con is ok and not as noisy as most.",5,2015,11,06

She really makes my day, super nice, always attentive. I have been going to the hotel for years now on a biweekly (or even weekly) basis, and I have my preferred rooms to which I am always sloted. And we she is in the front desk, there are always nice welcoming notes in the room. Really does make a difference.

125,Stay here and love London even more!,"We had the pleasure of three nights at this hotel for a mixture of work and pleasure! 
The minute you enter the lobby for the first time you realise that this place has such as great feeling. Even the smell is amazing!

The rooms are newly renovated and extremely well equipped. We had a double double loft room and it was first class with great views!
The bar is a great place for pre-dinner cocktails as well as late night drinks before bed.  Breakfast is served in the very cool Asia de Cuba restaurant. They have all of the usual breakfast options as well as some very nice innovative options such as a waffle with smoked salmon and avocado!  This was one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had! 

This hotel is a great party destination but is also very well suited for business guests as it really is a home away from home.
And of course the location cannot be beaten!

A big thank you to all at the St Martins Lane hotel for making our 3 night stay so memorable! We will be back!",5,2015,11,03
125,Excellent Property,"On a bit of a Europe business  trek and this is the best hotel so far. Location great right in the theatre district with plenty of dining and entertainment options all around. Design is minimalist Starck - rooms have fantastic bathrooms and excellent charging,lighting, amenities and every other bell and whistle. Ambient room lighting options, wardrobe id fine for an inner city hotel...really hard to fault the rooms. Corridors are a little funny with ankle level lights so quite dark. Asia De Cuba restaurant in hotel is good - fine dining but  a little expensive. The hidden bar is a hoot but they do take bookings so make sure you have a table reserved if you are a group. Complimentary use of a great gym next door - all in all a great home away from home. Thoroughly recommend and I will stay here again next time in town",5,2015,11,03

The location was probably the best possible you could imagine.
The room was very elegant and hip (needed to ask reception on how to operate the funky lighting system).
This is probably one of the best hotels i have stayed in a central location of a capital. All was just perfect.
If i had to suggest one potential improvement is the mattress that would need to be upgraded to offer the most excellent experience.

all in all, the best hotel in london",5,2015,10,31

125,Great Hotel in a great location & fantastic staff,"We love this hotel, discovered it about 8 years ago and would take a guess at saying we have stayed there 35 times over this period. I always book direct on the hotel website. The hotel has been 'refreshed' over the past year and is even better than it has been! 
The purpose of this stay was leisure, we had tickets to see Photograph 51 starring Nicole Kidman and the theatre was dead opposite the hotel. 
Our room this time was on the 5th floor, lovely view and silent! The air con in the rooms works perfectly, the showers in this hotel are unbelievably good (Some rooms also have a bath). The new media system in the room is easy to use and allows you to play music from your phone through the system via Bluetooth or a cable. To end on the room - couldn't fault it, perfect and in disturbed nights sleep. Oh, you can also ring housekeeping to deliver you a tea/coffee making facility tray-this is free and took about 2 minutes to arrive. Had a cocktail in the 'Blind Side' bar, this is the one directly ahead of you when you walk through the front doors, nice atmosphere and the waitress was helpful. Had breakfast the following morning in the Asia de Cuba restaurant-selection was very good but what I love is that breakfast is served until 11.30am during the week and 12pm on the weekend. Finally, you also get complimentary use of the Gymbox gym next door to the hotel and weather you use that or go for a run outside the hotel will launder your gym attire for you free of charge! I've done it many times I've even had my running gear back within 2hrs!

125,Return visit... And not the last ,"We love this hotel! Having stayed here 3 times, it's a regular favourite. 

Great position, fab food and superb staff! 

Rooms are modern and well finished. 

Great bar, very lively.

Super fast check in and out which is always nice. 

Breakfast was great and worth taking your time. 

Only thing worth noting is that it's not very obvious from the street and you could easily walk straight past! ",5,2015,10,14
125,"Location is great, service is inconsistent","I stay at this hotel for work several times a year and the location is great.  I also appreciate that guest can use the Gymbox next door for free.  The rooms are small and modern and clean.  But I am writing this review because the front desk service is very inconsistent and takes too long.  They did not have my reservations for two days linked so i was locked out of my room and they charged the wrong rate for one night stay.  Really wish they would improve that, otherwise it is a solid hotel in the heart of London.",4,2015,10,14
125,Nice place in London,"A nice place, designed by Stark, close to Covent Garden.
Good service, people from the hotel are all polite and dedicated to clients. Rooms are zen, bright and not at all noisy.
Enjoy your stay.
Just one and only negative point: breakfast is very expensive...as expensive as a lunch!!",5,2015,10,14
125,Very disappointed. ,"I'm a person who very rarely makes a negative comment, but I left this hotel with a very bad taste in my mouth. 
We stayed for two nights ( Sat. and Sun) and wanted to book for a third.  The front desk staff told us there was availability, but could not book us for some reason that even seemed to confuse them. They called the 1-800 reservations line, to no avail. They went behind the scenes twice to speak to an unknown supervisor. Then told us they could indeed allow us to stay, but the same room we had just spent 2 nights in would now be ¬£100 more expensive ( 200$!!).  While I understand there are different rates at different times, I was honestly offended. Even though we ended up staying in a room that cost more, we would not stay at St. Martins on principle. St Martins Lane, Not only did you lose a  nights fee/rate, you also lost a customer who works for a large international company who's travel department books for thousands of employees. Bad word of mouth is not a good thing. 
Positives- St Martins Lane has an excellent location and its decor is very funky, Christian was very friendly and helpful in check in. 
Negatives - worst nights sleep out of 4 hotel stays in London. Very uncomfortable bed. Left feeling they tried to rip us off. ",3,2015,10,14
125,Amazing 4th Visit,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to thank all the staff for making our stay with you so very special at St Martins Lane, London room 625 from 09/10/15 to 11/10/15.

I had originally proposed to Lynsey in one or your stylish rooms some years previously and only thought it fitting and romantic to return.

On our arrival we discovered an unexpected bottle of Champagne on ice, this was a lovely touch and showed true feelings from a company a its staff, people before profit.

We also had room service, drinks in both bars with friendly and professional staff.

We had a lovely conversation with the staff member Anesa (forgive my spelling) who was looking after us in The Den yesterday evening.

We hope to return again to celebrate another mile stone in our marriage!

Kind regards,

Mr & Mrs Smith",5,2015,10,13
125,Theatre trip,"Hotel in good location for theatre land easy to get to. Staff were friendly and helpful rooms were clean and tidy but the bed was not very comfortable compared to our own, food in Asia de Cuba although very good was not to our taste, perhaps we chose the wrong dishes, different way of cooking etc when asked if we enjoyed the starter the waiter was disappointed that we did not and asked how we like our food cooked he arrange for a extra dish to be cooked FOC (Calamari) that was very good main course was a lot better and the cheesecake for desert was excellent and breakfast was very good, Blind Spot was very nice but cold with the air-con on to high for my partners liking. Not sure if I would stay here again having stayed at the Sanderson (very good) before I might give the Mondrian a go next time.",4,2015,10,12
125,"Well located, but overscented","I had a pleasant four night stay at this property in September 2015. On the plus side, the hotel is lovely, modern and has all amenities available to make your stay enjoyable.  I stayed in a room with a patio, which was a great way to have some fresh air.  On the minus side, the rooms are small and a little pricey and when I arrived at 10 pm, there was no doorman to help me unload from the cab - I realize it was a Saturday night and the bar inside was rocking, but really - there should always be someone on the door. Wifi was great and quick.  The lobby and hallways are scented, and thankfully, I could open the patio door to reduce the burden (the windows open in rooms as well, so that's always nice).  This hotel is very well located for theater and doing things downtown.  It has a small business center on each floor, so that was also fine. I had breakfast a few days, pricey but fine. The better breakfast was in the restaurant/caf√© two doors down towards Trafalgar.  The gym was also very good, and it was not too loud at night. Front desk was very helpful with advice and suggestions.  I would stay here again because it is very well located, clean and reliable.",4,2015,10,12
125,Warm welcome in Central London,"St Martins Lane hotel is perfectly placed for shopping and sightseeing in London. Just off Trafalgar Square, it is a short walk to Covent Garden, Piccadilly and West End Theatres. We had a twin room which had huge comfortable beds. One reviewer said there was no door between the bedroom and bathroom. There certainly was in our room, plus an additional door to the lavatory inside the bathroom. The mini bar prices are pretty eye watering, but breakfast was much cheaper than expected as the prices given in the room literature are confusing. Apart from the fantastic location, the best thing about the hotel was the friendliness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and they were all charming. We would definitely stay there again.",4,2015,10,12
125,Hotel with style,"I had a short stay, but really like the atmosphere of this hotel.
The staff look great and are very professional.
The bar is not big on lighting, so if you are of a 'certain age' don't forget your reading glasses!
I had room service for breakfast, which was excellent and arrived promptly and the location ticks all the boxes for eating, shopping and culture.
",5,2015,10,12
125,St Martins Lane,"I can honestly say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in while visiting London. Everything is just perfect and the staff are just.....well the best I've even encountered! I have visited on 2 separate occasions, both to celebrate big birthdays, and each time the staff have treated us amazingly well and made us feel so special. I have stayed in quite a few hotels in London but will always count this as the best. I'm hoping to bring my Mum for her 50th in January as she loves this hotel just as much as me!",5,2015,10,12
125,"Fabulous! Great staff, great location","We had a weekend in London for my partner's birthday, and this hotel was perfect for our base. I ordered some things to be delivered in advance, and these were all set up in the room when we arrived. We had an upgrade - thank you! - and were left alone to enjoy our stay after a call to check everything was OK. The room was spotless, the bed extra comfy and the bathroom was clean and spacious. The complementary toiletries were gorgeous too!
We didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked very cool.
The location is perfect if you're off to a show, and you can eat cheaply in Chinatown. There is Long Acre and and Covent Garden not too far away, as well as Trafalgar Square,   National Gallery, and the Strand. All in all, fabulous - thank you!",5,2015,10,12
125,Swanky in the center of town,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 days during a business trip that my accompanied me on. The St. Martins hotel was perfect. This is why:
- Close to theatre and shopping in Soho and West End
- Restaurant in the area are open later than other parts of the city
- Bathroom in room was beautiful
- Room simple, clean, and comfortable
- Restaurant in lobby is a must
- Free gym and laundry (for gym clothes)
- Helpful and pleasant staff
- Free wifi

All in all it was a great stay. I have absolutely nothing I can think of to complain about. ",5,2015,10,11
125,St martins lane,"Love this hotel- beautiful comfy rooms, great service and food at Asia de Cuba. Also great bath products! Centrally located near theater, great restaurants and shopping. Asia de Cuba is a fun place to meet for a drink.

125,Great location and modern hotel ,"This was our first visit. Great location and minutes to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross station. Room was modern & bright with mood lighting. The only drawback is that the bathroom doesn't really have a door. For privacy, one can shut the door between the bedroom and bath/entrance area. Don't forget to check the speakeasy bar. ",4,2015,10,10
125,Great location in Covnent Garden area,"Location is great, close to walk to many sights.  Clean hotel with good vibe overall but don't recommend a room on the first floor.  Too noisy and there was construction right outside our room.  We had waited for a room not on the first floor but after waiting were given a room on the first floor.  Bar requires reservations which is good to know and concierge is helpful
      ",3,2015,10,06
125,Memorable customer service,"Every now and then, service is so outstanding that it remains forever in your memory. You are treated as an individual - and a special one, vs just another traveler. I had such an experience at St Martins Lane in November of 2014, and it made such an impression on me that I wanted to share it even though I‚Äôve procrastinated on this post for many months. This service came from perhaps an unexpected place, but clearly a role that other hotels should think about ‚Äì the bellmen. Mine were Igor and Ahmet, and they truly stood out as elegant, eloquent, helpful and most importantly, caring. 

At check-in, I was warmly given a tour of the room by Ahmet (not in a perfunctory manner, at all) and also offered suggestions and directions to a great, local restaurant for dinner when he realized this was something I was looking for. Every time I left or came into the hotel, he greeted me with a genuine smile and seemed ready to help if needed. The most memorable experience was on check-out, however. Since it was rush hour, I decided to take the tube/subway to the airport. When I asked for directions to the closest station, Igor insisted on helping with my heavy luggage the entire way to the tube stop (a few minutes walk from the hotel). He even brought my bag down the station stairs and explained the ticket system! I asked for his and his colleague‚Äôs names right then in order to commend them, but unfortunately so much time has passed that I don‚Äôt recall if I‚Äôm mixing up which gentleman did which helpful task. Either way, both men were lovely individuals. If either of them still work at St Martins Lane, please do tell them of this review. If they don‚Äôt, I hope they will learn of my high regard another way, and I hope St Martins continues to hire such fine folks. My husband and I are frequent travelers and also big Morgans Hotel Group fans (have stayed at all their hotels multiple times), but this experience was a step above the rest indeed.",5,2015,10,06
125,Nice design hotel,"Amazing location, very clean and modern looking. I didnt' try the hotel restaurant but it looked nice as well. 
Being a world traveller, I don't get easily impressed by hotel bathroom's amenities anymore, but I have to say the quality of them really impressed me.",4,2015,10,05
125,Visit the bar,"What a fantastic experience......  The staff in the bar were so welcoming and made us feel 'special' as soon as we walked through the door.  Stunning plush velvet sofas and beautiful bar, glitz and glamour.  A very memorable afternoon. Make sure you visit.",4,2015,10,04
125,Best experience,"Every thing was perfect.
The crew was lovely, food was good location was amazing.
It's not my first time in this hotel, and it keeps getting better.
Breakfast used to be better, but it still is very good.
Very recommended.

125,"Nice, clean hotel","Nice hotel.  Rooms are a good size and very clean.  Only weird part of my stay.  I told the front desk that my room smelled of gas before I left for the day.  When I got back, the room still smelled of gas but there was a lit candle in my bathroom. When I called the engineer he came to my room and said ""I don't smell anything"" and walked out.  Not super helpful. :-| Other than that it was a good stay.

125,Fantastic Location,"We booked this hotel last minute to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary, we got an extremely good deal as the location of this hotel is fab, right in the heart of Covent Garden. The hotel is incredibly modern, the staff efficient, attentive and helpful, everything you could possibly need right on your doorstep. The restaurant was buzzing, would definitely recommend this hotel.  ",5,2015,09,29
125,Always Great,I stayed at this hotel many times when it first opened and recently went back for a 6 night stay. Quality and service still the same - very high. Staff friendly and one of the best concierge services finding show tickets for popular shows at the last minute. ,4,2015,09,29
125,The best 5 Stars Hotel in center of London with best price,"We stayed in the Hotel for Four Nights in end of August  , it was very good.
I booked a Standard Room for me, my wife & our infant.
In booking.com was mentioned that all rooms can accommodate Crip for an infant but actually when we checked in they informed us the room can‚Äôt accommodate any Crip for room size problem.
But when I told them about their information in Booking.com & I already request a baby Crib in the room and nobody replies to me that the room not fit with Crip.
They made me a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room after the check in & they send their bellboy to assist us to move our luggage‚Äôs to the new Room.

The check in time was 3:00pm but we arrived early for our early flight arrival 9:00 am & they give us the room ready at  12:00 am.
The check in was very smooth, all the staff was very friendly 
The lobby was very cozy and nice 
All Rooms we checked in are very nice modern decorated and same style and design but the deferent only in the room size.
The standard was 22M & the Deluxe was 33M.
The Room & bathroom were vey cozy and modern with very nice Bathroom arrangement.

Hotel location was very amazing and in center of everywhere you want to visit in London.
Only 2 Min walking to Leicester Square underground Station.
Many cafe‚Äôs restaurants surrounding the hotel and all district near the Hotel 
5 Min walking to Covent Garden squire, Piccadilly Circus and Charing Cross Underground",5,2015,09,29
125,Weekend getaway,"We arrived just after 3pm checkin was fast and easy, we got the romantic package so the room and bath had rose petals scattered which was a lovely sight on entry, the room was spacious and clean with beautiful views floor to ceiling.

125,Great location and Great Conceriege and good hotel,"The hotel is a bit expensive for what you get.
Location is great as lots of things in walking distance.
The Concierges [all of them] are fantastic, they deserve 5 stars, helpful and always there for you",4,2015,09,28
125,Hip Hotel in Great Location,"Super hip hotel. Room was clean and spacious, particularly for London. Location is terrific - in the middle of the theatre district and close to Covent Garden shopping. Love the bar hidden behind the door with the golden hand. Didn't like the super dark hallways to the hotel room. That part was a little too much. I'd rather see where I'm going than feel like I'm in a club on the way to my room. Also, the effort to get into the bar - a bit pretentious. I swear I wouldn't have been allowed in had I not been staying at the hotel.

125,Perfect spot for a birthday surprise,"Lovely staff, room was light and airy, bed was amazingly comfortable and there was a lovely birthday surprise to help make my husband's 50th a very special occasion!

If you want to be in Central London and looking for a hotel that is conveniently located look no further ... Both the restaurants and the bar have a unique feel , this is an epitome of ""less is more"" in every manner of speaking . The Gym Box next door is a great gym and inspires you to keep fit more important a complimentary laundry of all your gym clothes adds the nice gentle touch and surprise .   We had a great community meeting with leaders across the globe and had a memorable stay and meet .. hope to get back with my family some day !

Totally modern style.  The room was large and very comfortable (though the lights were a bit tricky to figure out).  The hotel restaurant and pseudo-secret bar were both excellent.  The staff could not have been more attentive and polite.  The location could not be better!  Totally central to everything.  Great stay!",5,2015,09,21

125,Weekend in the City,"We checked into St. Martins Lane Hotel this time last week for one night. My wife and I were visiting London as part of her 30th Birthday celebrations. Whilst only at the Hotel a short time, our experience was amazing. The Hotel itself is incredibly well thought out, room was fantastic (great views of the skyline from our 6th floor room), breakfast was delicious... our entire experience was brilliant. The location is fantastic with so many landmarks just a stroll away. Perhaps best of all were the staff. They were polite and friendly from the moment we arrived and made our stay all the more memorable. Belle (Guest Experience Manager) was very welcoming on our arrival and made us feel right at home in what is a more upmarket hotel than we would usually stay in. Belle provided the icing on the cake when we returned to our room to find a complimentary bottle of prosecco, two delicious chocolate brownies adorning a plate with the words 'Happy 30th Birthday' written on it in chocolate sauce and a handwritten card wishing us a very happy time celebrating. We were so grateful to all the team who made our stay so enjoyable and will definitely return again. Thank you",5,2015,09,18

The hotel is trendy, clean and comfortable. But what sets it apart is the staff. Concierges Giacomo, Ahmet and Mike are charming, professional and friendly!  Sam, who is the lead bellman is charming and always ready to not just help with bags, but give directions recommend restaurants, etc. Everyone seems to really love their jobs which makes for a fantastic stay. This was my second year at St Martins and we'll return for many years to come.",5,2015,09,16

125,Lovely hotel. Great staff,"The hotel itself is very nice and has a modern theme. The standard double rooms were a fair size to what you would expect in a central London hotel. There are loads of mod cons available in the rooms. The TV was nice and modern with a large selection of channels to choose from. The changeable mood lighting above the bed was a nice touch, which was fun to play about with. Bathroom was a good size with a spacious shower and amenities provided. There are loads of items in the room which I suppose are classed under 'mini bar charges'. The bathroom had big bottles of lotions and products as well as shavers in a basket tucked away which could be purchased for use. A nice touch if you've forgotten something and it's late. It's right there, at a cost of course. I was mildy shocked by the actual minibar. There was a huge choice of drinks and snacks to choose from if you didn't fancy something more substantial from room service. There were even larger bottles of alcohol next to the minibar incase you fancied throwing a small party or something. The room and hotel were clean to a high standard.

The best thing about this hotel are the staff. All those we encountered were so polite and helpful. It's always nice to come across staff who genuinely seem like they want to help you and want you to enjoy your stay. The definitely made the experience more enjoyable.

The hotel is situated ideally if you're considering catching one of the west end shows, with loads of restaurants in the nearby area to choose from if you're not dining in the hotel.",5,2015,09,15

125,A quirky quality hotel.,"What a refreshing change to stay in such a quirky hotel, with so many surprising touches. A quality hotel with a fresh, modern feel. The staff were all very helpful and good looking. Our room was really light and airy, very clean and had an amazing bathroom. We could see Nelsons column and the Eye! A tv problem was quickly remedied. We ate in the Den and had cocktails in their secret lounge, a little pricey but hey this is London, and it was a treat. The breakfast was amazing too with a great choice of fayre. The location couldn't be better if you want to be around Trafalger square and Covent garden and 30 mins walk from the palace. Would really recommend!!",5,2015,09,15
125,just STUNNING!,"The hotel is just stunning. Reception, staff, concierge, waiters are very, VERY, friendly and polite. We felt at home. We stayed in the hotel in one of their ""studio"" rooms, for 5 nights. The room was very clean, large and spacious: perfect for a family of three like us! The bathroom was very clean,  with both a bath tub and a big shower, and well equipped. The lobby and the restaurant are perfectly decorated, clean, and the restaurant, the ""Asia de Cuba"" (see my review) is excellent! Breakfast is fresh, inviting and choices are numerous. The only ""negative"" comment is the very heavy use of air conditioning ... ! London has not the Miami temperatures; maybe it would be worth to reduce its use! We will visit it again! Hope soon. Recommended for families, friends, business and even a short romantic escape ...",5,2015,09,15
125,Asia De Cuba At St Martins Lane,"Had a wonderful breakfast at the St Martins Lane Hotel this weekend. Waitress Sophia was lovely. So much to choose from, It was my Birthday and she made it special. Many thanks.

The hotel is amazing very spacious.",4,2015,09,15
125,Great stay!,"Standard sized room was reasonable for Europe standards (comfortable for two adults with 1 carry-on luggage). Bathroom was lovely with marble tiled floors and a spacious shower. Water pressure was excellent.

Complementary shampoo, conditioner, body wash, was excellent.
And the mood lighting was interesting, if that's your thing.

Hotel offered tea and coffee services, which I unfortunately didn't take advantage of.

Had a way to pair Bluetooth to the room's audio system, but it didn't work. Nonetheless the technician that came to check out the room was polite and helpfully suggested he could provide a iPod/iPhone dock to help with audio play back.

One night I ran out of dental floss and I called the front desk to ask if they had any. They said they did and would send me up some. What I ended up getting was a cute travel toothbrush and toothpaste, but no floss. This was my last night there, so it wasn't a huge deal. It was nice enough that they had toothbrush/toothpaste available.

There's also a gym pass included which I didn't use, but colleagues of mine did and appreciated it. Note, the gym opens at 6 AM, so if you're up at 4am due to jet lag you'll have to wait a couple of hours. Nonetheless, the hotel is very well located near many theatres, the National Portrait Gallery, and other sights.

Check out the cafe ""Notes"" and ""New Row Coffee"" < 3 minute walk nearby.",5,2015,09,14

What a great move this was, we were upgraded on arrival and then out of the blue a bottle of Prosecco and two cakes were delivered to our door, with Happy Birthday Emily, written in icing, what a lovely touch this was. This is a very modern, cool hotel and the service you get is second to none. We dined in Asia De Cuba the fantastic on site restaurant, they offer pre theatre bites which are ¬£7 for a dish and ¬£7 for a cocktail, real Cuban Fusion and delicious. We arrived back to the hotel and 1am where we had a reserved sofa and table in the hotel lounge bar waiting for us. To top it all we were given a cocktail by the waitress for my wifes birthday.

The room had some led lights that changed color, very nice and unique.

Very slick and well run hotel.  Nice spacious room with great view, with professional and accommodating service.  Only glitch (why I didn't rate a ""5"") was that somebody messed up our Airport Shuttle for the early morning.  Thought we had some sort of van for 5 people, and got out front and it was a black cab.  Barely squeezed all of us and luggage into it.  The only help we got from the Bellman was that he said a few times ""I just got here"".  What?!",4,2015,09,10
125,Hip Hotel in Fantastic Location,"I stayed for a couple of days and could have stayed longer! The location is amazing - you can pretty much walk to everywhere from here; Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square. Theatreland and some great restaurants are on your doorstep. The lobby is open plan and has some cool designer touches. The reception staff and bell boys were fantastic, really helpful and efficient. I had an entry level room which was small but gorgeous. All white with some funky lighting, it had everything I needed. The bathroom was brand new, with gorgeous products and was large for the size of the room. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2015,09,10
125,Very hip hotel in a very central location,"Room had a great view (floor to ceiling glass windows with views of the Trafalgar Square). It was just like the professional photos on the website (you know how disappointing it is sometimes staying at other hotels when the website photos don't quite look the same as the real rooms) but the rooms at St Martins Lane was exactly just like in the picture which was awesome. We had two connecting rooms. Both were a good size. Clean with very modern decor, sleek design, which I absolutely loved. Bathrooms were a nice size with nice quality toiletries. Bed was very comfortable. Stayed here with young kids and they absolutely loved the ""disco"" lights (regular lights that can change colors and brightness). The breakfast included with the room was very good too (it was my daughter's 7th birthday and they even made a cake with her name on it! Our waitress was amazing! She made my daughter feel so special!). Location was perfect. Close to everything - the underground, Leicester Square, St. Paul's church, shops near Covent Garden, theaters, restos! Its a perfect hotel for a quick stay in London. But what made me give this hotel 5 stars is their staff. Everyone was very nice, courteous and extremely helpful, not to mention everyone was so gorgeous and good-looking (i'm serious! it's like they only employ models! lol!). Would definitely come back and stay here if I'm ever in London again.",5,2015,09,09
125,European vacation ,"Excellent hotel all around.  Perfect location near Trafalgar Square (but far enough away from crowds) and Covent Garden.  Super hip, love the quirky modern clean design and the staff was so warm and friendly.  Room was very comfortable and quiet- every amenity available.  Definitely worth the extra $$.",5,2015,09,09
125,Excellent hotel - 5* service from start to finish.,"Excellent hotel, thoroughly enjoyed our stay from start to finish.

Service: Personal, friendly and attentive, very high levels of service throughout.

Food and drink: Of a very high standard (and price).

Room: Comfortable, well designed, homely, quiet.

Location: Possibly the best location in London?

Recommended, would stay again.",5,2015,09,09
125,Cool hotel in superb central location ,"A very quick one-nighter, to see my daughter in a West End play, saw my wife and I enjoy a sadly too brief visit to the St. Martin's Lane. Decor, artwork, staff friendliness and efficiency were all top-drawer. Our room was on the smallish side but that was of no great consequence; it was very well laid out with a great vibe, comfy bed and interesting rooftop view.

We didn't dine in the hotel but the (cheekily slightly hidden) cocktail bar is absolutely superb. The waitress service to table was among the best I've encountered in London and the lady DJ played a really terrific selection of music...albeit a wee bit too loud. I could've stayed in the cocktail bar until breakfast but it's just as well I didn't.

We'll be back to the St.Martins Lane.",4,2015,09,08
125,My best friend's birthday - a time to remember!,"I cannot say anything negative about this place, and the staff. From start to finish, all I experienced was perfection, and even more than that. The staff go over and above what I would ever expect. Isabelle far exceeds my expectations of any manager. I cannot thank her and her staff enough for making my best friend's birthday the best it ever could have been.",5,2015,09,07
125,"Great Location, Nice Rooms","Great location, close to Neal Street - easily walkable to Oxford Street.  Rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable - the shower and amenities are great, I especially love the touchless flush on the toilet.  Cool decor too

125,"Excellent hotel, great location","We had the deluxe room, which was great. Especially the large shower/bathroom area. Slightly noisy. Large windows make the room light. We also had dinner at Asia de Cuba restaurant, which was great and also enjoyed tea in the tea salon next to lobby. ",5,2015,09,07
125,St. Martins Lane,"First of all we had a hard time finding the hotel because of the lack of a sign, but had nothing but a pleasant experience after that. We enjoyed the mood lighting, secret rooms, and breakfast buffet. The bed was super comfortable. The staff was very helpful, going out of their way to help us. The concierge very knowledgeable.  ",4,2015,09,05
125,Trendy hotel in the middle of it all,"Superb, cool, trendy hotel, right in the middle of it all! The doormen were polite and on the ball, reception were also pleasant and warming. The room we had was beautiful! Loved the layout of the room with the corridor that leads into the room. The decor was modern, clever use of space, nice products in the bathroom and a funky bed lights. What more can you want and to top it off, isabelle the manageress made our trip that little bit extra special for my girlfriends birthday.",5,2015,09,05
125,Excellent stay,"Stayed for a 50th birthday celebration and the hotel was great - service was fantastic and the the room really modern, clean and comfortable,  location was brilliant - the hotel staff and service made this a very special stay - thank you!",5,2015,09,05
125,Enjoyable stay for 3 nights,"I highly recommend the hotel very well situated and delighted with our loft room. The bathroom was very impressive - the bed was large but a little hard I would suggest the design to put suitcases underneath the reason however we loved the additional room design elements sub connectors to the bed and huge sized minibar spirit bottles. The concierge/door men were very friendly and also were great in recommending a massage therapist as my partner was suffering from our European travel itinerary. By the way probably the best looking doormen too....I think they all use the gym box located inside the hotel building - we did laugh at this as hotels are always trying to compete with an edge - Morgan hotel group well done and we will certainly return. Btw the making up of the sofa for an impromptu guest in our room one night was flawless - and your housekeeping staff couldn't be more friendlier or professional so please please do give a shout out to your housekeeping department as they do an excellent job for your business.

Thank you St Martins lane ",4,2015,09,02
125,"Wonderful views, comfy beds and quirky modern decor.","A lovely one night stay in a double aspect, 6th floor room. Great views and the room was modern and clean, but very comfy and relaxing. 
Staff are great, especially in the hidden cocktail bar.
Highly recommended!",5,2015,09,02
125,Another stunning property by Ian Schrager,"What a superb hotel. From the considerate, attentive, responsive service provided by the staff to the clean modern aesthetic of the room itself, a five star experience. Great location near Covent Garden. Its difficult not to embellish this hotel with accolades because my stay here was flawless, Ive done my share of travel and five stars can be a moveable feast depending on the reviewer but take my word on this: there is nothing not to admire about the is property. I'll be back.",5,2015,09,01
125,St Martins incredibly comfortable beds,"St Martins Lane is a boutique hotel on St Martins Lane. Walk out the front door,turn left is Trafalgar Square, St Martins Lane church The National gallery, National portrait gallery, turn right into New Row can walk to Covent Garden. The West End, Chinatown, Soho is also close by.

 The beds are super comfy, with mood lighting that changes colours. There isn‚Äôt much of view, the rooms are small, yet if you are only staying in your room at St Martins,your visit to London is wasted, considering what is available just outside the hotels front door. 

The hotel has a cool hidden bar. Spoil yourself make use of the hotel limousine, check the pricing, as the cost at times will be the same as a London cab, yet you will be travelling in comfort and style. Enjoy your stay, I did.",4,2015,09,01
125,Wow,Just back from a great trip to London made perfect by a super nights stay at St Martins Lane. Best equipped room I have ever been in. Beautifully finished and attention to detail was amazing. Staff were also top notch. Can't wait for next visit when we can try the bar and restaurant.,5,2015,08,31
125,What's not to like!,"The minimal decor of the bedrooms gives the place a lovely clean, simple feel.  The beds and linen are great quality and provide a very comfortable and peaceful sleep.  We were on the sixth floor and didn't hear anybody or anything all weekend.  There's tons of hot water and great showers and the air conditioning is effective and quiet.  In fact the bedrooms are as good as you could get.
The addition of the den provides a more relaxing place to have drinks and snacks during the day.  My only disappointment was that this closes at 11pm so when we arrived back at the hotel and wanted a quiet drink with friends there was nowhere to go - the options were the dark, noisy bar or a drink at the restaurant bar but only if we ordered food - we went elsewhere!!!!  It would be lovely to have this available as a residents bar at all times (even if the drinks have to be ordered via the restaurant or main bar). 
It's not a cheap place to stay, but nothing in central London is and this does have a fantastic location.
Definitely worth a visit!

125,Fantastic Hotel,"Couldn't fault this Hotel in anyway.  Awesome location, amazing staff and great facilities.  All the staff from the doorman, to reception and the cleaners couldn't do enough to make the stay enjoyable.  They all went out of their way and we're always very friendly.  One of the best Hotels I've stayed at..

125,Fabulous hotel,"I booked the hotel at the lastminute, got a fantastic discount with breakfast included. On arrival we were upgraded to deluxe room with oversized double bed. The room was special - beautifully designed with quirky touches and interesting lighting. We dined in Asia de Cuba (the hotel restaurant) and took the pre theatre menu. We were swiftly served with great food with fantastic presentation. Post theatre, we enjoyed drinks in the Den and then in the hidden cocktail bar. ",5,2015,08,28
125,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for one night as it was for a birthday treat for my partner. Great location as near everything you need!!!

Staff very helpful and friendly.
Had a cocktail too in the bar that was delicious too!!!

Rooms amazing and overall a wonderful stay.",4,2015,08,28
125,"Great location, funky hotel - would stay again","Really enjoyed my stay at St Martins Lane, it is in a great location.
Staff were really helpful and friendly.
I liked the trendy decor especially in the bedrooms.
I also liked the hidden bar on the ground floor.
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,27
125,Superb hotel,"This is my home away from home in London; they treat their Global Members superbly -- better than any other hotel group. The place hums with warmth and energy, reflective of the great city itself. I have been a loyal customer of St Martins Lane for years now and have never tired of it. Indeed, it gets better with age.",5,2015,08,27
125,60th Birthday celebration,"WOW !!! What a fabulous hotel and wonderful staff from the moment we arrived until the moment we left the service was impeccable we cannot wait to return a big thank you to everyone for making our trip so special and thank you for keeping the secret from our dearest friend Ned who was celebrating his 60th birthday. A special mention must be made to Belle who went out of her way to help us celebrate in style.  The rooms and food were both far beyond our expectations and sincerely hope to return later this year.

Thank you ALL once again for making our visit so  very special. When you do visit St Martins on the Lane do not forget to check out the Secret Bar.!!!!
  
",5,2015,08,26
125,Perfect location,"Aside from the facts that the hotel delivers a high quality product, and the trendy decor was rather fun, we would come back for the location.  We could walk everywhere we wanted to go: Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, British Museum, countless theaters.  There are so many underground stations, serving different lines, within easy walking distance, if you wanted to go farther afield that would be an easy commute as well. No problem getting to the Picadilly line for the tube to Heathrow. ",5,2015,08,26
125,Perfect location!  Elegant yet not too fussy.,We stayed three nights over eight days.  All hotel staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  A shout out to concierge Michael - if you need a restaurant recommendation and reservation he's your man - the more information you give him the more he can help.,5,2015,08,25
125,"Nice modern comfy hotel. Beautiful breakfast, shame about the nose at night","I stayed here on the weekend. The hotel is located in a very good location, 5min walk to regent Street. Everything was just a walk away. The room was very nice loved the bathroom and the comfy bed we had but I was awoken a lot of times by people entering their rooms at silly times. Loud squeaky doors, sounded like it was my door opening. O by the way everyone should do breakfast there and get the la carta menu, salmon yum ",4,2015,08,25
125,Our most enjoyable stay in the capital ever!,"My husband and I have just spent a weekend here to celebrate a special birthday and what a perfect choice this amazing hotel was! On arrival the check in staff were so welcoming and our room was ready for us at 11.30am which was excellent. We ate in Asia de Cuba at lunchtime and this was a gastronomic treat! the choices of menu and the dishes served were delicious and the service just perfect. The rooms here are so light and so clean with very comfortable quality bedding. The bathroom and fabulous lighting and design are just so relaxing. The lasting memory for us and our friends who surprised us there is that the entire staff here are wonderful. Fabulous service and hospitality from each and every one, especially Belle who made our stay very special indeed. The Morgan group should be extremely proud of the staff in this hotel because I am sure many people like us would now return regularly to this hotel rather than randomly pick from the hundreds of luxury hotels in the capital. Thank you again for a lovely stay in the most perfect spot in London!",5,2015,08,25
125,Loved it! ,"What an amazing night we spent here. We had a garden room which was just lovely. Room and bathroom excellent. Breakfast was great as well and we felt very well looked after. 

One small niggle, reception staff weren't as attentive as the others we encountered.

Will go again",5,2015,08,23
125,Mini Break,"We did a short break to London. we were able to check-in at 12pm, Hotel staff excellent all friendly & efficient.

125,Boutique - but sort the lights out :),I use this often when I have to stay in London on business. It's certainly chic and the central location from Leicester sq and Piccadilly is great. The rooms are practical and comfortable. The multi coloured light settings can be confusing and take a while to figure out. Breakfast is expensive -- just as well there is a Starbucks over the street. The gym is right next door but you have to exit the hotel to enter it. ,4,2015,08,22
125,Saint Martins Lane the preferred hotel in London,"Saint Martins Lane the preferred hotel in London. From its location close to Trafalgar Square and comfortable walking and running distances to almost all the key sites in London I cannot say enough. The staff from the front door people making suggestions about what to do today and ""night""The restaurant and bar a nice hideaway after a busy day on the streets. In the rooms are incredible. A real value in excellent quality and what can be an expensive city",5,2015,08,22
125,Form over substance,"I wanted to like this hotel, I really did. The location is perfect, the lobby design kicks the behind parts of human anatomy and the service is great. I wish I could give this hotel 4 or 5 rating. However, whoever approved the design of the rooms, must have never stayed in a hotel before or simply likes other people's lives miserable ;-).

The bathroom has no small side mirror and the main mirror is not well lit and it is impossible to get close as the sink is quite big. Putting make up on is no fun. It is also weirdly big compared to the size of the room. Now I have nothing against big bathrooms but not when I have to squeeze around the bed otherwise. I'd rather have more space to comfortably open my suitcase. There are no bedside tables (?). The desk is so long it effectively blocks access to the big window and being not quite a tall person I had a choice of either moving the whole desk/table or climbing on it to close the curtains - the plastic stick attached to them doesn't do the job. The mysterious panel with blue lights on the wall by the bed remained mysterious - no matter how long and what I pressed on it I only managed to get rid of the blue glow around the tv by the good old fashioned pulling the cable out of the socket. Even the receptionist was not able to explain to me how to turn it off - he said and I quote: keep pressing the buttons on the panel. :D The quite intense oriental smell can be a bother, too. I did not mind but my partner did not like it at all.

Loved the good sides: Malin & Goetz cosmetics, good quality slippers and iron with ironing board (not always a given even in 5 star places), the well stocked mini bar with unexpected extras (check out the pic), and the usb charger slots in the wall - but sadly that's not enough for me to come back.",3,2015,08,22
125,"""Hip"" and Wonderful","Expected this stunning Philippe Starck-designed hotel to have personnel with attitude.  So happy to be wrong! Everyone is cheerful and helpful. Our room on the 5th floor was spacious and beautiful. The location of the hotel is unbeatable: in the heart of the theatre district and just minutes walking from Coventry Garden, the Strand, Picadilly Circus...and two blocks from Trafalgar Square. We walked or took buses everywhere. Stayed 4 nights and wished it were longer. Will definitely return.",5,2015,08,21
125,Good location,"We stayed for one night to attend a cruise on the Thames, nice hotel although a bit surprised when we pulled up in front of it, it looks more like an office block. Inside very nice, very modern and clean looking, rooms quite small, although beds comfy and nice pillows, ( I do have a problem if the pillows are hard or lumpy). I agree with another reviewer about the lights in the bar area not very pleasant on the eyes, feels like you are having to strain to see all the time, breakfast very good and the staff are pleasant, not really our taste would rather have a bit more comfortable place to say, a little too modern for us, but a great place for seeing the sights as very central to the tourist attractions and within walking distance of lots of things.",4,2015,08,20
125,Fantastic stay at St Martins ,It was a fantastic stay with my wife. We were well received. The room was wonderful and our stay superb. Thanks to all staff for the attention We received.

Very trendy hotel, very minimalistic in style and full of young and beautiful people everywhere :-). Rooms nice but everything very white but mood lighting took off the edge - Personally as a business traveller I felt the hotel was tagetted at younger more catered more for leisure not really ideal for a one night business trip but okay.",4,2015,08,20
125,What a gem!,"This modern boutique hotel is in the middle of everthing! The staff were fantastic. Very helpful and upbeat!
Room was cleverly designed to have a place for everything. Bed was comfortable; bathroom was much better than expected. Ask for free coffee or tea service every morning. It's a perfect start.  Close to tube, Trafalgar square, Picadilly, Covent Garden, theatres..
Would stay there again!",5,2015,08,19
125,Great find!,"Stayed overnight midweek in standard room.  Very modern features and a compact but very clean and well appointed space.  Air Con too chilly for us so adjusted on wall.  Asked for tea tray - prompt service- able to make as needed in room.

Lovely bathroom with huge towels / robes / toiletries - extra's to buy if desired.

Used 'hidden' Bar in hotel lobby for cocktails- very informative staff and good atmosphere .
Clever light system behind beds for effect!

125,"VERY Cool, Ultra Modern, Great Location!","This hotel is pretty much the best, most central location that you can get when visting London. It's in Covent Garden which is a very quick walk to many tourist attractions or a quick tube ride away (we walked to Buckingham Palace which only took about 25 minutes, and about a 15 minute walk to the London Eye). You can choose the lighting scheme in your room which is a very cool trick. The room is very small for a hotel room (we had 2 single beds, a desk and a TV) and the bathroom was average. The hotel staff in reception were very friendly and helpful. I loved the look and feel of this hotel. The beds were very friendly and you had power sockets right beside your bed as well as USB Ports. Very modern!",5,2015,08,18

125,Class all the way,"Having stayed in a number of hotels in London in recent years, I have to say that this hotel delivered beyond expectations. Having had drinks there under the old management, I was so underwhelmed that I vowed never to go back. I am so pleased that I did as the customer service, attentiveness and chilled vibe was exactly what I was looking for. 

And I salute the hotel for providing decent complimentary toiletries in the room. Rather than the miniature bottles that most hotel groups are fond of these days, the bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash were 4 times the usual size. It may sound like a small thing but there's nothing more irritating than having to ask for more shampoo or thinking you should buy some in advance because you know the hotel room won't be adequate. 

All in all, this hotel is perfect for business, couples or families and I will be staying here as my hotel of choice for future trips. For those visiting London for the first time, the location is perfect - Leicester Square and Covent Garden are on your doorstep and centrally it's fantastic for the City or Mayfair. Don't hesitate to book in the future!",5,2015,08,18

Walking distance to so many of the attractions (Trafalgar Sq, Leicester Sq, TKTs booth, theaters, National Gallery, SoHo) and super close to the Tube too. There were also great restaurants nearby.

Our room was very stylish (and clean!) and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. In particular we'd like to mention great service from Mike (concierge), Belle (guest experience), Samantha & Ellen (front desk) and the bellmen Sam, Andre and Igor. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,17
125,Lacked that 5* luxury ,"Very modern and stylish but cold with a distinct lack of atmosphere. Room felt basic rather than luxurious and to be honest I've stayed in better 3 and 4 star hotels. 

Breakfast was nice with good choices a cafeti√®re of coffee rather than a cup would be better. 

Poor lighting in corridors and public rooms made it difficult to orientate when you have poor eyesight",3,2015,08,17
125,Perfect location with such style,"We planned a long weekend in London and wanted somewhere 'special' to stay. The St Martins Lane Hotel did not disappoint. Wonderful room with great views over London. So much effort has gone into the style and design of everything. The room was spacious and very comfortable, and the location is perfect - 2 minutes walk to Leicester Square and about the same to Covent Garden. Great location for a West End Show and surrounded by some great restaurants and bars. The hotels own bar located behind a hidden door is a great way to end the evening. Staff are all very pleasant and extremely helpful.

125,Small but fabulous,"Stayed 3 nights late July. Everything was just perfect from easy check-in to perfect room and a good comfortable bed. Location was the highlight. Very on-trend hotel that has a 'cool' feel about it...staff, setting and atmosphere. Was nervous to approach a couple of times with questions but staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. Once I asked them to hold a piece of shopping I didn't want to lug around, the concierge actually ran it up to the room. Early morning train departure and we used the hotel car instead of taxi. Probably minimal cost difference. Would recommend and stay again. Thanks",5,2015,08,16
125,Too expensive,"Nice, luxurious hotel, two minutes away from Leicester Square. Too expensive though! Plus, when we checked in, the receptionist failed to inform us that the hotel will pre-authorize the total amount of our stay on our credit card, plus 100 GBP per night! Her colleague apologized the next day for the 'lack of information', although we'd never expected that something like this could happen at a five-star hotel. For the record, the extra amount was released three days after departure.",3,2015,08,15
125,"Fantasic Hotel, Fantastic Location - Couldn't have been better!","Simply put, this is a fantastic hotel! As soon as you walk in you feel you're in a special place... funky but not pretentious at all. The staff were super-friendly and we were soon in our room checking out all the gadgets! (USB charging points in the headboard - genius!) We booked a standard room as we were only staying 1 night for a concert nearby but the room was spacious, super-clean and the bathroom had plenty of space and cool toiletries too. It really couldn't have been any better.

Location-wise, this hotel is spot on. It's just far enough away from the main roads and areas to be quiet but 2 minutes walk and you're right in the middle of Covent Garden & Seven Dials, which are just great places to shop and eat. Leicester Square tube station is only 2 minutes walk away too so it's really easy to get too.

Our stay was rounded off by a visit to the secret bar area (which was a surprise to me, even though I had read the reviews of the hotel on this website!) It was a cool bar with really good music (60s rock and soul) and great cocktails. Even the band we went to see stayed here as well, so it's a hit with the semi-famous too.

Overall this was a superb hotel and probably my favourite in London. It is a little more expensive than some but it is so so worth it!",5,2015,08,15

125,Well Priced in Great Location,"We stayed for 5 nights the first week of August.  We had two standard rooms, one for our kids.  The best thing about the hotel is the Covent Garden location, close to everything and not too noisy.  My husband stays at the hotel every time he comes to London on business.  The hotel reminds me of a W Hotel.  It is extremely modern and minimalist.  The standard rooms are small, but well laid out with a wall of windows that makes the room feel more spacious.  The beds were comfortable with special details like a built-in phone charger and lights that you can set to different colors.  We had use of the Gym Box next door for working out.  We didn't eat at the restaurant because there are so many restaurant options nearby.  The free wifi was a little slow so we upgraded to the premium wifi and were able to use 5 devices per room (instead of 3).",4,2015,08,13
125,"Great value, well located and very friendly staff","I really enjoyed my 3 night stay at this hotel. At around ¬£140 p/n for central London it is also great value. I have been coming to London for several years now and I think that this is the best London hotel I've stayed in yet. All staff that I came in contact with were exceptionally and consistently pleasant and a good staff selection and training policy was evident.

Rooms were clean and had all necessary amenities such as a good quality Iron/board and hairdryer and the bed and bedding were very comfortable. Tea and coffee facilities can be ordered from housekeeping and there is digital controlled themed lighting with various colours in the room. This is only for novelty, but is a nice touch.

The mini-bar fridge kept the contents very cold and was well stocked with a lot of choice. The toiletries smelled excellent and the shower was first class (our room was on the 3rd floor). The hotel location is also excellent being a 2-3 min walk from Leicester Square tube station and just on the outer edges of the Covent Garden theatre, bar and restaurant scene enduring it is as quite as can be expected outside in s busy city. The only negative I can find and it really is pedantic is the lighting in the hall to our room was quite poorly designed. The styling is nice with the lighting surrounding the large room numbers near the floor, but it is not easy to find something in a wallet, or bag if necessary.

The TV was a modern flat screen with excellent picture quality and there was a reasonable choice of channels.

The breakfast was great with a reasonable sized buffet and a la carte menu. I had a sirloin steak one morning, the cold buffet the next and a breakfast roll on the other. All were very good.

I will look to book this hotel on my next visit before looking elsewhere, as long as the price is still right.",5,2015,08,13
125,Design Hotel in Great Location,"We booked this hotel as a Secret Hotel on Last Minute.  The front desk staff were all very pleasant and we ended up upgrading our room to a larger bed - although the upgrade still didn't include a bath.  The rooms are all quite minimalist, white and with mood lighting around the bed!  Shower room with separate loo were very nice with lovely toiletries and candles burning upon turn down.

Only one slight glitch was at breakfast when we were given a bill for approx ¬£50 for 2 egg benedicts, 2 orange juices and a tea and coffee.  I said that breakfast was included and luckily I still had my confirmation on me.  Generally we usually eat out for breakfast as the hotels charge such a lot.  However, this was resolved.    Personally we prefer a more boutique comfy hotel over design but that is just our personal taste.",4,2015,08,13
125,Location and Service - spot on,"At St Martin's Lane the service was really spot on, reception, security, concierge desk. Faultless. The decor of the hotel was a little modern for our tastes, but it is a matter of taste and it was quite nice if you like clean lines and minimalist approach! Some of the staff seemed to buy into the snob factor of what the hotel is trying to be, which is fine. What I found amusing was when we asked about coffee in the room and said that if it was instant we really weren't interested as we like good coffee, we were informed that ""well, it is a FIVE star hotel and therefore the coffee that you'll get will be up to that standard"" The (very fast) delivery of the coffee facilities showed us that the FIVE star standard for St Martin's Lane is Starbucks instant coffee. We were expecting a Nespresso Machine or a French Press!",4,2015,08,13
125,Wow!!!!,"Came here for my 40th birthday via Secret Escapes deal.
From the moment you walk through the revolving doors you are blown away, the staff are so friendly and can't do enough for you.
Our room was probably in the top 3 I have ever stayed in, floor to ceiling glass, bathroom to die for and impeccably clean.
The best part was the secret bar area off the main reception, even if your passing or around Covent Garden pop in for a drink it's amazing.
Would I stay again? 
Yes yes yes tonight please. ",5,2015,08,13
125,Home away from home,"Stayed at St. Martins Lane for business for almost 3 weeks and it was the most amazing stay thus far I had experienced from all my business trips.  The staff is so very well appointed, professional, attentive and caring.  Sam, Ahmed, Andre, Thereza, Laura, Cata, Inisia, Pavel, Kinga just made me feel home and that was very important to me.  Great restaurant ""Asia de Cuba"", excellent food and service and great bar as well.  Hope to come back very soon!  Kudos to the management.",5,2015,08,12
125,Great stay,"Stayed one night last weekend. Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was awesome! Very bright, clean and quiet. Loved the different color lights above the bed.  Breakfast was great too! 
We catches a show and the theatre was very close so location is ideal.",5,2015,08,12
125,"High Quality, Central London Boutique Hotel","We stayed at St. Martins Lane Hotel duirng August 2015.  The location is superb - very central to everything.  The hotel is modern, comfortable and the staff are very friendly.  We chose a Garden Suite and would highly recommend it.  We would have no hesitation recommending this Hotel to anyone looking for a boutique, high quality, centrally located London Hotel.

125,Wonderful Central London Hotel,"What a wonderful bolt hole for central London. Modern funky rooms. Thoughtful details. Amazing breakfast to set you up for a day in the centre of London.

125,Great 10th Wedding Anniversary,"Myself and my Wife stayed at the St Martins lane hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. I wanted to stay somewhere that was close to covent garden as we were dining at Clos Maggiore in the evening and somewhere which was modern and upmarket. We were not dissapointed. The hotel is very modern and cool with beautiful and airy rooms. There are really nice products in the bathrooms and lots of lighting technology. We also visited the Blind spot cocktail bar which is located in the hotel and I would cetrainly recommend this also as it was a very nice experience.
I have to also say a big thank you to Belle the Hotels Guest experience manager who made our stay extra special by really looking after us during our booking and really going out of her way to make our stay and anniversary a really memorable one and I am sure we will return. 
Lee and Celine.",5,2015,08,11
125,Good hotel in a fantastic location.....,"Not a pretty building from the outside but the location is fantastic if you want to be in the buzz of central London.

The staff are all young and very friendly and the hotel markets itself as a hip boutique hotel.  It is quite funky but the accommodation is like so many other  4 star hotels in London, except it didn't have any tea making facilities (which isn't an issue unless you want a cup of tea). You had to request these.

It is a nice hotel in a fantastic location, and I would happily stay there again. Just not quite enough to get 5 stars.",4,2015,08,11
125,"Great location, very cool rooms","My biggest complaint about hotels is being able to hear all the hallway noise (which I come to expect).  However, I did not have that issue with this hotel!  The way the room is set-up must help reduce the hallway noise.  The only thing I did hear was my neighbor opening the door to the bathroom - the doors ""rest"" on wall when open and cause a slight bang.

The rooms are super cool and almost swanky which made staying there very fun.  The large windows are wonderful and one even opened!  The bathrooms are very nice (no bathtub) and roomy, but the rooms are just big enough for two adults.  

The location of the hotel is wonderful with lots of prime site-seeing within a 15 minute walking radius.  Another nice perk was that given it's immediate proximity to theaters, several restaurants offers early/theater menus that offered meals and at a reduced cost.  In the evening, the area is very lively and it was nice to see people dressed up for the theater.

I quite enjoyed my short stay at this hotel and checking in/out everything was easy.",4,2015,08,10
125,St Martins Lane London Hotel,"Awesome hotel, service and vibe!!  We will definitely stay there again!  A great place to stay in London when you want to be in the center of the action.  Great restaurants around, theater, National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery.  Whole Covent Garden area was great.  Loved the Seven Dial area that was right up the street.  Hotel played great music and we loved the restaurant and bar.  Great rooms and bathrooms..showers had super pressure and we loved the bath products.

125,Very contemporary stylish hotel,"We were two very lucky prize winners who were accommodated in this lovely hotel. The rooms were clean and very comfortable with all mod cons. We chose not to eat as we wanted to explore the surroundings, especially Covent Garden so can't comment on food but those who have bottomless pockets then I've no doubt the food would be as good as the rest. Unfortunately at ¬£25 for breakfast it was out of our price range.
The hotel is ideally placed for sightseeing and theatres.",5,2015,08,10
125,Hip Hotel with a Great Location,"The hotel's location is pretty terrific - close to Trafalgar Square, Chinatown, Soho, Covent Garden - just to name a few. The rooms are in great shape and have lots of nice touches. Bathrooms are lovely. Service is impeccable and invisible.

For a hotel of this caliber, I'd expect a bit more in terms of facilities. They give you access to Gym Box which is underground below the hotel. While a very functional gym, there's not much else to it. But this is pretty minor and the hotel and staff are exceptional overall. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,10
125,Lovely short stay in an Oasis,"We had a great stay at this genuinely original hotel in the heart of Central London, amongst all the hustle and bustle. It was a great location, as we'd planned an evening at Ronnie Scott's and dinner after.
We had a fantastic funky room and the bed was one of the most comfortable we'd ever slept on. Great breakfast in the morning, which is definitely worth adding on.
Would certainly recommend to anyone who wants somewhere different and special.

125,High standards modern design hotel close to the most vibrant area in London,"I really enjoyed my stay in the corner loft room at the Saint Martins Hotel. I loved the style, the comfort, the quietness of the room. The location is brilliant, especially if like me you wanted to be close to the bars and clubs in Soho, as all is at walking distance. The staff from reception are very welcoming and helpful... a little less in the restaurant... I definitely happily recommend this place. ",5,2015,08,10
125,Great Hotel and in the Heart of Theatre district,"St Martins Lane is part of the Morgans Hotel Group (MHG) and have 3 properties in London. This is the first time I have stayed at this particular hotel and keeping with the MHG Theme it is stylish, but not over the top to the point that you feel out of place.
Good staff to guest ratio ensures you are looked after, main restaurant has a casual feel and quiet louge area is a good place to work from. The Bar is popular with locals and is busy on the right night, only comment is the Bar has no natural light which is something I like. Rooms funky style also in keeping with the MHG properties. Location is great, right in the heart of the Theatre district so a short walk to see some of the best shows in town.  10 minute walk to Leicster Square and Tube.",5,2015,08,09
125,"Tight quarters, great location","Overall my stay was good. The room itself served it's purpose- it gave me someplace to shower and sleep. It was very small and not conducive to working out of.  The bed was comfortable, and except for my jet lag, I was able to sleep well. 

Room service was very tasty, and relatively quick to arrive. Colleagues of mine felt differently on that matter though I know.  

There was lots of confusion when it came to check out as the room charges were supposed to be prepaid to a master account but they actually weren't. (Despite the front desk confirming this to us when we checked in) While this wasn't a huge deal as it was a corporate booking, it could have been if we were traveling for leisure.

The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to many great restaurants and theaters.  Would have been a great hotel for a vacation stay. ",3,2015,08,09
125,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,"Love to stay at St. Martins Lane Hotel. The atmosphere is just fabulous, the staff is very helpful and the location is sublime! This is a great hotel to stay when in London. I can not think of some other place to stay :)

125,5 Star Staff!,"Stayed for 1 night to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  This hotel is a welcoming oasis in a crazy busy part of town.  Our room was quiet, comfortable, stylish and had a great view of the rooftops, London Eye etc. The girls on front desk, the concierge Joey and in particular,  Belle the Guest Service Manager all 'went the extra mile' to ensure we had a great stay.  Breakfast was first class.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2015,08,09
125,"Wonderful stay, perfect location","We keep coming back to this hotel and it always delivers. The location being close to Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden is perfect and the staff are always very helpful. Try Nd upgrade to a south facing room, great to wake up to a sunrise over the church. Just wanted to thank Andrei Ene who is always helpful and showed us to our room and explained the technology.",5,2015,08,07
125,Modern Elegance,"We stayed one night in August whilst on a theatre trip. Our welcome was first class and our room beautiful. We felt pampered and special. Didn't eat in the restaurant as we felt it was a bot expensive, but lots of good eating places close by. 
Superb room facilities - although you have to ask for tea and coffee in your room. This does arrive very quickly, at no charge.
Shower and bath towels all excellent. Room bright and tastefully presented. We loved the different lighting - and the superb A/C.",5,2015,08,06
125,Almost great,"There are lots of things to love about this hotel. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly; the location is perfect for central London; and our room was lovely. 

There were a few things, however, that stopped our experience from being truly excellent. 

Our room was on the first floor and must have been above the toilets in reception as we could hear the hand drier every time it was used. We didn't really notice this on our first two nights, but there was an outbreak of wet hands on our final night as the drier was going off all through the night. Just as we were falling asleep the drier would roar to life again. 

We were woken on our first morning by a very loud, high-pitched drilling. We called reception and the drilling did stop. In fairness, we came back to our room that night to find a bottle of wine along with an apology note. The note was addressed to the wrong person (I guess a few people must have complained) and we didn't actually have a chance to drink the wine and couldn't take it with us as we only had hand luggage on our flight, but I suppose it's the thought that counts. 

Finally, while we loved the lobby bar, we ate at Asia de Cuba and thought the food was pretty average at best. A shame as the restaurant itself looks great. 

We're lucky enough to enjoy a long weekend in London three or four times a year so might give the hotel another chance as it is very close to being wonderful. ",4,2015,08,06
125,Superb Hotel,"Ideal for a long weekend trip to London.

Perfect location and luxurious hotel which fully deserves its 5* rating.

A La Carte Breakfast's are a big upgrade on the usual buffet fare offered by other hotels and really sets you up for the day.

And the Secret Door bar is a must visit.",5,2015,08,06
125,"Great Location, helpful staff","Stayed one night, was delighted to receive a complimentary room upgrade when we arrived in the morning and asked where if we could leave our case - even better, could access the room straight away.  Reception staff were very helpful, as was the doorman. Extremely comfortable bed and spacious, spotless room. 
No bath only a shower.Teeny bit annoying to have to ask for tea/coffee facilities to be sent up instead of them being available in the room.  Cocktail bar - good ambience but my actual cocktail disappointing... 
Liked the location near busy Leicester Square and theatres, yet inside hotel it was peaceful and calming.",4,2015,08,05
125,Fantastic Hotel & Staff,"Fabulous hotel, immaculate with very friendly, helpful staff.

125,Outstanding Hotel and Service,"Our stay here was for two weeks. Our room was very modern and clean. The  staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was kept clean with two a day services. It was a nice touch to come in at night and have the candle lit and the mood lights on.  We requested a coffee maker and it was provided. This was helpful as we like a cup of coffee in the morning before we get dressed and go out for the day. The location is an extremely busy one. This was great for us as we liked the many options for restaurants and shops within walking distance. Also, the Leicester Square Tube Station was very close to the hotel which made movement around the town easy.
It is just a block from The National Gallery of Art and the Portrait Gallery. We highly  recommend this hotel!",5,2015,08,03

Next door to 3 underground stations, it was very convenient. As was the probity to Leicester Square and Covent Garden. Food was never an issue because of that no matter what time of the day. Even though the area has an active night life, its always felt safe because of the hustle and bustle during nights.

The hotel itself was very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Room service was quick. The room itself was very good and my daughter enjoyed the adjustable mood lighting.",5,2015,08,03

This location is near the Leicester Square underground station and Trafalgar Square. We walked to so many little pubs, restaurants, shops, and museums. Atmosphere of the lobby and the rooms off of the lobby were quirky, interesting, and inviting. The rooms themselves were comfortable and very stylish (you can pick your own lighting scheme/color!).

Our only complaint would be that the shower was was not designed well and essentially flooded the bathroom if we didn't shove towels against the shower door. While we didn't use it, we did have access to the adjoining health club. Wi-fi was great.",5,2015,08,02
125,"Modern, Clean, and Centrally Located","We picked the hotel for it's central location and proximity to various activities in London,  And, we were not disappointed. Everything is within walking distance - Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, Theaters, shopping, and museums.  Plus lots of great cafes and restaurants to choose from.

The hotel has been renovated with very modern touches.  The room itself was on the very small side, but it got lots of light and the bathroom was a decent size.  Although we would have liked a larger room, the location of the hotel made up for the small room.  The lobby and service are also very good.  The breakfast at the hotel is typical european fare, you can get hot entrees at a small additional price. 

Overall, I would recommend the hotel for anyone looking to stay in a great location. The furnishing are sparse but the modern touches (USB ports, TV) and clean looks make up for luxury.",4,2015,08,02

To our surprise they also brought up a bottle of champagne and brownies for my mums birthday which was so kind and above and beyond any usual service from a hotel. Location was perfect, right between Leicester Square and Covent Garden. Absolutely no complaints with this hotel and will definitely return. Thank you so much! ",5,2015,07,31
125,A welcome return,"This was our third stay at St Martins Lane and- post refurb- it didn't disappoint.  We weren't able to secure a room at late notice on the Thursday and so stayed instead with another Morgans Group hotel, The Mondrian, over in Southbank.  Nice enough but a frostier atmosphere and customer service not great.  St Martins Lane, however, is going from strength to strength.  The fundamentals are in place and somebody is running a tight ship in terms of training as this level of attentive service doesn‚Äôt happen by accident.  The restaurant and the chaps on the door stand out as being particularly tuned in to keeping clients happy.  Communication was good and even though they couldn't fulfil our early check-in request, when the room did become available, it was certainly worth the wait.  A studio room, with two walls of windows and a lovely view of the rotating globe on top of the Coliseum, it was hard to fault (room 305).  As ever, we struggle a little with the concept of no door to the bathroom (what ought one to do if suffering from tummy troubles?) though can forgive it for being minimalist, stylish and sparklingly clean.  The fittings and fixtures all look great after reinvestment and the sleep quality (for 3 of us) was excellent.  With our 6 year old in tow- and following a much anticipated trip to see Peter Pan at the Royal Opera House- we found both dinner and breakfast (and a quick lunch on leaving) as well run and pleasing as before.  Even though I wouldn't necessarily categorise this as a 'family choice' hotel- children being in shorter supply than elsewhere- the staff are genuinely warm and engaging and make a fuss.  Breakfast was plentiful, well cooked and even though the quiet hum of patrons was shattered by a thoughtless table of young American techies listening to their music at full volume, a quiet request to use headphones resulted in a return to a pleasant eating environment.  I have no doubt, if we had needed it, that the restaurant waiting staff would have intervened in a typically well versed and light-touch manner.  They really are consummate professionals in the art of running a smart, slick restauranting operation (by night Asia de Cuba) with super front of house and wonderfully pared down and delicious menus.  We look forward to returning soon.",5,2015,07,30

125,My Favorite Hotel in London,"The newly refreshed St Martins Lane Hotel is my favourite hotel in London full stop, I have been regular guest for the last seven year and with any great hotel it‚Äôs the people that work there that make the difference and the people that work at SML are fantastic, friendly attentive to detail and there to make their guests feel special. Second reason is its great location in the heart of theatreland and within five minutes walk to several tube lines and third, beautiful white linen on comfortable beds with fluffy pillows  in a cleanly designed well appointed room. The new secret bar is a find and the restaurant as always delicious.   If you can‚Äôt tell I am a big fan. 
",5,2015,07,27
125,perfect location.,"My husband booked this hotel as a birthday treat and I wasn't disappointed.  The hotel is modern with nice staff. The room was very clean and bigger than an average hotel room in London and the bed was so comfy I slept like a baby. We had a full cooked breakfast which was very nicely presented and delicious.   The location is great, you have Covent Garden one way and Leicester Square the other way with Regent St and Oxford St a short walk away.  If we go to London for another over night stay we would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,07,27
125,Brilliant!,"What a fantastic hotel. Such a friendly and welcoming place. This is a high end hotel without all the fluff and pretentious attitudes you find in so many London hotels. The staff are always having a laugh which means they are so cheerful. It seems they are genuinely happy to be there. The rooms are lovely. Superb air conditioning, comfy beds and crisp sheets. The shower is also super powered and lovely and hot. I came back one evening to find the room service had been in and lit the candles in the bathroom which was a lovely touch to the turn down service. The food was AMAZING! I can't really add more, it was gorgeous. I was here for 4 nights and my work colleagues and I didn't have a single complaint, which is a miracle, because usually someone complains about something. I will definitely return. New fave London hotel.",5,2015,07,26
125,Sharon Harris -kearney,"Stated here for one night and thoroughly enjoyed it ! The hotel is a gem in the heart of Covent Garden and from the minute we checked in the service was top rate! As it was my husbands 60 th birthday we got an upgrade and a bottle of wine!
The decor is very modern and the rooms are very tranquil ! Loved the bathroom and the bed was so comfortable! I would highly recommend this hotel ! ",5,2015,07,26
125,"""The Blind Spot""","The only reason we knew this swanky cocktail bar was in St.Martins newly refurbished hotel was because we were invited by friends of which one was the Project Manager for the refurbishment! What an apt name as well....we asked reception where the bar was as couldn't see it for looking and was told mysteriously "" follow the carpet runner to where it stops..."" Well we did and whilst walking down looked like it just ended by some book shelves. We were then greeted by another member of staff and shown the entrance via a door with a handle apparently moulded from one of the staff members hands (so says my insider the Project Manager). The bar itself was lovely, no fussy surroundings, good use of the mirrored walls and a great focal point at the end with the bar. The cocktail selection shown was, I thought, initially limited but the bar were showcasing their specials and could make anything requested. We did struggle slightly with the low lighting (age) but the helpful waitress sat with us and explained the choices in a very easy and helpful way. The cocktails are not cheap averaging ¬£12-14 each but as a venue to meet friends, catch up and savour some excellently made cocktails this is a highly recommended venue, 
",4,2015,07,25
125,Very good choice,"we've stayed in this hotel for a week in July and it was a great choice.
Location is terrific : 5 min walking toTrafalgar Square, National Museum, theaters and Piccadilly Circus. Underground station just a few steps away and LOTS of cafes, restaurants, shops in walking distance - as is Covent Garden as well. Couldn't be happier! 
 The hotel is very modern and fashionable, feels like you are entering one nightclub sometimes and the staff is very polite and accommodating. We've never had any meal there since there are so many options so can't judge. It's a bit pricey but I would definitely recommend and go back.
By the way, we were in a family of 3, with a 11 yr old boy, and hotel met all of our expectations.
",5,2015,07,24
125,Fantastic!,"I took my partner here for a surprise as part of her birthday celebrations and the staff, particularly Isabelle, made sure her stay was fantastic. We really couldn't fault a thing!

The room was a great size and had an awesome view, especially at night!
      ",5,2015,07,24
125,"This Hotel is ideally placed for a Theatre trip, as it is situated in Theatre land.","We have just returned from a one night stay at St Martins Lane hotel. We arrived at 11.30 am not expecting our room to be available, but found that it was ready for us and the reception staff could not have been more efficient. The room on the 4 th floor was everything we had hoped for, a good view over Trafalgar Square and spotlessly clean . We had a show booked and found the Hotel ideally sited for an easy 10 minute stroll to the Theatre.",5,2015,07,23
125,Hidden Jem - literally,Very friendly and helpful staff in a hotel that is hidden from plain sight. The subtle exterior hides a unique concept of open and hidden areas from the lobby to the bar to the rooms. A must see!( If you don‚Äôt walk past it like I did (twice) ),4,2015,07,23
125,Stylishly average...,"I've stayed at this hotel on a couple of occasions and reviewed it positively in the past. But I must say I was distinctly unimpressed with my latest overnight here. 

We turned up at reception at 2.45 - hoping to check in before a 3pm meeting around the corner. However the polite but unnecessarily firm robot on the desk informed us we were ""too early to check in"" (rooms are ready from 3pm). By this time it was 2.50. Are you seriously telling me that a hotel of this standard doesn't have ONE room ready before mid afternoon on a weekday? It just felt dull and bureaucratic - something the hotel goes to great lengths to avoid.

Later that day we finally checked into a clean & comfortable corner room but I'm afraid the whole hip minimalist thing feels a little dated and - dare I say it - bourgeois these days. One is reminded of an IKEA show room at times. Even more disappointingly the bed was incredibly firm and uncomfortable and the tea and coffee making facilities were on the distinctly frugal side. When will these five star design hotels realise that their guests have the ability to enjoy hip interiors AND a shortbread biscuit with our beverages? üòÄ

What lets this hotel down most however are the staff and the general ambience. It used to be a bit of an ""it"" place ten or more years ago buts it's not caught on that its now just one of many similarly styled soulless haunts. Hence the staff seem to think they're running one of Nick Jonses places, when in reality this is eons away from anything remotely ahead of the curve. Save your cash and invest in a room at the Hospital Club up the street instead - where they actually like dealing with human beings as opposed to wannabe reality stars.

",2,2015,07,23
125,Unique experience ,"Beautiful funky hotel with top service. Pricey but worth paying extra for the upgrade! Room was spacious with lots of hidden gadgets and unusual touches that made the stay really fun.
Fantastic location - only a few minutes walk to central tube stations.
Me and my friend stayed in February and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. They even managed to get us into the vip club area at the W club! ",5,2015,07,22
125,"Stunning hotel, great service, best location","Stunning fashion hotel, a staff is very polite and looks gorgeous. Hotel has great interior design with it own glamorous soul. Location is 50 meters near to Trafalgar Square, National Museum and Musicals. Best currency change Covent Garden FX is not far from, on Jubilee Market. I was there twice.",5,2015,07,22
125,Minimalistic and lovely,"Fantastic hotel and the best location to explore Covent Garden/Soho and Central London. The hotel is located near the National Gallery and also National Portrait Gallery and most theatres/ shows without having to travel long distances.

St Martins Lane Hotel is literally steps away from Leicester Square tube station so you are in the busy westend but the hotel rooms are well sound proofed so you do not hear the busy street or noises from the nearby restaurants and bars. Best of both worlds to enjoy the convenience of being in a busy lively place but enjoy the peace and quiet of well appointed rooms. 

Hotel room itself is very minimalistic in design but clever ideas such as built in USB chargers in convenient places around the room help without having to plug in adaptors to charge your phones and electronic devices. 

Fantastic Goetz and Malin toiletries in bathroom and daily turn down service transform the room into a really magical space when you return to a re-freshed room with candles add a special touch to this hotel. 

All staff were very welcoming and friendly from the check in front desk to the hardworking cleaners and housemaids. 

I will look forward to stay again on my next visit to London",5,2015,07,22
125,What a find!,"This hotel is second to none and the best we have stayed in during our visits to London.  During every part of our stay we received excellent customer service from people who seemed to care.  We ate at the Den and Blind Spot both were excellent and not over-priced.  The breakfast buffet selection was good and the smoothies excellent.  I did not have the cooked breakfast but my other half did and said it was delicious (just as it looked).  It is really nice to have this brought to you rather than sitting on a warming plate.  One nights sleep was interrupted by a noisy neighbour, the hotel security team resolved this, but otherwise the beds guaranteed a good nights rest.  In summary, the location of this hotel is superb, this is matched by the customer service, facilities and rooms provided.  We will definitely return.",5,2015,07,20
125,"Excellent Hotel, even better Staff !","Great Hotel in the perfect location and more importantly wonderful, pleasant and the most accommodating staff. Will definitely return and would recommend this hotel. Luggage store on day we were due to leave was also a big plus.

Staff is attentive at all times but not obtrusive it doesn't hurt that they all look like the just came of the catwalk.... And just look at that lobbyüòúüòú love sitting with a glas of bubbly watching the world check-in. Rooms are neat and clean with the right level of minimalist and smarts.,5,2015,07,20
125,"Beautiful Hotel, But......","Hotel wasn't easy to find, but did find it eventually. The hotel is perfectly positioned, modern, clean and very boutique chic. The staff are polite, helpful and friendly. The rooms are very white and a little clinical. We had a pleasant view outside our room considering it was positioned in a built up area. However, we were in room 301 which was very very close to two other rooms. So close in fact, a party we assume were staying in the adjacent room woke us up early hours In the morning with talking and laughing (not impressed as we had a long day planned within a few hours). My other, albeit minor gripe is, my husband & I love a nice cuppa in the morning. We had a choice of teas...peppermint, earl grey etc. we hate flavoured tea, we just wanted a nice breakfast tea. There was anIndian black tea which would've been fine, but only one bag. I went to see the concierge who clearly didn't listen (she picked up the phone before I'd properly finished my sentence!) to my request was for a couple more Indian black tea because when a member of staff arrived I was given a pit of the exact same teabags that I already had....peppermint, earl grey etc. AARGH!!! Such a simple request to make our stay a bit more homely. We are very well travelled and have stayed in some excellent hotels. This one felt as if you had to pay extra for everything.",4,2015,07,19
125,"Sleek, stylish and ultra modern","The staff here were fantastic and extremely welcoming. The hotel is very stylish and contemporary, not for everyone I'm sure but I personally loved it. Could have easily been too trendy and pretentious but the atmosphere was never like that. The Blind Spot Bar serves fabulous cocktails and again has a lovely relaxed atmosphere, a bit dark but still lovely! Excellent central location, would definitely stay again, what more can I say!",4,2015,07,19
125,So was it as good on the second visit...? ,"Yes, it most certainly was, in fact it was even better! 
I was so blown away by first visit to this hotel in June, I cancelled the booking for this trip at my regular hotel & re booked for SML. 
I really did not think this hotel could do better than the first time in terms of service & experience - how wrong I was. 
Belle, Guest Experience Manager absolutely surpassed herself. From walking into the reception area she recognised me instantly without me having to say who I was. This is really impressive especially when you think how many guests these guys come into contact with each & every dat. From a customer perspective I felt amazing. 
I was visiting with my mum & Belle went out of her way again to make sure our visit was memorable. The added touched in our fabulous too were not unnoticed & greatly appreciated especially by my mum who just could not get over how genuine the people at SML were & how special she was made to feel. 
My mum is in her 70's but said A visit to SML had taken years off her, especially when she was made a fuss of on entering Blind Spot by the nice young chap at the reception area. 
We only had breakfast one morning at the hotel & greatly regret this. On the other morning we visited the Wolesley, which had always been a firm favourite however in terms of service & quality the SML hotel is superior in my view. 
You really cannot get a better hotel with a fabulous location & the best approach to customer experience I have encountered in a very long time & believe me I visit & stay at many hotels throughout the year for work & leisure and a lot are in London. 
This is a genuine 5 star hotel that caters for your every need & cares about its customers. It's rare to get all of this from a hotel these days. 
All I need to do now is find another excuse to go back, soon!!!",5,2015,07,19
125,Location and View,"Placed just behind Trafalgar Square and a short walk to Soho and Covent Garden, you would be hard-pushed to find a better placed hotel in London. Leicester Square and Embankment tube stations are handy. Even though Covent Garden tube station is also very close, I found it best not to use that station because it is usually overfull with people and the lifts tend not to work (no lift means 250 steps to walk up, or some such ridiculous amount).

My room was smallish but not cramped. It was a long walk from the lift, which did not bother me at all, especially since I had postcard views of the London Eye and the spires and roofs of London. Big windows to take it all in. Good-sized bathroom but no bath. Room 620.

Service was very good. Staff were helpful and engaged, from the staff at the front desk, the porters, the waiting staff and Concierge, all seemed to know what they were doing and did it well.

I had drinks in the ""secret"" bar and it was fun. It is not the kind of place where you can sit or stand at the bar. Here you are given a seat in an alcove at a small table. I was with a friend, but had I been alone I would have preferred an actual bar to drink at. Still, it was a friendly place and did not have any attitude like some such nightclubby places. The dj kept the music to a level so that it was possible to have a conversation.

I had eaten at the hotel restaurant before and was not very impressed. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to give it another try this time.

I liked The Sanderson's bar and vibe, but I liked St Martin's Lane location and price and the view from my room. Either way, these Morgan hotels are very likeable. Must try the Mondrian too!",5,2015,07,19
125,Friendly welcoming staff ,A wonderful few days away with my husband and baby girl. From the minute we arrived until after we had checked out the staff couldn't have made us feel more welcome. The room was spacious with a fabulous view with a lovely bathroom and spotlessly clean. Will definitely revisit here on our next London trip. ,5,2015,07,18
125,Fantastic stay!,From the moment I booked to when we checked out everything was perfect! All the staff were great but Belle deserves a special mention her attention to detail was amazing and made our stay to celebrate my daughters graduation so memorable! Rooms and all areas of hotel were immaculate. Would recommend it to all.,5,2015,07,18
125,Trendy and cool,"I've stayed in many hotels in London and I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. I've also stayed at other Morgan's hotels and this was their best one. I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for some service/technical problems we encountered.

I'll start with the bad things: Our room wasn't ready on time and that was at 3pm, 3 hours after their check out time. We flew from Brazil and were exhausted and had a big night planned and that just was a bitter start especially at the rate they charge. Second issue, was that there was an open concept bathroom so you couldn't close the door when you were doing you business. I normally hate open concept bathrooms in general, but this was a double bed bedroom, I think that implies the people staying there are not a couple, hence was my case staying with my brother. Awkward. The elevators were strangely weird and not as beautiful as the rest of the hotel. And what bothered us the most, was that when we were checking out in a rush to catch our flight, the lady who was helping us stopped midway, told us to wait, and went on to help another customer. It felt that they prioritized this other lady just because she was dressed much fancier. I found that extremely rude and unacceptable.

Now the good part (And the good did outweigh the bad): The place is beautiful, sleek, edgy and elegant, without being tacky and dark. Its also not as bougie as their hotels in Miami. The staff was very kind and attentive especially the doorman and the bell boy. The staff looks what you expect from this kind of hotel, meaning they all look like models, but they still treat you with so much respect which isn't common in these trendy places unless you are a celebrity. The room (Aside from the open bathroom) was amazing! It was so clean, and remained very clean, despite us being messy guests. Props to the housekeeping team. There was so much natural light, windows galore, the beds were very big and comfortable, and the lighting was so cool. The lobby and breakfast restaurant were very trendy and beautiful as well. And last, the location was magnificent. the trendiest part of London. With a bit more attention this hotel would easily make the top of my list.",4,2015,07,17
125,"Great Service, Great Location, Bit Boring","Finding the hotel is a bit of a challenge on account of it being a bit trendy and discrete. However, the reception staff were hot, fun and welcoming and made me feel like i was a comedic genius.  A real boost after a 25 hour trip! 
The room was an upgraded loft room (321, although sans Dusty Bin je regrette) and was spacious, well appointed and very clean with lots of lovely things you could buy for reassuringly ridiculous prices. $30 condoms seemed very posh. The room had a very nice atmosphere, district views across nice parts of London and had a range of fancy lights that make it easy to identify any mysterious stains on the bedding of which there were thankfully none. 
Its a bit hotel, surprisingly considering the area, and the better rooms are a fair trek from reception, so don't forget anything when you leave the room. The hotel bar is very discrete and made for a good night cap option. 
All up its a great place to stay for couples, trendies and the soon-to-be-famous people and i enjoyed the experience. It's clean, quiet, comfortable, not over priced considering it's reputation and the service was of the highest quality.",4,2015,07,16
125,Edgy and cool,"We had a fabulous two night stay at St Martins Lane.
The hotel is so cool it doesn't even have a name on the outside..inside the ambience, decor and furniture are very Phillipe Starck.

The location is perfectly placed for London Theatreland.
Hope to visit again soon! ",5,2015,07,16
125,About room and corridors,"There was no day light. Room was good. Air condtion was really successful. I wonder to take sun light. Also the most disturbing thing was the way to the rooms. Corridors are so long and narrow and frightening. I stayed at 520 room ad I really felt unprotected.

125,Great room and location,"Rare to find a room with as much space and light, so close to everything. The staff were excellent, friendly, helpful and discreet.

125,Amazing Stay at St Martins Lane,"Everything about St Martins Lane was perfect!  Belle and the entire team were the most hospitable, kind, and genuine people I've encountered at a hotel.  They made sure every part of my experience was special, taking extra steps to upgrade my room (609 has the most amazing view of the London Eye and St. Martins-in-the-Fields), offer turn-down service every night, arrange tickets through a broker, etc.  The hotel is in an ideal location in the middle of it all, but down a smaller one-way street so it's not noisy or too busy at any time.  Couldn't have been better and I will never forget my trip!",5,2015,07,13
125,A Perfect Haven in a Perfect Location,"Modern, fairly minimalist hotel in a truly fantastic location. Rooms are so restful and comfortable - huge snuggly beds - wonderful lighting and the bathrooms are gorgeous with large powerful showers. I do not agree with the reviewer who felt the rooms were too small and I certainly had bedside tables in my room. Staff are excellent and extremely helpful. We simply drove to the front and our car was parked for us. So easy. If you want a quiet drink, there is a quiet bar but if you want lively, there is a trendy bar hidden just off reception which is a surprise as you can hear nothing of it at all. Ask housekeeping for tea and coffee making facilities which swiftly arrive free of charge.  Hotel smells wonderful everywhere so it was a surprise to learn they have smoking rooms. Simply ask when booking or at reception. Located in the heart of theatreland with most major sights and attractions within walking distance, we saved on taxi fares. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as it is expensive, but if you turn right from the front door, the first restaurant you come to serves a brilliant breakfast at a reasonable cost!!!!",5,2015,07,13
125,Weinbaum vacation in London,"We had a very nice week. The concierge staff were very helpful, particularly with restaurants. They would be even more effective if they had their own printer attached to their laptop so that they could print out directions and other information. They were all very nice, but sometimes their handwriting sucked.

Finally, after staying there a week, we found the hallways and elevator a bit depressing. Too dark.

125,Lovely hotel however disappointed..,"The hotel is absolutely lovely and we had a really comfortable stay here in such a fab location. However one thing that has bothered me is the ¬£100 deposit that was taken off of my debit card on arrival on Wednesday 8th July. I was told because I didn't have a credit card they would except a debit card but I would have ¬£100 taken until I checked out and it would then be given back to me. On the day of checking out (Thursday 9th) I asked the receptionist if the money had been put back into my account and she replied yes. I have checked my accounts today and the money still hasn't been returned to me. So I called the hotel and was told it takes around 3-5 working days, something that I was not told on the day of arrival or when I left. I'm just disappointed that it takes this long to be given back to me especially as I wasn't informed.",4,2015,07,12
125,Great Experience & central location,"My wife & I had a 1 night stay at this hotel as a stop over after a 30-day trip to Italy. We could not have been happier as the staff was extremely friendly & helpful, the hotel was clean & new, and the room was super comfortable (beds & pillows great). Also the shower was fabulous with great pressure (unusual for most hotels). 
Lastly the location was very convenient with all of the main attractions generally within walking distance. 
Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,07,12

We were upgraded to a apartment with amzing views and the rooms was very stylish and generously proportioned. However it was very noisy, we did not manage to go to sleep until 4 in the morning.

125,"""The Buzz Lightyear Experience""  (Infinity and Beyond)"," WOW!!!!
This trip was a surprise for our 20th wedding anniversary from my gorgeous husband ,and the very first stop from Heathrow was a surprise hotel!
 After a few attempts at locating this hotel amidst a very busy Soho location, we could not have been happier or more pleased!
We were upgraded to an apartment on account of our special occasion,and from the hand written note from Natalie and the reception staff to the bottle of bubbly chilling in our AMAZING top floor room, that alone was worth the flight from Australia!!
From Egor and Ahmed at the door to Natalie and Sabina on reception, through to Izabel and the welcoming staff at Asia De Cuba for our first night dinner at the top notch resident restaurant, we were treated like royality .The cocktail lounge is hidden behind a  door, and the atmosphere of both these places is private yet funky!

NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING was ever too much trouble from any of the staff we encountered upon our 2 night stay. 
Everyone we felt went well above and beyond their job description (hence Buzz s catch phrase of ""To Infinity and Beyond!"").
On behalf of my husband and myself we cannot praise highly enough the attentive staff, warm and welcoming ambience, and thank everyone we encountered at our stay at St Martins! Apologies to any one we forgot to mention, but I am sure you all know who you are that made this Australian couple feel super special on our special day!",5,2015,07,11

125,One Night Stay 7/7/15,"After reading the description on the hotel's own website, decided upon booking this hotel for my wife's birthday treat and booking a show. We weren't disappointed. From the extremely easy and courteous booking in at reception, it was a delight. We were told at reception that we had been upgraded to a garden room (after months ago emailing the hotel to tell them of my wife's birthday I assume), and this for her was amazing. We don't often book into hotels of this quality (well, never actually!), so the luxury of the room blew us both away. From the little touches that count, such as the personalised message on the TV screen when you first switch on, to the lovely bottle of bubbly and chocolate cake with personal fondant writing when we returned from our afternoon out. I can't thank the management enough for making it a day and night for her to remember. 
We will definitely return here again, it is so ideally situated for virtually everything you need to see in London. 
Thanks so much to SML Hotel.  ",5,2015,07,09
125,Wonderful stay,"We had an absolute wonderful stay at St Martins Lane.  We were in town for pleasure (and Wimbledon), stayed at the hotel for 9 nights.

We will most definitely return!",5,2015,07,08
125,Simply the highest quality and superb value,"You can stop searching around for hotels in London- this place is hard to beat. The Loft Double Double is perfect for a family of 4 with young kids who do not mind sharing the very large Queen bed. Modern but tasteful d√©cor, high end bathroom fixtures. Great shower with high water pressure. Extremely comfortable bed. In theater district, close to underground, dining and Trafalgar Sq- but rooms are very quiet at night. Great housekeeping service, excellent front desk and bell staff (Thanks for all the help Sam!) . Concierge (Biken and Henrik) dealt efficiently with pre arrival requests. The Den and the restaurant for dinner looked great but we did not try them. 
Rooms here are less than half the price of the bigger name luxury hotels- but it is far superior to them in every way. A world class bargain as hotels go.",5,2015,07,07
125,An oasis of luxury in the middle of Covent Garden,"We stayed at St Martins Lane because we'd heard it was designed by Philippe Starcke and we had loved his Mama Shelter design in Marseille. This is similar, but so much more sophisticated! A modern, spotless hotel bang in the centre of Covent Garden, but which feels like a trendy underground club - the entire experience was quite fabulous. 

The rooms are large, clean and bright, with trendy neon pops of colour, great light fittings, flatscreen TVs and a beautifully comfortable bed. There were usb sockets for your chargers or to connect in to, and the room was calm and relaxing. The bathroom was very stylish, with a rain shower and a pot plant, we had fluffy robes, an ironing board and generous and beautiful toiletries. 

We had a pre-dinner drink in the bar, which had very unique art work adorning the walls (very Philippe Starcke!) and there was also a hidden underground bar, which was very dark and very busy, and made us feel like we were part of a secret club. The breakfast the following morning was impeccable, and a post-check out billing query was handled absolutely perfectly by staff, all of whom were friendly and shiny, like better versions of you and me (!). This hotel is an absolute oasis - we will definitely be back!",5,2015,07,07
125,Excellent location/Cool Rooms/Friendly Staff,"We enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel.  The location has easy access to so many sites and restaurants. The rooms are very new and not only is there free wi fi but rather than needing a converter, the hotel has UBS outlets in the wall. The hotel staff were very accommodating.  We moved rooms from the 2nd floor to a higher floor for better view and it was quieter.",5,2015,07,07
125,Astonishingly brilliant full English breakfast,"Modern, stylish room, friendly staff, stylish restaurant and surprising hidden bar; all very  delicious if a little kitch in parts. The full English breakfast was the very best I've ever had anywhere, with superb bacon and sausage and reasonably priced.",4,2015,07,06
125,Hip & Trendy Morgan's Hotel,"I fell in love with anything that the Morgan's Hotel group has to offer ever since I stayed at the Shore Club Hotel which they own and operate in Miami. 

Sadly when I stayed here the hotel lobby, restaurants and some rooms were undergoing renovation. Still with all that, the hotel was perfect. The breakfast buffet was par or maybe a smudge beyond par. The room I got was spacious. The bathroom was practically half the room and lined with marble. There is a walk in shower as well as a bathtub if that's your sort of thing. 

The bed and linens were comfortable. The tech in the room was par. There's a decent mini-bar. You can even change the color of the lighting in the room to suit your mood; whether you're feeling romantic or just want to relax; there's a color for that. 

The hotel is perfectly situated on a not so very noisy London street. It's a few steps away from an alleyway filled with pubs. There's a Starbucks literally outside the door. The Five Guys burger is only a few steps away. If you want a quick bite to eat you can also go to the EAT. Cafe near the hotel or the Chipotle which you can see from your window.

I am going to London again in September and will definitely be staying at this hotel.",4,2015,07,06
125,Superb Central London hotel,"Excellent facilities, location and service.  The staff could not do more for you.  Room was excellent size, serviced throughout the day and the shower was amazing.  The concierges were great, even got us into the number 1 A lister restaurant for lunch on the day we requested.

125,Ultra modern London hotel,"Very modern hotel in the heart of London close to many attractions.  Trafalgar square, Westminster, Parliament, Big Ben, and Buckingham are all within a short walk.  The theaters are also very close by and Piccadilly Circus is also close by.  High end shopping is only around the corner.  Staff extremely helpful and pleasant.  I would definitely stay there again.

125,Retro chic in Central London,"This is the place Madonna used to stay when it was new and she was in the charts. It has lost none of its style and standard of service, although the A-listers probably use the W Hotel now.

The staff were welcoming and friendly from the moment we walked in, and nothing was too much trouble. The room was immaculate, and serviced twice a day. We loved the mood lighting, and the cute touches, like the 'glow-in-the-dark' hidden messages on the Do Not Disturb door tag.

We didn't use the restaurant, but the bar was a welcome and stylish respite from a busy Saturday night in town. We asked for a late checkout on our last day, and again, it was no trouble at all for the receptionist.

Highly recommended, and not expensive considering the quality.",5,2015,06,30
125,Out of this world and....and yet in the heart of it all,"We just enjoyed THE most magical 4 nights at SML. Our room was fantastic, all the staff incredible, the energy warm and chic. We didn't want to leave!  A massive thanks to everyone especially the concierge, Mike Fitzgerald who took care of us in hous, out of house, and back of house.  Thank you so so much ",5,2015,06,30
125,June 2015 Stay at St Martin's Lane,Booked a deluxe room for weekend stay (Fri-Sun).  Superb experience from the moment we arrived until we left on Sunday.  Staff were super friendly and took time to actually speak to you.  Made my 8 yr old daughter feel very special.  The room was excellent and with the added chic features you find at St martins.  The breakfast is very good and hotel is spotless.  Will be staying again without doubt.  Great location. ,5,2015,06,29
125,fantastic stay,"Contemporary... yes, fun....yes, stylish absolutely. Stayed here as part of a business trip,  and I would confess I was a but apprehensive, but after I arrived, checked in which was quick and easy any concerns soon melted away. My room was comfortable and modern and what a good idea to have 
usb  charging sockets in the wall next to the bed. Once unpacked I decided to go for a nose round Leicester Square which was only a 2 minute walk away and when I returned another great surprise,  a turn down service that tidy the room but also placed lighted candles around the large bathroom area. A great night sleep on a brilliant bed, and the food at breakfast was brill, the full English was cooked fresh and not from a warm buffet. I'll defiantly becoming back ",5,2015,06,29
125,Belle and the rest of the hotel staff are first class,"ROOM:
Stayed in a deluxe garden room 26th June until 28th June 2015 (room 144)
As it was a fantastic weekend weather wise it was perfect to be able to sit out in the garden/patio area and soak up the early morning sunshine. Additionally, to end the evening with a drink prior to retiring to bed in the garden/patio was also great. I would recommend this type of room for that reason alone. However, be prepared that you will not have a view of the London skyline as these are located on the first floor. However, you do get a great view of the potted plants from the comfort of your bed which does make you feel like you're outside. For us, as it was Pride weekend, being able to clear your head in the garden/patio area from the heavy drinking the night before was a godsend.

STAFF:
I would like to thank all of your Team at St Martins Lane for making this weekend a truly memorable one for Matt and me. Every member of staff we had interaction with were incredibly friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  There were a few highlights whilst staying at this hotel. Matt and I were very touched by the gracious gift of the bottle of champagne with a lovely note from Belle - Guest Experience Manager. For us it made the start of our Pride weekend very special. Thank you so much for doing this. From the very start of me checking in Belle was present and was extremely helpful. The staff ensured a very quick and effective checkin and were very friendly and had beautiful smiles. The guys that arranged for my taxis were simply brilliant. Not only did they ensure the taxi knew exactly where to take me and place my bags in the taxi, they were incredibly handsome. Good choice St Martins Lane! I would also like to highlight the lovely staff in the Den. After checking out on Sunday and doing some shopping, Matt and I decided to end the day with a few wines, a glass of champagne and something to eat. I asked the member of staff if the kitchen could replace the bread for celery and carrot sticks within the meze dish, this was to be no issue at all. I was amazed at the size of it! For one person, it was a very large portion. Unfortunately, I did leave most of it and I did explain to the waitress that I felt the seasoning was not right. It was very bland indeed. When I came to pay, the waitress explained that she had this item removed from the bill. I did explain there was no need and I was only highlighting it so it could be reviewed. The waitress was insistent as I did not enjoy it. That is service! 
And as I have already mentioned the service throughout was first class.

LOCATION:
You truly cannot fault the location of the hotel. You are walking distance (and I do not walk normally) to Leicester Square, Picaddilly Circus, all the fantastic Theatres are literally on your doorstep and Soho of course.

I would like to thank all of the hotel staff and thank Belle again for making this weekend a very special one for both of Matt and I.

So why give this hotel 5 stars? Well, take away the trendy look of the place, take away the excellent locality to everything for a fantastic stay in London and even take away the great views from the rooms (I have stayed before on the upper floors), I gave the 5 stars because of the exceptional staff at St Martins Lane. Without you it could be just another funky hotel. All of you make St Martins Lane what it is. Perfection.

I can't wait to come back in a few months time.",5,2015,06,29
125,Fabulous hotel in the heart of London,"We love staying at the St Martins Lane hotel in London.  The service is so warm and friendly, we always feel as if we are their most important guests.  The rooms are comfortable and inviting, and the location of the hotel cannot be beat.  We cannot recommend it enough.
      ",5,2015,06,29
125,Nice place to be,"Right location, very pratical, beautiful design. Everything is close to the Hotel. The rooms have all you need, Breakfast is as it should. I recommend highly . One regret , When privat parties are on, the hotel bar is closed.",5,2015,06,29
125,"Great hotel, great venue","Stayed here for two nights. Excellent service, nice design. Actually one of the few hotels I like to stay. Had a patio with my room and in the evening the oil lamp on the table was lit also a candle in the open bathroom. Small details, high service.
      ",5,2015,06,29
125,Very modern and clean hotel in the heart of West End,"I am not sure what criteria the hotel had fulfilled to be awarded 5 stars but for us, apart from being very modern and newly decorated, it just felt very basic. The mood lighting is a nice touch but then I spent two days trying to do make up without a proper lighting (there is a mirror in a bathroom and one on the bedroom wall, none of them have a strong light and if you have just had a shower, the bathroom mirror is simply useless). 

Also, the toilet seat in the bathroom could do with a soft closing lid.

The hotel lies in a great location, just minutes from Leicester and Piccadilly and close to the tube station, so for a busy weekend filled with a show, concert and restaurants, it was ideal for us. The only problem was the fact that we couldn't find it. We walked passed it twice. There is no sign on the front actually saying ""St Martins Lane Hotel"". It's just a grey building with some fancy glass on the front and only because my iPhone's Google Maps said that we were standing outside of the actual hotel, we decided to go inside. There was a tiny picture frame with hotel's name on the reception desk, which finally assured me that we found our destination.

Generally very good hotel but for the prices they charge, it could be slightly better.",4,2015,06,28
125,"Great location, relaxed and friendly","We stayed here during a short visit to London and really enjoyed the trendy, relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The Hotel is a perfect place to stay, right in the Heart of the City for shopping and tourist action. The staff are friendly and make you feel welcome. The Rooms are small, but modern feel and some great modern lighting options to make the room bling during your stay.",5,2015,06,27
125,Great central London hotel,"We stayed here for the first time when we were up in town to see Carmen at the ENO just along the road.  What a great choice - something a bit different to the norm and quite special.  Very well laid out room; spotlessly clean and a very comfortable bed.
Highly recommended - we will return soon!",5,2015,06,26
125,Trendy hotel in the heart of the tourist area near theatre land,"I stayed here in business just for one night. The hotel is lovely decorated, trendy with dedicated staff. My room was very airy, modern and lots of additions including mood lighting.

The hidden bar is a treat and you step out of the door and you are in the heart of London.

Great place to stay in London",5,2015,06,26
125,Another great stay!!,"Enjoyed another fabulous stay at St Martin's Lane this week. Reception staff friendly and very welcoming as ever, room was cool on a hot London afternoon and very clean with a very comfortable bed after a long day working! The quality is always high and the staff always friendly - would highly recommend for business or leisure!",4,2015,06,26

125,Amazing hotel experience,"On planning our one night stay in London we wanted a central location as we were visiting the theatre in the West End in the evening. After some research we decided to book a nights stay at St Martins Lane and are so glad that we did.
I booked online which was so easy to do. I stupidly deleted the confirmation email so contacted the hotel and they sent a copy straight away.
I emailed the hotel to see if we could drop off our luggage on the day earlier than the 3pm check in time and dealt with Isabelle Fowkes who was so friendly and helpful.

On arrival at midday we checked in and dropped off our luggage and were told that the room would be ready at 3pm.
We were made to feel very welcome and the reception area is very stylish and beautiful.

The location of the hotel is excellent with 5 minutes walking distance to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Theatre land and numerous bars and restaurants.

We went back to the hotel at 2.30pm and had coffee and cake in The Den at the hotel.
Again the staff were so welcoming and helpful. They recommended the Cuban honey cake which was amazing! The Den itself was very tastefully decorated and relaxing.
At 3pm we went to check-in and we met Isabelle who was lovely. When I dealt with her I mentioned that the stay was for our wedding anniversary and she had arranged for a room to be booked for us with an amazing view and complimentary bottle of bubbly. She personally showed us to the room which was a lovely touch.

The room itself was beautifully simple and had everything that we needed from a well stocked mini bar to slippers and dressing gowns.
We were in room 610 and had excellent views of the London Eye and The Collesuem.
It was a shame to leave the room to go out!

We ate at Asia de Cuba at the hotel which again was beautifully decorated and the staff were excellent. The food was so tasty and well presented. (I have written a seperate review for the restaurant).

Breakfast was excellent. We booked to have breakfast as part of the stay and could help ourselves to juice, breads, fruit, cereals, cold meat, cheeses and yogurts and also got to choose from the a la carte menu. We had the full English and the minute steak which were both excellent. The coffee was also great.

Check out was at midday so there was no rush to leave which is a nice touch.

Overall our stay was excellent but we had 2 little niggles........
The Blind Spot bar had a private function from 7pm-10pm so hotel guests could not use the bar. This was not a major issue as you could still get a drink in The Den but it would have been nice to have been told at check in.
The other was that a ¬£100 deposit is taken from your payment card at check in then the full balance taken on check out. The ¬£100 is then credited back to you within a couple of days. We thought the final balance would be minus the ¬£100 rather than a credit.
Again nothing major, just a little niggle.

We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area.
The prices may seem a little high but you do get what you pay for and the hotels location is brilliant. It is worth paying extra for a special occasion and to feel really spoilt!
Again, all of the staff that we dealt with were amazing but a special thank you to Isabelle Fowkes, Isabelle the waitress at Asia de Cuba (who offered excellent travelling tips) and the two waitresses in The Den. You all made our stay extra special.",5,2015,06,24
125,Superb,"Fantastic hotel, great location, superb friendly staff from the concierge, to the maids, wonderful. Self service breakfast which offered everything that you could want. This hotel is simply the best - it's faultless....would definitely go back again.",5,2015,06,24
125,Cannot be faulted!,"What a find.  The service and quality of the hotel were superb.  And then there was the location.  I spend a lot of time in London on business, but this was exceptional.  A nice weekend away with my better half in the bustling hub of London.  We will be back!
      ",5,2015,06,23
125,Great location and rooms.,"No tea and coffee making in room which was a shame.  We discovered the tiny note on the bedside cabinet (just before we left) that said you could call room service for tea and coffee.
No sign on the street that this is a hotel.  Makes it a bit difficult to find and embarrassing to enter and ask ""are you a hotel?""
Bar was being used by a very loud ""event"".  Not great if wanting to come back after the theatre and have a quiet drink.  Apparently there is a sitting area, but staff seemed to be unaware or unwilling to offer us a drink in the lounge.
Fantastic, modern room. ",4,2015,06,22
125,Fantastic birthday treat,"We stayed after a dinner in town for my wife's birthday.  The hotel team couldn't have been more helpful in arranging a few surprises, and she (and I) loved everything about the room, bar and breakfast!  Thank you St Martin's Lane.
      ",5,2015,06,22
125,Hyper modern place in the middle of everything,"Unlike some of the more traditional London hotels, this one features UV lighting so items in the rooms fluoresce, lots of white, an innovative 'Den' for light snacks and it's right across from the Duke of York theatre, very near the Leicester Sq underground station and Covent Garden. There is no hint from the outside that this is a hotel and the doorway is tall enough to bring in a giraffe. Very well run but better check out the discounts (if any). ",5,2015,06,21
125,Modern hotel with a cute little gaden,"When I arrived, I was at first disappointed with my first interaction with member of the reception team.However the room was modern and the the little garden is a great idea. The bottle of champagne and birthday cake are great touches and make you feel special. The bar can get busy but the staff make it a great experience.The location is very central and easy access to tube stations.",4,2015,06,20

125,A very warm welcome,"I had always stayed away from the ST. Martin's because it has a reputation of being very trendy, chic, and for the ""beautiful people."" I could not have been more wrong. Yes, the hotel design is very modern, but everyone who works there is genuinely friendly. They really are warm and helpful and actually seem glad to see you! I would truly recommend that you take a look and enjoy the wonderful energy. ",5,2015,06,19
125,Is this the best hotel in London?,"Like home from home.   Amazing friendly professional people at the top of their game
If you return everyone remembers your name.  Would like to know how they do that.
The new decor is terrific and there's now a ""den"" where you can spend a few quiet moments
      
      ",5,2015,06,19
125,Another great experience,"Always a pleasure staying at this hotel. It is my hotel of choice in London and for very good reason. The location is excellent. The management and staff are at the top of their game. The rooms are modern, clean and surprisingly quiet. The small touches such as the welcome drink left in my room, the fruit platter or the frequent room upgrades make you feel special and the repeat custom appreciated. ",5,2015,06,19
125,Top Service,"The standard of the hotel is hugely consistent and always top quality.  I can rely on the quality of the rooms, the food and the service of the team.  It is my hotel of choice i London, I would love to see a loyalty programme for my ongoing custom
      
      ",5,2015,06,19
125,Fabulous in every way,"After always staying with friends or family in London for 35 years, I decided to stay in a hotel as my wife was returning to London after two years and we wanted to stay somewhere central.
The hotel is exceptional in every which way. First of course is location. It doesn't get better - Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Trafakgar Square, Oxford St are all a short walk away.
Second, the design of the hotel is wow. It's a Philippe Stark property and whilst old is maintained immaculately. So it remains a modern and contemporary hotel with all of the latest gadgetary etc.
Third, the people. From the door man to the concierge to housekeeping staff. All very friendly and helpful.
Fourth, the room! Lying in bed we faced the colloseium and could see the Nelson statue at Trafalgar Square. The room size was good, bathroom (especially the shower) excellent, lots of complementary bottles of water, very stylish lighting and appliances and comfortable bed.
All in all, a fabulous property in a fabulous city at a fabulous location!

125,"Good product, let down by poor service","Cutting straight to the chase, what could and should have been a memorable experience was soured by a standard of service that fell well short of expectations. On our first night I phoned the concierge to request assistance with selecting and booking an appropriate restaurant. We agreed on a shortlist of three and I was promised a return call regarding availability and times... that call never came. I complained at the front desk as we left, having been forced to make our own arrangements, and the lady was suitably apologetic, but there was never any follow-up or explanation from either the concierge themself or a duty manager, which I would have expected given the positioning of the property as a five-star luxury experience. To compound matters, the following evening we attempted to reach the concierge to no avail regarding booking a spa treatment for the following day - we instead had to speak to the front desk again, who said he was on a break and promised we'd get a call back. The call back did come, but at 10am the following day, by which point somewhat unsurprisingly we had once again been forced to do our own research, make arrangements etc. The 'icing on the cake' came when we checked out, and were dealt with by the same lady on the front desk from Friday evening. She was clearly over-stretched, trying to juggle us with ringing phones and other waiting guests, so we weren't even asked how our stay was, let alone any kind of follow up on the concierge issues.
The great shame is that this soured an otherwise pleasant experience - in the interests of balance I should say the waiting staff in Asia de Cuba over breakfast were great and couldn't have been more helpful.

125,Wonderful stay at the gorgeous St Martin's Lane Hotel,"We stayed for two nights for our wedding anniversary and the first full weekend we've had without children - ever! We booked a deluxe room and it was absolutely beautiful - large windows, amazingly comfortable bed, dressing area and great bathroom. It was a really modern, beautiful, relaxing space in the middle of a bustling city. The location is excellent really close to Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. We had a really chilled out, relaxed, happy experience. Breakfast was included in the room rate we chose and was delicious. Belle the Guest Experience Manager had picked up on the fact that it was our anniversary and there was a lovely note and bottle of prosecco and two glasses waiting for us as we got to our room. Check in and out was swift friendly and efficient. Always someone on hand to open the door and welcome you in from the street. Only tiny disappointment was we had some cocktail vouchers as part of our room rate but the Friday night when we got there the bar was being used for a private function so we couldn't go in there until 10pm. We had ideally wanted a predinner cocktail so weren't able to do that and due to the plans we made for the rest of the weekend we didn't manage to make it for the cocktail. But no big deal just would have been nice to use the bar in the hotel on a Friday evening. Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere special and you love modern hotels in central London. We are looking forward to going back!",5,2015,06,15
125,Great Hotel,"Really surprised to find a hotel of this quality in central London. Modern and funky yet very relaxed and comfortable. Will certainly stay again next time we're in town. The bar is absolutely fantastic and the parking service extremely efficient

125,Perfect for hiding out in London after great bank robbery,"The hotel is a perfect place to spend a long weekend or week. It is not cheap hence the bank robbery comment. 

The location is spectacular and the beds are exactly the kind that you wish you had at home",5,2015,06,14
125,Fun in Theatreland,A really exciting yet terribly quirky fusion of style and taste.  Bar entrance and service is weird but enjoyable.  If you want the theatre and/or central London the location cannot be beaten.  Staff are as attentive as possible and with cabs lining up outside in their own rank you don't have to wait.  The breakfast was excellent with a wide variety on offer to suit all tastes.  Nice to see a well stocked minibar in the room.,5,2015,06,13
125,A bit underwhelming for the price,"Location is fantastic, the room is nice enough, but in front of my window there was some construction and workers were literally 5 meters away and able to see everything inside. The corridors are a bit claustrophobic, and there is a general shabbiness just under the surface of everything.

The staff are great, the chillout area was perfect for a early evening business meeting and the breakfast was also great",5,2015,06,13
125,Super impressed! ,"I stayed one night with a friend to celebrate their birthday - trip to London. Neither of us had stayed in this hotel before, I'm usually a creature of habit when it comes to hotels & given we were only there for one night I wanted the trip to be a success. 

I need not have worried. 

Location was great a very short walk from the tube. On entering the hotel we knew it was going to be good, aside from the cool decor the people that work there were so genuinely warm & welcoming. And this was throughout. They deliver a real, not forced nor prescribed customer experience, which was really refreshing. Everyone we came into contact with seemed to enjoy their job & wanted to ensure we were happy. 

Belle, Guest Experience Manager definitely needs a special mention as she made my friends birthday even more special by ensuring there were some extra touches to make the stay memorable & fun. 

Blind Spot is definitely  worth visiting, the cocktails are fabulous. 

Breakfast was lovely, good food served well. 

We really had a fabulous time. So much so that I have booked again for next month to stay 2 nights this time, having cancelled my usual hotel reservation. 

This is 5 star at its best.  ",5,2015,06,11

We had no problem as gay couple ... sometimes you still get an odd look at registration  ... we got a big smile!  The place is comfortable, the bed was large enough  the room may be needed a second chair. The only lower point could have been tv set. But we weren't in London to watch TV in fact !",5,2015,06,11
125,A Chic Hotel in a Fantastic Location,"It cannot be overstated enough how convenient the hotel is situated.  It is a short 5 min walk to Convent Garden, Leicester Square and not much further to Embankment, Horse Guards and more.  As such, it was very convenient to shopping, theatres, museums and the underground.

The hotel is still in good condition and well serviced by its staff.  The room was immaculate and while it was incredibly frustrating to have blinds that we could not close to further darken the room (the curtains just weren't enough) - and to be told this was the same in all rooms, the comfort level was great.  The toiletries are top quality but it was equally disappointing to not get our water bottle replenished or to be provided two when the booking was for two adults.

The speakeasy bar was a treat and worth a visit at night and the restaurant breakfast was good quality - though we were lucky to have it included as it was otherwise expensive for our taste with so many coffee shops around.

The staff were all great but despite a complaint during our stay we were not offered anything in return. And the service levels were what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.

A peculiarity with the room is that room safe - way to small for modern computing needs and luckily we had a portable mesh safe that we could use as the room safe didn't fit out 15 inch laptop.

Finally, be prepared for dark hallways as you walk to your room - very strange lighting arrangement though the coloured LEDs in the room were great fun!",4,2015,06,09
125,Blind Spot - Superb Bar!,"My in-laws stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel during a weekend visit to London. After an evening out we went back with them to the hotel for a drink at the bar. Blind Spot by name Blind Spot by nature. It has a hidden entrance and is a real gem, truly delightful. It was a Friday night and there was a DJ playing a set, the bar isnt very big and there were a good amount of people but not at all crowded. Lovely seating (not a standing bar place). I would return just to go back to this place. Staff were super friendly too.",5,2015,06,09
125,Nice staff!,"Stayed in celebration of a wedding anniversary. given an upgraded room and later, a bottle of champagne. Never ate at the hotel as breakfast next door was a quarter of the price.
Nice view from the room. Everywhere smelled nice
All the staff were approachable and extremely helpful",4,2015,06,08
125,It's back!!,"After a previous pretty low key stay here earlier in the year (great room but otherwise 'unremarkable'), it was great to see the difference post refurb of Asia de Cuba restaurant and the re-vamped well-named cocktail bar - The Blind Spot - phones needed to read the cocktail menu!!
Very attentive front of house staff who were well informed about previous visit, valet parking made easy and helpful staff throughout the hotel. Only slight niggle...apart from the 'blind lighting' in the bar, the staff there were a little too attentive, verging at times on being a tad pushy to order more cocktails before customers were ready to do so. Maybe less 'enthusiasm' here would be more!

Great breakfast too after a really interesting fusion Asian/ Cuban dinner the night before.  ",5,2015,06,08
125,Amazing location!,"We had a great 2 night stay, very comfortable rooms and great location for theatres, museums etc!

Ideal for National Gallery.  We explored the area on foot, easy walk to Regent's street and Oxford street.",5,2015,06,08
125,Has seen better days,"Had not been back in over 10 years, and very disappointing. Nothing has changed and outside it looks grimy and industrial - in a bad way - and the lobby looks like a Miami beach hotel circa 1990. Exact same decor, ditto for the dining room and bedrooms. Our ""studio"" was ok, but the a/c sucked and the room was not cleaned until evening. The food is exactly the same, and the staff and clientele very wannabe models. The only saving grace was the wonderful concierge and good location. No longer on my list of favorite places to stay in London ",3,2015,06,07
125,Friendly and calm amidst the storm,"Very nice hotel, great staff, in an extremely lively part of town. If you want a quiet neighborhood, this isn't for you, but once inside the doors of the hotel, things quiet down significantly. (A club/bar scene on the ground floor, but the noise never rises.) I'm not sure I would return simply because of the neighborhood (if the weather is nice, the evening scene on the streets is loud and crowded, almost made me want to stay in Chelsea!), but that has nothing to do with the hotel, which is incredibly convenient to the Tube and--as noted--very well run, with smiles. One thing I did love about it was that, unlike all of the other London hotels I've stayed in, you really can exercise here: the gym (a GYMBOX) is just next door, couldn't be more convenient.

So overall, as noted, an excellent hotel. Might be a bit better in the winter, when the street scene mellows out, but I do strongly recommend it in general.",5,2015,06,07
125,Celebrating in style for the Hen,"Mike from coincerge did a fantastic job and was a delight.
Caroline and Isabel arranged all the rooms so we were all close by.
The rooms were very sharp and modern and the cocktails were fabulous.
A very enjoyable stay. Highly recommended. ",5,2015,06,07
125,A mums special sleepover!!!!,This was my third stay at st martins.first wedding anniversary..when we told them at reception reason for stay they gave us a nicer room than one we had booked with fantastic view! second .girls weekend..third ..mums escape for weekend..had a refurbish this time round ...lovely lounge area and club decor fab..but music wasn't as good as previous visits..room was lush 337 fantasti..wish i could have stayed longer x,5,2015,06,07
125,June visit,"Love the hotel, what you lack in with minamilist furniture you make up with huge warmth. Great location, amazing room service. My request for a toothbrush was met before I had a change to run the tap! Room lovely and sunny though I wish there were a way to open the windows to allow some natural air Esther than th soften fierce air-con. Won't leave it so long next time before our next visit
      ",4,2015,06,07
125,Great hotel. Great location,"We stayed here for two nights as part of my wife's birthday celebrations. The fizz and cake delivered to the room, the attentive staff on the front counter, the quirky bar with some great music and brilliant staff, all contributed to a great two night stay. The hotel is also great in its own right. The design, the layout and the rooms all work to create a relaxing environment that belies the hustle and bustle outside of being between Soho and Covent Garden. You certainly get what you pay for here. can't wait to return.",5,2015,06,07
125,Stylish and sleek,"Hotel is situated in a popular area of the city.  Easy access to covent garden, theatre district and soho.  Also easy access to multiple tube lines.  The concierge (Joey) was super helpful in setting us up with dinner in Soho.  He provided great description of restaurants and gave great directions.  The bed in the hotel was comfortable.  Shower is awesome!  The complimentary toiletries seemed really high-end and nice.  
Reminds me a lot of W hotels--very much of that vibe and spirit.",4,2015,06,06
125,Luxurious Secret Hotel,"I spent about half an hour walking around the hotel location to find it! It was hidden secretly without a sign but once found it, the journey began. 

2 min check-in or less. So friendly staff

Very quite inside although it is in the middle of convent garden

I really enjoyed it.

The room was a bit small but that's normal for downtown hotels.

Bed was extra comfortable. Room lighting was amazing.

The room designed in a very modern decor and furniture.

Highly recommended specially if they have offers because it is a bit expensive.",5,2015,06,06
125,"Fantastic, Funky and Discreet","Unless you are in the know you would walk past the Saint Martin without a second glance as it's entrance us unmarked and the interior obscured by window dressings. Nevertheless, on entering the hotel one is greeted with contemporary minimalism and helpful staff. Just off the Lobby area us a rather decent cocktail bar but as the night goes by, only expect to be admitted if you're name us on the reservation list. The bedroom was extremely spacious with a view over Saint Martin's Lane and the bathroom was like a small spa. There was however a design defect which concerned our bath and caused it to overflow. Nevertheless, this was a very good hotel experience which we hope to repeat at some point.",4,2015,06,04
125,Great rooms and location...fun at night,"Hotel is conveniently located next to restaurants, bars and club. It is also a walk away from the entertainement district.
The staff is very helpful and friendly, always there to help and support.
Rooms are clean and quite spacious for london, witha very modern look to it,
Highly recommended for busineds travel and also for a holiday get away.",4,2015,06,03
125,Not a five star hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night at the end of May. We arrived at around 4.30pm and were told our room was not ready. Check in is at 3pm! We were palmed off with a free drink. At around 5.15pm my huband went to enquire at reception as to when our room would be ready as we had evening plans we wanted to get ready for. We were given a room, over 2 hours late.
The room was modern but tiny (even by London standards) and did not have blackout curtains. The hair dryer in the room was ace though!
There was nothing terrible about the hotel, it is just not of 5 star standard. If it were a 4 star hotel and priced as such I probably would have been quite content.",3,2015,06,03
125,One nights rest,"A bit pricey but very comfortable room.  The hotel's name is nowhere to be seen on the building so it was a bit hard to find.  Service was great.  Bed very comfortable.  Awesome shower. Location was great and able to walk to shopping, restaurants and theater.
      ",4,2015,06,03
125,"Style, comfort, friendliness...","...always the name of the game at SML. Every time I stay (3-4 times a year), I come away feeling like I've left my London home.
The recent renovations represented a move away from the old, clean lines, but I think the hotel has managed to stay modern, while if anything, making the place feel more homely. The new room arrangements provide for much more space.
I loved the new den in the lobby, a wonderful place to get a coffee (or something stronger) in a very comfortable (but engagingly quirky) space.
      ",5,2015,06,03
125,Birthday trip for my daughter,"2nd stay at this hotel and equally as enjoyable !
I booked this time as a surprise for my daughter who I was taking to a concert at the O2 for her 11th birthday.  she was over the moon with the room and loved the staff who were all extremely nice. I'd highly recommend this hotel, rooms are lovely, staff are great and the food is excellent !",5,2015,06,03
125,Great stay!,"St Martins Lane is a great hotel, they have amazing staff - so friendly and helpful, fabulous rooms with very good room service and good food. The location is also perfect! Highly recommend this place. 
      
      
      ",5,2015,06,02
125,Wow,"Lovely modern hotel with beautiful attentive staff. Bedrooms spacious especially on the 6th floor. Turn down bed service with activated mood lighting a wonderful surprise when returning following an evening out. Best location situated,  between Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square. Rating would have been excellent had the hotel been easier to find. Don't get the concept of mystery and intrigue by not having a name or obvious number on the hotel, just frustrating when trying to find it.",4,2015,06,02
125,"Fun, funky and oh so comfy in London!","We love every Morgan's Hotel property. St. Martins Lane is no exception. 
Amazing location, clean as a whistle, so relaxing yet vibrant, comfortable and stimulating surroundings. 
Lovely, and helpful staff. 
What more could one ask for?
Just stay there!!",5,2015,06,01
125,Can't wait to stay here again,"My wife and I had a fantastic first stay at St Martin's Lane. We were admittedly a bit unsure of the place before seeing it in person, as the funky lighting in the room photos on the web made it seem a bit... not what we were looking for.

We were immediately put at ease upon seeing it all in person, and dealing with the wonderful staff.

The room was comfortable, private, spacious, and we received a generous upgrade to a top floor room with a view that included the London Eye, Parliament, and parts of Covent Garden.

Belle and Joey (best concierge I've ever had) were particularly fantastic, but each and everyone at the hotel was fantastic. Clearly the management knows how to hire.

Location was perfect, with access to tube stations, taxis, lots and lots of restaurants and shopping.

We had a wonderful time, and really do look forward to going back!
      ",5,2015,06,01
125,Another fantastic stay at St. Martin's Lane !!!,"This is our favourite hotel in London.. A consistently great experience. The newly refurbished deluxe rooms are great with the bed linen and room lighting adding to the whole ambience.. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Hayley who recently arrived from the USA. The rooms are spacious, immaculately clean and effortlessly chic. What we like most of all is the relaxed, below the radar  feeling you get when staying at this hotel. Breakfast was great with a good selection of foods..One small blemish during the breakfast was the abrupt reply and service by one of the female servers who appeared to be having a bad day - Unfortunately not only was she short with her answers she also decided to reprimand one of her colleagues within easy ear shot of people at the tables. Very unusual for this venue, but we decided not to let this spoil what for us was a great stay!!    ",5,2015,06,01
125,Extended My Stay!,"A friend suggested this hotel for my first visit to London.  I booked it for the first three nights of my stay, as I thought I may want to check out another area.  I ended up staying for 8 nights!  The staff was wonderful and I mean all of them!  Doormen, desk staff, housekeeping and the bar restaurant staff.  The location was great for getting to Soho, Mayfair, Picadilly and Oxford Circus.  It is surrounded by great restaurants, theaters and shopping.  Covent Garden was a welcome surprise!  As far as the hotel is concerned, it is not The Ritz or Savoy in luxury terms, but it is hip, clean, modern and provides all the essentials for a cosmopolitan traveler!  
      ",5,2015,06,01
125,Great Location - Super Comfi Beds,"The hotel has done some refresh of the rooms, and I like the light and airy design. Location is fantastic: central but very quiet. Beds are super comfortable and I slept very well. Also like the new bar layout and fact that you can use the next door gym. Highly recommended!",5,2015,06,01
125,Excellent staying in Covent garden area,"Excellent location and excellent service level. Not cheap but worth the price! The free access to gym is also remarkable as part of service. Breakfast is various and quality of ingredients is super. There are special rates during weekend and certain periods of the year
      
      ",4,2015,06,01
125,2nd Visit Even Better than the First,"This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in whilst in London. From the minute you walk thru the door, everyone treats you well. And the rooms and common spaces are top notch as well. I was greeted as a return visitor - even had a bottle of wine and macaroons in my room. Great view. I enjoyed both the bar, The Blind Spot, and the restaurant - Asia di Cuba. Breakfast was spot on, as was dinner or even starters in the restaurant bar. Excellent ceviche and great bartenders. Location of this hotel is perfect too - just a quick walk to two tube stations - Leicester Square is on the Picadilly line, so if you want it's a straight shot from Heathrow. I will definitely return!",5,2015,05,31
125,Slamming Doors,"On the 6th floor, the doors have really strong magnets which mean they can't be closed without slamming them. This meant that whenever anyone in an adjoining room (and possibly further) went to the toilet during the night we heard their door creak as it swung, then slam shut.

Also, I couldn't figure out the media system!

Otherwise, it's a nice room, lot's of stock in the room (not all of it free). We didn't use the gym.",3,2015,05,30
125,Great hotel experience with great staff,"Loved this hotel! Couldn't be in a better location! Staff were amazing, especially, Isabelle Fowkes ((Belle) who couldn't have done enough to make our stay any better. The hotel was also perfectly clean as well as stylish. Certainly will recommend this hotel to all my friends who visit London. 
Thanks to staff, especially the genuinely lovely Belle!

125,"Decadent, cool and made to feel fab!","Loved our stay at St Martins Lane Hotel.  Great location, welcoming staff even though it's an exclusive hotel that I would normally feel a bit threatened by!  Wonderful contemporary bedroom (no bath, but no matter, nice powerful shower).   Loved the toiletries ( Malin + Goetz), free wifi, comfy double bed, dimmable lights in the bathroom, iron and ironing board, the amazing light effects you can alter in the room.  When we left for dinner it was set to a purple hue, when we came back the curtains had been drawn, bed turned down and room had been altered to an orange hue! Loved it. Haven't even mentioned the secret bar Blind Spot with delicious cocktails. Go!",5,2015,05,29
125,"Superb hotel modern luxury, now even better!","Seriosuly enjoyed a midweek break for my wife's birthday at St Martins Lane. Impossible to fault from the moment we checked-in to the time we departed. 

Check-in (by a charming young lady called Belle) was attentive, courteous and sincere. Our 4th floor room was absolutely stunning, spotlessly clean and incredibly quiet despite offering a brilliant view onto St Martins Lane.

The new cocktail bar is an absolute highlight - again superb service - and breakfast was absolutely first rate both in terms of food and service.
 
St Martins Lane is a really excellent design hotel and whilst such quality comes at a price, it's the West End hotel I'd recommend if you're looking for a prime location with style.  
      ",5,2015,05,29
125,Nice place in Covent Garden area.,"Spent a night, not to pricey great decor throughout and even got an upgrade on our room.

Not to sure about the restaurant though, possibly not my scene and very pricey. But the light-plater we had was very tasty, a glass of wine well over priced for my liking. Or is that just a London thing?

Had a full English breakfast, the best presented I've ever had and it was very tasty as well. All of the staff very welcoming and polite, will I consider staying here again - yes I would....",4,2015,05,28
125,Great Hotel,"Beautifully placed right in Theatreland. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms well appointed and modern with USB charge points in the wall. Mood lighting was a particularly unique feature where you could choose between cool blue and hot passionate red/pink. Only comment is that there is no name on the front to help find it.

125,St Martins Lane Hotel May 15,"Excellent location although not easily visible due to lack of signage.  Fixtures and fittings were of a high standard and my room was exceptionally clean and comfortable.  The staff were warm and welcoming.
Unfortunately I did not have time to experience all the hotel offered but hopefully have the opportunity to revisit.

125,Very good,"Lovely hotel- great gym. There is no bath tub in the standard rooms which for me was the only disappointment. If I had known this, I would have chosen a different room. Otherwise, it's very nice place to stay and on par with its sister hotel, The Sanderson.",5,2015,05,27
125,"Modern, clean hotel walking distance from key sights","St Martins Lane hotel is a very nice hotel located in the heart of the theatre district and within walking distance of key tourist sites.  The hotel has all the modern conveniences including mood lights in your room which you can customize to your liking.  The rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable, albeit very small and not the best lighting for applying makeup in the morning (opening the curtains to get natural light helps).    The restaurant Asia de Cuba is very good and a stylish restaurant.  Their breakfast buffet was a bit disappointing in the selection given similarly priced buffets in other restaurants - go with the a la carte menu instead.",4,2015,05,27
125,Short Break,"Stunning hotel in a superb location minutes walk to all the fabulous London sites. Totally unassuming from the outside, this boutique hotel offers a refreshing up market experience without the fanfare. Most definitely worth considering !!

125,Great location!,"Stayed at this hotel on Saturday evening. Although first impressions were disappointing because of the unhelpful attitude of the check in receptionist our spirits were lifted when we saw our room. We had been given a free upgrade deluxe room with our booking and therefore had a better view than a standard room. Bathroom was spacious with nice quality toiletries, full size hair dryer and ironing board. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable with crisp cotton linen. The Blind Spot bar is worth a visit and has a good atmosphere even through drink price is quite expensive. Breakfast next morning was leisurely with a choice of buffet or cooked meals, restaurant staff were very efficient and friendly. Overall an excellent experience and would definitely recommend.",4,2015,05,26
125,Stylish Living,"Everything about the experience in St Martin's Lane is sophisticated and polished. The decor is sharp, the service at the door and reception is sharp and the rooms are excellent. The bar is cleverly hidden away and the breakfast was very good. I can't fault it!",5,2015,05,21
125,"Nice Hotel, Small Room Great Bathroom","We enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  The only hitch was that when we arrived they had booked us into the wrong size room - which was disappointing since the rooms are generally small here and there were three of us.  The staff was extremely apologetic and since two of us were going to Paris for a few days it worked out, but I did want to make travelers aware to make sure to double check room size before arrival (especially if traveling with family/friends).  They did provide a rollaway bed which was comfortable for the one of us who used it.  Not to mention that they did drop the rate, so we didn't have such a bad time of it.

The room itself was small and covered in white.  Very modern.  The beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was very big and was nice with three girls sharing the room.  

The hotel itself is in a perfect location and is very clean.  We dined downstairs for most of our breakfasts and the food was really good.  The drinks in the evening were amazing, but we didn't utilize the bar much because we ate out most evenings...which the staff helped us make reservations and catch taxi's where we needed to go.

All in all, I would stay again.",4,2015,05,19

Prior to our visit, Mike the concierge discussed our requirements with members of our party to ensure we had a brilliant stay in London and made us great reservations for our evening meal and club entry.

125,Bug Bear in a ¬£200+ night hotel.,"Went May bank holiday 1st May till 3rd May 2015.

We've stayed a couple of times before, the bug bear I have is the tea making facilities!
Yes you can request them (WHY)  and we did. The makings appeared, what we didn't realise was a large box UHT milk (fine) one English breakfast, two mint, and a green tea bag supplied. for a two night stay............ really??? Not refreshed the following morning! Who wants peppermint first thing!

If you think I'm ringing down in a ¬£200+ per night hotel for English breakfast tea bags, I'm not! So we went across the road to the Costa coffee house got our morning cuppa there in a nice big china mug and on to ""Bills for breakfast"".
On the upside the new hole in the wall was nice, if not over inflated prices, couldn't read the cocktail menu thou! A case of dim lights and old age the writing was quite small..... Liked it thou! Everything else as other reports.",3,2015,05,08

125,Tip Top night spot,"I had the pleasure to staying at the newly refreshed St Martins Lane this week. My girlfriend and I had decided to have a rare night out in London and had been recommended St Martins Lane after its soft renovation. We entered the hotel and went to reception to check in. The two girls were very friendly and chatty. They arranged our room and up we went. The room had a quaint little garden which gave it good natural daylight and a fun space outside where we sat and enjoyed a late afternoon drink. The room was immaculately clean and in pristine condition. We popped out for walk around the local area before dinner. We had made reservations at Asia de Cuba which has had a soft renovation. We were greeted at the door by a friendly bubbly lady who took us to the table. The room has been really well done keeping the essence of the original Asia de Cuba but putting in a new bar amongst other things. The food was, as expected, an array of bursting flavours. The ceviche section, particularly the shrimps were amazing. We also had chilli rubbed scallop, tuna in a taco and the renowned doughnuts for dessert which were all fabulous. However the highlight was the service - we were looked after by GianLuca and Laura - true assets to the hotel. Gianluca thrilled us with his knowledge and charm and Laura - who was the girl that seated us on arrival was bubbly, cheeky and lots of fun. They both made the evening really special. After dinner we went into the newly renovated Blind Spot Bar. It is a hidden bar without signage - you enter through a blank door next to shelves of jars full of dried camomile, rose etc. On entering you come into a beautiful room. Dim lighting really gives it an air of excitement. Stunning d√©cor with a bar at the back that stands out in the room. This bar will be the next 'place to be'. The drinks selection was good. Bed was comfy and the shower really powerful - which is always a bonus. Would definitely recommend and will certainly go back.",5,2015,05,01
125,"Wonderful location, wonderful staff!","My husband and I stayed at St. Martins Lane last June and had a wonderful stay.  We were there for three nights.  Let me start by saying that we had such great service.  The gentleman at the front desk greeted us by name each morning, pulled out a trusty street map and helped us plan our day's adventure.  Couldn't have been more helpful or happier to see us each day.  He was at the ready for absolutely anything we needed.  I love, love, love the lobby.  It has such a cool, modern feel to it.  I fell in love with those gilded teeth stools.  Coolest thing ever.  We were lucky enough to come by an upgrade and so we experienced two great rooms.  Beautifully appointed and the bathrooms were new and fresh in every sense.  The location is unbelievable as well, right off Trafalgar Square and short walk to Covent Garden and Piccadilly.  So many great, great restaurants and of course theaters all over the neighborhood.  J Sheeky is right around the corner and of course, the National Gallery and the Portrait Gallery.  Can't wait to go back, will definitely stay there again!",4,2015,04,30

As usual Reception team are so welcoming  and the room was amazingly comfortable",5,2015,04,29
125,Good stay,"Room was ready early so we could check in as soon as we arrived. Staff were helpful. Room was spotless. Breakfast had many options and was very good.

The wireless service is truly terrible. You have to constantly log-in every time your phone goes on lock. There were many times when the server couldn't be reached at all.",4,2015,04,27
125,Love the place but most of all I love the people working there,"Dear staff of St Martins Lane Hotel. Thanks for an amazing time I spend with you over the last 2 years. But the cherry on the cake was the last visit with my husband. The attention we got and warmth showed to both of us was amazing. Loved the room. The bottle of bubbles as a welcome present. Thanks a thousand times. Hans

125,Perfect Hotel!!!,"Comfortable room, great location, staff is so helpful and flexible, friendly(everyone looks like a model!!!). Nice restaurant. I'm really glad to stay here and I'd love to stay again.",5,2015,04,20
125,Great one night stay,"A very modern and stylish hotel that manages to combine being cool with being friendly. We had a standard room but on a corner so extra space which was nice.  Very clean and contemporary design, comfy bed, spotlessly clean, masses of hot water in the shower, nice luxury toiletries, high speed wifi - rooms don't need any more than this.  Breakfast was very good, staff friendly.  Rooms are quiet so you can feel as if you are the only people staying there, helping get a really good nights sleep.  Would definitely recommend and stay there again - it's in the perfect position for West End theatres and restaurants.",5,2015,04,19
125,"Good position, tiny rooms","We stayed at this hotel during its recent revamp phase so I was aware that there was a certain amount of disruption due to this , however the reduced price of the room made up for this. The hotel is ultra modern much like its stable mate The Sanderson and we are not great fans of this style. The room was ok but really tiny I can't complain as we didn't pay full price but if I had I would feel it offered poor value, everywhere was very clean, bathroom had good quality toiletries, a powerful shower and soft towels, however soundproofing is very poor, do not share this room with anyone you don't know really well as the bathroom acts as an echo chamber! Breakfast was really expensive in the hotel but there are plenty of good cheaper places to eat locally. All in all a decent choice if you can get a cheap deal and want to be close to the theatres",3,2015,04,19
125,A gem in the heart of the city,"This hotel is really worth staying at, once you find it. Five star service, recently renovated modern luxurious rooms. I especially loved the ambiance lighting options in the bedroom. Big, beautiful bathrooms. Renovations in the public areas are almost over and that did not bother me at all in any case because there was no noise. The gym next door is already a reason for me to stay there every time from now on that I go to London. It is a heaven and you can use it for free. The hotel even washes your gym clothes for free! The gym runs 120 different classes per week, they have a boxing ring, entertainment, everything any fitness enthusiast can hope for.

I ordered in-room breakfast which came late but the staff handled it so perfectly that I have absolutely no complaints. I got the breakfast for free. The mini bar is very well equipped and there is even a ""mini-market"" in the room where you can buy e.g. razors if you forgot yours at home.

Location is perfect in the heart of the city but in a quiet street so there is no noise from the traffic. I will definitely stay again and already recommended to a friend who will stay there next week. Prices are quite reasonable for a five-star hotel in central London.",5,2015,04,18
125,A joy to stay in,"Top draw comfort, modern, room, my standard was large and immaculate, perfectly designed for the modern traveller, loads of USB points, awesome lighting, powerful shower (I had to force myself to switch it off), good aircon. Friendly folk",5,2015,04,16
125,Once you have found it,"Very anonymous. walked up and down the street and then had to ask.
The hotel does not have a sign or a number outside, and the foyer looks like a minimalist office space.
It was also disconcerting to walk into a semi construction site, as the bar an restaurant
We're being refurbished.
We were not informed of this happening or that there would be no restaurant facilities during our stay. Though on the Saturday night, there was clearly a private function going on.
The rooms are very good, spacious and well designed. The hotel is quiet despite being in the heart of theatre land
No tea and coffee provided, though was supplied on request. One very odd thing was that there were two of us, though only one sample of the teas or coffees was provided by the hotel
Word of warning. Mini bar is ultra extortionate. ¬£3.50 for a kit Kat and ¬£5 for a small bottle of water. Alcohol prices are just as proportionately high.

One big plus was that the staff were superb, and the location ideal for the westend",3,2015,04,14
125,Luxury in the heart of theatreland,"Overall very good
Disappointed with amount of current refurbishment to public areas.
Initial impression of bedroom, very good particularly the various light options
Did not use the internal door to the bathroom as the STRONG magnet made it difficult to open and at night it made a ‚Äúclanging‚Äù noise when closed and woke my partner
With wasting water such an issue these days, can not understand why you can not have a bowl of water in the sink. Such a waste when have to wash using running water. Spoke to a member of staff who confirmed it was not possible to have a bowl of water because there is no overflow and a number of guests had complained about this. 
Not possible to vary the angle of the window blinds for some privacy.
This is the first hotel bedroom I can recall of any quality that does not have bedside tables, only a shelf at the back of the bed. Therefore it is impossible to view my mobile phone for the time or alarm when in bed.",5,2015,04,14
125,A great hotel!,"Wasthere for two days. Was a pure pleasure at the moment I entered the hotel. Nice hotel staff. The check-in was smooth and fast.
And the room was great as well. Comfy bed. 
the location is unbeatable!
Will return for sure!",5,2015,04,12
125,"Great location, wonderful hotel","We stayed here one fine Friday night in April. The friendly and efficient check-in staff said they had given us a room upgrade which was a nice gesture. Room was on 1st floor overlooking St Martin's Lane, totally soundproofed with floor to ceiling windows filling the room with natural light. Good feeling of space, minimalist decor, white walls, white furniture, a splash of colour from a pot plant high up on one wall. Spacious bathroom with separate shower area, separate WC cubicle, deep oval freestanding bath. Just one caveat, be careful of the shower: the shower shoots out a powerful jet of water straight at you when you turn it on; it did not seem to be adjustable. However a blast of cold water in the face is a god way to wake up after a late night. The bed was super comfy, lush pillows, nice convenient wall lights, handy phone charger by the bed. Excellent TV stand containing a mini bar (not used) and a rack with glasses (used). Breakfast was served in a light and spacious dining room which had a strange tangle of electric light flexes draped from hooks in the ceiling, the light bulbs over the tables were fine but the cobweb of wires did not add anything. The service was warm and friendly, good latte, nice French yoghurts on the buffet, excellent pastries, fresh fruit including halved mangos, glistening strawberries, cubes of melon. However the buffet table is too long for the available space and you can't walk around it. Breakfast was Included in our B&B rate with the option of something from the hot section. We had the minute steak, a tender and perfectly grilled 8oz sirloin served on an oblong plate with two fried eggs garnished with a bay leaf (nice touch), some hot cherry tomatoes (very well timed to avoid  bursting the skin) and cubes of saut√©ed potatoes with a balsamic reduction. Freshly squeezed orange, a glass of ice cold water, good latte. All Perfect. One gripe: newspaper not offered at check-in and no papers in evidence in the lobby or in the breakfast room. The location is fantastic for theatres, Covent Garden, most of tourist London. We had A great stay at (for London) quite a reasonable price. Thanks for the welcome.

125,Excellent location!,"Cool & Trendy Hotel!
Extremely well located if a little hard to find the first time.
Rooms are comfortable and well appointed (you get to pick your mood lighting color).
Adjacent gym and Starbucks across the street.
Well stocked bar in the lobby (over 100 different rums) and some of the best staff in all of London!
This is my new home in London!

125,Absolute favourite!!,"I just love this hotel!! The position and the convenience being right in the middle of central London . We recently renovated a mill conversion and we based it around the clean contemporary lines of the St Martins Lane; so of course we feel really at home here. The staff are superb, extremely friendly, they clearly have a corporate look which is in my view spot on for this type of hotel. The room we had had been refurbished and of course was really nice; the only reason this hotel achieved a 4 rating was that the room was not adequately sound proofed, which was a little disappointing. I was woken up by next door 'talking' not shouting which really surprised me. I know the last time we stayed the air conditioning was really noisy and we were up graded to a lovely corner aspect room which was great. On this occasion; because we were only staying one night it seemed churlish to make a fuss.
Having said that it is still my most favourite London hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again; having made a note of the room number I would request not to be in there again.",4,2015,04,11
125,"Clean, fresh, modern","Lovely hotel hidden away. Very friendly, helpful staff on arrival. Sadly didn't get to spend much time in my room due to my work! 

The only thing that spoiled the stay was building work going on in the main lobby. 

Room was a very good standard with all the required basics. Would definitely stay again! ",4,2015,04,10
125,Wow... Loved this hotel,"Stayed here this week for my birthday, fantastic location, rooms are very modern and comfortable, breakfast was beautiful, the only downside was the refurbishing of the hotel, but this has made me want to return to see the finished look as we had a wonderful stay. Loved it!!",5,2015,04,09
125,Great stay! :),"My partner and I stayed here over the Easter weekend, location and the public holiday made parking very easy and we were able to park directly outside.

We were disappointed upon check in to learn the Light Bar had closed for refurbishment and the restaurant Asia De Cuba had been moved to a smaller area whilst the return takes place.

We often take full advantage of the hotels facilities when we stay out in London and was disappointed that the renovations hadn't been communicated to us prior or post booking and we were forced to have drinks and dinner out of the hotel.

That being said the room was incredibly comfortable with all aspects covered and despite the media hub not working we were compensated with a lovely complimentary breakfast by very nice understanding staff.

On waking, we felt the advantage of this hotels location as we strolled into Covent Garden. The sun was shining and we had lunch outside with no rush to get back or worry for parking, this may have added to our enjoyment more and taken our annoyance away from the hotels lack of communication.

All in all a lovely stay but won't be returning until all renovations completed! ",4,2015,04,09
125,Great location. Modern Rooms,"Care: if you are going in April. Bar is closed and restaurant too. There is a makeshift place for food. This is a great location, just on South West corner of Covent Garden. 2 mins to Leicester Square tube and 5 to Covent Garden. Nice rooms with mood lighting. Only downside is that on lower floors even pedestrians can see in. WiFi good.",4,2015,04,08
125,NO WILLY WONKA BUT HOTEL A STONKA! ,"Arrived to a wonderful welcome from the team who then, after my request, broke the news that we were not going to see Charlie and Choc Factory due to London Fire. Immediately the staff offered popcorn and DVD with chocs to make up for an issue that wasn't theirs to fix! Nice touch. 
Easy check in and off to wonder room. Spotless and v modern with great bathroom. 
The beds were super and room service spot on. 
Breakfast was a delight and very filling. Attentive and personal service. 
Will definitely return when I get my new tickets through! 
 ",5,2015,04,07
125,Different hotel,"Lovely Hotel, very hard to find as there is no signage on the hotel. Staff were very helpful and nothing seemed to much trouble . I would call it a minimalist hotel, very modern ,clean and upto date. The room was lovely had all the mod cons, including the iron board, iron, bathrobes etc.
Only one disappointment and that there was no kettle or tea making equipment in the room. Do like my cup of Tea when I first wake up. Overall first class, slightly more expensive than other hotels in this range, however it was Easter.",5,2015,04,06
125,Just perfect!,"From the time we arrived to the time we left, we were made to feel special. All the staff were so friendly and it was so nice to see people who really enjoy their jobs. The reception was so welcoming and beautiful with big candles in glass lanterns along the floor. It was my husbands 50th birthday and we came back to the room to find the bed turned down, candles lit in the (very luxurious) bathroom and a bottle of champagne chilling next to two glasses. There was also a hand-written card! Absolutely amazing and something you just wouldn't expect. We had booked dinner out, but were tempted into the restaurant for a drink and immediately changed our booking to eat there. The sashimi tuna was the best we've even had. The room itself was faultless. Incredible design with the lighting system around the extremely comfortable bed, Bluetooth connections at various points in the very soundproof room - despite being in the centre of London. It really doesn't get any better than this. Thank you everyone at St Martins Lane. Just wonderful.",5,2015,04,06
125,Great location and Great service!,"This hotel is very detail oriented, rooms are small but very well equipped and the hotel is on a great location! The bar downstairs has great food and the drinks are very unique. the hotel staff is very helpful and its a terrific hotel to stay in!",5,2015,04,05
125,Deluxe,"Deluxe room = Deluxe stay...
first impressions can only be good when staying here, arrived and was greeted with a smile by the doorman who had my suitcase at reception before I could even get out the taxi no messing.  Entered reception to be greeted again with smiles from all the staff and welcomed to St Martins Lane Hotel.  Check in was quick and easy just what you need after a journey.  I was early but my room was allocated and ready so without any delays I went in search of my room.
Room is just excellent with an outstanding ensuite and up to now everything works.  Love the  lighting system around the bed, itself one of the most comfortable I've slept in and for me the media hub that actually works is just fab my iPad plugged in watching my films.  Bluetooth connection to iPhone so i can play my music. I had pre requested tea tray when I booked so nice that this was in the room all ready. My only negative, despite being a very well stocked mini bar is the prices. 
Have no problem recommending here for a stay and certainly hope I will return again.",5,2015,04,04
125,lush!!,"A lovely warm welcome when we arrived! Check in was straight forward,our room beautiful clean,bright and the bed was to 'die for'...so comfortable!! The slight downfall was the lack of toiletries for a 5 star hotel no shampoo and body wash.Another little moan was no tea/coffee tray...if you needed one you had to ring housekeeping. Location great if you don't like tubes or the expense of taxis! Evening time the hotel looks beautiful with candles in the reception.",3,2015,04,03
125,Fabulous hotel with 5* staff and customer service,"I have  stayed in numerous hotels in London but this one exceed all expectations!!! Fabulous location, clean, crisp and modern rooms with an boutique feel. All they staff went out of there way to make our stay a memorable one. 
It was our first year anniversary and also my husbands birthday and Isabel one of the front of house staff really went above and beyond, upgrading our room, bringing champagne  and cakes to the room!  Customer service like this is hard to find in the UK. 
The bed was so comfortable and even though we were in the heart of the city the windows blocked  out every bit of noise!! They also had a car park! 
They have everything right with this hotel. We will definitely be returning! 
Thank you St Martins for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,03,31
125,Brilliant stay,"Just stayed at this great hotel, the rooms were spotless and quiet... which was surprising as it is located in the heart of the West End.

Loved the contemporary feel and all the staff I meet were very polite and helpful.

Will definitely stay there again",5,2015,03,29
125,Perfect location and spotless hotel,"The location of this hotel is perfect for covent garden/Leicester square etc.

The room was beautiful and modern with mood lighting and big windows. 

The bathroom was lovely with lovely toiletries, the room was set for us when we got back with candles lit in the bathroom and pink lights on!

We would def recommend for an easy London stay! ",5,2015,03,29
125,Fantastic,"Great location next to Trafalgar Square. The rooms are very clean, spacious and comfy. I have stayed in many places around the world and this hotel has the best shower and shower gels by far! Good bar in the lobby. Helpful staff. Definitely worth a try. ",5,2015,03,28
125,Superb and stylish,"We celebrated our first anniversary at the hotel and had a wonderful time. The rooms and bathrooms are beautiful and most calming. The concierge was very helpful and charming. Breakfast was fantastic. The lobby and bar have a great atmosphere and given the enviable position, this most surely be the only place to stay in London! Thank you to all the staff who make this place so special.",5,2015,03,27
125,"Amazing hotel, loved it!","Stayed here for a weekend with my wife back in October to get away from the routine. 

Expensive, granted, but you get what you pay for; huge great big room (corner suite), perfect location, cool bar, wonderful breakfast. 

Made for a perfect weekend, highly recommend. 

",5,2015,03,25
125,Try-hard (should try harder but for real and with a smile),"Overall, a rather disappointing experience for the premium price being charged :-/ 

The rooms are cold and not inviting and so are some of the staff. 

The design is trying hard to look cool by being all white but in the end the results feels clinical. Pseudo-fancy lights meant to look timeless actually look out of fashion. The whole thing doesn't really feel like it's been well thought-through but rather like the designer has indulged himself / herself and put the guests after his / her own whims.

The bathroom is nice and cosy, however. The best part of the room, sadly.

To be fair, design is a matter of taste and you can't please everyone.

But if I've decided to write such review it's because there are many small problems at every step of my stay here, starting with some (not all) of the staff. 

Just now, having dinner after 9PM was not possible. Ok, no worries, let's order room service and watch some TV. Problem is, asking advice on which TV channel to watch for some comedy turned into a lecture from the concierge complaining how difficult it was for her to answer such question - ??? And room service was served by a young chap with attitude instead of a friendly smile. Thanks, mate.

Again, to be fair, the waiter at the restaurant and the guy who did my check-in yesterday were actually nice. But hey, for almost 600 Pounds a night it should be expected, no?

I don't know. Maybe it's me. Or maybe it's London. Or maybe it's this place, that's not quite there yet seems rather full of attitude with statements such as ""We lead where others follow"" (i'm quoting the flimsy and cheap looking A4 stack of pages called 'guestroom directory')

So yeah, I don't look forward to coming back to this hotel at night and it's really a pity because I wish I did since I have quite a few more nights to spend here.

I hope they improve and I wish them good luck in doing so. 
It would be a waste if they didn't.",2,2015,03,23
125,Still a good Hotel,"Went back to this Hotel after many Years. The rooms are still similar, nicely decorated. Service is good, specially at the Reception and concierge.
The Restaurant has a great Menu and the quality of the food is outstanding. Breakfast poor and overpriced. The Location makes this Hotel one of the best in the West End, you can't beat it.",4,2015,03,23
125,Amazing,"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in from start to finish.
Our room had been up graded to deluxe and it was amazing with the mood lighting, dressing gowns, slippers and the most comfortable bed there's no way you can't relax. The mini bar had everything you can think of in there ( yes you have to pay). It was the best nights sleep i had. On my birthday we got back from being out all day and they had set the mood lighting, lit the candles in the bathroom and there was chocolate cake on the desk. Attention to detail in this hotel was very good, all the staff were lovely.
In a great area close to lots of theatres,restaurants and shops.
I would 100% come back to this hotel.",5,2015,03,23
125,Overpriced & overestimated,"The room is comfortable and nice as you can see in the pictures, outside is much different then the reality and the hotel is still under renewing, staff is nice and cordial.
The breakfast has to be avoided, the buffet is really basic and it costs 20 GBP PLUS 15% service to serve just a coffee, unacceptable.

Overall, not good value for money.",2,2015,03,19
125,Everything very good,"The hotel is located very close to Leicester Square, which gives it a perfect position in the city. Rooms are comfortable (very nice and clean) and the staff is also very kind and helpful. Would definitely go back again!",5,2015,03,14
125,I want to move into this hotel,"This property definitely deserves 5-star rating.  Here are the features which really impressed me:

Everything is bright and clean; from the moment you walk into the lobby, this place is sparkling.  The d√©cor is white, so managing to keep everything pristine is a challenge in itself, and they do this very well, from hallways to bathrooms to restaurant.

The service is excellent - every single staff member greets you with a sincere smile, helps you at the door, gets you a cab, etc.  Their manners are impeccable, very old world and gracious.

The room I had was exquisite - it  was a deluxe king and had to be one of the most comfortable and thoughtfully designed hotel rooms I've stayed in.  Linens were great quality, as were amenities (large sizes, not puny bottles), bathrobes and slippers.  Slippers were replenished daily, a very nice touch.  Loved that there was plenty of counter space for all my girly things.  Shower and toilet were separate from beautiful sink area, and candles were available so you could light them, dim lights and get rid of that stress...aaaahhhh...

Very modern decor.  I have to admit I couldn't figure out how to turn on one of the lamps, by the second day, I had it.  

On the website, pictures of hotel front show multi-colored window panels, and when I arrived, didn't see evidence of this.  However, at night, subdued underlighting in the room was turned on (I presume by housekeeping turn-down service), and each room was  glowing in a different color.  My favorite was reddish-orange, it made the room feel sooo warm and soothing.  

Location was fantastic, close to Covent Garden, Leicester Square tube stop.  Theatre district just steps away.  St Martins Lane is a lively and lovely street for a walk; I walked to Portrait Gallery to take in a Sargent's exhibition, top notch.

Plenty of casual restaurants in area, Pret a Manger, La Roche (Moroccan caf√©), take aways, Tesco down the street.

I had breakfast at Asia de Cuba, fantastic, absolutely stellar food.  I had the English breakfast which kept me going until the next day.

I was on a business  trip and hoping, hoping, hoping for a return trip and would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,03,11
125,"Super modern, wonderful location","This is a very nice, ultra modern hotel.  The best part is the location.  Walk to the river, the Ferris wheel, Trafalgar Square, coven garden, and a million restaurants.  The rooms are comfy and light.  Floor to ceiling windows. The odd thing is the light in the room at night.  Each room has a different color, for a cool effect from the outside. But it was odd in a green-lit room.  There was construction going on this week.",4,2015,03,10
125,Loved the mood lighting,"Perfect position near Covent Garden. Leicester Square China Town 
We went to see the Commitments 
Clean modern fresh
Comfy bed and bedding
Gorgeous bathroom 
Cool modern decor liked the sub charging points 
Loved the lighting 
Thoroughly spoilt",5,2015,03,08
125,Another great find,"I had booked to see the ""Commitments"" at the Theatre and had the hotel recomended by a friend.  I owe them big style.  A great hotel, although it was a little   hard to find, no Sign. The staff were fantastic all were very knowledgable, polite and friendly.  The hotel Bar and main Restaurant were undergoing re-furbishment but this was being tastefully hidden.  We chose the early Theatre menu in the Restaurant and it was superb, the waitress clearly explain your order, how it was to be cooked and presented.  As for the location,great, and the Commitments show was well worth seeing.",5,2015,03,07
125,Truly spoilt!,"St Martins Lane had been on my fianc√©es to do list for a long while, and boy was it worth the wait! Despite having stopped in many hotels around the world the last year this still remains one of the top experiences of all time. We spoilt ourselves by ordering room service dinner and breakfast and we were not dissapointed, You would struggle to find better good anywhere in London! The service was incredible and we were made to feel like we were the most important visitors to the hotel. Despite being one of the more expensive hotels in London, I would encourage people not to settle for anything less! ",5,2015,03,04
125,Great location and great breakfast,"Great location, great accommodation and great food! 

We chose St. Martins due to its location in the West End and also upon a recommendation from a friend.

The location is great, the hotel is within walking distance of Covent Garden, theatres and Regents & Oxford Street so if you have a theatre break booked or want shopping then this is the place to stay! 

We were a little disappointed with the check in process with some staff appearing dismissive and not recognising when someone had pushed in the queue or apologising for the wait but other than this our stay was just what we wanted. 

Unfortunately we were not made aware of the renovation project during the booking process but after speaking with Caroline at St.Martins we were offered a room upgrade and breakfast which we happily accepted. The room was spacious and light and had everything we needed. The breakfast was amazing, possibly our favourite part of the experience with many options on the menu including steak which proved to be a winner! 

I plan to stay at St. Martins again once the refurbishment has been completed and would recommend anyone else to do the same! 
",4,2015,03,02
125,Excellent location,"I stayed here for four nights over New Year. Its a great location and was excellent for New Year. We booked way in advance and got a reasonable price considering the location and time of year. This is definitly a ""trendy hotel"". If you want luxury, go to the Savoy.",4,2015,02,20
125,Disappointed,"I stayed at the hotel as a treat from my husband for valentines - Sat 14th Feb.  My overall experience was disappointing.  I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and the St Martins Lane Hotel appealed due to its location, which is perfect, however we should have saved our money and stayed at a Premier Inn or Travelodge as that how the hotel felt.  It offered nothing more than a budget hotel.  When we booked we were not made aware of the refurbishment.  Also when we checked in no-one explained that there were no facilities at the hotel.  We went off to find the bar only to discover there was no bar and the restaurant where you could get a drink told us to come back at 1145pm that evening as that was the first available slot (it was 1pm in the afternoon!).  The corridors to the rooms were very dull and shabby.  Our room was basically a small box overlooking a roof and air conditioning unit.  I'm sad to say that I was very disappointed with the overall experience and would not recommend.  My advice - save your money and go budget or stay at the Savoy!",3,2015,02,18
125,"Great staff, good location","The staff were great especially Gabriel and Fatima. The location is excellent and close to westend. 
Need to improve breakfast, and have a space to have a quick drink or coffee.
Enjoyed the experience and would love to go back.",4,2015,02,05
125,Sexy room,"Our refurbished room was beautiful. We stayed in a loft, huge room with floor to ceiling windows, big settee, gorgeous bed and very, very nice bathroom.
Front of house is a slick operation, staff are friendly and welcoming with a reassuringly professional approach.
Have stayed at both SML and Sanderson, prefer SML for location and quieter, calming atmosphere.
Push the boat out for a larger room, it's worth it.",5,2015,02,01
125,Things You Might want to Know,"When you are trying to find this place, look for a building fronted by lots of glass a short distance up from the Trafalgar Square end with absolutely nothing to indicate it's a hotel - you are supposed to be telepathic on your first visit.  In Jan/Feb 2015, it is undergoing refurbishment and there is no lounge or bar area.  When you get to your room, check if you can work the TV there are no useful instructions in the room and although I can work most things I could only switch it on/off or adjust the volume.",3,2015,02,01
125,Perfect stay,"We chose this hotel for its proximity to Covent Garden and The Royal Opera House and it is very close to the ROH Trafalgar Sq, National Gallery and Portrait Gallery. 
Our stay was perfect. As well as its great location the hotel is stylish and the staff provide a very high standard of friendly service.
Our room was spectacular, we were upgraded to a suite on the top floor.
Lovely atmosphere in the hotel: happy staff and happy customers.
Good breakfast choices and although a little pricey, excellent quality.
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,01,30
125,Covent Garden at its Coolest,"We arranged a family trip to London to celebrate our daughters 21st birthday and we could not have made a better choice! On arrival we were so impressed by the exceptionally welcoming staff. This is a design hotel with a capital D, with light bright ultra modern spaces and rooms. we really loved the location which allowed us to walk almost every where we wanted to go. We spent time on both nights in the bar and the delightful staff there could not have done more to make my daughters 21st one to remember! with birthday cocktails, a sparkling profiterole tower and even a group rendition of happy birthday :) We have so many happy memories and before I finish I wanted to make an extra special mention of Ahmet who did a fantastic job of meeting & greeting us every time we entered or left the hotel!! His lovely manner reminded us why we love Turkey so much, where we have many friends just like him. He is a star* We will return very soon and will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,01,28
125,The best hotel,"We returned for a second stay as a birthday surprise. My husband and I adore this hotel, it is very expensive for us but worth every penny. The attention to detail and customer service is out of this world. The staff will do everything they can to make sure you enjoy your stay. The rooms are clean and bright and bathrooms are to die for, we recommend this hotel to everyone and and look forward to returning next year.",5,2015,01,27
125,"Just book it, if your budget allows","There is no question about this place. Right next to Trafalgar square - in a happening place of London. 
Rooms are excellent. Unlike other hotels you don't get the beautiful view of Thames. That is negligible for a hotel of this standard.

Definitely recommend to my friends.",5,2015,01,25
125,Fantastic Location - Avoid the onsite parking.,"We stayed at the hotel for our annual Christmas break. Location is excellent for Covent Garden and the West End. Hotel was very modern and staff were very helpful and I would definitely stay there again.

I had two gripes - First the onsite parking ... I have never seen a parking garage which was so difficult to navigate - the spaces are very tight and very little room to turn around (there are other parking garages within walking distance). Second, the fitness centre ... it looks great on the website but is only open from 10am on a weekend ... not really much use for morning exercise. It would be useful if the hotel made this clear on their website to give the traveller an informed choice.",4,2015,01,23
125,Re-visit,"We have stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel several times, as we were not going to be in the hotel very much we booked a standard room, which we found a little on the small side. But as usual the cleanliness of the room was first class and the staff very friendly and helpful. I love the bar and the over all d√©cor, also the position of the hotel is just fantastic for the West End.",5,2015,01,23
125,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location, 5 minutes walk to Covent garden, 5 minutes walk to Leicester sq and a 2 minute walk to Trafalgar sq not to mention all the theatres that are in very close proximity. The hotel itself is moden with small but clean fresh rooms. Our room was room 224 and was on a corner so it benefited from lots of floor to ceiling windows and was slightly bigger than the other standard rooms. We didn't eat in the hotel but the food did smell lovely. The bar served nice cocktails and was nice for a nightcap, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2015,01,17
125,Beatiful hotel but small rooms,"Have stayed here a few times when working in London and would say its pretty good for its central location, if a little expensive for the size of room. D√©cor, in room amenities, turn down service etc. are all first class and the bedding is very comfortable. Food and drink quality is good and the service excellent. You also occasionally see the odd celeb in the bar, on this occasion clocked Robert Downey Jr. in the lobby.

Only real complaint is the room size / layout. I had a desk and chair in my room but there really wasn't enough room for them. To work I had to move the chair out of the way so I could sit on the end of the bed to use the desk. Quite minor but worth raising due to the room price.",4,2015,01,17
125,Fab NYE,"Beautiful hotel, fabulous service, great NYE dinner (mint mojitos are amazing) recommend for a break of theatre, shopping, culture and London at its best. Love it love it love it!  Good breakfast lunch and dinner places.  Les Deux Salons around the corner - lovely.  Bill's in St Martins Courtyard great for breakfast.",5,2015,01,16
125,Romantic break,"Our stay at St Martins Lane Hotel was amazing, from the moment we walked in the service was perfect. We had booked the romance package as a treat due to a rare child free night and it didn't disappoint. The room was lovely and the champagne a real treat. Upon arriving back from an evening at the ballet we ordered room service burgers which were delicious. 
When we checked out someone had charged their lunch to our room! but this was dealt with promptly and with good humour. All in all a great stay and I'm just trying to persuade my husband to take me back for our wedding anniversary as its a brilliant hotel to stay in London.",5,2015,01,12
125,Exceptional Customer Service,"Our experience at St Martins Lane was superb. The hotel was recently renovated, clean/well-kept, and ideally located. More importantly, the staff was incredible! The front desk, valet, and conceirge (Sam in particular) were incredibly dedicated to ensuring our trip was a success.

Highly recommended!",5,2015,01,07
125,peaceful time,"Thank you St Martins for looking after me from the moment I checked in. I would particularly like to thank Gemma at front desk for being so attentive and even sending me champagne and  cake to my room on my birthday. I found all your staff very friendly and helpful, a big thank you to  Andrea for keeping my room neat and tidy (even though I tried talking her ears off). ..oh also your security guard Martin ( we shared a few jokes on New Years, very funny guy).

Nabil",5,2015,01,05
125,London's Finest,"Our stay at The St Martins Lane Hotel was absolutely fantastic. My partner and I travel a lot and really welcomed the great service. It was impeccable. Warm, friendly, hospitable and authentic. From the bell boys to the last of the staff, every interaction was a pleasure and they really went all out to ensure our stay was both memorable and enjoyable, despite a surprise flooding of the 1 st floor which temporarily closed the main hotel entrance.
Of special note were the wonderful Isabel Ringis and Caroline Evans.",5,2015,01,05
125,New Years Evening...,"I had an amazing New years eve at Asia de Cuba and your Light Bar. The twins (Rose and Lilly)  were super welcoming and friendly and Helen the manager in the restaurant was an all around STAR. Vinny at the Light Bar was a gracious host and the waitress Amy's helpfulness made our evening all the better. Thanks for a great night, and hopefully see you next year..... 

Philip Black",5,2015,01,04
125,Really great location,A great hotel in a fabulous spot. We stayed on NYE and could get to key locations in theatre land very easily. Unfortunately we were on the fourth floor so although facing towards the embankment not high enough to see the fireworks from 406. However we couldn't fault the room ...the lighting was amazing and changed colours over the bed. The bathroom was also lovely with great toiletries. I left my toothbrush so hoping they will send this on though! I would recommend this hotel and certainly choose it again.,5,2015,01,04
125,"Excellent Stay, Excellent staff, Excellent experience","We landed on the red-eye from New York at 7am, expecting to drop our luggage off at the hotel because check-in was not until 3pm. We arrived at the hotel at 10am to pleasant staff, Caroline told us she could give us a room immediately with a complimentary room upgrade. Andre kindly helped with the luggage, and gave us a tour of the tech aspects to the room.
The room itself was great. very spacious bedroom and large bathroom. Clever layout, meant easy clutter free living. Modern and clean, the mood lighting was a cool focal point, and totally mesmerizing. The King bed was so comfortable, clean, crisp linens- wish I could take it home!
Michael at concierge was extremely helpful. We needed a table for 8 people that night (Friday) in the Light bar, and we were quickly accommodated. He also was helpful getting reservations for dinner. my mum bought us a bottle of champagne from room service, however we were out, they allowed us to transfer the bottle to the Light bar for us to dink there with our friends.
We were leaving London for Brighton in the afternoon Sunday, and they were very accommodating with extending our check-out time. 
Location was ideal, easy walking to everything. Great restaurants, museums, shows.
Such an excellent stay, we are going to Miami at the end of January 2015 and are looking into staying at the Shore Club (Morgans hotel) because we are so impressed with the service in London.
In all aspects we would definitely return the St Martins Lane again!",5,2015,01,03
125,Amazing Stay,We recently stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel for a family 70th celebration. We had 3 rooms all of which were upgraded to our delight and as a special treat for the birthday guest they were upgraded to one of the largest suits in the hotel. This made our stay extra special as well as the bottles of champagne. All I can say is St Martins Lane hotel have made our very special weekend even more special. All of the staff were very polite and friendly. Thank you for such a wonderful stay.,5,2015,01,03
125,Comfortable and bright,"I found the hotel fairly central to all tourists spots, walking to all locations. The rooms are reasonable size and have large windows that make it feel bigger and bright. The room I had was recently renovated and very nicely laid out, well cleaned every day. Very helpful staff. The only negative I had was that taxis could not find the hotel on their GPS or they couldn't find the entry to the hotel due to one way streets, etc.....",4,2014,12,30
125,Brilliant Location,"Firstly, its a great location for Theatreland, Soho and Covent Garden. All within a very short walk. The reception and bar/restaurant areas are very stylish and the staff were friendly. We had a standard room on the 6th floor with a nice view of the old Post Office Tower. It was very quiet at night. The bed was very comfortable, there was a good shower room and a few nice design touches.

On the negative side, the room itself was pretty small and there was no kettle - I think one was available on request but assume you would have to source your own tea/coffee, etc. It was great for one night but I think that you would need a bigger room if staying any longer than a couple of nights.

My major gripe was with booking. The website seemed to offer some price packages that werent available when I tried to book, either online or by telephone. Perhaps the website prices didnt include VAT. Eventually we got a much better price online through a third party.

Breakfast was pretty expensive, although it may be more economical as part of a package, however there are loads of places you can have breakfast within a couple of hundred metres.",3,2014,12,30
125,Not worth the price,"We stayed for a few days just after Christmas. First the good bits. 

The hotel is in a fabulous location for exploring london, in the heart of soho with easy walks to loads of hotspots and tube stations. An excellent base for shopping, theatre, tourist spots, museums, etc.  Leicester Sq is the closest tube, but lots of others nearby.

The reception staff are awesome, very friendly and helpful.

A cool bar, lobby and restaurant on-site and use of the modern gym (gym box) next door.  

Modern rooms (I'm not sure if all of them have been refurbished yet, but our standard room had been).  Great bathroom and the in-house toiletries are lovely, and very importantly not tested on animals. So many designer/boutique/upmarket hotels overlook that, so great to see here. Good shower pressure.

Comfy bed - but small - and lux linen and towels.

Good, powerful hair dryer in room, lots of plugs and USB charge points.

But I do have some gripes.

The hotel is very expensive, even compared to other five star boutiques. And I'm not sure the cost is justified, even for the great location. The rooms are very small, and quickly turn into a complete mess with two people and luggage and shopping. Not great soundproofing between the rooms - I can hear the family next door, and heard doors opening and closing all night.

The shower head is in a weird position and can't be moved, so often i ended up with water in my eyes. And the basin taps are impossible to turn on or off with wet hands.

No sound dock or Bluetooth stereo in room. No tea or coffee facilities.

The lifts are impossibly slow. Extremely frustrating.

Our room was also ages away from the lift so it was a huge walk to get to each time.

Housekeeping was a bit of a disaster. One day the room was only half cleaned, and the bathroom not touched. Another day we had no towels left, and the third day we were only given one towel and housekeeping knocked on our door several times to check if they'd cleaned the room already.

Overall, a trendy hotel but not quite worth the price. Unbeatable location though.",3,2014,12,29
125,Great service,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times during the last ten years. I obviously like the location and the rooms. I wasn't impressed by their service in the past but the price was always right so it has been one of my favourite hotels in London. However during my last visit I was happily surprised by the impecable service of the reception, the room service and the housekeeping. Congratulations on impoving the service. I am definitely coming back.",5,2014,12,28
125,Amazing Anniversary Stay!,"I arranged a one night stay and reservation in the hotel's restaurant, Asia de Cuba, as a 9 year anniversary surprise for my wife and I couldn't have been happier!  We were upgraded to a garden room and were treated to a bottle of champagne to celebrate.  The staff were extremely attentive and the food and drink was delicious.  In fact, the bar served the best white martinis we have ever tasted.  I think we ended up having 4!  Our waiter in the restaurant was also very knowledgeable about the food and wisely directed us to order less than we would have as the portion sizes are quite substantial.  This is one of the only restaurants where I can honestly say that quality and quantity go hand in hand.  The room was extremely well appointed too and I loved the changeable light colours to suit our mood.  My only regret was that I had booked one night and not two!",5,2014,12,27
125,Our favourite London hotel getaway,"This hotel is our treat when stopping in London. When visiting from Australia we usually book a few nights here. We have always had a great experience and this time was no different. We hadn't stayed here for almost three years but they remembered and gave us a room upgrade. Also when coming back to the room on our first night we were greeted by a personal welcome back card from the manager and some very delicious macaroons. The bed is comfy, bathroom excellent - great large shower, great toiletries and large bath. Staff always helpful and pleasant - even granting us a later check out on leaving day. The hotel is perfectly placed for heading to theatre or going out in and around London. My only recommendation would be to ask for a side or back room if you can. Our room was overlooking st martins lane. Great view but it gets busy early in morning with delivery trucks. Noise isn't too bad but might affect a light sleeper on the lower floors. We'll definitely come back and stay next time we head to London.",5,2014,12,24
125,Excellent stay - in all regards,"Very comfortable hotel. Room immaculate and decent size by European standards. Staff great! Especially, Concierge Michael.  Wish I could post our pic together. Extremely helpful to recommend everything from food to must see places to go. Location was ideal for husbands business and my play.",5,2014,12,21
125,Good nights stay,"Been in to the hotel many times but never stayed so thought why not. We had a great stay, the rooms are really nice and the overall look and feel is perfect. I would say that some areas need a bit of touching up but that's what comes with white walls and beautiful spaces.",4,2014,12,21
125,"Funky, modern, well-kept hotel","I must say that my experience was probably different than it would have been if I didn't have a corporate rate. My company does a ton of global business, especially in London, so they gave me a fantastic room with a small patio/garden, for a discounted rate, as well as a 10% discount on all food/bevs in the hotel bar and restaurant. 

My room was spacious and modern, well-kept, and I'm a big fan of the Malin+Goetz bath products. I do think the hotel's restaurant, Asia de Cuba, is good, but definitely not worth the price. I've eaten a lot better for a lot less.

Overall, great experience and you have to remember, London is really expensive, no matter where you stay. That said, if you're going to pay a small fortune anyway, you might as well stay someplace a little nicer, like the St. Martins lane.",5,2014,12,18
125,Disappointing!,"Our first visit to this hotel was very good, second time ok, this time not so good!  We were upgraded from a deluxe room to a garden view room - so dull with no view whatsover and the smell in the room was really odd.  I would normally complain and ask for a change of room but we really short on time.  

We also booked a table in the Light Bar post theatre to enjoy a drink on our return, but on arriving 10 minutes late were told there was no table available.  At this point we decided to call it a day as we had to be up early, but with the loud thumping noise coming from the bar below until 2.30am, followed by a lot of banging of furniture from 3am onwards, we could not get to sleep.  

Arrived home after what should have been a great weekend completely shattered.  No plans to return!",2,2014,12,15
125,Romantic Weekend,"What a lovely, boutique style hotel! 

We stayed for 1 night on December 13th in room 614 for a romantic, Christmas shopping get away! 

We had a room on the 6th floor that had terrific views! No other 5 star hotels we have been to in London have views like this! The room is modern, clean, airy and bright! The bathroom was immaculate and modern...With plenty of space for us girls to do our make up and hair! 

I did notice in the info book in the room that you can pay for a stylist to style your hair within the comfort of your hotel room! What a great idea and something more hotels should offer! Obviously you have to pay but it's worth it for a special night out! 

We went to Lite Bar, which is a cocktail bar within the hotel, we were asked if we had a reservation (which we didn't) but there was no problem in accommodating a table for us straight away! You have to try the Lemon Meringue Champagne cocktail!!! Delicious! Great atmosphere and drinks! 

The location of the hotel is superb! You have everything you need around you! 

To top it off, on our return from our meal out we had a complimentary bottle of bubbly waiting for us! Thank you! 

In the morning we ordered room service ... The breakfast presentation was good and there was plentiful amount of food which was very tasty! 

We look forward to visiting again! ",5,2014,12,14
125,Fabulous understated hotel ,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our wedding anniversary weekend.  

This is a modern understated hotel.  There is no signage at the door or inside to say that you are at this hotel. If you are a local and know this hotel as we did this is no issue for those that don't follow your Google maps, take a cab or know that it's opposite the theatre showing Shakespeare in love.

We loved the modern simplicity of this hotel with its coloured lighting adding a sense of fun to the reception and the rooms.

The bar was very busy on the Saturday night. It was bustling with life. The cocktails were to die for. A massive choice and very high quality. 

The hotel has 6 floors. We were in the 6th floor so it was nice and quiet to see we were in the middle of London. 

The room numbers are not on the doors they are on the carpets in the halls so look down whilst looking for your room.

The room was small but perfectly formed.  The room was immaculate and again very contemporary in its design. Everything is white. In our room yellow and red lights added a quirky sense of fun to the room.  

The bathroom was sleek and modern. It was also immaculate. The room has a shower. No bath.

The bed was deliciously comfortable and after a long day in London on our feet, a night at the theatre and many cocktails in the hotels bar it was an absolute delight to fall asleep in this bed. If I could buy the bed and the pillows I would. 

All in all we had a brilliant stay at this hotel. I would highly recommend it. 

",5,2014,12,13
125,"Great location, excellent service and good sizeable rooms.","Had not stayed in this hotel for quite a number of years, but was delighted it still is as great as ever. I stayed in a deluxe room which is quite sizeable for London standards and has a large bathroom with a great shower and plenty of wardrobe space. The minimalist approach to the design of the room is ok even if, like me, you're not a big fan of it. The location, walking distance from Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square and Covent Garden is hard to beat. But the greatest asset of this hotel is its staff. Friendly, hospitable, helpful and very competent. The bar still serves great cocktails and the breakfast buffet in the morning is great. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.",5,2014,12,12
125,Great hotel! Great location!,"Highly recommended and very affordable. Small, but very well designed rooms and a very cool, active lobby that's great for people watching. Excellent service. Easy to get around London from here. Would love to stay again.",5,2014,12,09
125,Never fails to impress...,"As a long time user of the hotel, and lover of the belovedly quirky design, it's always been a pleasure to recommend the establishment to others. Yes, standard rooms aren't the most sizeable, but the quality of the furnishings and lighting more than make up for this, as do the lush breakfasts in Asia de Cuba. Highlights? Best located hotel in London - everything that matters is close. Fabulous front desk staff who always try that bit harder. And let's not forget the awesome Ahmet on the door who will turn the capital upside down to get you where you want and how you want. Love this place, keep it coming!",5,2014,12,08
125,Great hotel in central London,"I stayed here for work, and it was perfect. The hotel itself is groovy and modern with amazing showers. You get access to an outstanding fitness club next door, and the Starbucks across the street is one of only two in Europe where the baristas get to pull their own shots vs using an automated machine.

You are steps from the theatre district and walking distance to all the major downtown sites. 

The service was excellent. I was jet lagged and they let me check in early so I could clean up before an afternoon meeting.

Love it.",5,2014,12,05
125,Fun hotel - Great Location,"I stayed here recently for work - mainly because it was closest to the office.  A very nice find.  I arrived late and the staff was amazingly friendly and welcoming.  That is always a great sign.  The room was very modern and hip and I loved that I could change the colors of the lighting in the room (over the bed and windows).  The room had all the nice amenities - although the outlets were not in the most convenient locations in the room.  As if the room itself wasn't the draw, the location is amazing.  I walked around and hit Trafalgar Square, then Covent gardens.  Such a wonderful neighborhood.  The gelato place around the corner is amazing - and also found a great local bookshop.

Additionally, the hotel is home to a fantastic restaurant, Asia de Cuba, which also serves as room service.  Are you kidding me?  Very good food and worth the splurge.",4,2014,12,04
125,Over priced pretentious hotel,There is not even a sign on the outside of the hotel telling you it is a hotel..... Says everything really. Over priced (20 euro for continental breakfast and 3.50 for a coffee.... )but great location and good service,2,2014,12,03
125,Fun Hotel,"To start I would have given this hotel a 4.5 if I could have. 

It is in a fantastic location, the staff and customer service is great, it is clean, beautifully decorated and well equipped. The wifi is great and there are lots of good little bars and restaurants nearby. The rooms are well equipped if not a little overly designed and confusing at times. There is a great gym and pilates studio next door. 

And why drop the 0.5 I hear you ask. Well overall it is just a bit too cool. I know that might sound stupid but it is a little bit intimidating. From the very enthusiastic trendy gym instructors with their ripped and stripped classes, to the back lit beds (which by the way look ultracool, but make anyone over the age of 25 look atrocious on Skype or facetime). I know this is what they are going for and they have succeeded. Perhaps I was not in the right frame of mind as I was travelling on business.",4,2014,12,03
125,Hip hotel in the center of it all,"My husband and I spent the weekend at this modern hotel. The rooms are cozy but very clean and love the bath products by  Malin and Goetz. Fab! 

You can walk to Covent a Garden which is a great place to visit and also down the road from the tube. The center of central London. It is where you want to be!",5,2014,11,30
125,Central and futuristic ,"The hotel room are very basic but stylish and you find everything you need! I like the lights color can be changed!
It is very central and in the neighborhood you find a lot of bar and little restaurants. Good to stay, but it is indeed expensive... ",4,2014,11,29
125,Nice Hotel - Great Location,"Hotel is quite pricey ¬£300 a night but i guess that's what you pay for a nice hotel in the center of London. We got a trip advisor special rate which meant we got an upgrade when we arrived so we were happy with that! 
Hotel itself is very nice, the mood changing lights above the bed are cool. The staff bought us a complementary bottle of prosecco to our room, which we werent expecting! The cocktail bar does some really good cocktails...
The view from our room (6th floor) was brilliant we could see the london eye very clearly and it looked so nice lit up at night.
We went to the theatre and the hotel location is perfect for all west end shows! 
All in all we had a nice stay at St Martins Lane hotel and i would recommend it to anyone.",4,2014,11,28
125,Excellent Hotel + Perfect Location,"I had a brief but fantastic experience at this hotel. Upon my arrival I was friendly greeted by the FOH staff. The lobby is spacious and modern, the lights are slightly deemed which creates a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. 
I stayed in the 1st floor room 131 on the 17th of November. I had everything I needed for a good night sleep. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and there were lights on the wall above the bed which you can change the colors to according to your mood and the temperature in the room could be easily adjusted by myself and the shower was great. 

I had dinner at the Hotel's famous Asia de Cuba restaurant. Upon my arrival at the restaurant I was greeted and escorted to my table where my family and I were offered a complimentary glass of Champagne. The service was above the standards I expected and the food was amazing and in big quantities.   

I would most definitely recommend and return to this Hotel. 

Diego Cerqueira",5,2014,11,28
125,Another fabulous stay!,"St Martin's Lane hotel is one of my favourite hotels in London. Fantastic central location just of Trafalgar Squire, close to Soho & Covent Garden & the West End.
Funky decor, fantastic service & comfortable beds. All good here!",5,2014,11,28
125,Very modern hotel in an excellent location,"Firstly this is one of the best locations in london. It is in the hub of theatre land.
The interior is very post modern and stylish although I have to admit all the club like mood lighting isn't really for me (you could change the light colour in your room from varying bright pinks to blues).

The room is very comfortable although I was disappointed to find out we could hear our neighbours on both sides clearly (luckily we had good neighbours!) and at one point the mobile was so clear I assumed it was mine ringing.

As it was a birthday It was a nice treat to arrive back after our night out to find a complimentary slice of birthday cake.

The light bar downstairs was excellent and worth having a drink in. It felt less like a hotel bar than most.",4,2014,11,23
125,Nice Hotel in perfect location,"We normally stay at the Charring Cross bur fancied a change.  Very modern hotel with very friendly staff always on hand to help and nothing too much trouble.  Our King Size room was average size, we were on the top floor so had great views over London, a good reason to stay away from the first couple of floors.  My wife loved the bathroom, really like. Dressing room that was very well lit, made life easy for putting make up on, not always the case in some hotels.
No bath bur wow what a shower, great size and really powerful.
No coffee in our room on arrival or kettle but they soon changed that once we devised them. The only reason it does not get five stars is due to the bar.  When we arrived it was closed but they thought we might like to see it and yes it did look lovely we were very impressed. However on our return from a night out we went in for a night cap and walked straight back out, the music was so loud you could of thought you were walking into a nightclub.  I understand they are targeting younger people who aren't staying at the hotel, which is fair enough but perhaps they could find room for a smaller and bar with a more relaxing atmosphere. Instead we ordered a couple of Cointreaus with coffee, all for ¬£30!  I know it's London but that was a rip off.  That was my only gripe, did not eat in the hotel as we prefer to eat out but all in all a very nice stay.  
St Martins or Charring Cross? I think because of the issue with the bar the Charring Cross will get our business next year. We booked throughout tripadvisor which was might cheaper than the rate they quote on Morgans web site.",4,2014,11,23
125,Great hotel- Great location,"We stayed at the St. Martin's for 7 days and had the pleasure of experiencing impeccable service and London charm.  From our arrival to the end of our stay, Nicole and the entire staff were fabulous.  We had a corner room with a great view of the city.  Be sure and try the restaurant on site as the food is fantastic!  Also, the Gym Box next door is complimentary and offers lots of great work out options.  Overall, a great hotel in a great location with an extremely attentive, friendly, and helpful staff.",5,2014,11,22
125,"Great location, trendy hotel, almost too modern","I recently spent a week in London for business.  Given the nature of my meetings, I wanted to stay somewhere central in the city.  I love the Athenium, but it was full.  I had heard great things about St Martins Lane so booked in .  
The location is pretty awesome.  Right off Trafalgar square, near Charing Cross tube station.  Right next to the hotel is starbucks and next to it a great little health place next door called 'tossed'.  Perfect for morning coffee and yogurt.  Just up the road is a mid sized Tesco, in case you needed groceries and other supplies.  Only a 2 min walk away.  Also next door is a Nero, which is just fantastic coffee.  You are also of course in Covent Garden, one of the most vibrant areas of the city for theater, restaurants, and other nightlife.
So, the hotel.  
Modern.  Very friendly staff.  Super modern entrance and foyer.  Clearly a place Londoners or business types hang out.  the lounge restaurant bar area seems super swish, but I didnt use it.  Checkin was seamless, very friendly indeed.  Without requesting, I had arrived early from my flight and even at 1-2 pm on a Sunday my room was ready.  Smart cards for room keys, the type you swipe over a door sensor.  
Up to the room, the elevators are super small.  More than 2 people with luggage is tight.  Same with the hallways.  Low ceilings, dark, trying to be stylish, but kind of feels like the lights are off.  Smells like an aroma therapy is pumped into the halls, that got actually pretty annoying through the week.  It was a strong smell.
The room numbers are on the floor, recessed into the walls.  It took almost an entire walk of the hall and a staff member to notice I wasnt registering room numbers in my search.
To my room.  Opened door to a rather closed hallway.  They appear to have rearranged the room from a traditional 'walk in door', bathroom on right/left.  Instead you walk into the back of the room about through at least 8 ft of hall past closet to get into bed area.  Then, around the bed to get to loo.  
Room is VERY modern.  End outside all is all window.  It has blinds in it, but you cant close those.  Only the curtains hanging inside can be closed.  That was weird.  There is very little room in the room.  Meaning, the space around the bed is not a lot.  Barely any.  the end wall is all a TV and desk.  More like a long white table.  Nice light above it.  Good sized TV, maybe a 40"", with decent channel selection.  The WIFI is slow with no ethernet to plug into.  Instead they offer an upgrade to higher speed WIFI, and it did make a difference.  Desk chair where i did a lot of work was super modern and almost too modern to be functional.  Not much space to use it, needed to put it back under table to get past due to bed being so close.
Bathroom, nice tile work . Small sink area, stand up shower only.  Decent water pressure.  Wasnt a drizzle actually pretty good for London hotels.  Many dont have room level water pumps so pressure sucks, this room obviously had a pump as the pressure was good.  Decent products (shampoo etc) for use.  Nice lighting.
The bed is central to the room.  It has a good stiffness to it, and a nice duvet experience.  They also have these crazy colored lights around the headboard and TV, like mood lighting controlled from a central panel next to headboard.  Overkill, never used it.  
One highlight was the guest use of the Gymbox next door.  Its a huge health club with locations all over London.  check out gymbox.com.  Awesome use.  Went in every day all week.  Blows hotel gyms out of the water.  A little cheesy of a gym, lots of guys in tank tops dropping weights wearing headbands, and shouting, but a great alternative to typical fitness centers.  Its a proper gym, really nice benefit for guests to use.  

I liked the hotel.  wold I stay there again?  I think I would.",4,2014,11,19
125,Savoy beware,"We recently stayed for two nights at St Martins Lane Hotel London for my girlfriends birthday and have to say they have really surpassed our expectations and left us with an extremely memorable weekend.

We normally stay at some of the more classic and well known 5* hotels in London but this stay was superb and they have really grown on us. We have had some poor experiences at other hotels and decided to try something different. 

This hotel is modern, colourful and footsteps away from everything you need.

The rooms are beautiful, meticulously clean and modern. I would suggest upgrading to a larger room as the bathroom and additional spaces are great for lounging in on a cold rainy afternoon like we experienced. We stayed on the first floor and couldn't hear a pin drop outside. Our room had a TV that elevates out of the end of the bed which was a nice feature when you have a lie in.

Bathroom fixtures are superb, the shower has a big fat head and the power is like a draft through the euro tunnel. Bath easily fits two people in.

The breakfast was one of the best we've had in a hotel, really good food. The toast actually came hot to the room which almost never happens in a hotel. Also which I think it is a clever idea to have such a variety of times to order breakfast in your room, you can pretty much order up to noon if you want to lie in to catch up on sleep without missing a decent breakfast.

The staff at St. Martins Lane have a clear understanding of what excellent customer service is and are exemplary to their industry. They all seem genuinely happy to work there and If they keep this level of satisfaction up they will become one of the leading hotels in London. Far too often hotel chains cannot see the bigger picture and allow customers to leave upset over tiny things, I just can't imagine the staff here would allow that. We would stay here again without hesitation.

We arrived by car, and parked in the basement of the hotel. It was ¬£40 per 24 hours and the staff brought all our luggage in for us and also on checkout they moved all our luggage from our room into the car neatly without hardly asking, nothing was too much trouble for them.

My advice to you is to give this hotel a try, you will enjoy it and if its a special occasion and want to impress you partner book a table at Clos Maggiore, a nearby restaurant. You won't go far wrong.",5,2014,11,18
125,A Birthday to Remember,"I booked this fab hotel after being impressed with the cool interiors and restaurant menu but also I was very influenced by the great reviews on TripAdvisor.
As it was a birthday surprise for my partner I emailed Nicole and she went out of her way to ensure we had a memorable stay.
The staff are all hugely helpful and friendly and from being looked after once we drove up to the service at reception to the attentive service in the bar and restaurant we could not fault it.
The bedroom was calm and we loved the lighting.
We will definitely be back and I would recommend this wonderful hotel for those who are looking for something a little quirky and not the usual traditional decor and dining.
Thank you to all who helped make our stay just brilliant.",5,2014,11,18
125,everytime in London!,"It's quite expensive one, but it it really worth to stay here. I'm always here because of business trip so from my point of view is located very well, just next to Leicester Square, 2 min walk from National Galery and in the middle of nice shopping area. I love design of the the rooms! It's modern, classy, the bed is really comfy. The only thing I don't really understand is noise of closing doors - it starts early morning and it's annoying. Restaurant in this hotel is high recomended however dishes are suprisingly big!",5,2014,11,18
125,Half Term and 50th Birthday 2014,"This hotel is just great. I had booked a standard double double room for 3 of us but was upgraded to a loft double queen queen, which was absolutely enormous with acres of space. We even had champagne and cake delivered to our room compliments of the hotel. The location is great, just a couple of minutes walk to Covent Garden. All the staff we encountered were very courteous and knowledgeable. The mood lighting in the room was very innovative. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you Nicole and all the staff.",5,2014,11,16
125,Beautiful decor and very friendly staff,"Just was visiting London from Canada for a work event and stayed at this boutique-like hotel. The design is beautiful with gold tooth stools and throws on the chairs with candles at night, almost magical. The door men were amazing for directions and almost going out of their way to accommodate us, specifically Amit as well as another guy I think his name was Andrew. Also I hadn't gotten their names but the girls at the front were lovely. All around fantastic experience,  thankyou :). ",5,2014,11,16
125,"Excellent Location, Small but Adequate Rooms","The hotel is located in Covent Garden, just a short walk to the Covent Garden Market and Trafalgar Square, as well as the Leicester Square tube.  The neighborhood is very lively and busy at night, with the theatres and restaurants being the main reasons.  It is also a charming neighborhood.  The hotel itself is very modern.  The room we had was very small, but it was big enough for its purpose (sleeping).  The beds are not the best and are also small.  Our room was clean and the price was very good.  They also let me check in early after my red-eye flight.",4,2014,11,15
125,Style should be less important than comfort and safety,"Great location in the theatre district, lovely and helpful staff, attractive rooms with a boutique style front to back (loved the chrome toggle light switches). They were able to accommodate an early check in (which we greatly appreciated even though it wasn't arranged in advance).  Concierge was very helpful too.  Rooms were very clean.

Detractors keeping us from giving a higher rating include:
- excited to see the full size king bed, but the quality of the mattress was dismal.  A hotel room is first and foremost a place to sleep and should be built around a top quality mattress.  Always a loses a star in my book.
- rooms are serviced twice per day, and on the turn down service tea light candles were left burning in the bathroom.  Lovely ambience to come back to but incredibly unsafe to leave an open flame burning in an unattended room.  Has to lose a star for this too.
- arrived on foot and the hotel is completely unmarked from the street.  Not a building number, a name or anything to indicate it is a hotel.  From the street it could be a low rise office building.  Walked past it twice, eventually went in to ask directions and (surprise!) it was our hotel.  I can forgive this, I assumed they were going for a low key statement.

Lot's to explore in the area.  We've never been before and loved it.  Think Las Vegas and Times Square rolled into one with everything within easy walking distance and all of London beyond to explore.",3,2014,11,14
125,Great staff,The hotel is only a few minutes walking distance from Leicester Square. It might not be everybodys taste with the modern style but I think it is very nice for a change. Besides London being traditional it is also modern and fancy. A great asset is the team. Very friendly and helpful staff members in all areas. I like the light settings in the room. And when you come back in the evening to the room and you see the small candle in the bathroom it feels like home. Keep up the good work. Till next time.,5,2014,11,13
125,Solid Choice.,"I am from LA and this Hotel very much reminded me of The Mondrian. Modern, young and edgy. Great location and staff was super helpful and friendly. I did not have a chance to try the restaurant, which I hear is very good. Solid Choice.",4,2014,11,11
125,I always go back to this hotel,"As a hotelier I usually like to stay at different hotels when visiting a city, yet after spending time looking at which London hotel I should visit, I always find myself booking St Martins Lane.

The hotel exudes understated elegance and hidden comforts that you take for granted. 

We arrived by car and were met outside the hotel where our car was valet parked in the car park, reception were very welcoming and efficient. Our rooms were perfectly cleaned and everything worked inside the room. Zero noise from outside and neighbouring rooms. Toiletries are of very high quality. I do not say this lightly, the bed are the most comfortable of any hotel I have stayed in. 

Another perfect stay and this is part was due to Nicole, Guest Relations Manager who provided outstanding customer service and planning and preparing our special visit. 

I look forward to staying again.",5,2014,11,11
125,2nd chance : they won!,"After having months ago a bad experience in this hotel, i decided to give this amazing looking hotel a second chance as everybody deserves that. 
Thanks to lovely Nicole, guest experience manager, she succeeded my needs and expectations more then 100% !
From having a very very early check-in (thank god!) to a nice upgrade....perfect !

From the moment you enter the lobby you can tell this is a very quirky, fashionable hotel which suits me a lot. As i need a lot of rest, the rooms with their very design-ish white look is perfect with cute and funky little extra's. The only thing that could be better, is when entering the hotel that their should be someone standing ready to take your luggage and welcome you with a big smile like you have at other 5 star deluxe hotels. Because everything starts with a first impression !

But this ltitle thing didn't bothered me at all. I had a wonderfull stay this time.
I can't thank mrs Nicole enough for helping me making the best stay, as i am dealing with issues with my health, you go girl !

So after all, giving it a 2nd chance they proved they are the best and they won...
As i will be returning here very soon !

Thank you St martins lane xx",5,2014,11,09
125,"Sharp, modern, slightly quirky.","Stayed here as a bit of a ""Lucky dip"". as you can tell from the photos the hotel is very modern and somewhat minimalist in its decor which is not my usual style but it is done well and I enjoyed my stay. There did not seem to be any way of getting to or from my first floor room without using the lift (I generally dislike able-bodied people who use the lift to descend one floor but there seemed no alternative here). The room was reasonably sized though not huge. There was a rather odd carved wood stool in the room, looked as though it may have been African, which was somewhat at odds with the minimalist decor, but it proved handy as a bedside table. The TV exuded a blue aura which was quite disconcerting at night but I could not find any button to turn it off so ended up having to unplug it at the wall (Not as easy as it sounds!). The bathroom was also sharp and cool, but there was no bath, only a shower. This does not bother me but if you are passionate about baths then it could be a factor. WiFi is complimentary and of a reasonable speed. Breakfast was outstanding. Delicious buffet selection and a good a la carte hot breakfast (Not a hot buffet with tired dried out bacon and eggs. Good). My room itself was rather noisy, getting quite a lot of ambient noise from the street below, but this is a hazard of most London Hotels, but i wonder if the rooms could be a bit better soundproofed? Overall a very nice hotel and I would go there again",4,2014,11,09
125,Fantastic hotel!!,"This hotel is amazing! We stayed here in September for a special occasion and have not stopped talking about it since! The staff at this hotel go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable. Our room was upgraded, we had a free bottle of wine and cake delivered to our room and in the bar we received free drinks. The staff greeted you by name and wished my partner happy birthday. We had breakfast delivered to our room in the morning which was delicious. We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again! Thank you to all of the staff who made our stay extra special. ",5,2014,11,09
125,Can't beat the location,"Stayed here on business recently. Room was decent sized, although depending on location you might get a bit of street noise in the morning. Wifi was decent enough to work from the hotel. There are an abundance of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

One thing lacking to me is storage - the room I was in had very little room to hang clothing and no chests - something to consider if you a longer stay.

Housekeeping did a great job making up the rooms and really paid attention to detail.",4,2014,11,08
125,30th Birthday celebrations,"We stayed at this hotel last week. My husband emailed ahead of us staying there, and upon arrival we were greeted lovely, and were upgraded! 
The room was amazing. The bed was devine, the towels felt of beautiful quality. I had a bottle of chilled Proseco and cake in my room also, not forgetting the fresh rose petals scattered everywhere!!!! The shower in our room was the most power shower i have ever used.The little touches made it all extra special!
The room was extremely quiet despite being so centrally located in london. It was lovely and warm too. The pillows and duvets were of excellent quality.
We went to watch the Lion King that evening and had a meal out. We didn't have breakfast the next day at the hotel, but check out time was 12pm, which was plenty of time to chill in the morn, and we didn't feel rushed. The staff were extremely helpful with suggesting how to get to certain places the next day. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in this centrally located, clean, friendly hotel again. Thank you for making our time so special!",5,2014,11,06

125,Great Staff made our visit a real pleasure!!!,"Stayed at this hotel on the 22nd October the staff could not have been more helpful.  We arrived around midday and dropped our bags at the hotel we then went to a matinee and came back at around 17:30 to check in.  The staff were really accommodating nothing as too much trouble.

The rooms were great and with complimentary drinks from Gabor the cocktail bar beckoned and again the staff experience with Vinnie really made a memorable evening.

125,"Very nice hotel, in Covent Garden","Nice hotel in St Martins Lane. 
Excellent room, breakfast, restaurant, bar, very good location, quality and most important, good service. The staff on reception are friendly.
Covent Garden - the best area in London:-)",4,2014,11,04
125,A real wow on St Martins Lane,"Just back from a 2 night opera break to London and it wasn't just the shows that had the wow factor.

The St Martins Lane Hotel is perfectly situated, next door to the Coliseum, opposite the Duke of York Theatre and in sight of the Noel Coward Theatre. It is also a 2 minute walk to Trafalgar Square and 5 mins to Covent Garden Market and surrounded by bars and restaurants. So if you are in London to enjoy the West End this hotel will be ideal.

As other reviewers have said the design of the hotel is cutting edge, inside the discreet entrance is a large open plan reception with designer furniture, superb lighting and access to the restaurant and a bar. The bar is unusual, long and narrow and very dark, it gets busy in the evening and has a real buzz. Despite the cool setting the staff are extremely friendly and work hard to recall things about you to create that personal touch.

We stayed in one of the newly refurbished superior rooms on the 4th floor. Overlooking St Martins Lane with floor to ceiling windows the style was sparse and bright with sharp white furniture and bedding. With the best stocked mini bar I've encountered and a TV complete with a good set of sky channels it was a great a space to relax in. My only improvement would have been to make the blinds adjustable as the curtains did let some light in at the top.

The bathroom was simply superb, spacious with separate glass cubicles for the shower and toilet and top quality sink and bath. The toiletries were well selected and the shower had great water pressure. With plenty of wardrobe space and a bespoke lighting system that allows you to personalise the room; it stands out as one of the best hotel rooms we have stayed in.

A great stay and I am already booking my next visit!",5,2014,11,03
125,Wowee simply amazing,"We stayed in St Martns Lane hotel for 3 amazing nights. From the moment we walked into the hotel unitl the moment we left the staff were superb. The doorman who assisted us time and time again throughout our stay was so polite, helpful and friendly and the young lady Beth who assisted us for breakfast was so awesome she made our day. Thank you Beth. 
Our reservation was not made correctly by our travel agent but that didn't matter they accomodated us so well. Our original room had quite noisy neighbours who arived home at 3AM to crank up the Ipod unitl 5.30. Easily fixed the next morning as we were shifted to the 6th floor to an even better room. The hotel is located in the theartre district and only a two minute walk to the main entertainment hub of London. Can't wait to get back to London and this is the only place we will stay. Wowee and thank you!!!",5,2014,11,03
125,The Only London Hotel I'll Now Ever Use..,"For me, this is the best hotel in London for location, quality and most importantly, service.
The staff on reception are so friendly and beat any other 5 star hotels that I've stayed in the past (W Hotel was the worst!).",5,2014,11,01
125,"Great location, edgy, upscale","Our loft room with a rooftop view of London was perfect for our 3 day visit which included two Westend theatres very near the hotel.  

Location

The location is central to the theatre district so no wait for a cab or traffic delays, just a short stroll to arrive just before the curtain‚Äôs up.  Plenty of restaurants and pubs everywhere so again no need to chance the London traffic.

The Room

London hotel rooms are very small, possibly smaller than standard rooms in New York.  We upgraded to a loft room so we had plenty of space.  

The bedroom was very bright in our corner room with floor to ceiling windows. The d√©cor, very simple and upscale.  Surprisingly there is no alarm clock or clock of any kind. This was a problem for us as in the dark of night I couldn‚Äôt read my watch and being from a different time zone wasn‚Äôt sure if it was still the middle of the night. This omission makes no sense for a hotel also catering to guests from outside European time zones. The windows have blinds which can‚Äôt be adjusted but the curtains are fine to blackout the light.  

Storage was adequate although the closet was small and there were no bureaus.  Instead there is open shelving which works well as you can then see the clothes you are looking for. 

The bathroom was large with separate shower stall and a large bathtub, but with just a single stylish sink and not a lot of shelf space.  Function gave way to form as there is no sink stopper, very annoying. The water volume in the shower was excellent, no North American ‚Äúwater police‚Äù dictating a light spray to save the earth.  

The Lobby

Very stylish, contemporary.  The lobby seating is fanciful with whimsical toadstool style or bench seating but very few comfortable chairs.  The comfortable chairs are here and there but not in one place so two people can‚Äôt both sit in comfort whilst waiting for a guest or car.  This could be easily remedied by the hotel which should provide a couple of sofas  - the design appearance doesn‚Äôt have to be destroyed. 

The bar and restaurant open into the lobby.  The bar is buzzy.  We had an excellent breakfast in the restaurant but passed on the buffet so can‚Äôt comment on that.  We didn‚Äôt dine there so again no comment. 

The Service

The staff were unfailingly friendly and willing.  Obviously management have got it right with staffing and staff relations.

Wi Fi is included but the log-on is annoying and is required time and time again.  This needs to be addressed.

The Gym

An excellent public gym is immediately next door and is available at no additional charge to hotel guests.  No pool, but an enormous variety of equipment. 

Details

The low lighting in the corridors and in the elevator create a subdued atmosphere, overall a quieting effect.

Amazingly there is no signage at the hotel entrance, so tell the cab driver to take you to #45 St Martins‚Äôs Lane. Look for it right next to the enormous Gymbox sign.",4,2014,10,29
125,Great stay,fantastic hotel. Stayed for a week the staff is fantastic. Sam and the boys in the front were top notch any thing you need Sam and his boys will take care of it. Thanks Sam see you soon as we get back to London. Definitely stay here. 5 minute walk to Covent Gardens 5 minute walk to soho. ,5,2014,10,27
125,Hit all the right spots.,"With room views voted by Conde Nast as some of the best in the world, Sunday night/Monday morning in St Martins Lane was quality. 
The rooms are fresh and spacious with amazingly comfortable beds. Breakfast was wonderful - they serve an amazing Eggs Benedict. 
The staff were very attentive, remembering our name whenever we had contact and offering lots of advice. 
A stay at this hotel is definitely a must if you get the chance.

",5,2014,10,27
125,Fantastic,"A great hotel for those who enjoy modern luxe- rooms full of gadgets, fun lighting and chic, modern furniture. Have stayed in both basic rooms and larger suites- both are immaculate and despite being very modern are very comfortable. A younger clientele than many of the older hotels, and this is reflected in the vibrant ""cool"" feel of the place. Absolutely love the fusion restaurant attached. Staff were lovely- very complimentary and service is excellent. Great location too.",5,2014,10,23
125,Couldn't ask for more.,"Once again another fantastic stay...... this time for a personal stay. We had a fantastic stay, my partner loved his bday present. And we couldn't have celebrated as well without the help of Nicole. Thanks again. ",5,2014,10,22
125,Best hotel ever,"My daughter booked this hotel for our time in London. From the man opening the door for you right through to the lady who cleans your room ( which was immaculate and funky) the staff are amazing. We have eaten in the restaurant before which was great so didn't  do so this time, but we did go to the light bar located in the lobby and really could not  have been looked after better had we been royalty. A very big thanks must go to Nicole who e mailed my daughter every day to see if she could assist in any way and when she found out it was my birthday she went out of her way to accommodate any bookings we required. Can't wait to go back, and it is very well placed for lots of sightseeing, restaurants, bars and theatres. Regent street is more than walkable and Oxford street just beyond.

Anyone who has ever read my reviews knows that the three things I look for are Location, Cleanliness and value. And although the St.Martin is not cheap by any standard it makes up for that in overall value. You're in the heart of it all. On top of that, the staff and the bar, restaurant are all excellent as well. Never got to use the gym but was told that that also was very good. I would recommend the St.Martin to anyone.....check it out on the map to see location.  Last but not least....the room, was well laid out and the bathroom was huge by euro standards.

125,It's the little things!,Lovely 3 night stay including breakfast. Breakfast was fab! Food great. Breakfast staff lovely. Remembering my name and how I took my coffee. Nice little touch which makes your stay a bit more personal. Didn't get to sample the lunch or dinner menu but it looks delicious and I heard great reviews from others. I did sample the cocktails which are a bit pricier than your average cocktail but they're a real treat and much nicer than a standard cocktail so well worth it! The bar staff were lovely also. One girl in particular whose name I didn't get had an infectious cheeriness and was great with me and my group! The bar staff gave great recommendations for cocktails based on what we liked. Rooms although small are very comfortable and new looking. Everything very clean and white. Cool lighting features. Bathroom lovely with a great shower. Reception staff very helpful with any queries I had and offered great assistance when I needed it. Great location in the heart of London. Ideal! Would love to stay again.

It was one of my best experiences traveling abroad.  I will be recommending this hotel to everyone I know who will be traveling to London.

Our room was beautiful, spacious and very clean.  Loved the water pressure for showering and lighting was great.  Housekeeping response time was excellent for anything we needed.  

The hotel was within walking distance of many things we chose to visit and your recommendations were spot on.  

Both our dinner and breakfast at the restaurant (Asia de Cuba) were very good.  

We loved it!  Thank you to all of your staff.",5,2014,09,27
125,"Great location, friendly staff","This is not my usual choice of London hotel but I was impressed. It's slightly tricky to find, with no obvious signage (and it doesn't look much like a hotel). The reception staff were very friendly and my room was spacious and comfortable. You need to get used to having glass walls.  I didn't eat there so can't comment on the food.  The decor is very contemporary but in a slightly quirky way.  Little touches like the USB charging ports by the bed were useful.   It is very central and would be a great base for sightseeing. ",4,2014,09,26
125,hotel prefers style over substance,"Hotel is nice enough, but there are telling indications: there are no signs on the outside of the hotel, not even a street number, so if you arrive on foot you have to work out that this must be the place you seek (not great if you are pulling a suitcase). The lobby (the only 'lounge') is useless, consisting of artfully spaces chairs and little golden stools; there is nowhere you could sit comfortably to have a chat. Room numbers are similarly hard to find (in the carpets in faded colors). The breakfast was expensive and looked meager; happily there are good coffee shops nearby.  Overall, for the price, you can do much better.",3,2014,09,23
125,"Only if you're ""hip""","The good
- Lovely bath products / room
- AMAZING food - Asia de Cuba restaurant / conference food. The doughnuts are the 2nd best doughnuts I have eaten in the world and I eat a lot of doughnuts.  Also I generally don't like veggies but made me gobble it up, especially that salad with banana in it. Just fantastic all around. 
- The staff! They SMILE and remember your name and your preferences!
- Location - in the middle of everything - took lots of fantastic walks to Trafalgar Square and beyond, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus etc.

The bad
- NO SIGN - lugged suitcases from Joburg and walked up and down the street before I just decided to try to random building with the green lights coming out of up. Upon inquiry I was told ""the people who need to know the hotel exists, do - i.e., hip people know"".  My friend who is a rapper stopped by later that week and LOVED the concept so I am probably just out of touch.
- Ditto on freakishly illuminated room numbers at the bottom of the corridors
- Lobby art. Wow.
- My room was a teeny bit small but saw another room which was just marvellous so depends on your pocket obviously.

The ugly 
- None, really enjoyed my stay.

Would definitely come on business, friends or with my husband but would leave the kids at home.",4,2014,09,22
125,Great hotel,I've stayed at this hotel quite a lot and this visit was as great as always. Stayed in the deluxe King with private patio which was brilliant. Spacious room and lovely bed linen and pillows. Had the tasting menu at Asia de Cuba which was nice. Would always recommend this hotel. I've booked The Mondrian in December just out of curiosity but the location I know won't match St Martins Lane. Great hotel and great staff.,5,2014,09,21
125,Great Location and lovely staff,Have stayed at this hotel a few times now. It has a great location at covent garden and close to some phenomenal entertainment and dining. The rooms are tasteful and spotless. The staff is very friendly and helpful.,4,2014,09,20
125,"A ""cool"" Place to Stay for Leisure or Business","I stayed at the St. Martin while joining my husband on a business trip.  I was a little shocked when we arrived to this London Hotel as all of my other stays in London have been in more traditional elegant hotels.  The St. Martin is very modern and simply decorated but still has a ""Wow Factor.""

This hotel was recommended to him by a business associate as it is walking distance from his business.  It is actually a well situated hotel being down the street from Trafalgar Square and walking distance to Regent Street which is Shopping and Restaurant central!

We were upgraded to a top floor room and had a nice view of the city.  Room service was timely and the food was high quality.  Housekeeping did a great job keeping up our room and the door man was very effective in getting us a cab whenever we needed it.  I feel that for the service you get and the quality of the rooms that this is a very reasonably priced hotel.  My husband has decided that this is the hotel of choice for our next visit to London.",5,2014,09,18
125,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for a few nights on business - booked here as couldn't get in to Radisson Blu Mercer St but in future think I would chose St Martins Lane. Rooms are bigger than Mercer St with more natural light. Excellent location, great rooms. Nice decor, great bathroom. Would highly recommend it.",5,2014,09,14
125,Modern and chic,"Awesome chic rooms. Clean rooms, beautiful bathroom. Not much of a view but still loved it. Love the bar area and so close to everything.

The entrance is so beautiful and so are the rooms. 

Would Defo come here again. Visited 2 nights before with a partner ",5,2014,09,13
125,Fantastic as always,"Big fan of this group of hotels. If your after a hotel that delivers on food, great drinks, perfect location & that little extra, then look no further. Always a warm welcome with the best lobby in London ",5,2014,09,12
125,Fantastic friendly service...wonderful stay,"Coming from the land of the friendly people (Ireland), it means a lot when I say this was wonderful always friendly service, ready to go beyond, fantastic attitude. This was across the board from the front desk, the restaurant, room service, etc. 

Superb location it's so central. 

Rooms are smallish but lovely and bright, funky (light switches are interesting), great towels, good feel to them. 

The gym next door is good, even a boxing ring, up to date great equipment.  

Asia de Cuba the restaurant is lovely - we ate in a private room but the food was from the main restaurant and divine. 

All in all a great stay. No complaints. ",5,2014,09,12
125,Wow An Amazing stay!,"I booked St Martins Lane Hotel as a surprise for my husband and Im so glad I did. The hotel is in perfect location between Leicester sq and covent garden. 
We checked in, the lobby area is bright modern and funky and the staff are really welcoming and so friendly. Our room was absolutely stunning, we had been upgraded! The features in the room were amazing and very modern. The bathroom was faultless with a sperate shower and huge bath, candles were lit pure bliss! The bed was one of the comfiest i have slept on, ever. 
We went to the bar late and after dinner, it had a great vibe yet chilled again in keeping with the rest of the hotel so very modern the barman was really friendly and made great cocktails. We had breakfast in the room it was delicious, not a negative word to say about it at all. 
I have been lucky enough to stay at some really lovely hotels around the world, especially in london including the Savoy, claridges, Dorchester and the Ritz. This hotel is my new favourite because of the staff and the location and they truly made our stay so so memorable, so i thank them implicitly for that. With 2 small children time away is precious. This excelled any expectations I had, we will 100% be back. Thankyou so much Nicole for everything i'm counting down the days until we return. 
You wont be disappointed if you book to stay here.",5,2014,09,08
125,40th Birthday Celebrations,"I have not a single bad word to say about St Martins Lane hotel. I have stayed several times over the years and it never ever fails to disappoint. The staff were, as always, amazingly attentive and extremely friendly. We received such a warm and bright welcome. Our room was incredible and my husbands 40th birthday was acknowledged with a wonderful card and cake in our room. So wonderful! Thank you to all at the hotel and we can't wait to come back!!!!!! A special thank you to Joey the concierge!",5,2014,09,04
125,Heaven in a hotel!,"Can not rave enough about this hotel.  Just perfect! Location is so fantastic for covent garden and west end theatres. Hotel is gorgeous. Made our wedding anniversary extra special with free upgrade, complimentary bottle of wine on ice waiting for us in the room and even sprinkled rose petals everywhere and lit candles for us. Staff were simply wonderful especially Nicole! We will be back! Thanks for treating us like royalty xxx",5,2014,09,03
125,"Sophisticated, calm & clean","Have stayed here a few times with partner and also with children. Never disappointed.

Also in the hub of things, but rooms are quiet.",5,2014,09,03
125,I've stayed here at least 5 times,"Hi!

I've stayed at this wonderful hotel at least 5 times - but not in a row.

Modern and a little bit trendy, wonderful service, tastes great and perfectly located.  Close to everything, which is a real geographical oddity.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone, well, except you.",5,2014,09,02
125,Excellent service,"We came to London for a birthday treat this hotel is very stylish modern and cosy. Made to feel spoilt by excellent desk staff and cater to your needs very well. We were upgraded and had a very special welcome and bottle of wine waiting in our room. Breakfast was fantastic and the bar is unique,  it has a gym which if we had time would have used. Close to all the main West end entertainment.  Definitely stay again! ",5,2014,08,31
125,"Stunning service, spectacular rooms, amazing stay!","We choose to go back to St Martins Lane Hotel for our 10th Wedding Anniversary as we had spent our mini moon there. I contacted Nicole Messham (guest relations manager)to ask if there was anything the hotel would recommend to make it a little more special. Nicole sent an email with an upgrade to a garden patio room (from a king ) and also a complimentary bottle of wine in our room- fantastic! When we arrived we opted for the valet parking option and was greeted by a very friendly chap. We had arrived at 09:45 so didn't expect our room to be ready but it was and they had also upgraded us even more to a suite! The room was beautiful with an amazing bath, crisp fresh linen and a great view. Within 10 minutes they had called the room to ask if we were happy and if the concierge could help with any recommendations. We then went out for the day when we returned the wine was in our room with a beautiful hand written note congratulating us. When leaving this morning they took our luggage to our car and couldn't of been more accommodating. Fantastic service that a lot of 5 star hotels could learn from. We will definitely return. ",5,2014,08,31
125,Superb hotel,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a 4 night London break. Hotel is perfectly located for shows, shopping and food. Staff were fantastic. Hotel was trendy clean and sophisticated. Rooms were spacious and well equipt with technology like Bluetooth connectivity and USB charging points. Only thing is the bar and restaraunt were quite pricey but plenty of options for breakfast on St Martins lane.  Would recommend to anybody. ",5,2014,08,30
125,Wow!! Awesome slick hotel,"Only booked in for a night and wish we could have stayed longer. 
Very modern and cool. We had new room - room 110, that had an OUTDOOR terrace. Truly amazing. 

Loved the slick modern design & details. 
Great room layout and perfect use of LED lighting. And yes you can change the colours! 

If you like boutique, stylish and modern you will enjoy! 

We chose this hotel due to its central location and fantastic bar to catch up with friends. It exceeded our expectations. 

The staff were great and we really appreciated the room upgrade upon arrival! 

",5,2014,08,29
125,Not a five star,"If you don't like modern hotels then avoid. Cold uninviting lobby, tiny standard rooms with no bath. After a long day of walking and exploring couldn't properly relax as no bath or jacuzzi on the premises. Overpriced both hotel and food. For breakfast go next door or Browns across the road, much cheaper. Can't recommend it I'm afraid.",3,2014,08,28
125,wonderful service,"stayed in this hotel for one night this summer. Nicole Messham in guest services responded to my email inquiry about whether the room would accommodate a trundle bed for my son by giving us an upgrade to a wonderful corner room, spacious with incredible views and a big bathtub. comfortable, quiet, all we could hope for. Will definitely be staying here again. Thanks to Nicole & all at the hotel for a memorable stay.",5,2014,08,28
125,Perrrrrrrrfect weekend!,"I can't fault the St Martins Lane Hotel. Before we even arrived Nicole was looking after us by email and when we did get to London we were greeted and looked after by her and her lovely, friendly, polite team in just the same fantastic way. They seem to have the ability to make every guest feel like royalty and it started our weekend off just perfectly. We were there for our anniversary and we upgraded on arrival which was a real treat, Nicole sent up chocolate covered strawberries with a really sweet note, we were so touched. Our room (number 303) was just divine!! It was modern, bright, spacious, spotless and had the most amazing plush bathroom and enormous wardrobe! There were two full length mirrors which was fab for getting ready. The hotel really think of everything, there was a full sized ironing board with fab iron, a full size high-power hair dryer, a safe, luxurious dressing gowns,cozy slippers and even an umbrella and extension lead! We rang down for the complimentary tea and coffee facilities and it arrived at our room 5 mins later. The mini bar was unbelievable, it had everything you could wish for and there was even his and hers razors in the bathroom which you could buy if you'd forgotten yours. The bathroom products were top class, really fresh and fruity, I had both a bath and a shower both days because they were so nice! I was even tempted to buy the gift pack they have for purchase but maybe next time! The bath was huge and the shower was amazing, really powerful and hot immediately! The room was fun and techy, with USB plugs next to the bed and desk and lighting you can change to your liking, the air con wasn't noisy like in most hotels and adjusted really simply. The bar downstairs was really funky just like the rest of the hotel, there was so much to look at and everywhere you go in the hotel the staff are friendly. I really could go on and on, I haven't got a single bad word to say it was better than I even expected it to be and we will definitely be back soon! Thank you Nicole and everyone else at The St Martins Lane from Savka and Phil",5,2014,08,27
125,Best Stay Eveer,"My husband travels throughout UK and Europe with his job and has stayed in many hotels in his life, as have I, but we have just come home from a stay in St. Martins Lane London Hotel for our wedding anniversary.  It just the best experience we have ever had in a hotel.  We were welcomed and found ALL staff to be friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  The hotel is boutique style and the rooms are lovely.   The hotel is brilliantly situated in theatre land, so lots going on and also near many attractions.  We had such a wonderful stay we have booked to go back for my husbands birthday.  Can't wait.",5,2014,08,26
125,Anniversary weekend ,"Amazing hotel ! Friendly professional staff ! Room was out of this world - if I could of brought the entire room home I would of ! 

Stayed here for our anniversary , received complementary drinks as our room was 10 mins late being ready , but well worth the wait ! Stunning ! 

After an evening out we went back to the bar , again fab staff and a great atmosphere 

Breakfast , would recommend paying for the breakfast package just what was needed after a night of champagne and cocktails .

Thank you , hopefully we will be back soon ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2014,08,25
125,"Incredible staff, wonderful Hotel, outstanding location","Jeez, there is no way I could write a review that could do St Martins Lane Hotel justice ... but I'll try.

It was my wife & my wedding anniversary and we booked a 2 night stay here after having previously stayed in their Sanderson Hotel.  I casually mentioned that it was our anniversary and was then taken on a whirlwind arrangement.  Fabio, Martin and then Nicole (especially Nicole) promised to make our stay memorable ... crikey, they did that alright!

We turned up and couldn't find the NCP park nearby.  One of the Greeters said ""No problem, would you like me to valet park for you?"".  We showed up way too early but the Reception team warmly greeted us, congratulated us for the anniversary (nice touch that they were made aware) and said they could securely take our bags & iPads and will call us when our room was ready.

We did get a call a few hours later but we were mooching around town and not in a rush to return.  When we did eventually check in, we were once again congratulated and told we had been upgraded, free of charge, and would love the room.

What a room!  It was so incredible I had to 'phone down to reception to thank them.  You'll see from our photos that the whole exterior wall was made of windows, floor to ceiling.  We could see the London Eye, National Opera House, The Shard and a totally unobstructed view across the town.  It was so good we just didn't want to leave.  Nicole had even added rose petals on the bed, across the bath, had tea candles lit for our arrival and was even going to leave a bottle of wine for us but learning we are non-drinkers, Nicole arranged for strawberries dipped in chocolate!

This was such a fantastic stay, in a fantastic hotel run by fantastic people ... I actually wondered if I should even write this review so I can try and keep it a secret but on reflection, their outstanding care and attention has to be acknowledged.

The Hotel is crazily trendy but you don't have to get involved in the bars or restaurants if you don't want as they are situated towards the rear.  At no stage do you feel intimidated by the trendiness ... we loved the interior.

Do yourself a favour and have a stay here.  We've stayed in many Hotels over the years and I honestly have to say St Martins Lane could possibly be the best stay we have ever experienced.

Thank you (especially Nicole) for making this an incredible short break.

We cannot thank the staff anywhere near enough.",5,2014,08,25
125,Wonderful!!!,"We had a fantastic stay at the St.Martins Lane Hotel. 
The staff are excellent and really friendly.As soon as we arrived Nicole personally introduced herself and checked us in.
Wonderful room and wonderful breakfast could not fault anything.
Our favourite London hotel, we cannot wait to return again and will be recommending this hotel to all our family and friends.
Thank you to Nicole Messingham who ensured our break was top notch.",5,2014,08,25
125,Absolutley amazing hotel and staff.,"We stayed here for a birthday treat and could not fault the hotel. The rooms are lovely and bright, and extremley clean. The bathroom in the superior rooms is lovely and feels more like a spa. The mood lighting sets a nice atmosphere and brightens up the room at night. The staff in this hotel are what make it really stand out, we recieved some of the best customer service we have ever had. A special thanks to Nicole who ensured I had a great birthday and was happy to help with anything we needed big or small, we will be back soon.",5,2014,08,23
125,noisy party all night,"Yes, its has a beautiful interesting decor. Both in the common areas and in the rooms. And in the restaurant where we had a great breakfast. It is very sexy how you can control the atmosphere by changing the colors of your white bed with a rainbow lights. Yet they had such a loud music till late at night, the hotel felt like a night club, it was hard to sleep. 
The location is of course perfect.",4,2014,08,22
125,Excellent customer service,"All the staff were very helpful and seemed genuinely interested in what we were doing, giving advice on what to do with our 8 year old during our stay in London. The room was very modern and comfortable. My daughter loved trying all the different style chairs in the lobby.",5,2014,08,20
125,Lovely First Anniversary Stay,"We had a lovely stay at St Martin Lane Hotel. Lovely Nicole Messham really spoilt us when celebrating our first wedding anniversary with complimentary welcome drinks, romantic rose petals decor and lovely chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room after dinner.",5,2014,08,20
125,Fantastic,"I stayed here with work Last week, and recommend highly. I have stayed here before. And I love it that much I have rebooked for my partners birthday this weekend. With the help of Nicole enabling me to make it a very special day for him. 

I love the atmosphere, the rooms are fantastic and the customer service is as helpful as i have ever seen. i have spoken to all my friends about this hotel and how much I love it. It is now the only hotel I will stay in in London. Thank you x",5,2014,08,20
125,absolutely faultless,"the manager of this hotel should be so proud of his training and staff.  best receptionists, door staff etc i have ever had the pleasure to meet anywhere in the world.  hotel itself is totally faultless with some great touches - big working area in room, usb charging points everywhere, hdmi ports in wall, super quality bed linens, best shower i have ever had - i could go on and on.  even the turndown service was different - candles lit inside and out (we had a room with a private terrace which is definitely worth it), coffee making facilities delivered in two minutes at 6 am (not sure why they don't have in the room - perhaps a kettle would spoil the clean lines?)

cannot praise this hotel enough and for london I think is good value.  only sad part, have to leave after one night",5,2014,08,20
125,Fantastic,"Just stayed here for one night with my six year old daughter and it contributed massively to a wonderful trip to London. Firstly the location is ideal, not far to London Eye, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street etc etc. as for the hotel, I have stayed in a fair few and this is possibly the most comfortable. Lovely room, comfortable beds, sockets, switches, chargers, controls etc all in convenient places, silent air conditioning and clean. Absolutely brilliant stay with the lovely touch of notes for my daughter wishing her a great stay when we returned from a meal and the chocolate covered strawberries were very well received. It is people that makes things really memorable though and the staff were all so very helpful and friendly and made us feel very special. thank you. For quality and location think no further than St Martins Lane.",5,2014,08,19
125,"Excellent, literally close to everything","Stayed here for four nights, was really impressed by the room, everything was super clean, I got a room higher up in the floors (was on the sixth floor), so got a nice view as well.

Staff were very friendly, Ricardo in particular was really helpful, always had a smile on his face and in general lent a very personal feel to the place.

The only downside was the breakfast buffet, it was fine, a nice assortment of breads, fruits, stuff like that.. But for anything cooked like a proper English breakfast, eggs, etc. You'll need to order from the menu, I would have preferred to just have these available at the buffet.

As for location, it really is close to everything you'd want, Leicester Square is just around the corner, lots of museums and shops around, so no complaints. It was super easy to get around.",4,2014,08,19
125,We're going again,"Lovely bedrooms, great cocktail bar in a West End location. Likes the ability to change the colour of the lighting. Note to Housekeeping though, please include English Breakfast Tea with the tea/coffee making facilities! There's an amazing Indian restaurant nearby (ask the concierge for details).",5,2014,08,18
125,Excellent,"This is a really nice trendy hotel with a certain authenticity that the W Hotel just cannot match. All the staff were extremely friendly and obliging (particularly Debra on the reception) and the rooms really well thought out -- USB power plugs by the bed, convenient power plugs by a good sized desk, great free wifi, plenty of storage space, dead comfortable bed, curtains that keep out the light, brilliant turn down service that doesn't call too early when you are getting ready to go out. Breakfast was fantastic and the in hotel bar a nice trendy respite from the chaos of Leicester Square nearby! My only niggles were the in room entertainment system (Nevaya) kept on freezing; the free water limited to one tiny bottle per day (GBP5 from the mini bar...a bit excessive) and the online reservation system quoted prices exclusive of room tax which caught me a little by surprise when the final charge came in. But these are hardly show stoppers.",5,2014,08,17
125,Centre of Everything,"You will be in the 'Middle of London' by staying here. 1 minute walk to Leicester Square, The national gallery, the west end, The Ivy, brilliant shopping at your doorstep. You will not be disappointed with its location. Reception staff are friendly and very helpful.",5,2014,08,17
125,Very pleasantly surprised...,"I remember staying at the trendy (and sometimes snooty) St Martins Lane of the 90's and was afraid that, like the some other Ian Schrager properties, SML would feel stuck there.  But given the fitness minded group I was traveling with, we booked there for the GYMBOX access (and complimentary laundry service for fitness clothes!) a colleague had raved about and was very   pleasantly surprised.  Yes, the Saturday night scene is ""naf"" and the bar no longer exclusive but...the renovated rooms are well suited to biz travelers and stocked with very nice amenities. the concierge, bellman (ed! especially) and front desk staff were all very friendly and accommodating and the location is central, busy, with plenty of good places to eat and drink within walking distance (Polpo and Dishoom were hits with our crew)  And for those who like to workout on the road, an extensive GYMBOX schedule leaves you no excuses!",4,2014,08,14
125,Nice hotel,"I was there in July for a convention
Only One night : Perfect hotel, fantastic design and very nice people at the front desk (Deborah)
Our Rooms were full of atmosphere in the evening : Light effects, candlelight, ...
A lot of extra's in the room : Umbrella, 
Perfect central location in the heart of London 
Nice breakfast !!!
I will come again in the future

125,"Great people, great hotel, great location","I stay at St Martins Lane hotel every month and never get tired of it. The service is fantastic, the people are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are great.  the location is also the best London can offer, ricght in the centre, and walking distance to all the importnt places.",5,2014,08,14
125,Great newly renovated rooms,"I stayed for a week at St Martins Lane during my business trip in early Aug.  Was lucky to stay in one of the renovated rooms (I was on the 2nd floor), the new room functions well with a lot of USB charging points and comfy sitting to read and work, plus the new high-tech TV which you can play right from your iPad to your TV.  Beddings and shower pressure was great!  Only downside is the soundproofing from the hall way wasn't great and noise could be heard from time to time.",4,2014,08,14
125,Great modern hotel for a special family event,"For my daughters 18th Birthday we wanted a hotel close to the west end that was a bit special. St Martins Lane came up trumphs with a ""loft"" room with two double beds that was perfect for our family. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly but it was the stylish and modern  d√©cor that impressed most. The teenagers loved the big TV the fast WiFi and the multi coloured lights, the many USB charging points and the wonderful bathroom.

Thanks St Martin's Lane",5,2014,08,13
125,Favorite hotel in London,"I didn't know about this hotel until it was suggested through Founders Card. Got a great deal and was impressed from the minute I got there. Front desk was kind and quickly checked me in. Room was perfect, big and bright. Bathroom was the best hotel bathroom I've ever had in London. Breakfast in the restaurant was good, although could he a little pricey. (¬£3.50 for a cup of coffee). Location was also perfect. Two underground stops within a couple of blocks. Walking to Leicester Square, Soho, Bloomsbury and beyond. Definitely recommend. ",5,2014,08,09
125,"Excellent service, perfect location","I had booked a room for 3 People through Hotels.com, (which was confirmed) and was fairly upset as we arrived at the hotel, only to find out that there were no extra beds available in this hotel. Luckily, the fantastic staff at the hotel, sorted this out brilliantly, by giving us a complimentary Upgrade to two interconnecting deluxe-studios!! Amazing! 
For the rest of Our 4-night stay, the staff did everything in their Power to make us happy, and they succeded!! We got an excellent complimentary breakfast (which normally i quite expensive), and they were so friendly and helpful, that by the time we left the hotel, they almost felt like Family :-) Espcially Ahmet, the doorman, was amazing, being so helpful and friendly, also With my two teenage daughters. 
The hotel has a very unique design, which may not agree With everybody, but the standard of the rooms, the cleanliness and facilities are all superb!
I will definately stay at this hotel the NeXT time I'm in London!!!",5,2014,08,07
125,Love the garden room!,"There is just something about the rooms here, of all the great hotels I have been to I LOVE the layout of the room! It wasn't huge but it was bright and well planned with lots of storage areas in the bathroom for toiletries. We enjoyed an amazing mixed seafood salad and my girlfriend ordered the Thai salad and loved it. The service was great! It was a pleasure staying here!",5,2014,08,05
125,The staff make it,"I will not repeat the other good  reviews about the amazing location, rooms, design, etc. except to say that I agree with them.

But to me the thing that made, and nearly always does make, our stay stand out was the staff. I met three reception staff and they were all brilliant....they must have degree level qualifications in interpersonal skills!! Nicole was exceptional.

The bellmen were unstintingly willing to help and the concierge was very knowledgeable when asked.
Top job, management .....well done. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2014,08,05
125,"Friendly, welcoming and the best location","Just spent one night in this quirky, lovely hotel but wished it was longer. We received a very warm welcome from all staff we came into contact with. Our room was ready early and although quite small it had everything that was required with a large, very clean and well equipped bathroom.  The location is fabulous within easy walking distance of theatres, Coventry Garden, bars and restaurants.  Considering we were right in the heart of London's night  life on a busy summer Saturday night our room was peaceful and quiet and the amazingly comfortable bed made for a great nights sleep. I have stayed in many London hotels but this is definitely the best, I will be back.",5,2014,08,03
125,Another great London Morgans Hotel,"Having stayed at the Sanderson, I had high expectations for the St Martins Lane and I wasn't disappointed. 

We stayed in a room with a small private garden and the room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. If you enjoy a good shower then the one in our room at least could almost blow you off your feet! 

Staff were friendly and helpful and sent my wife a birthday slice of chocolate cake which was a nice touch. 

We didn't sample the bar or resturant as we had a busy day about town and my wife is pregnant. 

The location was very convenient  for theatre land and not too far from Oxford Street on foot if you want to head that way. 

Overall an excellent experience.",5,2014,07,31
125,My favourite hotel!,"My boyfriend and I travel quite a bit and this is by far our favourite hotel!  The room is faultless, quiet, warm and light filled by day - pitch black and very quiet by night.  The room we stayed in was on the fifth floor and had a great view through the rooftops.  The staff are extremely friendly and are made to feel at home.

Do yourself a favour and be sure to stay here..  will be our only hotel we'll stay in when we visit London.",5,2014,07,30
125,Fabulous Stay!,"We booked the Loft room for my partner's 50th birthday which was worth every penny, having views of the London Eye, the rooftops at night and the most enormous, comfortable bed!  The staff were really friendly and helpful, and we were thrilled to have a bottle of champagne delivered to the room courtesy of St Martins Lane with their birthday wishes.  A really special treat!  The only niggle was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which would have been very welcome.",5,2014,07,28
125,Fantastic stay,"One night stay was faultless and excellent value.  We took advantage of the summer in the city break and had champagne and a delicious breakfast included for ¬£199. We had a room upgrade which was fantastic, light, bright spacious room and large, immaculate bathroom.  Nicole on the front desk set the tone for all the staff we encountered - super friendly and professional.  Glad we chose to eat in the restaurant as well - went for the pre-theatre menu, which was delicious and served in a pleasant setting and very promptly.

125,A lovely place to be üéÄ,"My mum and I decided on a trip up to london from Guildford so we booked into St Martins. We arrived early, were upgraded and able to check in immediately. The staff were beyond friendly and extremally helpful. Our room was gorgeous and we had a very comfortable sleep. A lovely place to stay üéÄ",5,2014,07,27
125,Theatre Trip,"We were visiting London on a very special theatre trip. We arrived early but our room was ready and the staff were exceedingly friendly. They offered information on the area, restaurants etc. and when they were told the name of the restaurant we had booked for dinner, gave us recommendations on their favourite dishes on the menu. Our room was excellent with a very comfortable bed, great mood lighting and a very good and clean bathroom. The hotel is in theatre land and is in a very busy area but we were pleasantly surprised at its quietness. On a very hot day in London the air conditioning was very welcome. We will return when we need a good centrally located hotel with great service.",5,2014,07,25
125,Peace & Quiet & very large - Room 123,"This was my second stay here.  Gave it another try and checked into a redecorated room on back side of hotel.  It was really quiet with view of back street and overlooking garage entrance.  No earplugs needed.

Good:

For London the room was huge with kind size bed, bed side tables on both sides, big desk, empty fridge,   big bathroom with separate shower and tub.  Like extra sheves in bathroom - lots of room to put everything away.  

Excllent Air conditioning, a good thing because it was hottest day of year while I was there.  Requested kettle and tea services was brought to room at check in.  Room was ready early - good thing because plane arrived at 7AM at Heathrow.

Weird:  a duvet on bed suitable for blizzard conditions in middle of summer.  We asked that it be replaced with sheets/blanket and then it was fine.

Not so hot:  must get out of bed to turn off bedside reading lights.  There was a wierd smell in room - suspect it might have been new carpeting.  The dimly lit hallways are so 1980's/tired.  Come on, put in some brighter lightbulbs!

Concierge recommendations for restaurants were not great - the two worst meals I had in London were places within close walking distance of hotel:  avoid Giovanni's overpriced bland Italian.

Great spot nearby:  Brown's a block up the street for breakfast - that was offering a two for one British breakfast deal.  Brown's is also a hot spot for drinks and snacks pre- or post theatre.",4,2014,07,25
125,"5star, great location and service. Some rooms in need of refurbishing","My wife, son and myself are just back from a weeks stay (our first time). I booked this hotel purely based on location and quirkiness (I work in the creative industry). It didn't disappoint. Fantastic, bit of a hiccup with room allocation at the start but the hotel manager was excellent, she went above and beyond to make sure we were happy by allocating us new rooms. Staff were great, food excellent along with the service. To keep its 5 star status the hotel needs to reform some of the rooms. The deluxe double that we were in has marks on the walls, a a power socket a ground level had been kicked in. The table that should light up had shorted at the plug also. However I believe the hotel are in the process of a refurbishment program.
Would I recommend this hotel: YES
Would I go back: YES",4,2014,07,24
125,Another Fantastic Stay!,"Just back from London and stayed at the St Martins Lane again for the 6th time.  Love this hotel, extremely friendly staff, very helpful.

125,Great hotel,"We arrived way too early for the standard check in time, but to our surprise, there was already a room for us. We were welcomed like one of their VIP guests and we also felt like one. Our room was spotlessly clean with crisp beddings and comfortable pillows. Bathroom was also very clean, and smells fresh. I commend the cleaning ""crew"" for their job well done everyday. People at the reception were all kind and helpful. By the way, location of this hotel is really central; theatres, restaurants, shops, underground, tourist attractions, pubs and bus stops are all within walking distance. I'll surely recommend this hotel to my friends, and we hope to be back next year.",5,2014,07,22
125,"Excellent staff, brilliant location","This is the 3rd time at St Martins Lane and the experience was equally as excellent as my previous visits. The check-in staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a corner room overlooking St Martins Lane and Mays Ct, which initially I was worried might be a bit noisey, but needn't have worried. The location is fabulous, on the cusp of Trafalgar Square, and close to Covent Garden and Leicester Sq. The room was a good size, as was the bathroom (with seperate bath and shower). There were no tea making facilities, but they were made available on request. We doned at Asia de Cuba (reviewed seperately, but I'll just say that the food was delicious, although book early if you can). All round an excellent stay.",5,2014,07,22
125,We'll be back,"Fantastic location, big spacious rooms. I'm London. That's a miracle. Apart from all the 'cool' bits, defining feature for us was the staff.

the room blinds and curtain give a good black out.the bathroom is good and the shower very good and there are are plenty of towels.the tv stand/mini bar thingy is awful and looms in the room looking more like an Ikea robot than something with form or function.hotel internet is good. the wardrobe space is very small.Please take the robot out of the room and get a small flat screen and put a small fridge on the wall",3,2014,07,18

125,Trendy spot in great location,"The rooms in this property are fantastic.  So big for central London, clean, white, huge floor to ceiling windows that take up all the walls, super comfy beds, extremely spacious bathrooms.  The service was great.  The staff were very helpful, even outfitting us with 4 cruiser bikes so we could see London in style.  The location is perfect.  Far enough from Trafalgar Square so it's not loud, but close enough to wander down and be a few blocks from so many famous sites.  Another plus - surrounded by wonderful pubs that keep you from getting home no matter how hard you try!",4,2014,07,16
125,"This is a super hotel, very central, great service & super friendly staff.","We booked a short holiday package to London including  hotel for 4 nights. We arrived at the hotel early Saturday morning and the receiving staff was so kind to give  us the key to our room instead of letting us wait until afternoon fir the official check-in time. We got a std queenbed room in immaculate all white and spotless clean. Hotel location was 2 mins walk to the Garreth theater where we watch the Beatlemaniac  ""Let it be"" musical. The staff were very helpful in providing local information and even let us stay for a late checkout without any extra cost. We will certainly recommend this hotel to our friends and looking forward to our next visit next year",5,2014,07,16
125,"Flawless, and I never say that","I give this place top marks (and I nearly ALWAYS have something to complain about). This hotel is extremely convenient for the theatre district, my room had stunning views over the Coliseum and Trafalgar. Chic, clean, well thought out rooms, really comfortable beds, great linen. And in a total first for London: spotless carpeting in the room. The first Starck hotel I really liked. The staff was hugely helpful and capable, yet trendy and well presented. Check-in delightful, bellboys wonderful, bar staff accommodating and flexible, concierge creative and helpful. I liked it so much I came back after a week (and cancelled my other hotel booking). Well done!",5,2014,07,14
125,Excellent location average rooms,"Pros: 
Excellent location
Near the underground
Close to boutique shops
Short ride to Oxford street
Walking distance to theatres and some tourist attractions 
You can use the gym box 
Clean hotel
Excellent cleaning staff 
Courteous doormen 

Cons: 
Reception staff can be impolite and snooty 
Room service food was OK 
Room phone randomly rang numerous times - distracting if working 
One memember of room service let himself into the room without knocking! (Good job I wasn't naked!)
Can be rather noisy at the weekend - people screaming outside in the street
Would not class this as a 5* there are better hotels for the money 
Pretty basic hotel rooms 
No tea or coffee facilities in the room",3,2014,07,08
125,5 Star Hotel. 5 Star Service. 3 Star room,"To start with. We had some mis-communication regarding disable room and I had to make a formal complaint prior arrival of the hotel. When I arrive, I have to say, the service was great. From the door man to receptionist to house keeping. Everyone is nice.

The decor of the hotel was great. However, I dont know whether they tried to keep the original decor of 'historic' decor of this old office block / cinema, the flooring and the lift were a bit run down. The room was small. The sound isolation was POOR. I could hear the neighbor very clearly. The water power was good. The tiles, cupboard, mirrors are all chipped despite this was a newly decorated room. I must admit this is a 5 star hotel with 3 star decor. There are definitely better and cheaper hotel. Bed / Mattress was quite hard.  

Location was fantastic I have to say. 

Overall, this is a 4 star experience.",3,2014,07,04
125,Perfect but Imperfect,"Perhaps trying to be a little too chic for its own good, the Saint Martin's Lane is a high-quality hotel in a terrific location. Its assets are location (theaters restaurants and subway a block away), service, and cleanliness. And if you're actually going to use the gym on vacation like you said you were, then a big asset is a massive gym (Gym Box) right next door, complimentary for guests. Some may be a little off-put upon entry to the hotel. Even though I relish modern design, I wasn't sure if I'd entered an office building or a hospital. This may not be important for many, but I like a hotel's lobby to be inviting and warm with a certain ambiance, despite my modern tastes. The other thing that bothered me (this is not an inexpensive hotel), is that some of the modern features seem to have been done on the cheap, or just getting long in the tooth. The hallways were lacking in refinement or were worn. It seems a can of pastel paint colors was the extend of ""modernizing"" some areas. (See pictures.) Although pristine, the tile in the lobby is worn. The uneven quality of the craftsmanship and aethestic vision of the hotel made it feel misaligned and unrefined in areas. 

The rooms are well-appointed and super clean in a stark aesthestic. I was in a very good sized corner king. The nice cleaning staff is almost obsessive with making sure everything is immaculate. The soap/shampoo products are very good (Malin+Goetz). The bed is comfortable, but not the most comfortable I've been in. The pillows, however, were large and nicely firm. The white lamenated swivel TV stand/mini bar was a little hokey and reminded me something my dad would have made for me when I was a kid.  

The power conversion options weren't built in, and the only outlets in the main room were on the floor by the desk in the front of the room. (See picture) There was an iPhone port on the desk, but it was for older models, so it was useless. Because hotels in the UK do not have outlets for hairdryers in the bathroom, it was a hassle walking across the hotel room to plug in the hairdryer cord into the floor outlets. An outlet on a wall closer to the bathroom would have made more sense. 

The aformentioned negatives are minor yet collectively irritating for a one who expects only the best from a modern/hip hotel in this price range. I've been in London hotels of this ilk that are far more refined and updated. But here you have the location. 

All in all a very nice hotel in a terrific area, albiet a tad contrived, sometimes lacking in the inviting modern refinement and hipness it's trying desperately to achieve.",4,2014,07,03
125,Beauty in the heart of the city,"This hotel is a nice gem of a place to stay, with great service, comfortable beds, and a fabulous location in the heart of the city. The decor was modern, fun, and relaxing. We ate at Asia de Cuba and found the service to be impeccable and the food tasty and well seasoned. They had to kick me out the door, as I would have stayed there forever.Loved it!",5,2014,07,03
125,Excellent,"Excellent hotel! Personal service, relaxed atmosphere, a boutique hotel in a perfect location in central London. Delicious food in the reataurant ""Asia de Cuba"" and cocktails in the Light Bar is to die for...
Didn't want to leave! Can't wait to go back.",5,2014,06,30
125,Perfect for a birthday treat,"This wasn't our first stay and I'm sure it won't be our last.

The staff throughout the hotel are both professional and informal in a very engaging way.

We were upgraded to a deluxe room as it was a special occasion.  Room 507 has lots of space, a huge comfy bed and a view of Nelson's Column.  The simple white decor is a welcome change from the chintz and gilding found in so many 5 star hotels.  Particularly liked the space in the bathroom for putting on make-up.  

Despite being in the heart of the city it was surprisingly quiet and we heard little noise from inside the hotel or from the street.

Fantastic cocktails in the Light Bar.  Pancakes for breakfast in Asia de Cuba are just what the hangover needed.",5,2014,06,30
125,You can do better in London...,"Poorly executed remodel. Truly seems like cheap apartments, with bizarre layouts. The dark hallway masks the run down nature of the halls, but highlights the single core, unsealed room doors that let light into it.   You know where this is heading - super loud in the rooms.  So much so that in the mornings you can hear the cleaning staff vacuuming down the hall in other rooms, the voices of everyone who passes in the corridor.   Rooms are so basic that they don't even have tea and coffee facilities. Now, if this was a low cost room, hey not so bad. But it's price is on par with The Savoy, The Langham and the Shangri-La - which are truly quality hotels.  Not kidding about the fact that you can hear everything in all adjoining rooms, as well as the floors above and the hallway. Including toilets flushing.  No privacy at all.  Very cramped rooms- couldn't even open the umbrella up to dry out easily.   Next trip I will give this one a miss.",1,2014,06,28
125,St Martins Lane - a great place to stay in London,"A Saturday night stay with a four year old was bliss. Both my husband (a Londoner) and I have stayed in London on business at some very nice and distinguished hotels a lot and this has been amongst the best but without anything being over the top! Check in was a dream - very welcoming yet totally efficient. Room was extremely quiet, I commented while we were there that all rooms must be sound proofed as we never heard a thing despite being in theatreland on one of the busiest weekends of the year. Decor was lovely, again some nice touches without anything extravagant, our four year old loved playing with the lights and the shower and toiletries were fantastic. Breakfast charges were outrageous so just eat out. We will be back. A special birthday weekend treat that did not disappoint.",4,2014,06,28
125,A superb hotel in an inspiring place!,It is not my first visit..... I love this hotel. It is really beautiful. Extremely comfortable. Staff are helpful. The place is hip and trendy. Location is great and inspiring. The amnesties are awesome! You get everything MALIN+GOETZ in your room:) I love it!,5,2014,06,28
125,Excellent Location,"Very friendly staff in reception, charming and very helpful. The lobby is a little bit weird (d√©cor) and there is no where to sit. Not a hugh problem, as there are plenty of coffees, bars, pubs and restaurants within a minute.

The room is a little bit small but comfortable. The bed is one of the best Hotels can offer. The lights are a little bit weird (I personally have no use for coloured lights). Surprisingly, my room only had a shower and no bath. The Hotel is very clean

I was disappointed when I've checked out. I announced a check out at around 04 o'clock in the morning (received a respective wake up call). when I was there they told me it is not possible, as they are running the night audit (???). Anyhow, I either had to wait and risk to miss my flight or receive my bill via e-mail. I wasn't happy at all but no flexibility or apologize.",4,2014,06,25
125,a special occasion hotel,"The stay at St Martin's Lane Hotel for us was part of a special birthday treat weekend in London. It's not the sort of price we could afford regularly (and it did take me a little time to realise that the rates quoted up front were without VAT, and had to scale back on my room aspirations accordingly) but as a once a year luxury we felt we had a top quality experience. 

We loved the lighting and the use of colour in the hotel and our room. We thought the multiple usb sockets and the effective air-con very useful. We slept well with good sound proofing and on the satisfyingly hard bed. We found the wifi access and admin side of things straightforward. The drinks in the Light Bar and the hotel breakfast were tasty and fresh - needs crispier bacon is the only thing I have to offer there.

The main thing that we enjoyed though was the genuinely friendly attitude of all of the people we encountered at the hotel. Thank you for making us feel welcome and valued.",5,2014,06,23
125,no real substance,"i stay in london up 6 times per year and my husband travels on business every month.
His company booked this hotel as others were full (tell you something???)
i arrived first and was checked in to a tiny room with shabby decor that resonated throughout. i did not mind about this as i was in London to organise a funeral and estate wind up and had serious business to complete before returning home abroad.
For the 2 days i was there there was NO INTERNET. on a UK sim without 4G one expects internet and it was offered but not working.
that could have been fine if the business centre could assist but the key they gave me to use didn't work and once a concierge arrived to open the BC the internet was down after a brief 2 hours operational.
i was distraught and said i had to move out to further conduct business as it was now Friday and the weekend offered no option to organise shippers and undertakers and funerals etc etc
they checked me out with a vague offer to sort out the already settled bill(to no avail i will receive no refund albeit exceptional circumstances)
they then also incorrectly billed me for breakfast which i discovered by mistake looking through my credit card statement 2 weeks later.
ONLY a complaint about the breakfast charge generated a response from guest relations 2 weeks AFTER my stay.
THIS IS NOT 5 star treatment by ANY means and i am happy to discuss hotels in London with St Martins and they can compare their reviews and see what is expected.
i have instructed my husbands bank travel consultant to never book them there again, albeit they have stayed at the group for years.
THIS treatment is unacceptable and not worthy of the loyalty of their guests.",2,2014,06,20
125,Great Location!  Great Gym!  Tight Quarters!,"We love the funkiness of MHG properties and the St. Martins Lane is no exception.  We stayed for two nights following a cruise and enjoyed our time there very much.  Excellent first impressions (and final, as well) from the welcoming front desk staff got us off to a great start and we appreciated being able to check-in hours in advance of check-in time.

Our standard room was very small.  We had a lot of luggage from our long journey and there wasn't really anywhere to store it except to line it up against a wall (it didn't fit under the bed).  This reduced the limited floor space even further so it was very difficult for us to move around the room--but we spent so little time there anyway.  We love a cold room to sleep in and the AC was highly effective.  Nice bathroom with one of the best showers we've ever had!  The view from our second floor room was pretty dismal, though. We looked out onto a roof, and an adjacent building that was undergoing renovations (we think) and was completely covered in sheets of white canvas.

The primary reasons we chose this property were:  

Its close proximity to theatres (we had tickets for two shows) and everything else. And, the fact that it's on a quiet street.

Its restaurant (we love Asia de Cuba) and we had another great meal there (although the service was disorganized and not especially attentive this time).  We also enjoyed our dinner the following night at nearby Kettner's.

Its fitness facility.  The hotel doesn't actually have one so guests use Gymbox next door at no charge.  A very large and well equipped (but very warm) facility that oddly, doesn't open until 10AM on the weekends.  The Brits apparently like to sleep in as the Starbucks directly across the street from the hotel opens late on the weekends as well (8:30AM).

We'd definitely stay here again but try for a slightly larger room with a more pleasant view.",4,2014,06,17
125,Attracts questionable patrons - skip this one!,"Location is the best thing this hotel has going for it. Staff also does try to do their best given what they are working with.

The hotel is definitely showing its age with obvious wear and tear on the marble flooring, carpeting and cheap furnishings in the rooms. 

Cutting to the chase - I have stayed here twice. Once four years ago, and once recently. On the Saturday nights of BOTH stays my spouse and I were awoken by what can only be described as 'theatrical performances' heard through the walls.... that began in the middle of the night and lasted for hours (ehm, someone was trying to get their moneys worth?). What do you know, the hotel maids could be heard cleaning the room next door before we even woke up. You do the math. It has a sleazy vibe. I travel constantly for work and pleasure all over the world and NEVER have I had this happen before. Twice in the same hotel, doesn't seem like a coincidence.",2,2014,06,08
125,Absolutely brilliant even with a young baby!,"I have stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel a few times with my wife but the excellent service and staff when bringing my young baby for the first time made me write this review. We found the entire staff so accommodating, attentive and nice we did not feel uncomfortable once with our baby - we have had the pleasure to stay at many top hotels and what made this stay really enjoyable was the service, all top hotels have a fantastic restaurant but can fail when listening to the customer. We look forward to returning and eating as much food from Asia De Cuba again! Thanks for your efforts!",5,2014,06,08
125,Trendy,"Liked it here - nice little patio room that worked well for 1 night stay. Great room, with  patio. Though I think your plants are way too big to move around, frequently poked in ear! Very cool, packed minibar - berocco, cigarettes, as well as all the usual stuff, Expensive though. We didn't eat in hotel but it looked great. Comfortable bed and great shower. Lovely toiletries too. 

It was Saturday night, but it was noisy. Can't be helped in great area. 

Just a couple of tiny attention to detail things for hotel- reception got us mixed up with another booking (same room type though), so tv welcome had wrong name on it. Only 1 bottle of water in room. Can't close blinds in room, which for my partner who needs total darkness it wasn't great, the drapes were fine though. Also perhaps us but corridors too dark....or maybe we're just getting old.

Excellent restaurants and bars all around.  The hotel staff is really, really cool.  Everyone seems to really enjoy their jobs.  Even the late night staff like Aga were really super friendly and helpful.  The doormen are very knowledgeable of the neighborhood.  There's a 24 hour convenience store just around the corner, and The Box Gym is right next door.  Guests of the hotel get privileges included in their stay.  So, I had a coupe of great workouts while there.  The rooms are very cozy, super clean, and well appointed.  My bathroom was totally immaculate.  I totally loved this hotel.  I'm very sure you will, too!",5,2014,05,30
125,Sweet love,"Thank you St Martins Lane for a lovely stay in London. I was impressed with the brilliant design of the hotel and the view from the Loft Suite was sensational -across to the Gherkin and The Shard and also London Eye and Nelson's Column which was dazzling in the evenings.  The room was perfectly quiet and peaceful and the bed and bathroom were fantastic. 

I was  impressed with the confident, friendly staff who are enthusiastic about your stay which is a refreshing change(thank you Igor for noticing my taxi before me & for helping as soon as I arrived,  ace!) I must compliment the Chefs also as the meals were excellent and I was impressed with the fresh fruit and presentation of the dishes.

The Malin and Goetz luxurious items were lovely but I was sad that the Designer Vending Machine with Selfridges items was no longer available - I didn't notice that. I hope to return again sometime soon. Thank you .",5,2014,05,29

Access to gym next door with gym bag and laundry bag provided! Free laundry for gym kit as well. Really couldn't ask for more.

Staff very attentive.. If you are looking for a modern, more cutting edge decor and feel, then you should check this hotel out..",4,2014,05,13
125,Service at its best. Felt right at home.,"I had been staying here for about a week; part holiday, part business. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi, the service was impeccable. Greeted by Ed, the nicest chief concierge I'd ever met, the check in process, to the daily meals, and the occasional requests were attended to promptly and efficiently. 
It truly felt like home everytime we returned from a day out on the town, constantly greeted by the friendly faces of the staff. 

The only mildly negative thing I might have to say would be that the room (at least on the 5th floor) was not the most convenient as it was rather limited on space, and I had to work my way strategically around my bags and the bed - also hit my head on the lampshade a couple of times. The upside of the room is the bathroom, which was fantastic. 

Another plus would be the restaurant which truly had some pretty amazing fusion food. I recommend that even the locals visit Asia de Cuba! 

Overall, a truly memorable experience which I will carry with me till I come back again! A special shout out to the wonderful Ed, who always went the extra mile, Amy who was ever so helpful with any touristy information I needed, Jack the bellman who always made us feel welcomed along with Ivano. 
Much love for the St Martins Lane hotel. Hope to be back soon!

125,"Sleek, trendy aesthetics without an attitude.","AESTHETICS  / SERVICE
Upon arrival the hotel and room were as expected - the aesthetic was clean, modern and uber-trendy.  All of the staff (even the cleaning staff) are smartly dressed in all black, there are quirky modern decorative elements, easy listening indie music in the background and lots of mood and accent lighting.  I mentioned in an e-mail prior to our arrival that we were celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary in London and shortly after our arrival we were gifted a bottle of wine and some chocolate covered strawberries.  Overall, the level of service was quite to my liking - polite and pleasant, available but not overbearing or omnipresent.  We‚Äôre rather independent travelers and certainly not high-maintenance guests so we only approached the front desk on check in and check out (no issues came up throughout our stay that necessitated rectification) and the receptionists were always friendly.  The doormen were also quite nice, greeting us upon our return to the hotel daily and opening the regular door next to the giant, automated revolving door to make it easier to get in.

CLEANLINESS / MAINTENANCE
You can tell the facilities aren‚Äôt new, but they are very well-maintained.  Our nearly all-white room was clearly well-cleaned, the only unsatisfactory cleaning issue I noticed was some drip marks on a window.  Large floor-to ceiling windows with black out shades let in lots of light.  All of the curtains, bed linens and towels were white (or off-white) and completely unstained, there were no unsightly marks on the walls.  The bathroom fixtures, walls and ceilings were without any mildew, hair or other types of disgustingness.  All of the shelves provided for storage were immaculately clean and dust-free.  The beige carpet was in decent condition and unstained, there were no fingerprints on the mirrors, etc.  It was easily clean enough to imagine we were the first people to use the room.  Whenever we left for the day, the room was reliably cleaned by the time we came back and turndown service was provided nightly.
  
LOCATION
The view from our room (situated on the back-facing wall of the hotel) had a nice little view - some well-kept brick flats in the foreground with a nice view of the west end buildings and a small view of Shoreditch including the Gherkin, etc. in the distance.  The location of the hotel is great for tourism, a few minutes walk to the West End theater (the play was saw was actually directly across the street), Soho, Leicester Sq, Oxford Street and Covent Garden.  It was a 15 minute walk to Westminster and the British Museum area.  Even with the prime location, our room was always quiet at night.

NEGATIVES
My negative comments are very few and rather nit-picky.  The bed linens consisted of several fluffy pillows and a nice, fluffy comforter ‚Äì no sheets or blankets.  The problem was that it was too warm to sleep under the comforter, even with the air-conditioning set as low as it would go.  It would be nice if there were lighter weight bed linens available (in all fairness, we never asked).  The television and mini fridge are housed in cabinets that were made by attaching three off-the-shelf cabinets together.  The structure seemed a bit rickety and the doors didn‚Äôt fit perfectly but closed without difficulty and was stable.  The hallways on the 5th floor are very moodily lit: read dark.  I could easily see where I was going and what was happening, but the dim colored lighting made it seem as if it was dark outside in the middle of the day.

All-in-all we had a great stay at St. Martin‚Äôs Lane.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would come back myself in a heartbeat.",4,2014,05,11
125,The best Hotel room we've ever stayed in!,"My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and we got off to a rocky start with the hotel. We had booked it via Lastminute.com's Mystery Hotels having done a bit of research. So I knew what I was booking. When we arrived St Martin's Lane had no record of a booking, despite my confirmation email. They were very helpful and apologetic but they were fully booked. There was apparently an error with Lastminute's system. We were about to be taken to another hotel (much to our distress) when by pure chance someone checked out a night early. Gemma, the manager, managed to get it all sorted straight away.

When we returned in the afternoon we had been upgraded to their best room in the hotel (or Gemma's favourite at least) with 180 degree views over London. The floor to ceiling windows gave way to views on Nelson's column, Big Ben, The Eye, The Shard, The Gerkin and everything in between. I've never had a hotel room view like it. 2 minutes later we were sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to apologise for the confusion. Between this and the outstanding room this truly made our anniversary.

As for the hotel and the room, it's truly 5 star. The design is the coolest I've seen. Not like so many nice, but forgettable hotels. This place truly stands out, even in a city like London. I've stayed in quite a few hotels with work and there are a few things that make the top hotels stand out. Quality of sheets, mattresses and pillows is a big one. Bathroom fittings that don't just look nice, but perform and are of solid quality. Polite and helpful staff. This place had it all. If you can get in to one of the 6th floor room in this place then do it, you will not regret it.

A special thanks to the staff that helped make this a special stay. We hope to see you soon!",5,2014,05,09
125,Quality,"Stayed for 3 nights over the bank holiday weekend with the missus. Fantastic hotel, everyone from the porters, to the check in to the bar staff always went out of their way to make you feel welcome. Didn't eat there but the cocktails were excellent and the location is perfect, literally a 2min walk from Leicester Square tube station. If we were staying in this area again we would be hard pressed not to stay at St Martins.",5,2014,05,09
125,repeat client - don't want to stay anywhere else !,"IDEAL location
GymBox gym next door
excellent staff and quality of service
** special thanks for Fabrizzio, Paris, and Andrew (the ""night crew"") for pleasant early morning check-outs !
all details thoughtfully taken care of; the rooms are very well designed; the beds utterly comfy.
the only hotel in London where I am a repeat visitors, and will continue to be one 
thank you St Martins, i finally have a ""home away from home"" when i need to be in London",5,2014,05,08
125,Exceptional!,"My mum in law was staying in the hotel as a birthday treat in London. I have left flowers, cake and champagne for the staff to take care of and put in a room before her arrival and they went extra mile - putting candles everywhere, making room looks stunning and including little cake and note from themselves as well. Exceptional customer service, attention to details makes you feel very welcome. Hotel itself if beautiful. Design/Boutique - stylish. Ideal location - walking distance from convent garden & Leicester square.",5,2014,05,08
125,BEST OF THE BEST MODERN HOTEL,"Cannot say enough on how we enjoy this hotel and keep going back. Very modern and minimalistic hotel, yet extremely comfortable and great value for money, even considering it is a top end 5 star rated and priced Central London hotel. Staff are extremely friendly and always very helpful, very often making you smile, even when you are feeling down. Breakfast exceptional. Highly recommend you eat for dinner at their restaurant, Asia de Cuba also but remember what the staff say, ""1 main meal between 2 is more than enough"". Only downside is try and not stay in a standard room, as a little small but upgrade and rooms are plenty big enough. Try a suite for that special occassion, top room in a top hotel in great part of Central London, couldn't ask for more.",5,2014,05,05
125,Just fabulous,"It was our anniversary, and we booked a night at St Martins, and it was marvellous. The room was awesome , with a view over the London Skyline. They had very kindly prepared the Room as per my requests, with the added touch of flower petals arranged over the bed and surrounding the bath, a very kind and thoughtful touch. The room has had a recent makeover and is simply fabulous. Went to the Light Bar for wonderful cocktails, wonderful evening and the most comfortable nights sleep.
What really sets this hotel apart is the "" Can Do"" attitude of each staff member, coupled with best Front of House Team of any hotel I have encountered, 
Big thank you",5,2014,05,05
125,Excellent location,"Very centrally located, friendly staff and decent service.  Mood lighting in the hallways which is trendy but a little dark, very nicely appointed rooms and I particularly like the bathrooms.  Excellent A/C.  I would probably opt for a room on a higher floor to get away from the outside street noise but overall I felt this hotel was very nice and I would certainly come back.",4,2014,05,05
125,"Beautiful room, great location","I booked this hotel for my husband's birthday and we weren't disappointed. Friendly and helpful staff, who seemed genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasurable experience. The room was amazing and the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Close to the theatre and underground, and many major attractions. We would definitely stay again.",5,2014,05,04
125,Too cool,"There are many things to love about this hotel; its location is superb, being walking distance to many sites and very convenient to many tube stations. The room and bathroom were large, spacious and clean with excellent hvac. So what's wrong? We were a family visiting London for the first time and needed help. The concierges were nice but maybe just too cool and flippant. Bad addresses, wrong days for events they recommended, inappropriate restaurant recommendations and what not. One day they had limited hours because it was a bank holiday???? There is also an underlying feeling that the hotel is looking to take advantage. They are the only hotel we encountered in our search that quoted prices exclusive of VAT and food at the hotel was obscenely priced. That was not an issue for breakfast as there are many reasonably price options just out the door but really... So if you are self sufficient and like cool, this can be a great choice. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.",3,2014,04,23
125,Wow,"Second time we've stayed at St Martins Lane hotel and will definitely be coming back. 
Once again, we could not fault a thing. The staff are very friendly, attentive and make you feel like part of their ""family"". 
We stayed in a garden room on 1st floor, which was very charming and the room is incredibly well laid out. 
Our friends also stayed with us for the first time, through our recommendation, and both thoroughly enjoyed it. They will also be going back in the near future. 
We had drinks in the bar first then dined in Asia de Cuba. Again, the staff could not have been more helpful and nothing was ever too much trouble. Food was excellent and more than enough for the four of us. 
We would really love to keep this hotel a secret but you must experience it for yourself. 
The team makes this hotel above all others, for which we cannot thank them enough. 
It's always our pleasure to stay there. A real classy place.",5,2014,04,22
125,A Good Base But A Couple Of Niggles,"We have just returned from a couple of nights at this hotel we checked in and were given a friendly welcome by Isabelle on reception

We were allocated a room on the 5th floor on entering the room I must admit we were disappointed at the size of the room. My wife has mobility issues and it was difficult to move around the room with crutches as floor space was very limited. Yes it was a standard room but have stayed in larger standard rooms in this area previously at the Charing Cross Hotel and The Waldorf. A quick call to reception and a few quid more we moved to a delux room which was marginally bigger with a view of the coliseum side exit and the London eye in the distance

The new room was clean with a comfortable bed with the usual over priced minibar, but that is standard around the area.

The location of the place was superb it is ideally placed for the theatres, bars, restaurants and the usual tourist attractions, just off Trafalgar Square on a reasonably quiet road just away from the real hustle and bustle.

Due to my wife's mobility issues we made use of room service, cheese burger and club sandwich, both adequate. Breakfast the next morning in the room was a little bit of a let down really the food was lukewarm the bacon had the appearance and texture that it had been kept warm for a long time as it was very dry and chewy not crisp as I suspect it was in the time before it arrived at the room. I noted there was a 15% service charge and a ¬£3.75 tray charge which took breakfast to over ¬£60. I resent paying a service charge when a tray charge is implemented its one or the other as far as I am concerned, if I like the service I tip the server not the hotel.

There were a couple of quirky bits in the hotel, in the lifts there are 3 mini tv screens displaying a reflection of a tree on moving water, with some weird music which could be likened to a bad 1970's acid trip!!

There were a couple of little niggles, the corridors although nicely decorated are very dark, the curtains were very difficult to close in the room, the blinds that are encased in the double glazing could not be closed as there was no tool in the room to do this, one thing that was annoying was that all the sockets are very low to the floor in a pretty inaccessible place close to the desk also no socket near the bed, most people have mobiles they charge overnight which dual as their time piece/alarm clock it's a bit of a pain, perhaps a design floor as all other hotels I have stayed in have had a socket in this area.

All in all though ok I suppose, just didn't light my fire, a bit soulless but that's the contemporary design I think. Would I stay again? Yes I would but only if the Charing cross Hotel was full",4,2014,04,21
125,Maybe getting a little tired,"I stayed here for one night in a deluxe room. At check-in the receptionist tried to entice us to purchase another upgrade to a studio. The sales pitch was nauseating, all we wanted was to check-in swiftly and then head out. Only 1 small bottle of mineral water was supplied in our room and sleep was disturbed by noisy guests from nearby. Mattress could do with a topper. 

Breakfast was delicious (we had the full English) but doesn't come with toast?!",3,2014,04,20
125,Modern !,"Grate, central place to Stay when visiting London. Jamies Italian Restaurant not to far from, Covent Garden just around the corner, ...., Superb ! Great Ambiance during the day, Great breakfast, Nice Staff, big bathroom with a Bath Tub in the Center :) Nice to relax ! Great Ride !",5,2014,04,20
125,"Fantastic position for theatre, tres funk design, upmarket attitudes, not great for kids","We stayed 3 nights specifically for theatre performances, there was an issue with our booking as we were 2 adults and 1 child booked via hotel.com however child was not advised via the booking to the hotel.  That made a not so great start for us however after a while staff sorted it and we were given a room suitable for us.

The hotel is mega mega funky and modern art decor (not our style) with staff adopting funky upmarket approaches (again not our style) but fascinating nevertheless.

We had some decor issues with our room of bumping into artistically placed lights that were at very low levels, however as above the funk design makes it unique.

The location, location, location was fantastic for us we walked to all three theaters, and even though funk staff and design is not our style we are likely to stay again for another theatre season due to the fresh, sharp cleanness of the rooms and absolute perfect location.",4,2014,04,19
125,more than made up for last time,After a bad experience at St Martin's Lane in the new year we gave it another go at the invitation of the hotel.  I'm happy to report that this stay was much better. The lovely people there even dropped complimentary champagne and strawberries to our room while we were out for dinner on our first evening. Any hotel can have an off weekend but this hotel handled the problem very well and we will definitely stay again,4,2014,04,19
125,Friday night treat,"We arrived late afternoon, parking was very convenient under the hotel. Funky Philipe Starck interior, still lots of Ooh factor after 10 years use. The staff were delightful, it felt like we were abroad on holiday, nothing was too much trouble. Room service was speedy, lots of tea & a stack of home baked biscuits. Room facilities are clever & fun, not brand new but still in good order. Really comfortable bed. Great cocktail bar, breakfast to die for, didn't want to leave...oh and superb location. Right on the edge of Trafalgar Square, walking distance for theatre, shopping, restaurants.",5,2014,04,18
125,Truly excellent!,"Warm, personal, generous and professional. The staff make this style palace as friendly as it is cool. It was a real treat from start to finish. Highly recommended. I loved the breakfast room decor and the gnome stools.",5,2014,04,15
125,Simply fabulous,"I honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else in London. This is my third time staying here over the years and it's still my hotel of choice! It is a fabulous, funky boutique hotel and is so well located - it's a 2 mins walk to Leicester square tube, 5 minute walk to Charing Cross station and in the heart of Covent Garden with all the great shops, restaurants and theatres on your doorstep. There is a gym (literally next door to the hotel ) and as a hotel guest, you can use the facilities and attend classes free of charge PLUS the hotel will launder your gym gear free of charge and return it the very same day!
I stayed on my own for a week. I had a standard room which is very cosy but it is so well designed, it's absolutely fine. (They are about to start updating the rooms soon anyway) The bed is comfortable, the shower is powerful and hot, the toiletries are excellent, free wifi, and surprisingly for London it was very quiet. The staff were brilliant - knew me by name and were always willing to help. Special thanks to doormen Ricardo and Ahmet and also concierge Joey.
I recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London. You won't be disappointed.",5,2014,04,14
125,Great stuff,"Great location, great stuff, funny furniture, great breakfast, enjoyed.
 Idea for guest experience management: last impressions bare most important, maybe more than first: Would appreciate takeaway coffee when leaving for airport before 6 morning :) ",5,2014,04,11
125,Great stay at St Martin's Lane,"Had a lovely weekend in London meeting a friend and stopped for two nights at St Martin's Lane. I had wanted to stop here for a while and was familiar with the hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful, I agree with all the glowing reports about the service, it truly made your stay special. The room was very nice, more spacious than I imagined. It had a nice bathroom and powerful shower. Considering how old the hotel now is the interior is standing up pretty well. It is probably ready for an update in places. I was surprised how quiet the bar area was on a Friday and Saturday night. I remember when people used to queue to get into the hotel. We had a fabulous meal at Asia de Cuba on our second night. Again the staff couldn't have been more helpful as I have food intolerances and they made special dishes for me which were delicious and much appreciated. All in all a really great experience!",4,2014,04,10
125,Fabulous location,"LOved the hotel - amazing vibe in the public spaces - the bar is a great space and the restaurant is a great space for breakfast.
The room was great with a lovely bathroom - wouldn't hesitate to stay here again - especially as they are doing a soft refurb of rooms this year",5,2014,04,09
125,Stunning rooms and outstanding service!,"Simply the best hotel service I have ever received - the staff couldn't do enough to help make the weekend special for my friend's 30th birthday, which included some unusual requests! The room itself was stunning with some of the best views I have seen in a hotel on London and despite being so centrally located had a very peaceful vibe. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough! Thank you!",5,2014,04,07
125,Opera in the West End,We have just returned from an excellent one night stay at the Morgans Group hotel in St Martins Lane. The room was fantastic and the staff were most helpful. I was so quiet that you did not know you were in the center of London . The bathroom was well appointed and the restaurants were full so even though we did not eat in the food must be good. The bedroom has funky mood lighting and the bed was very comfortable had no problems sleeping. We are certainly going back for another stay. I would recommend this hotel. The are some refurbishments being carried out up to August 2014 but do not let this stop you staying here. The purpose of the stay was to go to the opera at the London Coliseum which is 2 minutes walk!!,5,2014,04,05
125,Fantastic!!,Fantastic hotel!!!stayed here for a treat with a work bonus for a night with my fianc√© and we loved it!! So modern and funky and in a perfect location!! The bathroom has no door however how it is situated round a corner it didn't bother us. The style of the hotel is so quirky which we loved! Saving to go back!!,5,2014,04,04
125,Best hotel in London,"Love this very trendy hotel,always a treat, beautiful rooms and bathrooms. The lighting is sublime, all white decor with mood lighting. Just stayed there for 5 nights and enjoyed every moment! Best martini's I've ever had anywhere served in the Light Bar. Service excellent at the front desk and in the rooms",5,2014,04,03
125,One of the best hotels in London,"St Martins Lane is an amazing place. They deliver on all aspects: Service, friendliness, attention to detail, cleanliness, and design. Upon arrival they upgraded our room because of our anniversary and our room hostess greeted us with chocolate covered strawberries and written note. When time for the late night show in Victoria, they got us to the theatre on time with their private chauffeur. Well done! We'll will come back. A special thank you to the cool concierge and door man. Great job, guys!",5,2014,04,01
125,Can't beat the location and the service,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a business cum leisure trip and was bowled over by the classiness of the place. Located literally 10 steps away from Trafalgar Square, this hotel has almost every conceivable attraction in London within a walking distance (which for me would be a 30 minute radius) - one can follow the roads leading out of Trafalgar to reach Westminster and from there the London eye or walk to the Buckingham Palace and the Green Park and St James Park, or take a short bus ride to reach the British museum. For shopping, the Strand is nearby and Oxford street a couple of bus stops away. Must also commend the service staff, great attitude, very friendly and go out of their way to help you - something that we really value when traveling abroad with a toddler.",5,2014,04,01
125,Always a pleasure!,"I stay in hotels a lot & most of them are non events, same old, same old.
St.Martin's Lane however is an exception & a true treat to stay there. Fabulous service, great decor & a real sense of style.
Stayed here mid week on business. They kindly upgraded me to a top floor suite, which was palatial, spacious & stunning. Thank you for a fantastic stay, I can't recommend this place highly enough.",5,2014,03,28
125,Another excellent stay at St Martins Lane,"This was our 3rd or 4th stay at St Martins Lane in less than a year. And we were exceptionally satisfied with our stay again. We keep coming back here when visiting London. It is a fantastic experience and the whole team has a natural ability to make us feel very welcome and special.It is a home away from home. Unlike many 5* hotels, the welcome at St Martins Lane feels genuine.

My wife and I travel frequently and we find the attention to detail at St Martins Lane is second to none. The rooms have all amenities a traveler can wish for, whether travelling on business or on leisure. The rooms are very nice with very comfortable beds and a shower with high pressure.

Located a brief walk from Leicester Square and with a tube stop just up the road it is a perfect location for a weekend break.

On Saturday night we visited Asia de Cuba, the restaurant on the hotel premises. It was a superb eating experience and we will be back again when we celebrate something special next. In addition to the restaurant there is the Lightbar that plays groovy tunes in a chilled atmosphere until the early hours in the morning.

A big thank you to Nicole and the rest of the team for making our stay  exceptionally memorable once again.

We can't wait to be back again, later this year.",5,2014,03,26
125,50th Birthday,"Fantastic 50th Birthday celebration for my husband.  Made to feel special from the moment we walked in.  Got a complimentary upgrade to the Apartment and recevied a botttle of bubbly and cake from the Guest Experiance Manager, Nicole Messham.  Great hotel and very attentive staff.",5,2014,03,24
125,Resting on their laurels.  We know how that story ends.,"I have been staying here since they opened as it is one of the hotels approved by our top client in London. The location remains exceptional for business and leisure as it is steps from the several tube stops, theaters, Leicester and Trafalgar Square and so much more.  There remains some exceptional staff like Edward, several bubbly young women (some blond-some bronze brunettes) and a lovely Italian fellow at evening reception.  The downers--the bored young new kids who exhibit little interest in life, let alone the life of a guest and the absolute worst concierges in London.  They all consistently avoid eye contact so that you do not trouble them with directions and are often on personal calls (will not look up when they are on the phone) and they rarely smile and are aloof (yawn).   The doormen rarely present to open the door (ok-they have a revolving door ) but are too busy chit chatting to help customers arriving from the airport with luggage.  They wait till you have stumbled out of the taxi struggling with your luggage and have made your way into the lobby before they ask if you need help.  Overall the newer staff needs some SERIOUS customer service training or needs to find roles that do not require people skills.  I never considered staying anywhere else but will review my client's approved list of hotels for my next stay.",3,2014,03,23
125,"Nice hotel, great location","Very convenient location, near West End theatres and all the central London attractions, and 2 minutes from Leicester Square station on the tube line from Heathrow.

The king deluxe room was nicely designed in typical Starck style and very comfortable, if a little tight for space. Great bathroom, and very clean.

Asia de Cuba had good, interesting food.",5,2014,03,15
125,"Very friendly service, great location, nice room","The checkin staff were very friendly and helpful. Our bedroom located at the rear of the hotel on an upper level was very quiet, and the room was a good size and very comfortable. We didn't dine or drink at the hotel but I have on previous visits and Asia de Cuba and the bar are top notch. All round a nice visit. ",4,2014,03,15
125,Nicole & Alexandra were great!,"Loved this hotel. In an amazing location and perfect in every way. 

We checked in late and quickly showered and went to dinner. It was a lovely touch that upon returning to the room it had been serviced with fresh towels and a candle lit. Great touch. 

",5,2014,03,14
125,Funky and great,"Cool room, great bar, amazing restaurant. Lovely bed. All the little extras added to the whole ambience. The whole experience was a lot of fun! I want to go back! And  i want to try other Morgans' hotels!",5,2014,03,09
125,Amazing Hotel!,"Perfect location, amazing room (loft suite with 2 queen beds). Had dinner in Asia de Cuba from the pre theatre menu which was great value for money and delicious! The staff at St Martins lane are so helpful I must give a special mention to Nicole Messham in guest relations who I contacted before we arrived at the hotel she gave us the best advice for bars and restaurants. Nicole arranged for a bottle of champagne to be sent to our room which was a lovely surprise. I cannot wait to return to St Martins Lane and would not hesitate to recommend it to all of my family and friends. ",5,2014,03,09
125,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,"Great location, fabulous rooms, fantastic bar and restaurant. Could be a handful of top hotels in London. What really sets the st martins lane hotel apart is the attention to detail and the wonderful staff. Couldn't recommend any higher ",5,2014,03,08
125,A perfect city break hotel,We chose to stay here as a special treat despite living in London. The location is beyond perfect. The rooms are all white and clean and very spacious. Fantastic bathroom! It was enormous with a  walk in shower. We even got a welcome note and some tasty treats from the manager. It was all just seamless and very well run. The room was floor to ceiling window along the whole side of the room and it was just fantastic. Really this place makes you feel special.,5,2014,03,07
125,Not sure,"Hotel clean and staff friendly. Double room was like a shoe box for ¬£250 a night room only
Expected to be bigger . Looking out onto a building getting renovated wasn't great but not
Hotels fault I suppose . Also hotel bar doesn't open til late afternoon. Not somewhere I would stay again due to personal preference . 
",2,2014,03,02
125,"Great hotel, excellent staff","Great location in Covent Garden with a highly attentive staff that is willing to help with restaurant recommendations, reservation issues, etc. Everyone is friendly and makes the stay enjoyable. 

On a recent trip, weather caused major flight issues and the front desk staff (Annalicia) worked with me to extend my stay if necessary. Definitley made a difficult situation easier.  

Will definitley be back.",5,2014,02,28
125,Defiantly I found the best hotel in  London,"I travel for business 4-5 time year to London, and I can honestly say it's the best hotel I have ever been to in London. Very friendly, not too expensive, big rooms, modern but above all - the best location!",5,2014,02,27
125,The hotel to book in London!,"Great experience at St Martins Hotel. Located in a great area, walking distance to best London spots. Room very nice (mine a bit small but cozy). Very Very clean.. and all staff very taking care form the valet at the front door to receptionist, concierge, waiter/ess.. all of them!
I really recommend it..",5,2014,02,22
125,Amazing!!,"This hotel felt amazing as soon as we were approaching it walking down the street and before we even stepped foot inside. The contemporary furniture and design (by Philippe Starck) was amazing, and there was always something new and interesting to look at. The staff were excellent and very helpful. The room was great, it had changing lights around the bed, iPod docks and all sorts of very cool touches. Check out the fish tank in the lift, that always makes people do a double take. We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel or make much use of the facilities, but what we did see was fantastic.",5,2014,02,20
125,Review from a 7 week guest ‚Äì pure bliss!,"The St Martins Lane Hotel and staff made my two long stays (one 3 weeks and one 4 weeks) in December 2013 and February 2014 absolute bliss.

Each and every element of this hotel is perfect ‚Äì the warm welcome from the doormen, reception staff and concierge, upbeat music and creative interior design, immaculately clean room, crisp linen, comfy bed and pillows, lush toiletries, roll top bath, jet shower, floor to ceiling windows (which you can open for fresh air), mood lighting above bed, excellent breakfast and room service (I was working late every evening so didn‚Äôt get chance to try the restaurant) and last but not least a fabulous location for exploring everything central London has to offer from the doorstep and by foot! Oh yes and a fantastic range of cocktails in their light bar ‚Äì the one in the Tiki glass is best!

You get free access to the gym next door ‚ÄòGymbox‚Äô which opens early till late and has great equipment (cardio and weights) as well as a huge choice of classes.

On my last night the hotel gave me a voucher for a free cocktail and had made me a huge chocolate cake covered in strawberries with writing in chocolate on top saying ‚Äòcome back soon‚Äô ‚Äì such a lovely surprise and gesture.

If I could pick one improvement the hotel could make, it would be to have a spa or in-room treatments service which I would most definitely have made use of during my stay.

I‚Äôd never hesitate to recommend the St Martins Lane Hotel to anyone I know and will definitely be back to stay again soon.

Thank you to everyone at St Martins Lane when you read this!",5,2014,02,18
125,The best mix between trendy and homely,"Although the first impression of the Saint Martins is of a trendy - snobish hotel, once you get acquainted with the staff youll find that is home away from home. This is my second time, and I enjoyed it in spite of some minor flaws regarding the lifts, renovation works etc. The reception staff is very friendly and efficient and the concierge¬¥s are the best. The location is unbeatable, in the middle of everything without the noise !!
Be aware that standard rooms are tiny but well equiped and the breakfast prices outrageous. Ah, one last thing, my 13 year old daughter said she never met in any hotel such handsome doormen !!",4,2014,02,17
125,SPECTACULAR!!!,"Stayed at SML last week 2/7 thru 2/13 and as always, I am never disappointed that I chose to return to SML time and again.  Ed Parkes, Ahmed, AnnElise, Nicole, Greg--all went above and beyond expectations--and made our stay in London that much more seamless and enjoyable.  As always room service was efficient and fast and our room always spotless when we returned from a day out--and that is not said lightly as I was traveling with two sloppy teenagers!  We were upgraded from a standard double/double to a loft queen which turned out to be an amazing and spacious room.  Ed and Ahmed made sure as we came and went into and out of the hotel each day that we had every thing we needed, front desk staff happily replaced lost keys with a smile--and chocolate covered strawberries sent up to our room one night with a lovely note from Nicole were quickly devoured.  SML is ideally located--but its service and warmth are what keep me coming back.  I cannot recommend this hotel more strongly.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2014,02,16
125,Best Hybrid Boutique Hotel,"The St. Martin's Lane Hotel offers the best location and the best service.  Situated in the Theater District, there is always something going on right outside the doors.   Inside, the hotel is an oasis that is inhabited by sophisticated global travelers and savvy welcoming staff.  I travel all over and this is one of my all-time favorites.

This is an american style boutique hotel.  Do not stay here if you are looking for the baroque, rococo, edwardian, or victorian styles.  This is an Ian Schrager/Phillipe Starck hotel.  It is very 'spare'. If you cannot get in here and want that sort of thing, try the Sanderson.  

The beds are very comfortable.  The shower pressure is legendary.  The Wifi is fast.  The furnishings are spare.  Asia de Cuba has a great - but pricey - breakfast.  The Light Bar is a nice spot, especially when guarded by CJ.

The front desk is very welcoming.  I especially appreciate the service and friendliness of Danielle.  Ahmed the Bell Dude is totally awesome.  Didn't see Eddie or Amy this time.  

When I stay at this hotel, i feel like I am at home.  I'll be back several more times this year and now all the execs at our company stay here.  Why not?  When the restaurants of Seven Dials and Covent Garden are so close, there is a starbucks across the street, all the best theaters.  Hungry?  The Ivy, J Sheeky's, Hawksmoor, Balthazar. Tourist? Trafalgar, piccadilly, covent garden.  Shopping? LongAcre, and Monmouth street...You get the picture.

Is it cheap?  No.  Is it worth it?  Yes!",5,2014,02,15
125,Wonderful stay,"We just checked of the St. Martin's Lane Hotel and miss it already. It is in a terrific location with lots of little restaurants nearby. The staff couldn't be nicer. They made us feel like it was our home and they welcomed us with open arms. My first room was on the small side but I decided to splurge and upgrade. The second room was spacious and bright. Room service was delicious. I ordered the black cod with miso from Asia de Cuba, their in house restaurant. This is a boutique style hotel and definitely worth a try. ",4,2014,02,14
125,"Modern, chic boutique, energetic hotel with awesome gym","St Martins Lane is a chic, modern boutique hotel right in the heart of Covent Gardens. Very walkable neighborhood as well as just a few blocks from the Tube made this a tourist's heaven.  Guests are given access to the Gym Box next door which this California girl thought was the coolest, hottest gym I've ever been to (Equinox, watch out!).  The staff at St Martins Lane is knowledgable and very accommodating from restaurant and bar recommendations to simply guiding how to navigate London. I look forward to staying at St Martins Lane again!",4,2014,02,13
125,Great Hotel - Perfect Location,"1st stay at St Martin's Lane 
Location Excellent - right in the heart of Leicester Square and Covent Garden. 
Great Hotel - friendly, very helpful staff, trendy but not pretentious or overcrowded bar, GymBox attached is great, and Starbucks opposite makes the 2 min walk to the tube very enjoyable. ",5,2014,02,13
125,VERY TRENDY,"St Martin's Lane Hotel is situated in Covent Garden area just one minute walk from Trafalgar Square.
Entering the huge yellow door the always smily stuff welcomes you to this trendy and decorated by Philip Stark Hotel. Modern and sophisticated clientele , young people everywhere , nice bar and one of the best restaurants in London , Asia di Cuba . 
Rooms are very comfortable , all white with granite bathrooms .
If you want to be close to West End theaters , the atmospheric Covent Garden area and the Royal Opera House and at the same time live in a very modern and friendly place ... just go there.",4,2014,02,12
125,A great night in London in the heart of the City,"We stayed at the hotel in Feb 2014 for 1 night for our wedding anniversary.  The location is excellent for Theatre Land, Covent Garden, restaurants and shops.

The staff on the front desk were very polite and attentive, a real difference to some of the places we have stayed in the UK.

Nicole Messham was particularly helpful in making sure we had a great room and booking a table at the bar and restarant in the hotel.  The view from our room was amazing with a great view of the London Coliseum and the London Eye, sunset was something special.

The meal at Asia De Cuba was excellent one of our favorite restaurants in London.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a great central location, likes modern contemporary design, enjoys great food and likes brilliant customer service. 5 Stars *****",5,2014,02,11
125,A fantastic birthday treat,"We stayed here last week for my husband's 50th birthday.  When we arrived, not only had the hotel upgraded us to a better room, no - they had upgraded us all the way to the Penthouse, which was just amazing.  Plus there was a bottle of champagne to celebrate with as well!  All I can say is - we have stayed here before and really enjoyed it as the hotel is beautiful and the location perfect - but it really is the staff that make the place.  And on this occasion, they, and in particular Nicole Messham, the Client Relation Manager, have really excelled themselves.  It could not have been a better celebration - thank you so much for making this stay really special and we look forward to staying with you the next time!",5,2014,02,10
125,Can't fault it,"Had an incredible and stay at the hotel for our engagement weekend and have to specifically mention the Guest Experience Manager, Nicole Messham, for being so helpful in making our stay even more memorable.",5,2014,02,10
125,Excellent customer service,"- Isabel, Annalicia and Caroline at the front desk were GREAT. I lost a camera at another hotel and they located it, put it in a taxi, and had it to me in 30 mins before I left for my flight. This is some of the best customer service I have ever experienced and I am so grateful for their help retrieving my camera. Thank you!

- Clean Rooms, although a bit small. Bathrooms are lovely. Walls are quite thin so you hear a lot of noise from other guests. 

 - Excellent central location",5,2014,02,08
125,"Nice, central location","Stayed here for 2 nights during tube strike so I could get to work a little bit more easily. Decent rooms, decent size bathroom, comfy bed along with the 6 pillows. Did not get a chance to try breakfast but my colleague said it was good. Friendly doormen, especially the black guy with the american accent, friendly bar staff and nice staff all together.
Would stay here again!",4,2014,02,07
125,great location and beautiful venue,"the hotel is located in the heart of london and is a short walk to the metro...never mind all the buses around and so many places to go in walking distance
the venue is beautiful all in philippe starck style
great breakfast",5,2014,02,06
125,Loved it..,"I really loved this hotel, perfect location for exploring London. The staff were all really helpful and informative. 
Its very clean and modern with an amazing enterance area and fab bar.. probably the best Mojoito I've ever had (and I've tried 100's of places!).
The rooms are quite compact, very crisp and modern. The bathroom products and a favourite of mine.. Malin&Goetz.
Id totally recommend this place.",4,2014,02,04
125,Great location,"Stayed there for 6 nights for work.
I landed on Sunday morning on a long flight from HK. 
The first employee told me no rooms till 3pm so I tried to walk around Covent Garden.. unfortunately it was 8am and the only people I encountered were drunks. I walked back at 9am, and met another employee at the front desk. She said for 40 pounds more I could check in earlier and have an upgrade. Done! Why didn't they do this from the start...! 

Rooms were HUGE for Central London. and full of nice vibes like mood lighting and a huge bathroom. 
Location was excellent too, right by covent garden and they have a nice gym. 

The only thing that I don't rate it 5 stars was the service- on the final day I had the door opened for cleaning 3x despite me telling the staff I was checking out and didn't need cleaning. Maybe I should have put a privacy tag, which I did in the end, but that was annoying. oh, and I ordered room service, and the staff couldn't find a bottle of water for me, came one hour later! That's also quite inexcusable.... 

Otherwise, amazing location and rooms.",4,2014,02,04
125,"Nice hotel, excellent location","Stayed here for 7 days.  Very nice boutique hotel in prime London location.  Couple of blocks from Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens,  Long Acre street shops and theatres.  Two minutes from Leicester tube station. Friendly reception staff, including very handsome doormen.  Check in/out was a breeze. 
 
Room was good size, lots of  shelving available.  Great windows with noise cancellation.  Bathroom was very big, but with  two cons: first, we were given a handicapped-accessible room which had no door, thus, we had to close the bedroom door when using the toilet; secondly, the faucet was not practical ‚Äì location of the tap did not leave much room to get hands washed.  

We dined once at Asia de Cuba ‚Äì excellent!  Beautiful ambiance, delicious food, great service!  We shared two appetizers ‚Äì scallops and calamari salad ‚Äì both delicious, and the Chilean sea bass ‚Äì excellent quality, perfectly cooked.  Highly recommend.  The restaurant was full every night ‚Äì very popular.

We highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,02,02
125,Amazing,"Stayed for 1 night to accompany my husband to London prior to him flying off to work. We had previously stayed in a Morgan hotel in New York, the Royalton (see review), we had found the hotel there great but the staff a little pretentious, so it was with trepidation we arrived at the hotel. I am pleased to say that the hotel was gorgeous, our room though a little small was wonderful and bright and airy, with great views over London. The staff without exception were outstanding, they always acknowledged us and genuinely seemed pleased to see us, such a difference from our experience in the 
Royalton!! A special mention to Gabor, he made us feel very welcome and treated us like old friends,  thank you. We ate in Asia De Cuba and drank in the light bar, again both were very good and again nothing but praise for the attentive and friendly staff. We enjoyed our stay so much we are already booked in again for 
March!",5,2014,02,02
125,Loved it ! Understated Cool !,"I booked an overnight stay for our 20th wedding anniversary in January and contacted Nicole to let her know it was a special occasion for us. She had a room upgrade organised for us and the room was decorated with rose petals and tea lights when we walked in...it was so pretty and romantic. She also had a bottle of champagne on ice in the room for our arrival. It was just perfect..so thank you very much Nicole...you really know about customer service. After seeing Stewart Lee in Leicester Square theatre,(absolutely hilarious BTW) we returned to The Light Bar.. The cocktails were outstanding and once again the staff were great...really efficient. Definitely can't wait to come back and stay longer next time.",5,2014,02,02
125,Nice stay,"Located in Covent garden, it is a convenient location - in walking distance to the tube and many central attractions.  The room's d√©cor was modern and fun.  Would definitely recommend staying there and would probably stay there again next time in London.",5,2014,01,30
125,Best place to stay in central London.,"All the staff are very friendly and the rooms are really comfortable and modern.  The rooms have all the things you want and need, there is air conditioning but you can also open a window if you want to, so you don't wake up with a head like a boiled owl!  Really fantastic.",5,2014,01,23
125,"what a welcome, lovely hotel","Great value from top secret hotels. What's great: lovely staff, waving as you tour the hotel!.small but lovely boutique rooms, beautifully lit and furnished. What didn't work: you can't find the blooming thing! No sign at all and it doesn't look like a hotel. We sat in the bar waiting for cocktails for 25 minutes. The guy who was front of house seemed to be playing on his iPad and there was still no sign of a drink when we walked out.
So my advice......get the same level of care and Capability in the bar as everywhere else. I would definitely go back to the hotel but would drink elsewhere.",4,2014,01,21
125,Trendy & lovely,"Very trendy hotel, and staff extremely friendly.
Room was very small, with huge bed in the middle. Luckily I carry only hand-luggage.Not sure how people cope with big suitcases in this room.
Room is very quiet, air-con works perfectly, bed is comfortable.
Turndown service light the candles in the bathroom - nice!
Coffee and tea making equipment are provided to room upon request.",4,2014,01,20
125,"St Martins Lane London Hotel, nice and Excellent Hotel","I really enjoy my stay at St Martins Lane. I am really impressed of the Front Office Teams welcoming spirit and kindness. The team are so professional and met me with an enormously cordiality. Door/Bell, Ahmet, Igor and Riccardo were gracious, present and eager to assist. Especially Riccardo, I will say the State of the Art with a humorous twinkle in his eye. 
Deborah, fantastic, hearty nice and kind, checked us in quick and efficient.  Isabel, many thanks for offering us the fantastic room and the exquisiteness wine. Alex, the concierge was genuinely interested in offering personalized service. I really felt the team genuinely cared about making my stay special.
Thanks a lot and very much appreciated. All in all I will very much recommend the St Martins Lane to my friends and my business partners and colleagues.
Next time I will visit London I will definitely choose to stay at St Martins Lane. 
Thanks 
Owe Wallinder",5,2014,01,20
125,Great Central Location and Amazing Views,"Stayed here for 2 nights in December. Hotel is very poular and busy, however, staff are really helpful. Ask for a room on the top floor facing the back - the most amazing views of London from Trafalgar square, Houses of Parliment, The London Eye, The Shard, and right down to the city - truly magical at night! Walking distance to Trafalgar Square and right next to the Colluseium, with an array of restarants and bars around to chose from.",5,2014,01,20
125,Great hotel defiantly worth a visit,"My husband and I visited this hotel as a birthday treat and from the minute we walked in nothing was too much trouble for the attentive staff. After we'd checked in and been shown to our room my husband happen to mention to the concierge it was my birthday, he immediately relayed this info to the girls on the desk who then called our room and told us we were being upgraded. We were thrilled with the extra space the deluxe room gave us and were impressed further when we were given 2 complimentary cocktail vouchers for the light bar. This really is a great hotel in an ideal location with super comfy beds and would defiantly go back..",5,2014,01,19
125,If you stay here you'd better be a Phillippe Starck fan,"This hotel made such an impression on me that I wrote a poem about it. Enjoy:

The other day I Googled Philippe Starck
and saw, to my surprise, not in a zoo,
but posing in some city park,
a being bodied much like me or you.

His arms were not unusually long or lean, 
his forehead didn‚Äôt slope, he wore a shirt,
and though it‚Äôs hard, from snaps, to gauge hygiene
his skin and clothes seemed fairly free of dirt.

And in the smiling close-ups I could sense
the thing anticipated least of all;
the spark of real human intelligence.
So much, I thought, for the Neanderthal

I had envisaged, having lately stayed
in one of Starck‚Äôs ridiculous hotels.
The room they gave me there, I swear, was made,
By, and for, an illiterate. How else

explain the fact Herr Starck forsook 
a shelf, or bedside table, or indeed
surface of any kind to rest a book?
To make it still more difficult to read,

the silly light switch dangling overhead
would stretch the sinews of the tallest man:
To activate it, lying in the bed,
you‚Äôd need the arm of an orang-utan.

And when you do get out of bed, beware:  
That stylish floor-to-ceiling window-blind
won‚Äôt close. So lest you really want to share
with all of Covent Garden your behind

be sure to book a room without a view -
or you may find yourself becoming one. 
The bathroom‚Äôs worse; when you have used the loo,
don‚Äôt try to wash your hands - it can‚Äôt be done.

The basin taps are two smooth knobs of chrome
which fingers slightly damp, or touched by soap, 
can‚Äôt grip or turn. The shower‚Äôs the bloody same.  
How do my fellow guests, I wondered, cope?

What mug but me would fork out this much cash -
(the cheapest room‚Äôs two hundred quid a night) 
to stay in a hotel where you can‚Äôt wash,
or read, or work, or hide from public sight? 

And yet the place was full - and fully booked 
for days ahead, said the receptionist.
And when I whined about my room she looked
at me as if I might be mad or pissed.

It obviously doesn‚Äôt happen much.
As eaves-dropped bar and elevator chat
confirmed, this guest was sadly out of touch
with the consensus, which is, broadly, that

because they were designed by great Philippe 
the fittings in my room are objets d‚Äôarts.
His beds are not for reading in (or sleep);
His sinks are not for washing, nor His bar

for leaning on, His shiny cupboard door
does not have knobs because it is not meant
for opening. So what then is it for?
The answer‚Äôs simple: it is ornament

and nothing more. And this might, I suppose,
explain the patronage of this hotel
by those well known for paying through the nose 
for things which make no sense. A clientele

whose shoes cannot be walked in without pain, 
whose trousers hang half-mast between their knees,
whose raincoats weren‚Äôt designed to keep out rain,
whose hairstyles simulate a steady breeze.

And as I watched them teeter to and fro
On scrawny legs with sunken eye and cheek
the penny dropped. But how was I to know
when booking, this was London Fashion Week?

I saw my bill, I caused a little scene,
then walked to Charing Cross and caught a bus.
Starck and his ilk, in jet and limousine,
are making monkeys out of all of us.",3,2014,01,19
125,Still great,"The staff make this hotel very special, from the moment you arrive 'till you leave nothing is too much trouble. The doorman are great, a mine of information and so helpful,parking your car with a real smile. The light bar seems a little dated now but that's really the only quibble I've got with my stay.",4,2014,01,17
125,disrupted stay,"We encountered a very aggressive room-upgrade sales technique at check-in.  The assistant was persistently misleading (possibly deliberately so) about whether upgrade rate quoted was for total stay or per night.  At no point was it mentioned that the rate was exclusive of VAT - it is not standard anywhere to quote ex VAT price without making it clear that VAT is applicable and at what percentage!!! We declined the upgrade once the assistant finally made clear that the fee she was quoting was per night ‚Äì not for the entire stay. (The assistant had come down from ¬£150 to ¬£125 and finally to ¬£100 in her attempt to make us take this room).  On gaining access to our ‚Äúdeluxe double‚Äù we found it to be much smaller than the same room type we had thoroughly enjoyed last July. It was ridiculously small and we felt that we had no choice but to avail of the upgrade, which we did.
On the second morning of our four night stay, we were asked to move to enable staff to set up for an event or large booking (stories differed)  We agreed in order to facilitate the staff, who seemed nice and who stressed that this would be a much more comfortable space.  The next room, although an apartment, was not as well appointed as our original upgraded room.  In fact it felt rather soulless, functional and was grubby and cluttered with a much smaller bathroom.  We let it go as we assumed that we would not be paying the upgrade fee for this new room as the move was at the behest of the hotel.  The hotel then proceeded to send me 6 emails confirming and cancelling the new room at different rates. My head was spinning so I doubled checked with the desk.  They said I should disregard the emails - it was a complementary upgrade.
However on check-out I was charged the upgrade fee for all four nights including the final two.  The front desk assistant was polite however he felt it necessary to point out to me what the full cost of the apartment should have been.  Not my problem the hotel asked me to move!  He finally removed the upgrade fee for the final night.  It should have been for the final two nights.  We ended up feeling that we had a disjointed stay (3 moves in 4 days!) and had been somewhat fleeced.  I usually stay at Firmdale Hotels, although after a positive experience in St Martins last Summer, I had decided to return.  It won't happen again.  I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel and won‚Äôt return.",1,2014,01,16
125,Wonderful service,"This is a really quirky urban hotel unlike any I have stayed at. I like the small touches that they do for their guest.

We got offered Champagne on arrival, Candy sticks also and a free room upgrade.

The service is warm and friendly which it should be. They surprised us in the room with petals on bed and free bottle of bubbly as I explained its for a surprise for my partner.

They really do go that extra mile for there guests. Our rooms was all in white with ambient lighting felt slight cold if you know what I mean but with the lighting it changes the mood, our view was of the Colosseum, nelsons column and of the millennium eye. Really really nice and unsual.

We didn't really stay so much in the room to fully enjoy its facilities though. 

Would recommend this hotel over, service is great and staff are fabulous. Nicole made our trip.

WONDERFUL..",5,2014,01,15
125,You owe me five farthings ring the bells of St Martins..,"Sunday I woke to the faint sound of church bells, am I dreaming, no - I open the window to hear this beautiful sound -the' Oranges & Lemons' nursery rhyme in my head, priceless.
Overall though this hotel wasn't my cup of tea, which was just as well because if you want tea you have to do the dreaded room service, why oh why do some boutique hotels not give tea/coffee in the room.
The room itself was created by a reader of 'Wallpaper' magazine -stark white, flowerpot nailed to the wall, bulky chipboard TV/Minibar in the shape of crucifix, ridiculously large sink.  Gloomy low lit corridors. So at a price range at the Seasons end of the market,  for me there's better options. 
But what do I know, the place was busy with quietly moneyed guests.   The staff team were organised and there is a lively bar/disco. Its also undeniably a great location for a stay in London",3,2014,01,14
125,Poor service and a noisy room,"I did not enjoy my stay in this hotel. The member of staff at check in was quite rude and dismissive. I was expecting a room with one double bed but was told there were two beds, but that was no problem, I could have a double bed, for another fifty pounds! I choose not too. The room itself looked smart, however one of the lights did not work, which made it quite dark. My main issue with the room, is that the soundproofing was terrible. I was woken several times in the night by people talking outside in the alleyway alongside the hotel. What was worse was that construction work was going on next door and people began drilling/riveting scaffolding at 6am. I complained about the noise, at first the staff did not believe me and said it was impossible that the work would start at 6am. I can read a watch, it was 6am. Then they said they would love to offer me some money off my bill, but they couldn't. Great. Why say that at all then? There was an offer to give me a higher up room next time. But overall I sensed they really didn't care about what I said or even believe it. Would not stay again, so many better Five star hotels in London.",2,2014,01,13
125,St martins Lane Hotel,"Excellent hotel, hotel was spotlessly clean, with a fantastic location, so central to everything. As other reviewers commented the beds were extremely comfortable with top quality linen and when we asked for our room to swapped for a room with a bath we were upgraded and request was dealt with quickly. I am unable to comment on the food as we thought breakfast at ¬£25.00 was a little expensive so we eat next door at the Cote Brassiere which was ¬£22.00 for both of us and very good. Only downside of hotel is no external signage so not easy to locate and corridors slightly to dark, also you could hear the next door bedroom using bathroom !!",4,2014,01,12
125,St. Martins =4.5,"St Martins is an excellent hotel in a superb location just steps away from the Charring Cross station.  Excellent food and entertainment options in this neighborhood.  St. Martins is a ""ultra modern"" minimalist hotel.  Its a slight step above the Sanderson owned by the same chain.

Really nice hotel rooms.  Well appointed with GREAT showers and comfortable beds.  They light a little candle in the bathroom on turn down service which is nice to come home to.   Breakfast is anywhere from fair to good for London. Room service is the same.   I did not get the same flavor of the super friendly staff here.  Front desk guy in the morning had a little attitude (which after an international flight is annoying.)  Rather, I got the sense that they were generally attentive, but that is all. 

Negatives:  Thin walls and plenty of late night revelers at this hotel is a big miss. Hotels like this tend to attract that 4AM crowd.  Give me some earplugs at least.  Don't push on the revolving door.  No signs that it is automatic, but if you push you will get stuck.",5,2014,01,11
125,Excellent service,"Stayed here last week with my Daughter , purchased hotel on lastminute.com couldn't believe the offer - Fantastic location  5 min walking distance to both the shows we were seeing. Staff excellent, attentive and very friendly ( receptionist and doormen were exceptional the best service I have ever received in a London hotel)  Room excellent daughter loved the lighting and decor - small issue with room service quickly resolved and not an issue . Would have liked comps drinks tray in room and would have been disappointed if had paid full price. However we will be back for out next stay with or without a special offer -- thank you to you all for a lovely stay wish it was longer.",5,2014,01,11
125,The best hotel staff I have ever come across!,"It's not often I feel compelled to write a review, but I have stayed at the St Martin's Lane Hotel three times in the last six months and the reason I keep coming back is because of the staff. Those of you who travel a lot, as I do, will find that the welcome and care offered by the staff of this hotel is second to none. From the moment you check in to the moment you check out, you feel as though you're their top priority. They remember little details about you from your last stay which really makes the place feel like home and the staff feel like friends. I can't speak highly enough of Nicole and Ed in particular who are just a joy and highly efficient!

As everyone has commented, the hotel is in such a great central location and convenient for tourists and business travellers alike. Hotel guests have access to Gymbox, the gym next door which is arguably the best gym in London with a fantastic array of classes and equipment (boxing ring, power plates, trampolines even!) As many have commented, the rooms are on the small side but they're very well appointed with great Malin & Goetz products for the product junkies among us! Housekeeping does an amazing job at this hotel - they're incredibly discreet and are in and out of your room very quickly but they're super efficient at the same time.  The hotel restaurant, Asia di Cuba, remains one of my favourite restaurants - you can't beat the Cuban BBQ chicken followed by the Mexican doughnuts! Again, the staff here are friendly and efficient, remembering not just your name but what tea you drink in the morning, which room number etc. Finally, the decor of the hotel is just cool, the vibe is lively if you want it to be, but equally it's a great place to just chill out. 
I love staying at the St Martin's Lane hotel. As a former Londoner turned Californian this is always my hotel of choice when I am back in town. It has the cool factor without the pretension and just has great people working there!",5,2014,01,11
125,Very cool in London,"Prime location nearby to key connection. Tiny rooms but trendy, with design furniture. Very supported staff at the frontdesk. Overpriced. For relax staying book top-end rooms. Furthermore make sure you book in advance your stay here.",4,2014,01,10
125,A Great Stay,"My wife and I stayed at St Martins lane for our honeymoon recently and were hugely impressed. 
The front desk staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating (Nicole and I forget the name of the doorman) - genuine, friendly and welcoming - what a pleasure.
The hotel design is sleek, clean and trendy.
The rooms are large (well ours was) - the bathrooms were as good as i've ever seen. Clean but functional as well. 
Finally, you can't beat the location. Situated on a quiet street in Covent Garden - Oxford st, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Sq are all a few minutes walk away. 
Cant wait to go back.",5,2014,01,06
125,Great staff and stay,"I stayed at The St. Martin Lane Hotel over Christmas 2013 and had one of my best experiences ever! 

Starting with Igor the doormen upon my arrival hotel staff has been very attentive to my needs and very friendly. 

Alex at Concierge is amazing and even got me a ticket for The Nutcracker for December 23rd first row; all the places he recommended me were all local places and good. 
I only had breakfast but both buffet and a la carte selections were satisfactory. 

The only thing I did not like was  that they charge you for WFI which whould be free at 21st century...

Overall food and ambiance is great but what made my stay a memorable one was the staff ! I once again thank Alex, Igor and Ahmet , hope to visit back soon.",4,2014,01,06
125,Superb stay at St Martins Lane Hotel,"What can I say...I booked this hotel as a surprise for my mothers birthday, she was very pleasantly surprised! When I booked the room we we given a complementary upgrade with a bottle of champagne to make the most of our celebrations. The hotel is very stylish, even thought they are starting renovations to improve it even more. The beds are one of a kind, and I had a very comfortable nights sleep. The staff are very friendly and helpful, without being intrusive. I must mention Nicole who made our stay really special. I would definitely recommend this hotel. And I will make sure I return. Many thanks St Martins Lane!!",5,2014,01,05
125,Luckiest guests maybe : fantastic stay for sure !!,"We just left St Martins Lane, but couldn't wait longer to thank Debra and Fabrizio !! Thank you for your warm welcoming smiles and for hosting us the way you did, especially knowing how we ended in your great hotel ! The room was amazing : perfectly quiet, perfectly clean and perfectly styled ! Thank you again and we hope to see you again !!",5,2014,01,05
125,Chic design,"We liked this hotel as a change from the normal nice but anonymous style of most hotels in London. Everything's carefully thought about - big things and small details - from the handleless doors in the ground floor loos and adjustable mood lighting in bedrooms to the teabag and sugar containers. We upgraded and had a great room with huge floor to ceiling windows. Toiletries smell delicious and the bed was dreamily comfortable. Air con worked well. We got a good deal - ¬£159 - as a secret hotel on Lastminute.com (the upgrade when we arrived  was an extra ¬£40, so still good value). As previously mentioned, no wifi in the room but as we were there just one night this wasn't really a problem, just seems a shame not to offer this yet as a free part of every stay. We didn't bother with the ¬£25 (each) breakfast as we wanted to get on with the day and it's steep for a bit of muesli and a cup of tea (which we found quite satisfactorily in a nearby Nero) and was all we wanted. The staff were professional and welcoming. A missing towel was immediately replaced. 
I suppose my only reservations would be a lack of decent lighting in the room, again not really a problem for one night; stylish taps on the basins are entirely smooth, so hard to turn with wet or soapy hands; and finally, although it does everything well, to me St Martins Lane felt slightly soulless, which I guess is a personal thing. The bar and restaurant didn't attract us enough to want to go in - I didn't feel we would fit in and feel comfortable. ",4,2014,01,05
125,Last. Business trip of 2014,"Have stayed in the St Martins Lane a few times an every time I have really enjoyed.   Rooms are modern, full of light and practical. Service is superb. Both room service and Asia de Cuba restaurant are great.  Concierge, receptionist and bell service are friendly  and proactive.  Making you feel welcome every time you come back during the stay or need anything.  The use of the near by great gym , the box, ( only a few meters away), is also very convenient.   Location, just by Covent Garden and close to businesses, theater, restaurants is also very welcome .  Always looking forward to return !,",5,2014,01,04
125,Chic and cheerful...,"There's no doubting the St Martin's lane is a stylish, central and accommodating abode to lay ones head. The beds are comfy, the Malin & Goetz products are delightful and the staff are incredibly attentive. The bar, however, is an awful mix of hangers on and wannabes wishing they could afford to stay at the hotel. Avoid at all costs!",4,2014,01,04
125,Loved it!,"Booked it as a secret hotel for our first anniversary and I can't fault this hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is really interesting and although I'm not a fan of modern stuff, I really liked the d√©cor of the rooms and the hotel. Great location: turned out that my favourite restaurant is just next to the hotel!!",5,2014,01,03
125,Contemporary hotel with thoughtful details,"My husband and I enjoyed a weekend in December in this contemporary and very central hotel. We were lucky enough to have a patio room and even though it's was tipping it down, it was nice to have a bit of outside space. Our room overlooked the stage door of the Collesium which was an interesting view and the bells of St martins in the field rang out in the morning. Our room was small but extremely cleverly laid out so it did not feel restricted. Staff were friendly and the rooms had everything you could possibly need even cigarettes! I also liked the fact we had fresh milk to make tea and coffee with. The location was fabulous. Central without being noisy.",5,2014,01,03
125,Excellent experience. Special hotel,We were there for my birthday. Excellent experience. The hotel has a very special design. Rooms have a minimalistic look and feature high-design furniture and elements. The friendly staff made our stay a most pleasant one and recommended a good plan for us to see. Restaurants of the hotel are great although a bit on the pricey side. I would note especially Amy who made a very heart-warming surprise for my birthday and found some great tickets to Wicked which we loved.,5,2014,01,03
125,Terrific find,"Cool, chic, minimalist modernity, supported by a fabulous team of staff that the hotel group should be proud of - friendly without intrusion, helpful n yet knows when to withdraw. Any request resolved with no fuss. Facade so discrete (no signage) which is unnecessary therefore difficult to find (look out for  Gym box next door!) However, what a treasure once, one steps into and soak up the calm, spacious n delightfully designed environment with good mood lighting. Fab bar, even nicer restaurant (Asia de Cuba) - New Year's Eve taster menu was amazing, with a good range of wines. Very very clean, quality bedding, fab mattress. Great location for all the sights n theatre land. Staff mentioned that it will be progressively refurbished in 2014, floor by floor- may I suggest you get rid of the flower pot in the room (we hit our heads on it many times!); redesign the shelf over the basin as we hit our heads when bending down to clean our teeth; corridor carpets could be better fitted! However, we shall be back for more - cool place, great location, wonderful service - it rocks!",5,2014,01,01
125,"trendy hotel, perfect location",Saint Martin's Lane is such a great find. It's a balance of simple and at the same time outrageous. The rooms are decorated in a modern fashion but cozy as well with unique lighting options. The service is wonderful and the hotel bar is to die for.,5,2013,12,31
125,There's no place I'd rather be than here!!!!!!,"First, let me start by saying the service is first class and I'm a service junky. I always get the best treatment from checking in, to breakfast to check out. Everyone on staff puts in their all to make sure your every need is taken care of. Caroline Evans front office manager who I have been dealing with in our planning and needs for this Christmas holiday is the best!!! The best!!! Somebody give this lady a raise and a promotion. Then there is Ricardo Martin!!! He is as beautiful and handsome on the outside and even more beautiful and caring of all your needs on the inside. He gives you all the New York beauty standing at the Door to help you but without the attitude. Quite the opposite you will want to wrap him up and take him home. He is fantastic!!! Somebody give this man a raise and a promotion. Then there is Amit who is also at the door and has a heart of Gold and couldn't be more helpful. Others I must mention at the front desk are Nicole(great) fabrizio(so nice) Paris ( fabulous). The entire staff at breakfast are so helpful and always ready to serve you. Concierge is very helpful and very knowledgeable especially helped by Joey and Alex. Our room was perfect and we were allowed to see room before we settled in to make sure it met our standards and needs. The location is perfect!!!!!! Trust me, my partner and I love to shop and see shows, could not be in a better locale. I guess you get the point from reading my review, there is no better place I rather be in all of London than St. Martin Lane. Sorry Sandersen, but still love you tooooo.  Andrew",5,2013,12,30
125,Cool. Exclusive. Friendly. But -1....,"This is a special place. An oasis of style and calm amongst the chaos of London's busiest quarters. So special that unless you know what you are looking for you just might miss the nondescript 60s tower that hides a funky interior and groovy rooms.  You get what you pay for and you are not left feeling short changed. 

But. I have to whine about charging for wifi again.  Hotels need to wake up to the fact that because you can charge for wifi does not mean you should - in this day and age.  I would not expect to pay for towels and neither do I expect to pay for wifi.  Not when a room costs this much.  So I have dropped a star from what was so nearly a 5* visit. ",4,2013,12,28
125,Nice boutique hotel,"We stayed 4 nights over xmas and enjoyed the hotel. Very friendly personnel, , good service, fancy room lightning, nice bathroom, good bar with cool music and interesting cuisine (asian/latin fusion), hotel is of course very well situated. We recommend it.",4,2013,12,26
125,Excellent Hotel in the heart of London,"Very smart hotel, great location. Staff are fab, they have a very demanding clientele and they all seem to have the patience of a saint. the rooms were very smart, very comfortable and very clean. Added benefit is the bar which is very cool.
Great place, very cool!",4,2013,12,26
125,THE place to stay in Central London,"Great rooms, very friendly staff, very well located in Central London and super clean.
The restaurant (Asia de Cuba) is strongly recommended and so is the bar if you fancy a last drink. I always stay there when coming to London and would definitely recommend it.",5,2013,12,24
125,Got a Great Last Minute Deal,"Coming to London around the Christmas holiday, we expected difficulty in finding a decent hotel at a decent price.  But the St Martin's Lane hotel offered their extraordinary rooms at a normal hotel price, and we couldn't pass up the opportunity.  The hotel is nondescript outside, but the moment you walk into the lobby you are immersed in the beautiful experience of comfort, service, and style.  

The staff were amazingly friendly, helpful, attentive, and responsive with every interaction.  I know the next time we come back to London, we will be checking for specials here, and might even be tempted to pay full price if we have to ... it's just too good!",5,2013,12,23
125,superb hotel in ideal location,"We booked this a secret hotel via lastminute.com at a fantastic price ( although not the ¬£89 from another recent review). It is right in the heart of theatre land minutes from Leicester Square tube station and two minutes walk from Nelsons column. We booked room only and had a lovely view over the city. The beds are very comfortable the only criticism of the room is there are no tea/coffee making facility unless you ask, which we did. Breakfast is very expensive at ¬£25 per person, but there is a cafe next door and a Garfunkels chain restaurant next to that, both providing very good breakfasts for ¬£6 plus drinks. We will be going back to London again soon and will try the secret hotels again and hope that we get this one again.",5,2013,12,23
125,Bargin stay from last minute.com,"I had an excellent stay at St Martin's Lane. I got an amazing deal via lastminute.com for a Sunday night in mid December. I paid ¬£89 for a room which is usually ¬£250 according to the hotel's website. It was via one of their ""Top Secret"" Deals. When the receptionist saw the room rate she said it was one of the best she had ever seen. She even upgraded me to the next room also so I really got an excellent deal. Check-in was quick, friendly and efficient.
The room was really good. It was very spacious and I liked the minimalist decor. The views across London were excellent and the bathroom was huge.
The bed was incredibly comfortable and large enough for 4!! 
I had a drink down in the light bar which was nice but it is rather expensive in there. When I 

returned to my room the maid had turned over the corner of the bed cover and little candles had been lit in the bathroom. It all looked very beautiful and it certainly felt like a 5-star experience.

I'll definitely be looking out for that same deal again as I loved my stay at St Martin's Lane. It is 
high quality and every conveniently located. I'd love to stay for longer but not sure I can afford to at the regular price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it though.

The Receptionist was also good at check out and seemed to be genuinely interested in how my stay had been. 

I agree with other reviewers that it is a shame that there are no free tea and coffee making facilities in the room. All others aspects of my stay were great though.",5,2013,12,22
125,Excellent hotel in a great location,"We have been staying in this hotel several times since 2007 and we've enjoyed every time! 
The staff is really nice, the hotel decoration is minimal and the rooms are fantastic.The view over London from the upper rooms is just magnificent!
The hotel has also a great location! We step outside the hotel and we're in the middle of London's vibrant atmosphere. We can not think of some other place to stay :)",5,2013,12,22
125,Boutique London Hotel in a great location,"Its pretty much all about the location here... You're smack in the middle of London, basically in the theatre district. I've stayed here for business. I've had the smaller rooms with no bath tub and the next size room up with the tub...both were exceptional. There's no gym in the hotel but you can get a gym pass for the Gym Box next door and its a great place to get your workout on. The staff are really nice and the service was accommodating. The mini-bar and the restaurant downstairs are definitely on the pricey side but because you're centrally located you can get anything you want close by.",4,2013,12,21
125,style over substance,"I chose the hotel for the location and at just one night I thought I would experience the luxury, the rooms are nice and big , no bath, no electrical socket near the kettle, there was internet connection but it was chargeable (¬£10) as was everything including the milk (¬£5) to make a hot drink with, we didnt bother with the breakfast which I think was about ¬£25. The whole experience felt like we were being rinsed at every turn. dissapointing.",3,2013,12,19
125,Funky Hotel in a great Location (6 stars for location),"this was a great hotel - really enjoyed it. From the outside does not look up to much but inside is just brilliant - so unlike most hotels you will visit. The reception is stark but works perfectly for this hotel - the check in staff were friendly and not too officious. 

The hotel bar and restaurant were buzzing and if you do not fancy these then you are so centrally located you can go anywhere in a couple of minutes (Leicester Square - 2 minutes !!). 

Room, bed and shower were excellent and the quirky television, mini bar in the shape of the cross is weird but sort of works. Checking out was relaxed and even though I was a little late checking out it did not bother them. 

Would definitely go back anytime in London.",5,2013,12,19
125,"Great location, nice rooms and very good service.",Our company had our global conference in London and those of us traveling from other markets were lucky enough to be booked into St Martins Lane.  On arrival we were impressed by the very friendly and efficient service at check in.  I was lucky enough to get an upgrade and was pleasantly surprised by how large my room was considering the central london location.  Over the 4 nights I stayed there I had consistently good service throughout the hotel.  The bar and restaurant weren't cheap but I guess that is what you expect to pay in Covent Garden and for that class of hotel.  I don't know how much the rooms were as these were pre-paid.  I guess my only criticisms were the lighting in the rooms is terrible and I was a bit annoyed to find they had charged an extra 25 pounds after I left for two waters (small) and an orange juice.  Obviously the price of the items was massively inflated but it was more that they didn't send a note to tell me they had charged my credit card.  I actually told them at check out that I had had two waters (not sure where the OJ came in) and they said they would get housekeeping to check as some items had already been added.  When they didn't come back I assumed all was in order.  Just a heads up would have been nice but overall a very good experience.,4,2013,12,16
125,Four days in two separate visits in the past month - great hotel and service,"My wife and I have stayed here in two separate stays in the last month, both for two days each and both in a king loft suite.

the hotel has a great location in the heart of the city, the service from the front desk to room service, porters, restaurants are excellent

we ate for breakfast in the restaurant and for dinner also - both excellent and good pricing

the hotel is chic but not over the top like some of the modern London hotels such as the W - which was truly dreadful

highly recommended for this or its sister hotel the Sanderson, great, great, great

keep up the good service !",5,2013,12,16
125,Perfect stay!,"We are just home from another perfect stay at St. Martins Lane Hotel! 

Returning to the hotel, I used the offer earlier made by the hotel manager, to inform about our visit. I mentioned that it was for my wife's birthday wich was really greatly taken into consideration. We were offered a nice welcome card and a wonderful bottle of red wine. Also my wish for a room on a high floor was fulfilled - we stayed at the top floor with a wonderful view over London. So we already got great service - before we even arrived.

The hotel again was of high quality. The rooms are well equipped and the bed was very good and gave us a very good sleep. Breakfast is of very high quality and service very friendly. Location is top and cannot be beaten. You are right in the heart of London and of everything. Bellmen very helpful - we had a problem with our transport to the airpoirt and they were really caring about us.

Only two little problems: The bar is always really full and it's impossible to find a table as an inhouse guest. And upon check-in we were again not informed correctly about our rate plan (incl. breakfast and wi-fi). Would be nice if check-in staff knows about rates and tells you what you get (and what not).

But apart from that - we just again had a great stay!",5,2013,12,16
125,"Modern hotel, staff always friendly and responsive","Hotel never dissapoints, stay here regularly on business, and the hotel and service is always impressive. Rooms aren't the biggest but are well arranged and the bathrooms and toiletries are really nice. The staff are incredibly responsive and can't do enough to get you anything you need. The bar and restaurant is very fashionable and quite lively with a great food and cocktail selection. Its a 3 min walk to Leicester Square tube. ",5,2013,12,15

125,Superb hotel in great location,"Stayed here for a birthday treat got a great deal from last minute .com as this was one if their secret hotels. Hotel was in a fantastic location just off Leicester Square so theatres and restaurants all within walking distance. Hotel rooms clean bright with a clever use of space. Everything you could need provided, beds very comfortable, had a great nights sleep and when requested tea and coffee making facilities they came so quickly I swear someone was waiting in the corridor with the tray! Whilst being shown to our room my husband happened to mention that we here for my birthday and to my delight after returning to our room after a night at the theatre someone had left a slice of cake with a candle and a lovely note wishing me a happy birthday which was so thoughtful so a big thank you to Nicole for your lovely gesture. Overall an excellent hotel which we would definitely recommend and look forward to staying there again soon.",5,2013,12,14
125,"St Martin's, trip to excellence","With its perfect location and arty interior design, this was absolutely a brilliant experience. Rooms are very clean, spacious and the beds simply heaven.
Never encountered such an engaged and friendly staff in any hotel, from the moment you walk in you feel welcome and at home.
The restaurant serves great food and the bar is alive and very hip.
Pricey, but worth every penny.",5,2013,12,13
125,Ready for it's Makeover . . .,"The bellman and the doorman at this hotel are wonderful!

The front desk staff could learn a lot about organization and customer service.  Not horrible, but I worked in hotels for 5 years, so in my opinion the service was sub-par.

We were told that the hotel is going to get a re-do which I think it's really in need of.

The bed was good.  The bathroom was great.  I liked the room.

It didn't seem like a luxury hotel.

The neighborhood . . . is fabulous.",3,2013,12,12
125,Business Trip,excellent stay - service was the best I have received from all hotels in London. location is perfect. good sized room + gym right next door. highly recommend for business travellers or anyone else looking to stay in central london :),5,2013,12,12
125,"Great location, amazing staff, a little disorganised in booking and emails","St Martin¬¥s is pricey but has such a fab location and great staff that make it worthwhile.  Special mention for the extra comfy beds and the great smelling toiletries.  Extra special mention for Jos√© who had come up from the Sanderson on a very busy Friday night and managed their booking error so well that we were very happy campers.  The telephone reservation thing didn¬¥t work well for me (""I don¬¥t have availability"") when I, at the same time, on the webpage had tons of availability.  Also received emails (only about 2 of the three separate reservations) which only made me more nervous - why isn¬¥t the third one here?  Maybe its not been booked?  Resulting in phone calls and more expense.  So Morgan¬¥s Group - your staff are wonderfully trained so let us talk to them directly in each hotel instead of the call centre thing!  All in all, very highly recommended!!",4,2013,12,12
125,Faultless,"I just returned from London where I stayed at Saint Martins Lane hotel. Initially I was a bit taken back by the design, but once in the hotel feeling it, I got it. The staff is amazing, smiley and engaged. The rate was less than my usual preferred hotel and the location spot on. The gym is huge, the restaurant and bar hip, busy and the places to be. In short; I will be back.",5,2013,12,12
125,YOU SHOULD STAY HERE,"This is the fourth time this year I have stayed here, the staff remembered me the second time, the third time- the welcome was like coming home to family!  Hotel is funky and takes a little getting used to, but the rooms are very nice, nice linens, and a great bath.  Can not beat the location.  Management must work hard to make sure guests have a pleasant stay, which is evident by the staffs engagement with guests.  You should stay here and find out yourself!",5,2013,12,12
125,Great hotel great location,"Friendly staff, amazing design and attention to detail. 

Perfect location for sight seeing and restaurants and bars.

Free access to well equipped gym in basement called Gymbox. 

Easily the best hotel I have stayed at in central London for this price.

125,Just the best..,"After some time away from London, I made a return visit to St. Martin's. 

So good to be back, and to feel valued and cherished as a customer.  Despite it being a while since my last visit, being greeted by first name and a huge smile on walking through the main doors makes you feel very welcome.

After staying in so many bland and faceless so called 5-star hotels around the world, you realise just how good this hotel is. The team are all switched on and friendly, and to borrow another companies phrase...""it just works..!""

Great rooms, great bar (the Light bar) and great dining, on the doorstep of anywhere you would want to be in London with a short walk.

London hospitality at its best. 

Thanks team, in my book you are the best, and still my favourite hotel.",5,2013,12,11
125,Amazing hotel. We'll be back!,"This was our first time staying at St Martins Lane and it definitely won't be our last. 
We arrived on Friday 6th December for a weekend break, our 1st in 6 months without the children and much needed. Check-in was smooth and the reception staff were very friendly. First impression of the all white room room was ""hmmm this is bright, I'm not sure how I'm going to feel waking up in here after a big night out?"" As it was, the black out blinds did the trick and I didnt wake til 9.30am, which is a 1st for me in about 6 years (thanks to the kids). Our room was 522 and as it was at the end of the corridor it was very quiet with no passing traffic so we were left in peace. 
The location of the hotel was perfect for us: Covent Garden shopping, a short walk to the South Bank Christmas Market and an easy tube ride to the O2. The concierge, Mike, was so helpful and gave us great directions to follow to the O2. We also had a great recommendation to a steak restaurant - Mash on Brewer Street and we'll definitely be going back there too. 
The bar was also fab, playing old school classics on Friday night. 
Can't recommend the hotel highly enough. It's not cheap but it is special.",5,2013,12,10
125,Still the best hotel in London,"I have stayed at St. Martins Lane four or five times over the past 10 years and it is the only hotel that I have revisited where the reality beats the happy memories.  This weekend, we stayed in Room 205 which is a corner room, with views over Covent Garden which is as lovely at nighttime as it is first thing on a sunny Sunday morning.  Below is what makes it stand out for me when compared to other 5* hotels:
- The staff are so friendly and helpful. They're all beautiful and ""cool"" obviously but unlike other hotels in this price bracket (about ¬£400 for room only) - they all look absolutely delighted to see you and are genuinely enthusiastic about you having a great time.
- The room decor is unusual. Sure, not to everyone's taste (minimal) but I love all the white and glass. No clutter, no mess. Everything ""hidden"". 
- A proper hair dryer that you can plug in anywhere and a decent range of toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser etc - enough for two people)
- Terrific bathroom, great big bath, huge sink, candles and matches beside the bath, a shelf to put your G&T...
- Midday checkout time. Bliss.

The only negatives are the fact that breakfast was not included in the room price (fine for us as we always sleep through breakfast) and ¬£10 charge for wifi!!!!  I happily spend money like water (ask my husband) but even I thought this was a bit much. 

That said, I cannot recommend this place enough, especially for a bit of romance. We had to go to a party around the corner on this visit but we could've happily just spent a day in our room, watching London beneath us. ",5,2013,12,09
125,Superb location and great staff,"Stayed for one night. Smooth check in and door staff sending out Christmas vibe with champagne welcome :) 

Great location, one min from Leicester Sq and a short walk to Coventry Garden.

You pay for chic vibe and location.  Rooms are well equipped with bathrobes etc and as we were only staying for one night I could cope with the compact room layout. I agree that if I were staying longer, the economical use of space would annoy me. Tight space around desk & large TV compartment. 

To counteract this, great shower wet room and bathroom area, love the mood light settings.

Considering the location is right in Theatre land, we had a peaceful night sleep. 

This was a 'secret hotel' booking from Lastminute, a nice find as I probably wouldn't have selected a boutique hotel in such a busy area.",4,2013,12,08
125,St Martins Lane Hotel London,"This hotel has a great contemporary look and feel. Room was very comfortable and well appointed, the bed was particularly comfortable - gorgeous high thread count sheets! The hotel is a short walk from Leicester Square tube and close to Covent Garden and the theatre district. It's a great base if you're looking for somewhere close to the main attractions. The staff at the hotel were very welcoming - Ed and Amy deserve a special mention. They really made our stay a memorable one (thanks for the Hakkasan recommendation!). 

We work in London on a regular basis, but this hotel has become our place of choice when we're here for pleasure.",5,2013,12,08
125,Best experience,"I have stayed here a number of times this year and it really is a fantastic place to come back to.
Nothing is too much trouble for the excellent front desk team , and you always get a warm welcome
This time it was an unexpected arrival at 0130 hours without a reservation, and this was handled by the excellent reception lady  ( sorry can't remember her name but from Down Under ) as if it was 6 in the evening and I had a reservation..
The room was beautifully clean and breakfast was really good

Breakfast not inc. they were asking ¬£25 per person for full English. So decided to opt for garfunkles breakfast, next door but one, which came in at about ¬£11 each !  Four drinks in the hotel , came in at ¬£34. No tea and coffee facilities , had to ask. All special tea's - but no good old English tea!
Rooms very small for standard room, but lovely decorated. Bed very comfy. Wouldnt stay again, only on the basis that I think they just overcharge",3,2013,11,25
125,Compromised Functionality for Design,"Stayed here for a long weekend with my husband. The first room (414) was so small I felt like I was a patient in a mental asylum. Not to mention that they decided to add a very large robot shaped TV cabinet which took up a significant amount of what was very little space already. In the morning, I could hear word for word the conversation the rooms next door was having due to the very thin walls. Housekeeping kept slamming doors waking up anyone who was trying to sleep in. On top of that, one housekeeper barged into my room without knocking while my husband was in the shower. Thank god the security latch was on, and when I walked out and confronted her about this, all she said was ""OH the security latch scared me!"" No apologizes.

We requested a different room and was shown a few on the first floor. The front desk attended first informed me that the rooms on the first floor, albeit bigger, was more susceptible to noise from the bar which played until 2-3am. My husband and I decided that we did not want to be awake until 3am and said that it's okay, we can wait until a new room opened up, she then changed her story and said that the rooms on the first floor would not be able to hear any of the music played? We were very confused but ended up in room 125 which was significantly larger (did not hear any music...)

The room itself is very minimalist in design, which I know is generally the aesthetic of Phillipe Starke. However, there was no powerpoint in the bathroom so I had to blow dry my hair near the desk. There was also no powerpoint near the minibar to plug the kettle in. The airconditioning unit stayed on for around 10 minutes and automatically shut itself off which was frustrating. 

However, there are some good points - the shower pressure is amazing. The location is very central. The bar downstairs was well serviced. 

Would I stay here again? Unfortunately no.",3,2013,11,25
125,Definitively coming back!,"The hotel is great, service is nice, the environment is excellent, rooms are well cleaned, the bed is super comfortable, and the stuff is quite nice and always available. Their restaurant Asia de Cuba is excellent and their set up and design is amazing! Perfectly located at literally one minute for Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square, has also an excellent concierge happy to help for theatre tickets or other bookings! Highly recommended! ",5,2013,11,24
125,Good Location,"We enjoyed a 2 night break at this hotel. The welcome from the staff was first class and having ones bags taken to the room was a rare treat.

The room was smallish, white and minimalist and had the potential to be annoying with small inset door handles and taps that were difficult to turn with wet hands. The bed however was very comfortable. It may have been the case that there were comfortable areas to sit and relax but we didnt  find them , the area around reception was a bit stark for our taste.

A visit to the bar cost us ¬£25 for a malt whiskey and a small liqueur. You expect London prices but this was a bit heavy. .

The location was just great since you step out the door and you are in the middle of theatreland

Finally was it me or is there nothing on the outside of the building to tell you that it is actually a hotel.

125,Excellent location but a bit out of date and too minimalist,"Stayed there with my wife for a couple of nights and cannot say we felt it was money well spent. Having said that the first impression was really good and that their service was excellent. 

We arrived very early in the morning and we were allowed an early check-in. The staff was friendly and welcoming. However, when we get to the room, it was not as good as we expected. The room was small and difficult to walk around. We could see that it was probably a hip hotel a good few years ago with its rather untypical design details. However, it felt kind of out of style and not very functional to us. The whole room was white and pretty empty. We had to ask for coffe/tea, cups and kettle etc., which they did provide us with. We did stay at the standard room so not sure what other rooms were like. However, the bed was comfortable to sleep in which was important.

We could not complain about the location at all though. It was right at the heart of London's West End and within easy access to everywhere we needed to go. 

The downstairs restaurant Asia De Cuba was a favourite of ours from before and we had dinner there again. We had the theatre special so it was just a quick and easy dinner. The quality of food and the atmosphere were still nice.

Overall, you pay for the location of the hotel and not the room itself. Services were really good though. There are other hotels around Trafalgar Square that are better value for your hard earned money!",3,2013,11,22
125,Always Five Stars,"I first had the pleasure of visiting this gorgeous hotel when invited to a dear friend's thirtieth birthday party in 2002.  I fell in love with the place that night.  Numerous business events have also brought me back time and again...the charm of St Martin's Lane never wanes.

Much more recently though, it was time for my mother to celebrate her 70th birthday and as a gift, I purchased tickets on her behalf for the Royal Philarmonic Orchestra at the Albert Hall.  It seemed only right to pair this with a night's stay for her at SML.

As always, the booking process was a delight but moreover the staff involved in making my mother's stay a truly magical experience were just outstanding.  Not only did she receive the most wonderful birthday cake on arrival but her room was kindly upgraded from a Standard Double to The Loft.  I was overwhelmed by this kindness.

Special thanks to Sarah in Reservations, Ed the Bell Captain and Andrew the hotel's manager for going above and beyond and giving my mum the most wonderful time.  

We will be back very, very soon.",5,2013,11,21
125,Repeat customer - worth every penny!,"I have stayed at SML a number of times over the last 5 years. It has a great locations - close to Leicester Square, Tube Station, Covent Garden, Shopping etc. Rooms are immaculately clean, funky, modern decor, and bathrooms are large for London standards. Gymbox is also included in the cost of the stay - great gym. The cocktail lounge downstairs is a must stop when you are in town.

One of the most amazing things I have noticed is how attentive the porters/bellhops are - remembered my name and face time and time again and I only stay once or twice a year! Nothing is too much effort for them. Service is exceptional and the conceirge desk has given many good recommendations for restaurants and bars - puts in the extra effort to get reservations with the London hot spots - even with very short notice. They seem to have good contacts around town. Would highly recommend a stay here for your next London trip!",5,2013,11,20
125,Great hotel!,"I think Morgan Hotel Group are one of my favourite hotels I have been to. I've stayed at The Hudson & The Royalton in New York & The Sanderson in London previously, which are all great, so wanting to be in Central London, decided to give this one a try.
Funky decor, great service from all staff & a well equipped luxury room. Was a bit of a whistle top trip, so wished I could have spent more time in the place. Top notch place to stay!",5,2013,11,20
125,Trendy & Great Location,"I would definitely recommend St Martins Lane - it is in a great location.  I must mention Nicole, who I emailed on several occasions for various questions who was extremely prompt and efficient with her responses and even got us an upgrade.  We loved the bar, however, I do not think tables should be reserved.  We were sat down then told that our seats had been reserved so we had to move.  This was not a problem as we managed to get another seat but as the bar appears to always be busy another time this would not have been possible. We had breakfast and what we particularly liked was that the fried breakfast was cooked to order, unlike some hotels where it is a buffet. Although pricey it was very nice.
All in all a great stay!",4,2013,11,20
125,Old London at its surprising Best,"Trendy lively Hotel in the heart of Old London ,as recorded in history ,nursery rhymes and Dickens' classic tales  I was treated to a short stay at the St Martins by my son to mark a  signifcant Birthday ,sister in law also came--- to keep order! The Hotel was stunning ,lighting ,decoration , food ,immaculate bedroom .We had never seen such crisp white linen .But it was the service which set this hotel apart .we were greeted as welcome and expected guests and made to feel comfortable from the start .Ed the senior ""bell Boy ""was a star nothing was too much trouble for him or his collegues ,Equally the bar staff in the evening were very kind to a couple of old biddies in the presence of the other wise young  and lively young ,who were having the time of thier lives My one slight negative thought ,Where are the more senior management at the week end? They also need to be seen 24/7/365 to support staff and guests alike",5,2013,11,19
125,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for three nights a few months ago (I forgot to post the review at the time).
The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful from the start.  We were greeted as we got out of our taxi and helped with our cases. 
I am disabled and we were allocated an accessible room.  This room was one of the best I‚Äôve seen in any hotel in that it had all the necessary aids ‚Äì walk in shower with seat, grab rails, etc but still looked like a luxurious hotel room.
The lighting in the room was particularly good, extremely adjustable from dim (but colourful) mood lighting to full brightness.
There were plenty of plug sockets and an extension plug board was provided in the wardrobe.  The bed was extremely comfortable.
The bathroom was very well designed and the Malin + Goetz toiletries provided were excellent.  So good that they were used rather than the products I had with me and I have since purchased full sizes of them all.
We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on two of the three mornings.  Quality and choice were excellent, and the service very good.
We had dinner in Asia de Cuba on one of the nights.  The food was excellent both in terms of quality and quantity.  The staff were knowledgeable and helpful.  The only criticism I could make of the restaurant was the lack of signage on the loo doors ‚Äì some of it appeared to have fallen off.  Luckily there was no one in the room with the urinals when I walked in.  I did mention the lack of signs to the concierge, so hopefully this has been fixed.
I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2013,11,19
125,Great staff. And a great location.,"My wife and me were both working in London and booked this as a wee treat. The hotel looks pretty good and the rooms are really well designed, cool, if a little small.

What makes this hotel is the staff, who were relaxed and made our stay simple and fun.",4,2013,11,18
125,"Great hotel, average restaurant","Booked a ""loft king suite"". To me a loft means it is on the upper floors, however when we arrived we were booked into a 1st floor suite ..... In all fairness, I complained to front desk and the very helpful receptionist moved us to a 3rd floor room and gave us cocktail vouchers to make up for error. She did however say that there are loft king suites on every floor.......  
Great hotel room, good cocktail bar downstairs, we ate in Asia de Cuba - buzzing atmosphere as expected on a sat night, very good service but very average food. Its a shame as the portion of Tuna was generous for London standards but tasted very plain and the other dishes just felt mixed up Asian cuisine. The beef starter had too much salad which was drowned in dressing.
I will say that the staff in the restaurant and hotel were 1st class, we asked to move tables in the restaurant and they did so with very little fuss and all staff very helpful and genuine. I would stay again as fantastic location for theatre district / Covent  garden but I would eat somewhere else.",4,2013,11,18
125,Stunning,"My partner and I stayed at the Hotel on 2nd November. It was our anniversary so I had booked a weekend away at the St Martins Lane hotel along with a west end musical and shopping.  A work colleague had stayed at their sister hotel, The Sanderson, just of Oxford street, and from her stories of that hotel I knew St Martins would be excellent.

On arrival the desk staff were hugely welcoming, chatty and very warm.  As it was our anniversary I had asked prior if we could have a large bath tub in the room and on arrival at our room we were not disappointed. We had a standard queen room but the room was extremely spacious and immaculate.  The staff had also placed tea-light candles all throughout the bathroom and bedroom along with petals on the bed and bathroom floor to which we were blown away and hugely grateful.  We were also provided with a free drink each at the hotel bar, which is very popular in its own right as a cocktail bar, filled to the brim with people not staying at the hotel. However I mentioned to the 'bouncer' we were guests and he was very helpful at making us a priority to find a table.  The cocktails were pretty special.

The hotel is a fantastic location, right in the centre of the west end and only a minutes walk from leicester square.  I cannot recommend the hotel enough. I will definitely be visiting again.",5,2013,11,17
125,JUST STUNNING!!!!,"It was the first time that I was staying in London. And this Hotel just answered all my expectation.
Very nice and profesional staff. I wanted to have a drink at the bar and the guy found a seat four me in the crowded bar (thank you!).
The rooms are so comfy. Great Wifi (worth the 10pounds for 24hours). 
The mood lights is the room is actually very nice and spacious. 
The view is amazing (trafalgare square from room 406). Close to main touristics attractions.
Great bed! YOu can find all you need in the bathroom.
Very stylish and design decoration.
The only bad thing I'd experienced is finding my room. Could not find my room number (It is on floor written in yellow on the orange carpet) Not very easy.
Did not try the fitness but I am sure it would have been very nice too.
ANYWAY I WOULD DEFINITLY STAY IN THIS HOTEL FOR MY NEXT TRIP TO LONDON.

125,Divine!,"Stayed here for the weekend for my husbands birthday - staff were super helpful, room was gorgeous, perfect location- what more could you ask for! We had a bottle of wine and birthday cake brought to the room and when we got back from an evening out the room had been filled with candles and rose petals. It was these extra touches that made a rare weekend away together all the more perfect. 

Definitely recommend and hope to return soon for some more relaxation and indulgence! ",5,2013,11,14
125,Excellent,"We booked this hotel through lastminute.com as one of their secret hotels. Having had the hotel revealed to us and now having stayed there I'm please to say that the description of this hotel is completely spot on.
 ""An urban oasis in the heart of the West End.....Step through the doors of this glamorous hotel in London and you will be transported into surreal but luxurious surroundings, where you can even set the mood in the room at the touch of a button.""
The service from the staff was excellent. They could not have done enough for us. Even though we booked at a cheaper rate through the secret hotels deal on lastminute, we were very pleasantly suprised to have been given a complimentary room upgrade. The room was fab! Well layed out, the bed was huge and everything was spotlessly clean. We really enjoyed the quirkiness of the interior of the hotel. It definitely shows off the modern and contemporary side of London. 
The location of the hotel was excellent. A stones throw from Leicester Square tube station, there is everything you could possibly need within comfortable walking distance....shops, restaurants, bars and clubs etc. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at St Martins Lane and would definitely consider returning in the future.

125,Fantastic stay in the heart of London,"My new husband and I stayed at St Martins Lane for an extended layover en route to South Africa for our honeymoon. From the moment we got there, the entire staff made us feel so welcome! Thank you to Nicole and Edward for the especially nice welcome! Directions, reservations, taxis - everything was just a phone call away. Edward even gave me fashion advice for what I should/should not wear to afternoon tea. 

The location of the hotel is in the heart of the theater district and everything is walk-able from there. Definitely recommended for a sleek, stylish and comfortable stay!",5,2013,11,13
125,Amazing,"Amazing experience to stay at St. Martin‚Äôs Lane!
I stay at the hotel a few time a year and I‚Äôm always looking forward.
The energy is great, with very service minded staff, that creates a relaxed 
and still organized felling.
It‚Äôs my favorite hotel in London.",5,2013,11,13
125,Brilliant Hotel!,"I cannot say enough good things about St Martins Lane Hotel in London!  We booked site unseen, having stayed in other Morgans hotels and our expectations were not only met, but exceeded.  From the minute we walked in the door, the staff went above and beyond to make sure that we had an enjoyable stay.  The front desk staff was wonderful with check-in and check out, the door staff was always quick with an umbrella and a to hail a taxi and the concierge were the best that I've experienced!  They were spot-on with food & beverage recommendations, were great about helping us get reservations and put on lists at popular spots and even sent up wine for a birthday celebration.  In the time of our short stay, I felt like the staff had become our friends and I was as bummed to leave them as I was to leave London.  They room was great, and big given European standards.  The water pressure was surprisingly great and the room amenities were wonderful.  Bottom line, I would re-book at St Martins Lane without a moment's hesitation.",5,2013,11,12
125,Fabulous Birthday Week-end!,"I booked at St Martins Lane to celebrate the birthday of a good friend of mine. I contacted the Guest Experience Manager (Nicole) who helped me plan every steps of the way the week-end, from Champagne given at Asia De Cuba, to accommodating us to nicer rooms as some constructions was ongoing, Nicole went out of her way to ensure that we would have the most fabulous experience during our stay and that the birthday celebration was memorable. We were very tired after our last night of partying and a late check out of 3:00pm was easily arranged since the hotel wasn't fully booked. The staff was super accommodating, the rooms were modern and clean and overall we have just had a blast! I'd definitely go back, for a birthday celebration (the food at Asia de Cuba is AMAZING) or for work!",5,2013,11,12
125,Pricey but well worth it!,"Fantastic Hotel, amazing friendly service and couldn't do enough for you. Hotel itself is beautiful decorated and has one of the best restaurants ive ever eaten in - food and drink were second to none!
All things do come with a price tag and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for! in this instance that is very true...the quality of everything is superb.

The only thing to watch out for is the 15% service charge which is added to all food & drink services. if you feel uncomfortable with this you can ask for this to be removed and add on a discretionary tip that you feel more suited. However, if you have the money its worth paying it!",5,2013,11,11
125,Another Excellent Stay,"I stay here regularly when visiting London, location of the hotel is superb, you can walk to almost anywhere that you want.  Rooms are bright and fresh, superb bedding and comfy pillows, bathroom great, power shower refreshing and a superb range of complimentary bathroom products.  Breakfast on Sunday morning was exceptional, well cooked, good service and excellent food.  All in all a great hotel with superb service.   Many thanks once again for a wonderful stay",5,2013,11,11
125,Go for it!,"I stayed at St Martins Lane London Hotel 5 days and enjoyed that visit quite much. Hotel is what they most likely call design hotel that means that lobby is kind of mixed of night club, design shop and hotel lobby with loud music. Nothing against that but it would be easier to discuss with receptionist if you would actually here what he/she says. Definately good thing in these type of hotels is that they have this Nordic style interior that I personally prefer.

Staff was extremely kind and helpfull and I ranked the service level high. I'm not sure how they managed to know my name but I would assume it was because of electronic keys. No matter how they did it, it gave extremely personilised feeling to the service. 

Room I had was standard. It was compact but on the small side. Well equipped and clean. I had nice view over the roofs and room had all I needed. Including Gillette razor that is unfortunately not that common. Wi-fi was included as I think it should. Who can live without one nowadays anyway.

Breakfast was not included but restaurant offered small buffet and on top of that you could order from menu. Ingredients were fresh, well served and I can recommend that to anyone. In case 20 something sterling price is an obstacle one can pick up cheaper alternative from some of the Coffee Places nearby.

I also used gym next to hotel that was free for hotel guests. Gymbox is definately a good one and far better than average hotel gym. You need to walk about 7 meters outdoors to get there but basically you don't have to change clothes for that so it is quite nice location.",5,2013,11,10
125,Excellent hotel! Highly recommend.,"This hotel was everything I could've asked for. 
Great design details, sleep quality was excellent, great location, and great food! 
The bar downstairs had amazing drinks. Overall great hotel for business or pleasure. 
Highly recommend!",5,2013,11,05
125,A little bit of New York,"Feels more like boutique NYC hotel than London.  Small rooms and bathrooms carefully designed with lots of little features - like mood lighting around the bed.  All depends whether this is your cup of tea - everything is tad too cool for my liking - all very knowing.  The location is superb,  The higher up floors have some nice views of London.",4,2013,11,05
125,Long weekend with sister and mother,"Went to London for a long weekend with my sister and mother and was blown away by St. Martins Lane. The hotel itself is beautiful and our room was pure indulgence. Amazingly comfortable beds, ample wardrobe space, plush carpet, you name it. The staff was extremely accommodating with all our special requests (computer charger, earplugs at 11pm when my mum really started snoring etc). Our fantastic dreamy bathroom was complete with tub and super nice toiletries from Malin + Goetz. The hotel is not only clean, friendly and happening, I thought it was also a fun place to stay. Alex, Amy and Joey are all great concierges who gave us brilliant recommendations. Alex especially managed to get completely in tune with what we wanted to do during our stay and we went to some fantastic eats (and we're all extremely picky foodies) on his advice. Altogether 100% greatness on all levels, I would definitely come back, and definitely recommend warmly.",5,2013,11,05
125,St. Martin's Lane London Hotel,"St. Martin's Lane offers superb service in every aspect. Excellent restaurant, invaluable advice from concierge, spot on wait staff, amazing decor, excellent bed and bath. Short walk to Trafalgar Square and theater district.",5,2013,11,05
125,1st anniversary stay,"Just home from a weekend in London and feeling very happy !! This hotel is fantastic. All the staff are so friendly and service was excellent. They knew in advance it was a special occasion and did everything they could to make it unforgettable. We ate in the hotel restaurant which was one of the best meals we have ever had and at the end they bought out a special dessert for us with chocolate writing wishing us a Happy 1st Anniversary on it. Our room was clean, comfortable and a well stocked mini bar. We would like to make this a yearly trip but the thought of staying anywhere else in London is now not an option!!! Roll on next year !",5,2013,11,03
125,heart of theatre land,"Sophisticated, trendy hotel with staff to match. Great bathroom accessories and excellent bed and pillows and bathrobes.  Exclusive toiletries available for purchase and displayed in room.. Great location and could be missed if you are not aware of location. Hotel has own transport available but stick to taxi as it can be expensive. Bar and restaurant available. Good central location for walking and sightseeing.",5,2013,11,03
125,A little London gem!,"I enjoyed a fantastic birthday weekend in this hotel with my mum and sisters.  I hadn't even stepped out of the cab when already Ed from the hotel was providing a great warm welcome.  We had two double double rooms a few doors apart and they were great - modern, spotless, surprisingly roomy for central London and very well equipped. You really get a sense that the staff in this hotel love what they do and that makes such a difference to your stay.  Check out the Light Bar and be wowed by the dancing bar and security staff - they don't do routines but they are having such fun working they just dance around!",5,2013,11,03
125,Birthday/theatre,Stayed at this hotel on the 19th October  for one nights accommodation upon entering the hotel you are very much welcomed by all staff that you meet reception was quick and efficient and you was straight up to your room which are compact but very we'll set out .we were staying to go and see a show in the strand which is very convieniant with the hotel booking we had a meal in the hotel Cuban style which is very lively and great atmosphere we had the taster meal which included starter and main course which was lovely with great staff we totally enjoyed our stay and would return again,5,2013,10,31
125,The perfect London experience,"Staying in St Martins Lane hotel, was like feeling like the cool kid at school. I felt exclusively special due to the incredibly helpful and friendly staff. I felt in-the-know because the hotel was situated literally in the West End, London's hub of culture and experience. I felt accommodated due to the cosy modern rooms and amazing turn-down services which was akin to being tucked in to bed. I felt I could maintain my homely rituals of exercise due to UK's state of the art gym, Gymbox, being just next door which we had full access to. In general, I felt like I had stayed in a place which combined the comfort of my home life with the luxury and escapism of a hotel.

The key difference between this hotel and others, is the phenomenal people that work here. The reception staff were friendly, energetic and efficient. The concierge and doormen had encyclopedic knowledge of good places to eat, drink, explore and were happy to pass on this information. The security boys at the hotel's bar were also a stand-out, namely CJ. Thanks for teaching me those moves man. 
When you do inevitably arrive there, seek out a girl by the name of Nicole Messham, because she was a vital factor in our amazing experience. Just a lovely person in every sense of the word who will go out of her way to help with whatever she can.

Just do yourself a favour and stay here next time in London, you won't regret it!

125,My most wonderful vacay in London!,"The St. Martins Lane Hotel was located perfectly for the theatre, sightseeing, and eating experiences that I had in London.  I could walk to almost every place I wanted to visit.  The hotel itself was comfortable and beautiful.  The service was impeccable.  The staff was fabulous!  Everyone - Michael, Nicole, Joey, Ed, Anna, et al - were terrific and made me feel special.  I especially loved the shower!",5,2013,10,29
125,Marvellous St Martins... a must stay!,"I have just got home from a weekend in St Martins and I had to write this review TONIGHT! Why? because it was a FABULOUS STAY!!! I went with my friend and we stayed in a double double room. The rooms ooze modern and sophistication. The room was plenty big enough and we had a hallway with a storage area for our clothes. The mood lights are a fab idea. The bathroom was great. Big and an amazing shower! I rang housekeeping for some coffee facilities and within a minute a man was at the door! Top service! Talking of service... this was a very high level throughout all the staff we met. Everyone was friendly without being false or over the top. I loved how they remembered my name and asked how our night at Once the musical had been. Down to earth personal staff is a great bonus! We had an amazing time. I have stayed in five star hotels on Park Lane, hotels in Mayfair, but this has been my favourite! I cannot wait to go back! Thanks all that made it a great trip for myself and my friend. Go to Bills for breakfast or dinner... fab! Its in St Martins Courtyard. ",5,2013,10,28
125,Fabulous!!!,"Stayed here for 1 night and what can I say? Wow!!
My partner booked this hotel as a surprise, we were celebrating a special occasion and he had been in contact with the con concierge staff and Nicole the guest experience manager prior to our arrival.  They arranged for an upgrade, fresh rose petals spread throughout the room, a bottle of champagne and complimentary cocktails in the bar, the perfect touch!!!
The hotel itself is in the best location close to everuthing and everywhere.  The staff are very helpful and the rooms lovely.
Will definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning, hopefully for longer next time.",5,2013,10,27
125,Awesome Hotel!,"Everything about this hotel is perfect. We arrived off of a 4-hour train ride from Edinburgh, tired, peckish, and slightly damp from navigating the alleyways from the Leicester Square station in the rain (which is ridiculously close, but for two disoriented Americans, it's not). Ed, at the front desk, was so sweet and accommodating that he had our gigantic soggy suitcases wiped down before he took us to our room. That right then and there was above our expectations, for I'm sure those bags suffered far more abuse from Virgin Atlantic than a little rain. Anyway, our room was fantastic - located right behind the English National Opera House, so it was very quiet. Even though it's smack in the middle of the very busy Leicester Square/Covent Garden (and we were there during Cocktail week) it was very peaceful. Everything was new and clean, the amenities plentiful, and most importantly, the bed was very comfortable. I also loved the plant hanging on the wall, and how a member of the staff would light a candle in the bathroom in the evening. It was those small details that made this hotel so lovely. But I have to say, it is the staff that really makes this place so special. Everyone is so kind and knowledgeable. I cannot count the times we went to the concierge (each and every one of you is a credit to your service) for help, whether it was cheap theatre tickets, how to get a refund for the Oyster Cards that never showed up, or how to make a simple local phone call (which is quite complicated if you've only dealt with no more than 10 digits for the majority of your life...11 if it's a 1-800 number...I swear we're really not that incompetent). To top it off, the hotel's location is perfectly centralized to EVERYTHING even though it's smack in the middle of the very busy Leicester Square/Covent Garden We mostly walked everywhere, but it's so stupidly easy to take the tube anywhere and everywhere as well. Thank you everyone at St. Martins Lane Hotel for making our holiday in London that much more enjoyable! We will be back soon, and we will be staying with you!",5,2013,10,26
125,Friendly retreat from busy London theatre district,"My recent stay at St. Martins Lane Hotel was a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding streets.  It was conveniently located between Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Square which were fun to visit.  The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The rooms were nicely furnished with very comfortable beds. The dress code was casual which fit right in for a weary traveler.  Having free access to the health club next door was an added bonus and the in house bar was lively and fun.  Would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone who likes modern d√©cor mixed with comfort.  Centrally located for the theatre district, with many fine restaurants within walking distance.",5,2013,10,21
125,Very nice modern bright hotel.,"We spent 6 nights in Loft King- a corner room on 6th floor. The windows were floor to ceiling and the room was Iincredibly bright, a joy in London. The views were excellent.  Location cannot be beat. The concierge desk- Joey and Michael-were fabulous...recommendations and assistance with a smile.  Even the bellman was a joy- he ran all the way up the street to hail a cab for us. Asia de Cuba was good and the lobby bar was small but fun. Only things needed from hotel to receive an excellent review are to improve bed quality and refresh/update the  look of the rooms. Also free WiFi in this day and age should be a given not a profit center. All in all a very good stay.",4,2013,10,21
125,How Fabulous is this!,"We have just stayed at The St Martins Lane Hotel, wow its lovely. it obviously has a really stylish interior but the thing that really makes it special are the fantastic staff, they are trained to such a high standard, it really was a pleasure being there. The bar area is great , you can ask for odd things at odd times, nothing fazes them, they are so friendly and helpul.
Lovely room with mood lighting, amazing view of Nelsons Column, very special to lie in bed staring at that ! Great washroom area, for once someone had thought you might need to put down a wash bag! they'd also thought a girl might not want to get her hair wet in the shower so two options there too.
Complete treat save up and go!",5,2013,10,21

They also have an excellent health club next door where you get free entry.",5,2013,10,15
125,A hotel worth returning to,"I recently stayed at 'St Martins lane' hotel again - 11th Oct through to monday the 14th and to say I was impressed is a mere understatement.  I find the place vibrant, beautiful and well designed.  This however is not a patch on the smiles you are given at this hotel and the warm that radiates from the Staff.

I would like to say a particular thank you to Alex on the conceirge desk.  He is highly skilled at mixing a professional manner with one of friendliness and warmth.  He during is a face I am always so pleased to see on the Conceirge desk.  He is always willing to help and fairs well under pressure when the desks get busy.  I have been witnessed to him juggling helping staff at the check in desk and manning the conceirge side of his job.  He truly should be a valued member of this hotel, he certainly is from a guest perspective.

Amet, the bellman is also a name I want to mention.  He, like Alex, always in my experience goes above and beyond for his guests.  I watched him hail cabs on Saturday evening for many guests and he is always polite, efficient, and welcoming.  Again, he seems to have this incredible balance between efficiency and friendliness.  I am delighted to honor him by writing this email because his work truly is exceptional.

I would also like to take the time to mention Paris and Sonia on the check in desk and Amy on the Conceirge desk.  These women are again, so efficient and good at what they do.  It is a pleasure to enter the hotel and have people you feel care about you staying there.  I commend their work too as they truly are three remarkable women who are amazing at their job.

Another beautiful visit and I will return again, often.

This hotel is made by its staff and the level of service they provide.
I love being in the covent garden area it is so vibrant and beautiful.  And with Neals Yard and 'the wild food cafe and juice bar - two seperate doors- just in that space. This hotel has everything in walking distance... Monmouth coffee on monmouth street too, just up the road, is NOT one independent coffee shop to be missed.
LOve the hotel. loved it all.",5,2013,10,15
125,Tired of nonfunctional design,"Another ""trendy"" hotel that is over designed but not functional. Light switches that didn't work, dimmers that didn't dim, a toilet concealed by a glass door that didn't close completely for privacy. I would love a solid, beautiful hotel room that was actually easy to master and fully functional. This was not it. 

Through the king loft is large and the beds and bedding wonderful I just can't accept that the lights in the bath were blinding and I couldn't use a toilet privately. (No door on the bathroom.)

The location is wonderful, but I would not return to this property. ",4,2013,10,14
125,Quality product as expected,"Overnight stay booked through lastminute so a better deal than normal prices for the hotel. Was greeted at reception and little things like asking about trip tells you they care about customers. We were given an upgrade without asking, even with a cheaper booking, perhaps this was because we booked in for afternoon tea at Asia de Cuba?. The room was comfortable and nicely executed. Warmer in ambiance than its sister hotel, the Sanderson. I believe some rooms are very small but ours was well sized with gorgeous bathroom featuring ample space and walk in wet room shower. Nice amenities and M+G products. Despite it being an older hotel (now) it still has a freshness about it and as long as you get a good deal and above entry level room, it's a good way to see london given it's prime location. Will be back again. ",4,2013,10,14
125,Great location but room too small,"I loved this hotel for its location.  Absolutely in the heart of everything and made it possible to go shopping, and back to the hotel, and then shopping again without even bothering with the Underground or a taxi.  

I should also say the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

But to me the size of the room was a real let down.  I had a corridor area with a curtained recess that worked as a wardrobe and then a bedroom that was large enough for a double bed and not much more.   There was a desk but you had to move it to try and sit there.  One wall was all window, whichever as nice, but it was very difficult to get to the window to draw the curtains, as there was a desk and a tv in front.   The bathroom was fine.

I don't see how this is a 5 star hotel and this is why I've rated this hotel lower.  If this was described as 4 star, or even 3 star, I think it would be amazing, as you'd accept the room size as part of the deal.  

So, if you think you're paying a 3-4 star price, you'll love this hotel, I think.  If you're paying or expecting 5-star, expect the room to be small but the location to be excellent.",3,2013,10,14
125,great service,"We have stayed at St Martins Lane sister hotel (Sanderson) before but feel this hotel better situated to walk to all the sites. Service was superb, rooms small, prices in bar etc silly even for London but book last minute and get a good deal and you can walk to hundreds of cheaper and better bars and restaurants",4,2013,10,13
125,Modern hotel,"First we got a room with double beds, very dark and a construction just next door at night there were loud voices and at 8 am it started the terrible  noises , and we request another room right away but they were fully book because of the Fashion week... so they move us to another decent room with good illumination and a king bed. The room service  was excellent the food at the restaurant was a mix of cuban with thai ... the bar is nice but they charge you the tip in advance.
The internet connection was very slow and pricey. There is a Starbuck in front of the hotel. You can change the lighting according to your mood. Nice shower with very nice  toiletries (cilantro conditioner) The hair dryer is very good. Our room had a back alley view.",4,2013,10,11
125,Massively over rated,Special anniversary trip & I decide to do a secret hotel chancer on lastminute dot com - big mistake. This hotel has been put together cheaply but trying to create a look of quality - failed miserably. Aimed at the hip & trendy crowd who earn stacks but don't yet know where to spend it. Very friendly staff who sell the place well. Cocktail bar serve decent cocktails but the display cabinet with the crystals really sum up this place. The room is a reasonable size but no bath for the end of week relaxer & a shower that flooded the place. Bed with budget mattress - not the luxury expected. Not my bag at this money & many more quality establishments in London with more competitive pricing. No parking but that applies to most city city centre locations,3,2013,10,11
125,Improved since last visit,"Stayed here 12 months ago and did not have the most pleasant experice. This time around it was still rough around the edges - although to be fair it was LFW so they were very busy, I did enjoy my stay. I still dont understand how a 5 star hotel can charge for WIFI (personal gripe) but other than all was good. Housekeeping were wonderful, room service was prompt, doormen are really the highlight - they are amazing !!!!!  - and the location is  truly fantastic, it really is central and walking distance to just about everything. Could not fault it. I stayed 5 days in a deluxe king (top floor amazing view) and the room is quite large - we had two large suitcases and still managed to move around fine. There is no door on the bathroom as such - frosted glass - so if you are ""shy"" it may bother you. however the bathroom is very spacious and the shower has excellent water pressure. But the room had everything you needed, umbrella, iron, clothes hangers, a good selction of inhouse movies (we got heavily rained in one night)  etc.",4,2013,10,10
125,Wonderful stay in the heart of London.,"My husband and I traveled to London after a bike and barge trip through Belgium. We had biked 35 miles every day.  We came to St. Martins Lane for our last week to relax and enjoy the sights of London.  This hotel was absolutely what we needed for comfort, relaxation and seeing the sights easily.  The staff was so accommodating.  They upgraded our room which was huge and had a large and much needed bath tub!! Our laundry was done within one day and anytime we needed anything from housekeeping it came within 5 minutes.  Every time we entered the hotel the staff was welcoming, friendly and eager to help us in anyway.  We had delicious drinks in the light bar and the bar was always lively and fun.  The light changes in the room and the room design was modern and exciting. Every time I come back to London I will stay at St. Martins Lane as it made me feel like my home away from home.",5,2013,10,10
125,Wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again.,"Well what can I say? I've used plenty of hotels in my time. My husband still uses hotels an awful lot for work, in London too.

The service was great from start to finish. I did pay a cheaper advance rate through an agent. I doubled checked with the hotel all was ok. Due to us not getting away without the children very often and having limited time. I didn't want any hiccups.

The hotel were very reassuring. We checked in later than we'd hoped. We were given a free room upgrade and sat there waiting was a handwritten note congratulating us (it was an important celebration) and a complimentary bottle of champagne.

The room was big enough, considering it's used as a base. The bathroom was huge in comparison to those I've seen in Central London. The bath was big enough for 2, it was huge. There was also a good shower.

We had a street view, which was lovely. When outside the noise was immense. This hotel is right in the thick of it. Bars, restaurants, theatres, shops all on your doorstep. So lots of crowds. This however you wouldn't know from inside. The rooms blocked out the noise.

The bed was comfortable, nice and firm. The room had been attended to when we were out, so we returned to lit candles, and a plumped up bed, nice touch.

I hear the rooms are being refurbished in the next year. I hope they don't change too much and it's just a refreshment.

The staff were all so helpful and polite. I wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again, either as a couple or family.

When we take the kids to London, which they love, I would stay here, even at full rack rate. As the service and help takes all the stress out of a visit to London!",5,2013,10,07
125,My nirvana,"Words cannot express how much I adore this hotel. There wasn't a single missed detail during my three-night stay. I arrived very tired from 22-hours of travel and meetings via taxi. I had the one mean taxi driver in London and his credit machine wasn't working. The bell man -- without even asking -- went to the front desk to get the GBP to cover my LHR > Covent Garden ride. So helpful!  

As a vegan, I often struggle to eat, however the extremely caring room service staff personally delivered the veg menu to my door to walk me through my dinner options at Asia de Cuba downstairs. The food was divine!

My garden room with an outdoor patio was tranquil, spacious and so comfortable. I loved that bed! And who doesn't love Malin and Goetz bath products?

St. Martins Lane has become one of my top five favorite hotels in the world. It's worth every pence.",5,2013,10,06
125,Incredible Service and Best Location!,"While I always expect quality from a Morgan hotel, St Martins Lane Hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. The staff provided us with exceptional service, from the doormen, the front desk, the concierge and even the manager, everyone could not have been 
friendlier or more 
accommodating. Our room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was large and modern and many amenities were available to use or purchase. 
As for the location, it is absolutely incredible! It is in the heart of the city and within walking distance are endless restaurants, stores, shops and theaters. We could not wait to get out every day and explore our surroundings. This is a great location for business travelers, as well as couples and families looking for a great central location with a lot of choices for food and activities. 

I could not recommend this hotel more. There is no doubt I have found my new ""home"" in London. 
 ",5,2013,10,01
125,All ways perfect,"I have stayed at this hotel more than the once, and every time it meets my standards with the addition of friendly attentive staff. The restaurants food is excellent with the front of house team being truly professional. Sam the restaurant manager is kind and skilled at his work, making me and my friend feel welcome and able to enjoy the high quality we expect.",5,2013,10,01
125,Better than I hoped,"My husband and I stayed here for a week at the end of September.  I don't think you could stay at a better location; we were able to walk to almost everything and being so close to Covent Gardens was fantastic.  We had a studio suite (#205) and the room was large.  There were no ""drawers"" for clothing but there were two sets of shelves and although I brought way too much clothing there was plenty of room.  Everything was modern and sparse - exactly how I like it.  I think this was the first hotel I've stayed at where I didn't have to request extra towels.  The towels were thick and huge and we had at least 6 bath towels at any given time.  Bathroom was very large, modern and immaculate.  The staff was incredible.  They greeted us by name each day and were warm and helpful.  All of our requests, for example the coffee/tea set up, were responded to IMMEDIATELY.   I was hesitant about going to London with nothing more than a bucket list of places we wanted to visit but the concierge(s) were incredible.  Joey and Mike provided information, reservations, suggestions, etc. every step of the way.  We even got a last minute reservation for tea at the Ritz, which usually needs to be booked months in advance, thanks to Joey.  There is nothing they could have done to make this trip any better than it was and this was one of the most fantastic trips we've ever taken!",5,2013,09,30
125,Great for business,"I stayed 3 nights while in a business trip in London. The room is small, but clean and nice. Bathroom is super clean and modern. I stayed in the 325 room, which has an awful view, but I didn't need one. I don't recommend the hotel with you're traveling accompanied, because the design of the room is perfect for one person, that's it. Staff is super nice and helpful. They have partnership with a fitness center next door, which is very convenient. Hotel location is great: close to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and other attractions and main transportation. I would go back!",4,2013,09,28
125,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Staff and Great Location",We received excellent service from the time our cab pulled up in front of the hotel.  The room was great.  Not large but very comfortable.  The beds and bedding were amazing.  All the hotel and restaurant staff went out of their way to make our stay a great one.,5,2013,09,22
125,"Amazing hotel, lovely staff","This hotel from the second you walk in you are treated like royalty with the staff falling over themselves to help you. Rooms are a little small and you have to enter the gym box by leaving the hotel, but the rooms are so clean, bathroom is amazing. The bar downstairs is very trendy with the cocktails made with perfection. The breakfast buffet is outstanding with everything you will need but the cooked food can take a little longer. The times are great though with breakfast served from 6.30 - 11 (never had that before). Great hotel, amazing location and helpful staff!",4,2013,09,21
125,Great location close to all that beats in this vibrant city.,"Great location close to all that beats in this vibrant city. 
The rooms are a little small  but that is London and when you are in the location of this hotel, who cares.... Walk out the cool door of this hotel and you are 3 minutes walk to some of London's best atractions and if you  like trendy bars and a vibrant atmosphere the streets around this hotel go off after work so you will have no trouble finding friends and quality drinking establishments. The hotel is super trendy and modern and has a cool bar/restaurant on the bottom floor, along with some of the coolest teeth seats I have seen. The rooms look over the bustiling streets or the old London rooftops and have some cool features such as mood lighting and a nice roomy bathroom. The beds are super comfy after a day of exploring London streets and the blinds will keep the light out if you have had a big night. We found the service here really good, especially the concierge service. My wife had wanted to do High Tea in London and I had left it a tad late... After calling around I had no luck. One call from the concierge and I was out of trouble as he swiftly made a booking at one of the best high tea's in London. When we arrived at the High Tea we were treated to some extra special attention due to our concierge friend and contact. This was super cool and helpful. So make sure you use the well connected and knowledgable concierge. The hotel has a car park at the back if you happen to be driving like we were and a host of breakfast places around. Enjoy thuis trendy and modern hotel that is in one of the best locations for a fun stay in London.",4,2013,09,18
125,Swirl through the London Summer!,"Awesome modern hotel in a perfect location. Friendly & helpful staff. Decor that wows and a nice bar to spend the evenings. The suite with the open air patio was ideal for the summer

Plenty of options for F&B within a 5 minute radius",4,2013,09,17
125,Second Stay,"We chose to stay here again, after staying a few years ago.  After reading a few reviews I began to worry it wouldn't be up to the same standard as previously.

On arrival our car was taken to the car park and our luggage into reception.  On checking in I was convinced I had read the reviews for another hotel!  Check in was efficient and courteous, even giving us a free upgrade for our wedding anniversary.

Our room was on the sixth floor and was just as I remembered from our previous stay - clean, spacious, crisp bed linen, enormous bathroom and plenty of storage.  Our tea tray arrived promptly and was refilled each day.

A truly wonderful stay in an extremely central hotel,",4,2013,09,16
125,Excellent luxury hotel right in the heart of London - great service,"I organised to have my wife's birthday in London last week, and Nicole was very helpful in getting a few little surprises organised in the hotel for us, including champagne, flowers etc.

The hotel has a very cool edge, and the staff are all friendly and helpful. As a London resident for many years, even I was impressed by the lengths they would go to help with regards to shows, dinner reservations etc. Rooms were clean, beds comfy and bathrooms were lovely. Our room was a brilliant white throughout (room 158).

All in all a great stay, only reason for not giving 5 stars is the price (over ¬£350 for one night and not including breakfast). But it was expected for a luxury central London hotel that is walking distance from Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Mayfair, Trafalgar Square, etc etc. Leicester Square tube is literally 5 minutes walk.

Not visited this time, but the hotel bar and onsite restaurant (Asia de Cuba) are both very good as well.

Highly recommended if this hotel is in your price range.",5,2013,09,16
125,"Not a 5 star, rude staff","No way is this a 5 star hotel, i have stayed in plenty of 5 star hotels around the world and this is not one of them. 

Firstly i just want to warn people about the ¬£100 charge they take from your credit card before you have even stepped foot in your room, the receptionist told us it was to cover any expenses from the mini bar/food etc, i explained to the receptionists that this was not explained when we booked the hotel and he just shrugged and said its in the small print, we are still waiting for our refund, i have called the hotel to be told it could take upto 10 days, i don't understand how it can take 2 days to show on your statement but 10 days to put back!!!!!!!

 found the staff to be extremley rude, for example we put our bags in there holding room because we had arrived early and when we went back to collect our bags the man in charge just shoved them in our hands, and we got the same when we were handed our key, we were not told what floor we were on or where the lifts were the staff stare at you as though your stupid.
Also we found the hotel had no flag or sign to say it was a morgans orginal hotel, we walked ages trying to locate it, and the door number is not very big.

The rooms are modern, comfortable bed, and nice power shower,  but we did have problems with the tv and ipod speakers and we could hear alot of banging, we thought we had booked a city view but instead we were facing another building with windows facing our room, so it felt quite exposed. 

The only positives i can give this hotel is the location is ideal to the tube station given easy access to other areas of london and its right on covent garden

I would not recommend this hotel to friends or family and i will never stay in this hotel again, very poor service, poor value for money.",2,2013,09,13
125,Nice... but 5 stars not sure,"Really nice, but stayed in nicer 4 star hotels for less money in London... Nice room, clean and what I expected, friendly staff, food and drink very expensive as expected, breakfast for 2 - ¬£50.00 which I think is a bit steep... Basically really nice but just couldnt justify the 5 star hotel rating.",4,2013,09,12
125,Very happy,We stayed in the hotel for 7 nights and were extremely happy with the location. It is a short walk from Leicester Square Underground and around the corner from Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. The rooms are very modern and super clean with really comfortable beds. The service was great in the hotel and the bar and dining areas. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. I especially loved the foyer and would definitely return when I travel to London again. ,4,2013,09,12
125,very nice indeed !,"Priced at the upper end of the hotel market this is a luxury venue with its emphasis on ‚Äòluxury‚Äô. We were greeted by a very polite and professional individual ‚ÄòDebbie‚Äô who, upon hearing that our stay was a honeymoon treat upgraded us to a suite with a garden ! Yes it was a boxed off area with a tree in it and no view (think the exercise yard in Guantanamo bay !) but being in the centre of London and not a concentration camp in Cuba this was a real treat and we were happy ! The room had a note saying that we could call for tea / coffee and we did and after we had gone through the extensive range of teas and coffees available a person appeared at a door (almost instantaneously) with our complimentary order. Very nice and would recommend that you make good use of this facility.  The breakfasts were very good ‚Äì pastrys, cereal plus the usual hot option which saw me having steak for break fast for the first time in my life. But the eggs Benedict was equally as good. The moring coffee is supreme ‚Äì seriously divine coffee errved over breakfast.  The only negative issue was that we were told that we could not close the inner blinds in our room. For the price we paid I would have expected to wipe my butt with those blinds so to be told that we couldn‚Äôt do it was a bit insulting. That said merely standing on the chair and reaching for the right bits will allow you to close the blinds fully. Also on our first morning the surprisingly thin walls allowed us to hear the group (4 brazilian females and 1 male ‚Äì or a very manly sounding female) wake up, get ready, drink coffee, clean teeth, get dressed and argue about the days weather ! All in all a most excellent experience and when I have saved up enough money I will be looking to book up another stay !",5,2013,09,10
125,Fabulous Weekend Away,"I loved everything about this hotel! The rooms were spotless and I loved the ""mood lighting"" and illuminated desk in the rooms. You can request tea and coffee making facilities which were a great addition to the room. The lobby decor was quirky and cool. All the staff were very welcoming and helpful. ( Our rooms were ready early which was a real bonus) The bar had a very buzzing vibe both at the beginning and the end of the evening. The cocktail menu was extensive... We gave lots of them a try. The location is fabulous for Covent Garden and the theatre district. 
The hotel however is tricky to spot from the outside. There are literally no signs stating the name of the hotel!
Our weekend at St Martin' Lane was a fantastic experience and I would definitely return.",5,2013,09,09
125,Great Location,"We stayed at the hotel for the weekend. The location couldn't have been any better , great for shopping , theatre's and Restaurants.This Hotel has a fantastic vibe , the staff are friendly and helpful , the rooms are spotless.If you manage to stay when the doorman Edd is working then your in luck not only is he exceptionally helpful but he's like a personal tour guide he seems to know the greatest places to visit I don't think we would have seen as much of London if it wasn't for him.Highly recommend this Hotel will definitely be going back.",5,2013,09,08
125,A Wonderful 5* Hotel in a Great Location,"We stayed at St Martins Lane in a Studio Suite on Saturday, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. The room was very clean, bed was amazingly comfortable, and room was spacious (for a London Hotel). Floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides, gave great views accross the city and the bathroom, with HUGE bathtub and fantastic shower was just brilliant. The tolietries were really nice too, very good quality... everything and moore that you would expect from a 5* hotel... what sets the St Martins Lane apart is the service... I have been fortunate enough to travel extensivley, and the staff at this hotel could even give the service in Asia a run for its money... Super friendly and polite, and a real personal service, like they had taken time to read the requirements on your booking and go that extra mile to make your stay memorable. The staff could not do enough to help in all aspects of our stay. We travelled for my birthday weekend, and when I returned to my room, I had rose petals and a birthday cake, which was just wonderful... again what made this so different is that there were also candles everywhere, which just blew me away..!! There were so many other personal touches, that now, I do not think I could ever consider staying at another hotel in London and I will certainly try out the Morgans group at their locations around the world too. 

Thanks you St Martins lane for a trip I will never forget!",5,2013,09,02
125,Bit of a difficult place to review......,"The hotel is in a 60's/70's block which has been refurbished as a 5 star hotel. Location is fantastic close to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square etc etc. Exterior is unattractive and the reception area no better. Corridors are bland and dark. BUT the reception and all other staff I met were wonderful and the room was great with some really useful touches. Good bar and fab restaurant. I booked through Secret Escapes and got a very good deal. I would not contemplate paying the rack rate for my (deluxe) room which was shown on the reception desk as a whopping ¬£555.........",3,2013,09,02
125,Great hotel,"we only stayed for one night as we was having a night out in London. great room. spotless clean. nice mood lighting. great big bed nice and comfy had a good night sleep. great location from Covent garden, china town, etc. The staff where friendly and helpful. the hotel came alive at night with a bar. didn't go in but sounded and looked good. Breakfast was nice lots to choose from on the menu and the buffet was great too. just a small thing would be that it should be made more clear on the outside the name of the hotel as walked straight passed the hotel when looking for it.",5,2013,09,01
125,Very good,"Stayed her last Friday in August, everything about this hotel is extremely good and to a high standard except for the price of the mini bar!

I am not the one to moan about prices in London as we have Ben known to spend hundreds on champagne etc however the price of a small bottle of spirit in the room was unacceptable even the small pot of Pringles was ¬£5, I do not want this however to take anything away from the hotel as the staff were fantastic and the hotel was extremely good value for money.

One pointer to the hotel however if people were to ask for a car to take them to a destination for the evening they should not need to pay for this in a 5* hotel. We have never paid for cars that are owned by the hotel before and I felt this was a bit steep for asking us to do so.

However love,y hotel lovely food and lovely room.",4,2013,09,01
125,Wonderful St Martins,"Booked through Last Minute Secret Rooms for my partner's birthday at a very good rate.  I contacted the hotel prior to arrival to ask for a birthday cake to be arranged for the room. Everything was dealt with very well and the service was faultless. The cake was yummy and as it turned out ... complimentary.  The hotel is so central for everything and the room was huge, very comfortable and extremely quiet. Loved everything about our stay here and will definitely do it again. I highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2013,08,31
125,Modern hotel,This hotel was in a great position and very easy to reach theatres  pubs clubs and restaurants and lots off London sights all in walking distance bedroom was all in white with floor to ceiling windows a very comfortable bed with mood lighting a large tv mini bar with good selection of drinks and snacks and price list a full sized ironing board and iron and a good powerfull hair drier The shower room had a selection off luxury products to buy with price list as well as your normal hotel products to use free of charge nice fluffy white towels plus dressing gown and slippers the shower was good with lots of power  room service was fast and efficient You need to ring the number given in the paperwork to get free complimentary coffee and tea do not just ask reception to send you coffee as you will be charged We did not use the restaurant in the hotel as there was so much choice close by drinks are ¬£11 each in the bar but this is a luxury hotel and you have the choice off how much you use  I would use this again,5,2013,08,31
125,Changed a few rooms but still good overall..,"We arrived at the hotel and was supposed to be getting a premier room but the system showed otherwise. The front desk did his best in helping us to verify but to no avail. He assigned us a room of which we did not like due to smoke smell and room was changed upon request. On the second room, it was not suitable and requested for another change. The change was quick and easy as well with their guys helping with the bags. On the third and final room, it was fantastic, spacious and large. Although small events took place and caused a change of room for 2 times, their service was good. The location is convenient too and there is the Jamie Oliver's restaurant just down the street. The stay was good with the high sleep quality. Overall, I might consider this hotel again if I want to stay in that area.",4,2013,08,30
125,Great location,"Spent a lovely weekend in this hotel with my wife. It was our first stay in this hotel and we loved it. Hotel's location is fantastic, so we were able to walk just about to all attractions and places we wanted to visit. Hotel is very modern. The rooms are a bit small, but compared to other similar hotels in London, would say they are above average. Price is also within normal range for London hotels 260 per night. Despite the in the evenings the bar is packed and music loud, rooms are quiet.",5,2013,08,30
125,Great base for a family adventure in London,"Traveling with a family of four is a challenge, especially when it includes 2 young children. We were very fortunate to have picked this hotel, for several reasons:

Location - it is within walking distance for nearly everything on the 'must see' list. Also, it is near dozens of restaurants, a supermarket, and staples like Starbucks / Pret a Manger, all which are essential when trying to keep kids happy and fed.

Service - staff was very friendly, helpful and responsive.

Room - we had a Loft Double Queen, which was fantastic for a family of 4. The beds were very comfortable. The large bathroom and separate storage / dressing area were perfect. [but, yes, size comes at a cost...]

Atmosphere - Want to ride in an elevator with video screens showing goldfish? Or sit on lobby stools shaped like teeth? Or change the colours in your room by adjusting the lighting? OK, these are pretty minor things but every little bit helps when trying to entertain a 3 yr old!

I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I'm in London.",5,2013,08,29
125,Worth the hype,"Ok let's get straight to the point......

Pros
1. The customer service is great from the bellman to the reception staff.  Genuinely friendly and helpful.  This is unusual in London so a great plus!
2.  Fantastic location...... 2 minutes from Leicester Sq, Covent Garden, the theatres, old English pubs etc etc. 
3.  The power shower - the shower in our room was awesome - blow you away kind of stuff.
4.  Our view wasn't the best but it wasn't facing the busy main road so it was extremely quiet. In the centre of London peace and tranquility is more important than a view for me.
5.  The restaurant looked fancy (Asia de Cuba) although we didn't eat there. We drank in the bar and the drinks were good although expensive at ¬£13 each.  
6. They had all of the Sky Sports channels!!!!

Cons
1.  We stayed in a standard room and paid ¬£250 per night.  The standard rooms are very small and like us you may think you've paid over the odds for it.  We could have paid only ¬£30 more for a deluxe standard so I would advise if your going to pay ¬£250 then you may as well pay the little extra for a better room.",5,2013,08,29
125,Tranquility in the city.,"This is my go to hotel in London, especially when I want to escape from the hustle and bustle. Room service is a must here, it's the best I've ever had. My next visit can't come soon enough. This hotel won't disappoint you.",5,2013,08,28
125,My second home,"I am a regular visitor at St Martin's Lane, which has become my home away from home - I just love the place.  The staff are absolutely perfect - friendly, professional and SO helpful. I just love the design of this place - if I am not mistaken it has been designed by Philippe Starck.  The rooms are so stylish and very well appointed, and the bathroom impeccable.  I usually stay in a lovely room with a private patio where I can have breakfast when the weather is nice, or relax and quietly read a book and sip a virgin cocktail in the evening.  The location is perfect for me and so central, just off Trafalgar Square and a couple of minutes' walk from Covent Garden.  I have travelled quite a bit over the years: St Martin's Lane ranks among the very best hotels I have stayed at, and I think the staff, the warm, relaxed welcome play a great part in making this my home away from home. - Fiona M.",5,2013,08,28
125,Very Happy Relatives!,"Stayed here twice so far this year with my husband. Enjoyed it so much that we decided to recommend it to my family when they visited UK from South America.We booked them here for a night before they were due to leave for Paris. We arrived and were greeted by very friendly and informative staff. Nicole was absolutely outstanding! She was gracious, knowledge-able and keen to help where she could.  Room was fantastic and once they realised that some translations may be needed  they simply sent a native speaker to assist. Edwardo translated and was very professional and extremely helpful. To top it off we ate at the Cuba de Asia where once again everything was excellent! Relatives were very impressed with the flexibility and attentiveness of the staff that just topped off the whole experience...We love to show off the positive points about the great city of London to visitors and this was just a perfect end to a wonderful visit.  Thanks.",5,2013,08,28
125,Fab location with great service,"Stayed here a couple of times, most recently in May for one night - one of our favourite hotels in London.
If you're arriving for the first time, don't be put off by the hotel lobby that makes the reception look an invite only club - a little unapproachable. The staff are really friendly, and the concierge certainly know their stuff in terms of bar or restaurant recommendations. The rooms are bright and clean with some great views. An ideal location if going to the theatre, with Asia de Cuba offering a great pre-theatre option.",5,2013,08,28
125,Superb corner room with great views over the City,"My Mother and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over August Bank Hols weekend.  I booked through a last minute website with no option of what kind of room to choose.  I contacted the Hotel and was offered an upgrade for a good price and we were delighted to find ourselves in a double double loft room on the 5th floor with floor to ceiling glass all around and located on a corner of the hotel so we had windows all around.  The room was stunning, full of light, all white and plush and very well appointed. Everything had been thought of from tea and coffee making facilities, to candles in the bathroom.  The shower was very powerful and bathroom very well laid out.  The beds were very comfortable and linen all crisp fresh and white.   We did not want to leave!  We did not use the bar or restaurant as very busy already with things booked.  The staff were pleasant at all times and very keen to help.  The location of this Hotel is also a major bonus, walking to most attractions, but the great part was the room was so quiet.  
Thanks to all especially Jesper for making this a great stay!  We will definantely book again.",5,2013,08,27
125,Love It !,"From the moment we booked to the moment we left everything about our stay was excellent. Service, rooms and the staff were helpful and polite - drinks in the bar with friends and breakfast delicious. We wanted it as a base to shop and despite the rain this proved to be ideal.",5,2013,08,27
125,A fantastic hotel.,"St Martins Lane ranks up there with some of the very best hotels I've stayed at. The staff are spot on, the rooms are stylish and the music in The Light Bar is top notch. We didn't eat at the hotels restaurant so cannot comment on the food. Eat instead at J Sheekey's a lovely fish restaurant which is a minutes walk away.",5,2013,08,27
125,Can't beat it,During our second visit to St Martins Lane hotel it was again a case of you just can't beat this place. The beds are great. The bathrooms are great. The rooms have taken a little wear and tear in the past two years but not enough to make us look for another property in London. The location is unbeatable and the staff are wonderful. We will be back...,5,2013,08,25
125,The staff make St Martins even more exceptional,"St Martin's is my second home as I'm in London most weeks, it should absolutely be the first choice of hotel to stay in London, great location, simplistic style and spotlessly clean ‚Äì what I like is that you never see cleaning trolley‚Äôs trundling down the corridors, it is all carried out discretely. Even better are the staff that make this hotel such a nice place to stay, you cannot pick out one as exceptional ‚Äì they all are! Very polite, very friendly, nothing is too much trouble and offer that little bit more each time I stay there, that makes it especially nice to stay there on an ongoing basis. and not to forget the food - divine!!",5,2013,08,24
125,Style and service both,"Before you get there, the St Martins Lane looks like the perfect hotel: ultramodern and cool, and ideally located in the midst of the West End, surrounded by theatres and wonderful restaurants, steps from Trafalgar Square. I stayed there for 10 nights, and I think most travelers will experience challenges during that long a stay; the key is how a hotel addresses those challenges. In this case, the hotel staff were the equal of the hotel's style and location. Any issue that came up, they came up with solutions--more than one, when necessary--and kept the stay a very positive one. I single out the Director of Rooms, Jesper Sorensen, in particular. I found the staff to be real professionals, and I can confidently recommend the hotel to anyone who finds it in their price range.",4,2013,08,24
125,Brillant,"We stayed here for two nights recently & found all the staff to be extremely friendly & helpful. The room was amazing, & it really was located perfectly. Would definitely stay there next time we are in London. ",5,2013,08,24
125,"Excellent location, friendly staff","Stayed  here for 5 nights and I must say that this is a pretty good hotel. All the staff are super friendly and helpful, I was impressed by the service they provided. The hotel itself is quirky and modern. We paid for a room upgrade to one of the garden rooms, not sure if I'd do this again though. It's a nice thing to have but it is essentially a 2m square patio with a small table and chairs. We also had room only, just down the road there are plenty of cafes where you can get breakfast considerably cheaper.

The location is great, literally a 2min walk to Covent garden, Leicester square etc. there are also a couple of tube stations close by to.

All in all a great hotel with exceptional staff. The restaurant and the bar though quite pricey are very nice to.
",4,2013,08,24
125,Excellent boutique hotel,"I had a really excellent experience during my brief one-night stay at this hotel. The decor is very modern, designed by Starck I'm told. The staff at the front desk were truly excellent - I must have interacted with five or six different people at various times and they were all very friendly and helpful. The room was really beautifully decorated with many unique details such as a table with built in lighting and Starck's signature white curtains in the bathroom. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to try the bar but the location is really excellent with many cafes and interesting shops lining St Martins lane. I would definitely stay here again, in fact it is my new favourite hotel in London!",5,2013,08,22
125,Super St Martins Lane !,"Some hotels don‚Äôt just offer amazing service  but influence how that city is viewed .St Martin‚Äôs Lane offers all the modern design ,palpable energy and ingenious innovation that we surprisingly stumbled upon from this cool and hip  brand. Its  fabulous location right in the midst of theatreland is where art meets metro style. It‚Äôs a sensory experience staying at St Martin‚Äôs Lane and what we remember most fondly and what stays with us from our trip  is the hospitality of the people there.. Gabor , Alex to name just a few . Its people like these who remind you of the wonders of travel . We are regulars at the Westbury in London and with this happy accident of a change to St Martin‚Äôs Lane, it is sometimes the incredible people you encounter like Gabor who greet you like long lost friends and with pride convert you to their brand . We will certainly be back ! Thanks so much for a wonderful stay !",5,2013,08,22
125,Home Away from Home,"I travel to London for business nearly every month and I stay at the St. Martins Lane hotel whenever I possibly can. The entire staff makes me feel so welcome - it's nice to see the same faces on the door, at the front desk, in the restaurant and bar - it makes traveling on business so much more pleasant! They do everything possible to make my stays perfect, but if for some reason, something does go wrong, they go above and beyond to address it.  

I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit London - great for business as well as romantic getaways!",5,2013,08,21
125,"Expensive for its quality, High Design.","If you are into paying very high rates for high-design hotel rooms. This is the hotel for you.

If you are into paying well for large rooms and comfortable quality, this will be less likely to be your pick,

Located on a bit of a dirty street right in the heart of London's theater district, the St. Martin's Lane hotel is designy, but needs a cleaning, a coat of paint, and perhaps some refurbishment.

Rooms are reasonably large, bathrooms are very nicely equipped.

Hallways are a bit dirty. Lobby is a bit hectic.

The hotel breakfast if fresh and of exceptional quality. Service is impeccable throughout the hotel.",4,2013,08,21
125,One word for St. Martins Lane London:  Fantastic!,"My family of four stayed at St. Martins Lane for 3 nights in early August 2013.  Since this was our first visit to London, I leaned heavily on the concierge for guidance regarding sightseeing, museum reservations and dinner suggestions.  This was all done via email a few weeks prior to our arrival and every plan put forth was right on target for a great visit.  The front desk staff and bell staff (Martin in particular) were absolutely amazing and our room was modern, clean, and spacious with a bathroom that would make most spas jealous and beds that made us not want to leave the room.  Overall, the best hotel experience I've ever had only matched previously by a stay a few years ago at the Shore Club in Miami, another of the Morgan Hotel Group properties.  They've earned a ""customer for life"".  The St. Martins Lane London location is perfect for first time visitors to London and walking distance to most of the major attractions.  Gymbox, the gym attached to the hotel, is one of the coolest gyms I have ever been in and I even used the opportunity to have a private training session with one of their personal trainers, also a great experience.  I can not say enough good things about this hotel and our stay.  Also, if you are looking for an terrific meat-centric dinner while in London, be sure to visit the Hawksmoor in the seven dials neighborhood.  Delicious!",5,2013,08,20
125,Great Hotel & Excellent Location!!,"I took my partner to St Martins Lane Hotel for 1 night for her 30th Birthday.  Location was important as I had arranged dinner and theatre in the area and St Martins Lane was an ideal choice for the night.

I had booked us a deluxe king for the night and once we arrived to check in we was upgraded free of charge to a studio room, a perfect start to my partners birthday.

Our room was bright, clean, had lots of space, massive wardrobe, desk, iPod docking station, a big bathroom that had a bath tub and walk in shower and well stocked amenities and the mood light in the room was a lovely touch.

The staff we encountered was friendly and polite and happy to assist when we needed them.

The hotel lobby is modern and clean and the giant chess pieces are a great touch!

We ate breakfast in Asia De Cuba the following morning, the breakfast selection was of a good choice with cereals, cold meats, fresh fruit, cereal and various cooked breakfasts to order from the menu.

We had small problem with the heating in the room which resulted us in having to move room, but once we was about to move, the heating issue had been resolved so we stayed put in our room.

One small criticism, the rooms don‚Äôt have tea/coffee facilities which I found strange for a 5* hotel. Having travelled all over the world, staying in various 4* and 5* hotels, this was the only hotel that I have stayed in that didn't have tea/coffee facilities in the rooms.

A special thanks to Steffi Steidle for all her help before we checked -in and a big thank you for arranging the birthday cake for my partner who was very happy with the surprise.",4,2013,08,20
125,Just Wonderful,"The hotel is fantastic!
Everytime I go to London I stay in this hotel. As I‚Äôm coming back to London in September I‚Äôll stay there again.
The accommodation is great, the rooms are confortable, the staff is very helpful and the location is just excellent!
A perfect hotel for vacations or business trips.",5,2013,08,19
125,"Ed the star man. A Great Service, Location and even better staff.","If your want a hotel with a great location and to be treated like a V.I.P from the start of your stay then St Martins lane is the hotel for you.
Upon arrival we were greeted and very warmly welcomed by a concierge who introduced himself as ""Ed"".
He quickly guided us to the bright and contemporary styled reception area, took our luggage and introduced us to the very friendly and extremely polite reception staff who checked us in very swiftly and very efficiently. A lovely touch also, was that our rooms were ready earlier than the stated check in time.
""Ed"" then showed us up to our room, which on entry was very tastefully decorated in a contemporary style, with ambient mood lighting which I thought was a nice touch.
We were shown the amenities, like the mini bar, complementary robe ans slippers, safety deposit box and asked whether we would like any complementary Tea or coffee brought up to our room. 
We had a shower and not a bath which suited us fine. The bathroom is tastefully decorated. 
A word of caution though, the cosmetics that are placed around the bathroom and bedroom are not so clearly marked as for sale and not ""complementary"" as they seem. But some use of your common sense, you will be fine. As this being the only fault, its not much of one.

The rooms are cleaned daily, with fresh bedding and towels (if you require them). There is a turn down service, so when you get in from you evening out, the mood lighting is set and your bed is ready for you. Another nice touch that goes a long way.

From the lobby, you have a bar which opens from 16.30 until approx 3am, which serves up some of the best cocktails I have tasted and its a great way to start the evening off and also for a night cap too. The drinks are reasonably priced, the staff again are second to none. Polite, smiling and very friendly. They could not do enough for us.
Also from the lobby area is the restaurant which is also the breakfast area. We did not have the chance to eat there in the evening as we had bookings elsewhere or otherwise we would have as the menu looked delicious. We had the breakfast buffet which had an excellent choice of fresh fruit and cereals, the √Ä la carte breakfast menu was delicious too. The staff again are amazing. (I seem to repeating myself here but they are worth mentioning again and again)
The location of the hotel was paramount for us choosing it. Covent garden, Leicester squire and Trafalgar square are all just 5-10 mins walk away.
The tube is very near too. All in all, perfect. 
The staff on the door are again, amazing. Always on hand for advice and directions.
I must say again a big thanks to Ed. He is an absolute star man, who made our stay so much more special. This man deserves a medal for service.
I dont normally stay at the same place twice, but for the reasons Ive stated above and the service we received, which in my opinion is above and beyond the call of duty and one of the best I have experienced, I will be returning to the St Martins Lane hotel.
Thanks once again to all who worked so diligently, that made are stay so enjoyable.
Tony & Julie.",5,2013,08,19
125,Amazing customer service!!,"I stayed at the St Martins a few weeks back and was very very impressed. I stay in London quite a bit for business and pleasure, and have stayed at 5 star hotels here which are lovely, but the St Martin's just gave that bit extra. The customer service was phenomenal, from the lovely ladies on reception, who sent up birthday cake for my partner as they knew the stay was a birthday surprise for him, to the incredible guys and waitress in Asia de Cuba who sent out birthday cake, as they had been forewarned by front of house it was a special occasion. It was great to see a hotel with matches up its style and substance, the decor was beautiful, minimalist with dashes of quirkiness. But the real stars are the staff, whoever trains these people deserves a raise!! As do the staff themselves. I will most definitely be staying again, and I would recommend anyone else to do the same.",5,2013,08,19
125,Superb place,"We had a great time during our stay ‚Äì everything was top notch ,super clean and just as you would expect from a high class hotel.
The staff were all very accommodating especially bell captain Ed who made our stay most enjoyable. In fact all of the staff bent over backwards to help us.
Great location too - highly recommended.",5,2013,08,19
125,best hotel in London by far,"I very rarely write reviews, however on this occasion I though I must take the time and just let everyone know what exceptional service I received from this hotel.

I booked this via lastminute, and got a very good deal.  As I was planning a special weekend for myself and my partner I contacted the hotel direct to see if they could help making it even more special.  

Even though I had not booked direct with the hotel, and had paid a fraction of the price of the normal room rate, a very nice lady (Nicole) emailed me back with some great suggestions.

She also upgraded my room free of charge with out even me asking.

I was planning to propose to my partner over the weekend and Nicole came up with some great suggestions to make it special, including rose petals and candles in the room on arrival, which cost wise was not a great expense, she also arranged for a fresh fruit platter and also a gift set for my partner, which was just simply amazing.

The hotel itself is in a great location, so close to everything, but also very quite at night.  We were on the 6th floor.

We used the light bar and Asia de Cuba, and again no faults, and trust me I can be picky.

When we arrived at the hotel, before going out for the evening we both took a bath and used the towels, when we came back in the evening, we came in to find the bed had been turned down and more fresh towels had been supplied, and service above and beyond

We have stayed at many hotels around the world, many 5 star, and I must say that the service I received from this hotel was by far the best.  Every member of staff was helpful, and I felt they really wanted to make you feel welcome.  Nicole is simply amazing and is a real asset to the hotel.",5,2013,08,19
125,The London hotel for Londoners!,"Our stay at St Martins was a gift for our wedding anniversary (even though we live in London) and it was bliss from start to finish. The location couldn't be bettered and waking up on St Martin's Lane felt like such a treat ‚Äì it's a shame we can't just move in permanently! We loved the sleek minimal room, the cocktails in the Light Bar and the staff could not have been friendlier. A special mention has to go to Ed in the foyer who was incredibly helpful and always smiling.",5,2013,08,19
125,My Second Home In London,"I normally stay at the St Martins Lane at least 5 times a year while in London for work. The location is second to none, right by the Soho area.  I have come to know most of the staff and they provide amazing service. The location of the state of art GYM (GYMBox) is also something I weigh very heavily whenever I stay at a hotel. Clean and spacious rooms and stunning lobby bar and restaurant included. Great place to stay,",5,2013,08,18
125,My Favourite Hotel!,"Just returned from celebrating our wedding anniversary and have been so impressed with St Martins Lane.
Having previously worked in travel for a number of years, I have stayed in most of London's top hotels. I can't wait to return to St Martins next time we're in London.
The hotel was at full capacity, but Nicole checked us in and made us feel like we were her first guests of the day. She gave us two free cocktail vouchers, as we were celebrating our anniversary.
We stayed in a deluxe room, which had fluffy dressing gowns, slippers and an amazing hair dryer and hot powerful shower. Even spare razors for the men.
The light bar was amazing, the lemon meringue champagne cocktails was to die for (we certainly didn't find the bar pretentious as some reviews have said). The full English breakfast was delicious and even the coffee was nice for a change.
Every member of staff, without exception were so friendly.
To summarise, its a perfect location, modern, clean, friendly and we'll definitely be returning.",5,2013,08,18
125,Fantastic!,"This is the second time I have stayed here and it was just perfect!
Staff were great and so helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and our room was impeccably prepared (as it was the last time) and so comfortable.
We'll be back soon I hope.",5,2013,08,18
125,"An Amazing hotel, Needs work on the Service and Value","I was brought to this hotel by my sister as part of a trip to the city for my birthday, first impression was very good, the hotel itself is impressive and the decor it unlike anything I have seen before. 

Service at check-in was friendly yet the staff made us wait quite some time and seemed rather uninterested. 

Room was lovely, immaculately clean and well furnished. 

The evening we arrived we were on a tight schedule and phoned reception to arrange us a taxi for 7:30 however when we arrived to the lobby the doorman was nowhere to be seen and neither was our taxi, although we were assured it was on its way we were still kept waiting for over 15 minutes and would've been better off hailing one ourselves. 

The only thing I could really complain about was our view (or lack thereof) which overlooked an alleyway and must have been a kitchen / staff entrance as I was woken up very early in the morning by shouting from down below and the unloading of vans into the hotel. 

I was unimpressed that breakfast was not included in the rate, as it is relatively pricey. We checked out the menu / continental buffet and weren't impressed so went to Covent Garden instead.",4,2013,08,18
125,Fabulous hotel and brilliant staff,"We stayed here for a birthday treat and had a thoroughly excellent evening. The room was very nice, the staff were exceptionally friendly and we had a fantastic night. The location of the hotel is great for the theatre and he many eateries and bars of Covent Garden and the West End.",5,2013,08,18
125,Fabulous hotel,"At arriving at the hotel there was a mix up with our booking & we had visions of  crawling around london trying to find a room but then the management were amazing. For the trouble caused they upgraded us to a fantastic room with fab views complementary champagne & breakfast.
Within a few minutes of being in our room Natalie (who was great) called up to say they were to give us a full refund! 
Breakfast was to die for & the staff there were lovely & accommodating to every need.
5* in all areas.
Thankyou for a superb stay & will be coming again for our 10th wedding anniversary!

125,My favourite hotel in London,"I have been going to London for business for the last 5 years, I go on the average 3 to 4 times a year, and always look forward to going to st martins lane. the hotel itself is contemporary with a great edge to it, the rooms and beds are extremely comfortable and i have found myself not wanting to leave the bed on many trips, my favourite is the bathrooms, i love the sleekness and how clean they are with the most powerful shower jets i have ever been under (helmut required), soo amazing. all this being said the truly best quality of the hotel is the staff, it is like coming home, everyone knows me by name and they make me feel like part of the st martins family, i truly look forward every trip! i have recommended the hotel to alot of people and have only heard positive feedback!",5,2013,08,16
125,World class service - they treat you like family!,"Prime location, hip and cool setting, this boutique hotel is tops in my book. From the moment you walk in, you are taken care of. Ed, Mike, Gemma, Jesse, Amy, Angela, Anna, Nicole and the rest of the staff go out of their way to make sure you feel right at home and have everything you need. I especially like the pot of coffee that arrives at the same time as my wale-up call. The service is truly world class. Add to it that this chic hotel is just steps away from Trafalgar and Leicester squares, and an easy stroll to Piccadilly and Regent St. make staying here a no-brainer. I can't wait to come back and catch up with everyone. Thank you! - Glen",5,2013,08,16

125,Home away from home!,"I've been travelling to London on business for about 6 years now, and I won't stay anywhere other than St. Martin's Lane.
The hotel is lovely, immaculately clean, has an amazing & convenient West End location and the staff is fabulous & friendly.
As a lady who travels alone quite often, I feel safe & sound at St. Martins Lane. Truly, a home away from home when I am abroad. I've also never found a better value for the money.
Excellent hotel!",5,2013,08,15
125,Nice hotel but definitely not worth 5*,My husband and I decided to stay in London for our first wedding anniversary..so we chose this hotel..first impressions very smart hotel...the lady at the front desk asked if it was a special occasion. .and we both replied its our first wedding anniversary...she didn't say anything..we were taken to our room..it was smaller than I thought...there was nothing complimentry for our anniversary no champagne/chocolate...not even coffee and tea making facilities.....I was really disappointed the carpet had a large yellow stain..the bed was uncomfortable...I had to ask at reception for tea and coffee facilities..later in the evening we went to the hotels club and the man at the door said do you have a reservation...again I was disappointed...the breakfast was the best thing about the hotel...we didn't have to leave the room until 12 the next day but we decided to leave at 10.30 I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all..very disappointed,3,2013,08,15
125,Perfectly positioned.,"We booked this hotel for a night after I had a knee operation and it paid dividends as we were based right in the heart of the West End near to everywhere we needed ......Theatre-land, J.Sheekey (one of my favourite restaurants), and all the attractions of the West End......so no rushing for the last train - just pure relaxation at this wonderful hotel. The rooms were minimalist and they worked really well. Breakfast was a joy. Relaxing, personal service and freshly cooked - unlike some of the breakfast buffet scrums you get at many 'popular hotels'. Would I go back to St Martins Lane? Like a shot!",5,2013,08,15
125,There's no place like home,"I do a fair amount of traveling for business being based out of NY and London has been a favorite of mine for years. I can safely say I have been to this fair city at least 80x and many a night at St. Martin;s Lane or its sister hotel not far away.
Being a frequent guest to many of the Morgan Hotel Groups locations, there are so many commonalities whether you check into Miami, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco or London that by the time you arrive to your room, you can really lay right down on that beautiful bed, with a big sigh and say, ""Finally, I am home!"" From the treatments and trimmings and the ameneties one receives and lets not speak of the staff, well I am a bit biased as once you frequent St.Martin's Lane or Sanderson, the staff great you with a great welcome back or if you are lucky enough to stay in South Beach, they say, "" Welcome to Paradise!"". Enough, my few words alone should have you running to check this place out, great vibe, great people, hey, its the place to be!",5,2013,08,14

125,Great location! Wonderful staff!,"St. MARTINS LANE is most definitely a 4  star hotel.  Rooms are very clean. Staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Rooms are minimalistic, decor has not changed in over 12 years, however, this is what makes the HOTEL special. Location is perfect and can not be better. (WEST END THEATRE DISTRICT) 

We had dessert and drinks in restaurant. Desserts great! Restaurant was empty? 

I love the minimal look of rooms, but recommend the HOTEL redecorate to 2013 decor.",4,2013,08,12
125,"Great location, great service but pricey and pretentious","We stayed in this hotel because it's in a perfect location for going to see a show.
Coventry garden and Leicester Square are 2 mins walk away and so is the nearest tube station and most if the theatres.
There is so much to say about this hotel. I have a love hate relationship with it. We had a corner room which was bright, white and spacious with huge windows. The room was clean but a little worn around the edges (cracked bathroom tiles, worn carpet etc). The bed had huge fluffy pillows but the bed itself wasn't comfy but im really picky with beds (I stop in Premier inns a lot and their beds are south better). The shower was good, the water was hot and the toiletries were nice. There was quirky multi coloured mood lighting above the bed but no good lights near the mirror whe applying make up etc. There were some bath robes, a decent hair dryer and a docking station which was nice but no tea making facilities. The toilet roll was poor quality and the towels were big but a bit rough. The duvet cover also felt, well a bit cheap and crunchy really.
The bar area was good fun but full of really pretentious people.
I know you pay a premium for the location but I did expect more for ¬£225 a night. The staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough.
Overall the location is good, the rooms are spacious and the staff are great but you can't help feeling like you've paid a little too much. I think the facilities and location rather than the finish of the rooms give it the star rating it has.
I would stay again but I wouldn't pay full price.",4,2013,08,11
125,"Very clean, very quiet, very comfortable","I had stayed in this hotel about 10 years ago and it doesn't seem any different so maybe is tiring now. The bathrooms are all lovely finish, amazing power shower and room spotlessly clean which so rarely happens, even though rooms on smallish side no noise from adjourning rooms and staff all seem happy and friendly . Only negative quite small room, and lobby smells of food. Decor very mimimalist other than very odd looking pot plant on wall which completely jarred with surroundings",5,2013,08,10
125,My favourite hotel,"The St Martin's Lane never fails to impress.  From welcoming doormen, to friendly receptionists to the beautiful white linen atop comfy beds with loads of pillows in the lovely bright bedrooms, we found it difficult to leave to go out and explore London.",5,2013,08,10
125,Treated like a Star!,"Booked room via Top Secret rooms BUT we were still given superstar treatment...upgrade to loft room with the most amazing view AND complimentary champagne to celebrate birthday & anniversary. Well done, we will be back again!",5,2013,08,09
125,Better hotels in London for less money,"I booked this as a birthday treat for my husband as he's always wanted to stay there for its famously cool designed interior and its location in Covent Garden.  The service is really great, you can't fault that, there is a great cocktail bar on the main floor too, although the crowd is a pretentious, wannabe seen crowd with a hint of the meat market feel about it.  Cool DJ set and gorgeous belgian chocolate martinis though.  The room itself was really spacious and on a corner of the building so had a great outlook, however it had a musty smell in the bathroom, you know that stagnant water smell, the furnishings were becoming worn at the edges, the bathroom had no door although it was around a corner but still there wasn't much in the way of privacy from sound effects if you're a little on the prude side. Maybe my expectations were too high, though I felt the price warranted something a little more luxurious inside, I guess due to its rep and location though it was not going to be any cheaper.  I paid ¬£175 and afterwards wished I had booked another hotel.  Like I said, the service was really professional but I wouldn't stay there again.",3,2013,08,09
125,"Don't bother if you're paying full price, better places to stay!","Like everybody else read the reviews liked what we read, offer on Secret Escapes so we booked. Location fantastic could not wish for better. Light bar = Light wallet, only used the restaurant for Breakfast, nothing to complain about included in the price, however plenty more breakfasts outside half the price. Now here's the problem, waited at least 20 minutes to check in, on our first full day returned to our room at approx 4:30pm room had not been cleaned! Asked for tea tray when we arrived fine no problem there, however it wasn't replenished when the room was eventually cleaned, asked at the desk as we left to got out in the evening only to find the next morning NO milk. To my mind this hotel is all front with pretentious smiles and little substances, for the star rating of this hotel appalling!! The stupid thing is, having said all the above,would we stay again?Yes we probably would ""On a really good deal"" the location is superb, we only stayed for the weekend, two nights, so the poor service was irritating but did not effect our most enjoyable weekend. There are better places to stay the Fleming for example.",3,2013,08,08
125,Simply THE BEST!,"This hotel, well and truly lives up to its expectations. It was a truly marvellous stay and one that has made me want to return ‚Äì and soon.

My husband and I work in London, and so to stay at St. Martin‚Äôs was a total treat on a weekend ‚Äì and this without our kids! It is a stay here that we  have both wanted to do for some time now, and we are so very glad we did!

We got a super offer for a night‚Äôs stay including breakfast through Secret Escape‚Äôs and it was thoroughly brilliant. 

I must say that I am always quite critical of hotels and my expectations run quite high‚Ä¶.
However, from the moment we stepped into the hotel to when we left it seemed as if nothing was too much bother for anyone. 

The lady that very swiftly and efficiently checked us in at reception (Jess, I believe) was wonderful. We were staying overnight for a wedding at the Royal Opera House; so for its proximity and ease of location we cannot fault it at all! 

Back to check in and we had a slight predicament as we needed to check in earlier than normal given we had to get ready for our friend‚Äôs wedding. As an alternative (at this point no rooms were available) we were kindly offered the Gym Box next door with complimentary passes so that we could change. However after returning back to the hotel we were told that a room had been made up and was ready for us to use straight away.

They were so accommodating. Honestly. Brilliant!

The room? Well, the room was lovely. All of the usual mod cons you would expect. The sheets were the lovely, pristine, crisp white‚Äôs that you so desire and is a total prerequisite in a hotel of this order. Lovely. The bathroom was very well thought out also. 

The following morning at breakfast ALL of the staff here were wonderful. Furthermore our compliments to the chef - my breakfast of Eggs Benedict were simply amazing. Just the right portion and was the best I have had in quite some time. Fabulous. If nothing else, I would return for this over and over again!

The Full English was also wonderfully presented and consumed quite happily by my husband, who ‚Äì like me were both suffering the most amazing hangovers from hell. Weddings!!! They seem to have this effect!

We rushed off sadly and didn‚Äôt enjoy the benefits of the room; nor the bar as we would have liked under the circumstances. 

We would MOST DEFINITELY return to this establishment, even just for drinks and or for me ‚Äì that great breakfast!

Thanks to everyone that we encountered. You really made it for us, given it was only an overnight stay. Cannot wait to return folks!!! 

Compliments from Mr & Mrs Gibson.",5,2013,08,08
125,A whirlwind stay at the lovely St.Martins Lane Hotel!,"Our stay couldn't have been better or more enjoyable!
The staff were just fantastic, to say the least!!
From Igor to Amy and Danielle and Mark, all the staff we came across were superb, extremely helpful, welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.They even delivered an amazing chocolate cake to our room, as the trip was booked by my husband for my birthday.
The room was tremendous with a truly sumptious bathroom. 
Asia de Cuba was also great and terrific value when we experienced the pre-theatre dinner.
A fantastic choice for anyone looking for a special treat!!",5,2013,08,07
125,"Location, location, location","Brilliant location. Decor made us smile, pretentious in the extreme, large gold molars as seats, giant chess pieces and a massive vase, made us feel like munchkins. Staff were super friendly. Light Bar, worth a visit, again just to marvel at the decor & prices! Couldn't work out how to shut blinds in room so awake at day break! However brilliantly located, very comfortable beds and lovely toiletries in bathroom. Don't drink from mini bar, bottle of Volvic water cost me ¬£5. There is a tesco 2 mins away with full range of lovely cold beverages. Good value break on last minute.com.",4,2013,08,06
125,Nice hotel,"I had booked this hotel thru last minute as it was the featured secret hotel. The location was excellent although if I hadn't checked on google maps I would have walked past as hotel has no sign. It's right beside Leicester square on the way to covent garden so ideal for the west end. I stayed with my 16 year old son who did think it was a bit ""fancy"". The style of the hotel is very modern and I can imagine not to everyone's taste, especially older visitors . We didn't use the bar as we ate out and to be honest we could afford the hefty breakfast, thankfully there is a McDonald's up the road and Starbuckss across the road. The rooms where lovely, very white! Excellent bathroom, tv etc and good air conditioning. No tea or coffee facilities which was bit of a shame. The staff she very helpful and friendly. The only negative was that we had to pay ¬£10 for Internet access which I thought was a rip off (premier in only charge ¬£3) in this day and age this was extortionate.

Other than that we had a good stay ",4,2013,08,06
125,Fantastic place for our long weekend!,"We've just stayed in this hotel for a long weekend.  We had just a fantastic time!  We upgraded our room on arrival - this was the largest central London room I have stayed in, at least 40% larger than the room we had at the W on a previous visit.  The room was very light and airy, the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was excellent - large bath tub, extremely powerful shower and separate toilet.  The toiletries were lush.  

There were little quirky touches in the room - a planted flower pot on the wall, ""mood lighting"", a beautiful orchid arrangement on the lit-up marble desk - all very nice.  

A minor gripe - as seems to be standard in posh London hotels, there were no coffee making facilities - what is it the problem that London hotels seem to have with this concept?  Surely it cannot be too much to ask to have this in the room, rather than making an extra buck or two out of your guests for room service coffee?

What really made our stay though was the staff - from the moment we checked in, everybody was just so friendly and nice without seeming ""fake"" or over the top.  The bar prices were also more acceptable than is often the case in luxury hotel bars - and I loved the way how the bar turned into a ""cheesy 80s disco"" on Friday night with most of the guests spontaneously getting off their seats and having a boogie.  I did not expect that, and it again made a welcome change from our previous experience with the W, where the people at the bar were clearly far too cool to behave like this... :-) 

Overall, can't wait to come and stay here again.  

Oh and I forgot to mention - the location is brilliant too, you can't get more central than this.",5,2013,08,06
125,Very clinical and cold,"Excellent location, and very attentive, helpful staff, but felt it lacked substance over style!  Very clinical, minimalistic, made it feel quite cold and unwelcoming.
Lacked 'home comforts'.  No tea making facilities.  One very small bottle of water for 2 nights, and 2 people.  Not what I expect from a 5* hotel?
Purchased through lastminute.com 'Secret Hotel' so didn't know where we were staying until after booking.
Although full of quirky designs, and very stylish, it was just too minimalistic for us.",2,2013,08,05
125,Stark and modern,"Philip Stark influenced the decor to this hotel assuming a minimalist but quirky design. Ideally located off Trafalgar Square/soho/theatre land, the hotel is extremely comfortable, welcoming, and staff very friendly and helpful. The room was equipped with iron, ironing board in addition to top quality products, wi games, dryers and shavers. breakfast was really good with wide range of options and loved the lemon meringue champagne cocktail. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will use this hotel again.",5,2013,08,04
125,Good value,"Had a superior queen room on the 5th floor. It received a lot of sunlight in the afternoon and it was 30¬∞C in London but the aircon worked perfectly well. The windows were soundproof. Comfortable bed, very clean carpet, nice marble desk. The bathroom and dressing took half the size of the 30 sqm room and are well designed, with separate bathtub and powerful shower. The only odd touch were the 90s style bulky telephones, the absence of free wifi and the shaky elevators.",4,2013,08,04
125,Not over excited about this hotel !,"Stayed at this hotel for my husbands 40th, on arrival staff are lovely and helpful.  They upgraded us as it was my hubby's birthday was given a court yard as an extra.  Room was ok size as it's an hotel so only needed to be sleeping here.  Bed sheets were a bit ripped and I expected better as this is a top hotel.  Location was brill.  Air con was great.  Lots of bars near by.  ",3,2013,08,02
125,This place is way too modern...,"Great location - right between Leicester Square and Covent Garden, you can't beat the selection of restaurants and nightlife in this area. However, that selection comes with a price; the hotel can be noisy so choose your room appropriately.

I asked for a quiet room and was told they only had rooms available on the first floor (Wimbledon weekend). It was a bit noisy at first, but then it quieted down. Not sure if I was in a sound jet-lagged sleep or if it actually did quiet down, but nonetheless, I slept well.

The rooms are a bit odd - I had trouble figuring out how to turn the lights on and off and was not sure what to do with the light that oscillated different hues of neon-colored light. What is the point of that!??! Use your profits for better sound insulation, please!

All in all, great if you're on a bachelor weekend getaway, but if you're there for work, I would go with something a little less modern and more practical.",4,2013,07,29
125,Perfect!,"We couldn't have picked a better hotel for our first visit to London. Everything from the accommodations, the decor, the extraordinarily friendly and helpful staff (special mention to Amy and Joey Ceunen, concierges extraordinaire!!), the superb location (literally minutes to most theatres, great restaurants, and fabulous shopping close to Covent Garden, the National and Portrait Galleries, Chinatown), were all perfect. Would definitely recommend to friends nd family, and look forward to staying here on our next visit!",5,2013,07,29
125,Amazing and helpful staff and great hotel near Covent Garden,"We stayed at St. Martins Lane last week for my husband's business trip and with our 14 yr old son. The room was very comfortable had good amenities and greAt air conditioning. The hotel is walking distance between two tube stations and walking distance to great restaurants shops and theaters. The best part about our stay was their amazing staff! The front desk, especially Nicole who took time to print our Eurostar tots after a half hour of trying to email our files to her. another incredible person at their hotel was their concierge from Belgium. I believe his name was Jimmy he arranged my daughter and her boyfriends' excess baggage issues for over an hour and even used his personal credit card to pay for the fees since none of our credit cards would work! This goes beyond the duty and I appreciated his patience and suggestions. this exclusive boutique hotel made our family feel at home and exceeded all of our expectations on our trip to London.",5,2013,07,24
125,Informal luxury,"Great location and a great night's sleep. The standard rooms are tiny (don't expect to be able to work in your room, I couldn't fit behind my desk) but I received a lovely welcome note and strawberries on arrival, and check out was painless. A candle was lit in my bedroom every night and excellent bathroom amenities. Asia de Cuba is an expensive but quality choice for dinner, lacking a little bit in 5 star service.",5,2013,07,21
125,Informal and style.,"An experience.
The staff is amazing.
The rate is fair.
Asia de Cuba is a good place to eat.
The Style is amazing and could be ""over"".
The point is ""Do you like to stay nearest Trafalgar Square and Picadilly?""

The service is superb, even if  compare with London high level.",4,2013,07,17
125,Style over function wrecks stay here  - Room 602,"Stayed here for 3 nights on business trip.   Hotel is well located and has pretty good AC that helped during heat wave period.  

Soundproofed windows minimize street noise, so I had a good view, and was still pretty quiet.   Front desk staff were helpful for most part, but night shift bellmen do not know the neighborhood very well.  read more on this below.

What's not to like:

-you must get out of bed to turn off the reading lights, that is unless you can read with green or magenta mood lighting

-a great tub is floating in middle of bathroom.  Ledge to put soap, shampoo etc is high up vs. adjacent to tub.   No grab bars either

-towel racks are stylish but towel would never dry on such a tiny rack so it defeats purpose of asking guests to hang up towels/go green

-no bedside tables within arms reach.  You have to get out of bed (or have really long arms) to reach the ledge behind the bed.  So I had to put alarm clock, reading light and other stuff with me in the bed.

- the build in venetian blinds embedded between the double paned window glass could not be adjusted - the pole to turn was missing, so you must have curtains closed all the way unless you want the building across the street to watch your every move.

-if you want to use hair dryer, only place to plug in near mirror is in closet - no ledge or table to put brushes, spray.  Must put items on floor or on bottom of closet

-local atmosphere lacking - the bar had not one British beer, ale or cider on the menu.

-desk is very narrow and fixed/floating in room.  The desk chair is made of metal. It is butt-rotting bad after 45 minutes.   

-only comfortable place to sit was on the bed.  At nearly $400 a night you'd think they could put in a comfortable chair.

-No local hospitality:  no tea/coffee tray in the room that is standard issue at most British hotels.  Had to ask for tea tray/kettle to be brought up.  It took up most of space on the narrow desk, so only other place to put it was on the floor.

-TV system is maddening to use.  Nobody on phone at front desk could describe how to use it so an engineer was sent up to show me how to use the TV.  Whoever bought this system should be sacked!

-night shift bellman were eager to please but poorly informed.  They need to tour around the neighborhood.  After being told that few stores would be open on Sunday morning before 12 noon, I went out at 10am and found a Co-op, a Sainsbury's local and a Tesco market within three blocks of hotel that were all open for business.

-tired 90's too-cool for you style decor with dimly lit halls and corriders.  Geez, get some lightbulbs that are more than 30 watts.

Boil down: if you are in London to party and need a hotel near theaters and Covent Garden/Soho area, don't need to use a hairdryer, don't mind getting out of bed to turn off reading lights or hunting down alarm clock, don't care about watching TV, don't care if you get any British flavor/feel from your visit, this place is for you.

For the price paid there are many better choices.  I would not stay here again.",3,2013,07,16
125,Top class personal service from check in to check out.,"All I can say is wow! Our stay was absolutely amazing! To be entirely honest, the hotel initially felt a little cold and sterile but the staff at SML really do have the ability to warm any environment.
From the customer service received (not only by the staff who we met but also the management behind the scenes) to the bar and the breakfast, this hotel truly exceeded our expectations. 
I can honestly say that there is nowhere I'd rather stay when visiting central London. ",5,2013,07,12
125,Worth every cent....,"We've been wanting to stay in this hotel for the past 15 years but have always been swayed somewhere else (hazlitt's, zetter, etc.)  I was worried that the hotel would feel ""old"".  While it does show the years it is still a wonderful place to stay.   From the doorman Edward, to the desk clerk Analisa everyone was friendly and helpful.  Our 6th floor room on the corner had wonderful light with views out to st. martin's lane and beyond.  The bathroom has a great layout with places to store everything. We we're in London for Pride weekend and the city was overrun with party people.  The wonderful thing about this hotel is it is set off from the crowds of Leicester square by just a few blocks, but it makes such a difference.  We had considered the W but when I actually saw the hotel, with the hordes of crowds surrounding it (not to mention the very odd M&M store in the lobby...?) I was so glad I had picked SML.
The hotel is still worth the price for style and location.",5,2013,07,10
125,Home away from home!,"We stayed in the St. Martin's Lane a few times and it is our home away from home in London.  The people working there couldn't be nicer!  Mike, the concierge will do anything for you that he humanly can!  The location is superb: theaters within walking distance, J. Sheeky restaurant across the street, the National gallery 5 minutes away!  We wouldn't stay anywhere else!  Thanks!",5,2013,07,10
125,Central with nice rooms,"I returned to St Martins lane after at least 10 years (if not more) and things haven¬¥t really changed that much. The hotel looks like it did when new, albeit some wear and tear in the public spaces, the rooms are very nice. Minimalist, clean and spacious enough. Having lived in London the past 5 years, I am not that well acquainted with recent London hotels, except from the bar / restaurant scene. SML is a nice place to stay, very very central for all London offers just outside the door, but still calm and quiet. Service is very good (the even remembered my 10 year old former stay!, and room service swift serving a fantastic breakfast). Asia de Cuba is a very nice restaurant (been before) but the bar in some way feels a bit ""noisy"", and they do not have any other lounge area for you to enjoy a quiet drink (not allowed to bring your drink into the lobby!).",4,2013,07,09
125,Slick & stylish central London hotel,"We stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel for two nights and the service was nothing short of fantastic for the whole duration of our stay - from check in to check out, everyone we encountered during our stay (from the reception, to the light bar, to the maids in the hotel corridors) were exceptionally polite and friendly. 

I am the greatest advocate of modern, slick hotels (especially in Central London) but I must say on this occasion I do think it may of been slightly 'style over substance'. The room was very compact (although we did pay for the 'best available rate' so I wasn't expecting a suite) & there is an emphasis on up-selling throughout.. you can buy the toiletries in the bathroom, the candles in the room, the ipod dock, the alarm clock.. the list goes on! My partner almost opened a bottle of soap thinking it was complimentary (it was situated next to the sink) until he spied a very discreet price list highlighting the circa ¬£30 price tag! That being said, this is an upmarket hotel & caters for your every need - it's just when you pay over ¬£300 for a room, you would maybe expect coffee/tea facilities rather than having to pay for it on room service (then again, a kettle really wouldn't fit into the 'style' of the hotel). 

All in all, absolutely fabulous stay, the location is superb (2 seconds walk from Leicester Square tube, 5 mins from Central Covent Garden & 5/10 mins to Embankment) and the staff are delightful. We brought a big group of friends for cocktails in the Light Bar on a Saturday night & the hotel were more than accommodating - brilliant service & fabulous drinks menu. 

Highly recommended.. just watch out for price lists in your room!",5,2013,07,09
125,Hospitality with a big H,"From check in up until check out it was all about hospitality. Staff is very friendly and very well trained. The deluxe room is large enough ( a corner room # 514 ) bathroom is ideal with 2 large mirrors and enough space to put down your toileteries. Bed is very comfortable and clean. The only slightly down side to the room is one can look into a neighbour room... and vice versa, so keep the curtains a bit closed.
Room is very well maintained for a 14 year old hotel!
Breakfast is fresh with plenty of choise, thank god not an over the top full stuffed breakfast buffet.
It's not a cheap hotel, the room rate is high, also breakfast and drinks but it is definitely worth it.
3 things they can improve. The music that's awful loud when entering the elevator, the music in the elevator... why??? And the corridor to the room is a bit run down ( carpet )
But all in all one of the best hotels I have stayed. If this is standard for Morgans Group, hear hear!",5,2013,07,03
125,Something a bit different! Not great for sharing colleagues,"Came here on a work trip, the cocktails in the bar are always brilliant. the food in the restaurant is amazing and the staff were really helpful.

I was sharing a double room which had everything you could need and even a little private enclosed terrace garden thing with a tree and a quaint table for 2.

My only complaint about the room we had would be that it was awkward for 2 sharing unless you are a couple! It is hard to explain the layout of the room but it is sort of like a cube with two hallways running past, off of these two hallways are the 'cupboards'- one for the shower, one for the toilet, one for sink, one for wardrobe e.t.c. While this made the room interesting and the shower was incredible! But this effectively meant that you had to leave your clothes in one area, shower in another, go to the toilet in another, dress in the open area of the room. There was no 'bathroom' as such. Awkward if you are sharing with someone you are not comfortable walking around naked in front of! There was absolutely no private area in the room at all.

I would still give it a 5 star rating and I have regularly returned since just for the great cocktail bar!",5,2013,07,02
125,"Excellent service, great location, modern and comfy room","Returned to this hotel after a year for a couple of weeks. The service is still consistently excellent. The people are very nice, helpful, and friendly. The hotel's location is superb-- right close to all the theatres, restuarants, and only few minutes from SOHO and Piccadilly Circus. If you want to take the tube to somewhere, it is only a few minute walk from Leicester station. Starbucks is right across the street from the hotel. Gymbox is right next to it. It's free of charge. And best of all, they do laundry for your gym clothes for free. I thought that was super awesome. The room was very comfy. The bed was also nice and comfy. Plenty of pillows to spare. Loved the lights on the table. What I looked forward to every night was the turndown service.. with the candle light in the bathroom (although I could do that myself, but I don't think I would get the lighting right!). This hotel is not just about esthetic, but they really put efforts into providing great service. Well done, St. Martins Lane. Keep up the great work!",5,2013,07,01
125,"Fabulous staff, relaxed atmosphere","We had an amazing time at the hotel, fabulous staff who were eager to please and looked like they were pleased to work at the hotel. Had a lovely snack in the bar after a full day out with friends, I highly recommend this hotel. Amazingly quiet in our room for such a busy hotel in the centre of London.",5,2013,07,01
125,Fantastic hotel and will definitely be returning!!,"Myself and my husband have just returned from here and we had a truly wonderful time! We came to London for our wedding anniversary and upon arrival we was greeted by Jessie who was so friendly and helpful. We was taken to our room by a very helpful man who showed us round and explained all the amenities in the room. 
Our room which was 143 was lovely and clean and spacious with a beautiful terrace. The bed was so comfy and the sheets were so soft!!!
We had some lovely cocktails in the bar in the evening. The bar staff were very attentive. 
On returning from our dinner we had a bottle of champagne waiting for us with a lovely note from Jessie congratulating us on our anniversary which was such a kind gesture.
We could here a slight noise from the bar when we were in bed but nothing to stop us from sleeping.
Breakfast was delicious and there was a lovely menu to choose from.
The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic and so accessible to Covent Garden and Leicester Square.
We can't wait to return here... It's a truly wonderful hotel.",5,2013,06,30
125,Beyond wonderful!,"We stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon and I can't believe I didn't write a review sooner!  We booked our honeymoon as part of a vacation package and St Martins Lane was an upgrade option--so we stayed at special rate with a full english breakfast.  Everything about our stay was simply perfect...The staff was wonderful!  The rooms were very nice with the largest bathroom I've ever seen in a hotel!  The location is convenient to everything--we walked to the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square and there's so much to see!  There are fabulous restaurants within walking distance and the hotel's restaurant Asia de Cuba was very good and where breakfast was served.  Upon check-out when the staff learned we were staying for our honeymoon, they even comped our wi-fi.  It was simply a wonderful stay and we hope to return in the future!",5,2013,06,30
125,St Martins my favourite hotel,"This hotel is unfailingly excellent. Friendly, welcoming staff, great service and right in the heart of Covent Garden. I stay here about 3 times a year and am always happy. Beautiful clean white sheets give a very zen feel to the room.",5,2013,06,29
125,Home from home!,"Lets start with the issue of tea/coffee tray ....or lack of one in the room!  For me it's a must have being a night owl in need of caffeine and early bird in need of caffeine.  I read several reviews kind of complaining about the lack of this basic facility in the rooms but management responded with 'just ask and we'll bring one up'.  That's what I did and that's what I got....a well stocked tray promptly delivered so please don't be put off by other reviews. Then there's room size.....well mine was great. Not sure what I got but I'd booked a standard room and it was great....2 double beds with plenty of space all around, a huge bathroom, dressing area and great desk space (think it was 116 or 126). Noise? Not a peep from the banging Lightbox bar even though I stayed Friday and Saturday night. Location...great! Theatreland and covent garden on the doorstep and so central that everything is easy to access.  Service...tiptop!  Staff were all young vibrant fun and friendly...nothing was too much trouble.  Restaurant...can't comment having not used it but it looked great....fully booked....buzzing atmosphere.  I hit the cocktail bar instead..the lightbox was buzzing...huge cocktail menu..yummy although the snacks/lite bites menu was a little limited.  The hotel itself is cool....it feels cool & calm...lots of space...no clutter....white white white peppered with funky light and the odd statement piece that is pure fun entertainment.  I would definitely recommend a stay at SML...I'd definitely go back.  If you want traditional grandeur you won't find it here but if you want a place where there are no airs and graces but plenty of chic and fun in a top central spot then SML does the trick.",5,2013,06,25
125,Fabulous location,"Recently stayed at the St Martin's Lane Hotel in London. We were passing through for two nights. We had tickets to go to the theatre, so thought we'd stay in the theatre district. Brilliant!! Short walking distance to everything. Theatres, Leicester Square, shops and an amazing choice of restaurants. The hotel is quite modern. The rooms are well equipped, but we were coming from a month on holidays, so we had a bit of trouble with our two large suitcases. Otherwise, the room was great. Fabulous breakfast, friendly staff. We really enjoyed our stay. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,06,24
125,Great Location,Have stayed here on a couple of occasions in the past. It's a great location for visits to the Opera or Theatre - its literally 2 minutes from the Coliseum. Standard rooms are not huge as you would expect but they are more than adequate and the bed was very comfortable.,4,2013,06,24
125,Turning bad into very good.,"I have stayed in this hotel many times and have always had a good experience.  I love the location, rooms, price value and the fact that although getting on a bit.... its still in good shape and has a bit of style. ( Sounds like me LOL) 

I am prompted to write now as I wanted to share an example of first class customer service. I always eat in Asia deCuba when I stay and this time invited a couple of colleagues to dine with me.  I had raved about the food and to my horror the food on that evening was not good and took an age to be served.  I complained on the night and was given a discount off the bill. It did however leave a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  On my last evening it was raining so I decided not to venture out for dinner but risk the restaurant again, the Young lady at the desk recognised me as a regular and I told her about my bad experience earlier in the week for no other reason than she asked....

I was shown to an excellent table and had a meal that was as good as I have had there in the past, there was also live music so for a dinner for one it was quite fun.  During dinner the manager of the restaurant came and asked about my bad experience earlier in the week, so I gave him the lowdown, again cos he asked not because I was complaining.  

Anyway, when I came to pay I was advised that dinner was on the house!  

This unexpected and un solicited gesture means that the hotel will continue to get 20 nights a year from my business and the restaurant my patronage and I hope yours...   

A simple message to all hotels, mistakes happen....its how you deal with them that determines the impact.

Bravo St Martins Lane and Asia deCuba

125,Best Stay ever!,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at from Ed, who helped with bags to Carolyn who cleaned our room. The staff was so friendly! Our room was so clean! beds were excellent as well.
Great location on top of everything else! a short walk to tube station as well as Charing Cross Station. Trafalgar, Picadilly, Covenant Garden literally a short walk away! two theatres across the street and a few shops down was the Coliseum Opera House. A Tesco right around the corner if one needed it. A beautiful restaurant with good food and a very friendly staff. I'd come back again just because I felt welcome and appreciated as valued guest.",5,2013,06,19
125,A Wonderful Place,"I've stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel the past three years. I love the rooms, the Light Bar, and the location. But mostly, I love the friendly, caring, competent, and enthusiastic staff. Since I travel by myself, the personal touch is very welcome. It is always sad to leave.",5,2013,06,19
125,St Martins Lane better than The Sanderson,"We stayed here for our 2nd wedding anniversary last year and stayed in the Sanderson for our first and St Martins Lane won hands down.  The staff were fantastic from the check in on reception (and the wonderful upgrade when they realised it was our anniversary) to the great staff behind the bar and at Asia de Cuba who were so accommodating and friendly.  The location is great and overall the service felt much more personal than The Sanderson, although they did recognise our anniversary with a bottle of wine overall you felt like a guest passing through vs being made to feel special and looked after at St Martins Lane.  The Sanderson does have the benefit of of a Spa and I would thoroughly recommend the treatments there but the only real downside of St Martins Lane is a very small bar (we like to sit at the bar for drinks) and its still the winner in our eyes.",5,2013,06,17
125,"Very relaxing, great food","Very welcoming staff, the room was excellent and the food in the restaurant was out of this world! The hotel is in a great place for enjoying everything London has to offer and the views on the 6th floor are amazing. I'm definitely going back for another meal and some very good wines. A great stay, we will be back!",5,2013,06,16
125,First Class Stay,"As soon as you arrive at St Martins Lane you know you are in for a special stay. With a friendly welcome at the door, smooth check in, and a personal tour of the hotel for a first time guest.
Our bed was half the size of the room and really comfortable with beautiful soft bedding and fluffy towels. 
Amy at concierge was very helpful with fantastic advice where we could eat that evening, and advice on how to get around London.
On our second evening we dined at Asia de Cuba for their Cuban Evening, eating their taster Menu and served by Sam and Selena - both so very attentive.
All the staff while we stayed were all so happy in their work - so thank you all for a fantastic weekend.

125,All you want from a London hotel,"St martins is an ideal hotel for any type of break in London 
Great location.    Great food.   Great service     The hotel is obviously really well managed  but in a subtle way. All  of the staff take on there responsibilities to ensure each guest has a great stay. This was our second visit and the only time we have revisited a London hotel",5,2013,06,11
125,Great weekend!,"Stayed at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel for 2 nights ‚Äì wonderful location with theatres, museums, galleries etc. all within easy walking.  And Trafalgar Square almost on the doorstep.  The hotel is a delight ‚Äì strange sights at every turn and weird lighting effects everywhere.  Room small and minimalist, but very comfortable, and lots of hot water in cute bathroom.  The Light Bar and Asia de Cuba restaurant both great ‚Äì food and cocktails delicious!

125,Dave & Karen love this place!!!!,"After numerous visits to London and stays in various different 5 star hotels, we returned once again to St Martins Lane Hotel last weekend, and still - in our opinion - find this hotel unrivalled in the quality of accommodation on offer and it's superb location - right in the heart of theatre land/Covent Garden/Leicester and Trafalgar Square!
From the ""welcome"" when you first arrive from Edward and his team, through to the front desk guys, The St Martins Lane team are friendly, polite, helpful, knowledgeable of the city and always there with a big smile -  ready to help! Special thanks on this occasion to Nicole on Reception who was particularly helpful!
The room was bright, fresh, clean and fully loaded with anything you might just need during your stay.  Love the bathroom - very stylish!
Breakfast was superb, as were the late night 'tipples' in the trendy bar!! Again, the members of staff in the restaurant/bar areas were extremely accommodating.
Special thanks once again to Edward for making our stay memorable!!!
Dave & Karen, Lincolnshire.",5,2013,06,10
125,"Hip Hotel, Well Located for Fun or Business","I've stayed at this hotel for about 10 nights out of the last month on two separate trips.

First, it's got great staff.  Amit, Jessie, Danielle, Amy, Joey, Edward all fabulous.  Missed CJ this time, but everyone deserves a holiday.  On this trip I landed early in the morning and needed to get into my room before 11am.  They made it happen.  Needed shirt pressed, shoes shined, reservations, hamburger at 2am.  Effortless.

The location is on the theater neighborhood and next to Leicester Square.  Great access to Tube stations and local attractions.  Covent Garden and Soho are a short walk away.  Great restaurant choices abound with a 5 minute walk.  

Asia de Cuba restaurant makes a fine breakfast.  The bar is tons of fun too.

The rooms, while on the smaller-boutiquey-chic side are very comfortable.  It's like a big pillow.  The bathrooms are outstanding.  I had a full bath tub and a separate shower with incredible pressure.  Room service was both thorough, helpful but not intrusive.  Great amenities.

If you don't like 'Starck' design, this is not the place for you, however.

Starbucks across the street.  Some great pubs mere feet away.  Very safe area.

Overall highly recommended and I will be back.",5,2013,06,08
125,"Slinky and stylish, but somewhat sterile","A very cool hip happening hotel in the heart of London. Around the corner from Covent Garden and Leicester Square. We were given one of the corner suite rooms as an anniversary present and was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the room. What i found unlike other hotels, we found the rooms sparsely furnished and a tad sterile. The bathroom we had was massive, with a huge bath and separate shower with top quality bathroom amenities. I found the fact that everything in the room had a price tag on it. From the in house movies costing 13 pounds to the wifi costing 10 pounds a day, not to mention a phone call back home to Australia costing us nearly 7 pounds a minute. I understand these are the prices that usually come from staying in a 5 star establishment but what i am finding is that the influx of newer, nicer and smaller boutique hotels will often include alot of these services for free (we also stayed at the nearby hotel The Arch, and that included free wifi, free soft drinks, juices in the mini bar) and even complimentary movies to play in the DVD.... Dont get me wrong, this is a nice hotel, but i think you can find much better value for half the price.",4,2013,06,06
125,Fantastic location,"This hotel has a superb location about half way between Leciester Square and Covent Garden.
St Martin's Lane itself has a great choice of pubs, restaurants and coffee shops - I think you could find food and drink at just about any level within 300m of the front door.
The hotel design is all about style, and the staff were all very helpful and friendly with the most quick and sensible check-in I have experienced - no long speeches with too much detail to take in, just ""Here's your keys, anything you need just ask"" which was very refreshing.
The room was smallish, bright and airy and stylishly designed, but starting to look just a little bit tired. Nice big bathroom and power shower, and all nice and clean. Personally I would have liked tea and coffee facilities in the rooms, but there is a Starbucks directly opposite the front door, and this did not really detract.
Did not use the restaurant, but had a nice cocktail in the bar. It does seem to be a popular bar with non-residents due to the area so this is not one for those wanting a quiet drink on a weekend.
Over all, I would strongly recommend this place if you are seeing a show, or anything else in the area; or if you just want to feel in the middle of one of the most vibrant parts of central London.",4,2013,06,06
125,Stylish London Delight!,"This hotel, which I believe was designed by Phillipe Starck, is a really cool hotel choice for your next London visit. Located smack in between Leicester Square and Covent Garden, you will be able to walk to many of the most visited tourist destinations of London. 

The hotel puts emphasis on design, and this is reflected in everything from the lobby, restaurants and rooms. All these are of great standard.

Hotel staff are helpful and hospitable, and makes check-in and check-out easy and fast. The hotel is not filled with abundance of facilities, but guests can work out in the next door gym and enjoy post-work out drinks at reasonable prices in the lobby bar. 

All in all a hotel I can recommend for everyone.

Travel in style!",4,2013,06,04
125,Family trip to London to see The Lion King - Michelle G,"Our stay at this hotel made our first family trip to London a very special experience. Very friendly welcome at the front desk. The hotel and accommodation really funky and modern, we had a beautiful room on the second floor, very light and airy with very comfortable beds and a huge bath. A great nights sleep after lots of walking round the city. Delicious breakfast with again very friendly service, nothing too much trouble for the staff. Our little boy is four years old, the hotel staff were all extremely friendly, courteous and helpful taking the time and trouble to talk to him directly, making him laugh and feel very welcome. There is the perfect combination of style, luxury in a friendly, unpretentious setting. Perfect location for seeing the sights and visiting the theatre and dining out. We'll definitely be staying here again on our future trips to London.",5,2013,06,02
125,Understated elegance,"This hotel made my trip.  Ease at every turn.  Great products, comfortable rooms, and a very accommodating staff!  I highly recommend it. I recommend utilizing the concierge service.  They were consistently helpful with restaurants, shopping and theater tickets.",5,2013,06,01
125,Wonderful experience,First visit to this hotel for my sister and myself and we thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic service the staff are the best of any hotel we have ever stayed in nothing is too much trouble for them. Great room on the sixth floor really comfortable bed and a fantastic breakfast.  Will certainly stay here again and have already recommended to many of our friends and family.,4,2013,05,30
125,Always fantastic!!,"Can't praise this hotel enough. I've been coming here for years now and it really is the best experience of any hotel I've ever stayed at. The hotel itself is lovely, but its the staff that really make the experience so good. I'm a fussy, demanding regular who expects the best and these guys just surpass expectations every time. The little things make a big difference, and their attention to detail, service attitude, proactivity and sense of good fun really makes the stay an experience. Love the team there and they make me feel special - thank you guys as always!",5,2013,05,29
125,Very swanky pad.,"Stayed here for a birthday treat last weekend, faboulous welcome on the front desk and also by the very helpful concierge. Extremely trendy place, great room on sixth floor, comfy bed and superb bathroom. Would highly recommend. Just a short walk from Covent Garden tube.",5,2013,05,29
125,Amazing service in a perfect location,"If you are looking for a central location and top notch service then look no further. This hotel has it all - friendly, helpful, attentive staff and close to everything!
Look for Ed at the door, Anna Lisia at the front desk for great personalized service. Ed and AL not around, no problem - ask anyone at the concierge desk, front desk or the door and they will be only too willing to provide assistance. 
The rooms are bright, spacious, clean, modern and quiet. Perfect for relaxing after a long day of takin in all that London has to offer.
Absolutely we will stay again next time in this incredible city!",5,2013,05,28
125,Fantastic!!!,"i stayed here this weekend with a friend and we had the best time! The staff here are so amazingly helpful and relaxed that It was so refreshing.

Quite often in nice hotels you can find the staff to be robotic and following endless rules but here their relaxed attitude and genuine interest in chatting to us about our weekend was so nice.

Also the late check out made our weekend even more relaxing.

We had room service for dinner and breakfast before going out to a club and the food was amazing.

Ps Ahmed was awesome and really helpful.

Will definitely be back for another girls weekend very soon!!",5,2013,05,28
125,Home from home,"I travel to London frequently for business and always stay at the SML. Just got back from my 4th trip this year and I just couldn't stay anywhere else. From Ed at the front who makes everything easy, to Ana in the restaurant who remembers exactly how I like my coffee it is a hotel who makes sure that the little things are taken care of.
You are right in the heart of the West End and the lobby can sometimes be a ""scene"", but the rooms are always calming and relaxing. No fuss, nothing unnecessary just clean lines and the best beds. 
Be back in July, looking forward to it.",5,2013,05,26
125,The Best Staff Ever! LOVE This Place!,"I just stayed at SML for 11 nights for business. This is my 2nd stay with them, the 1st stay being just over 2 years ago.

The best pillows ever. 
Wonderful shower and bathroom.
Best small touch - they light candles for you every evening in your room.

Many of the same staff where there upon my return, including my favorite, the handsome and ever helpful - Ed Parkes. The staff is so lovely, always happy to see you. They bend over backwards to help and love doing so. I'm not certain, but I'd be pretty comfy saying SML treats their staff really, really well.

SML is smack in the center of Seven Dials/Covent Garden. Maybe a bit touristy for some, but I love being able to walk out onto a lively street scene. Tons of shops, restaurants, and of course theatre. Location, location, location.

I missed SML when I moved on to Prague.",5,2013,05,17
125,Nice designer hotel,"Stayed at a standard room, not the best view and not a big room, but clean white design, good bed and a clean room and bathroom. Quiet and no noise from street or hall. I liked that there is candles in the batroom and live plants.
Didn't like that they charge 10¬£ for 24h wifi - those days were you can charge for wifi is over. It is free at all restaurants nearby. 25¬£ for breakfast is to much, never tried it. Ate next door at a french bistro and got a full english breakfast at 8¬£.
Would stay here again and recommend te hotel - it is 5 star and it is located centrally and you have everything in walking distance.",5,2013,05,17
125,Maybe my favorite hotel.,"Work takes me to London fairly often.  Most years, it's 3-4x a year.  It's May, and I've already been 4x this year alone.  Years ago, when I first started going, we used to stay near the customers out in Canary Wharf at the Four Seasons.  Now mind, you, that's a beautiful hotel with a great staff, but we found that we spent the majority of our evenings in cabs or the tube going to the west end for fun.  So, naturally, we figured why not just stay there in the first place?

A friend turned me on to St Martins Lane, and at this point, I've stayed there maybe 10 times over the past few years.  One time, there was a misunderstanding related to a rate that included early check-in, but apart from that one thing, I've had nothing but great experiences there.  On one trip, there was a maintenance issue with my room that couldn't be immediately repaired.  So, rather than just swap me into a room of the same caliber, I got a double-upgrade.  That was a fun week.

Great location too.  You're within a  5 minute walk of at least 3 tube stations, and within 10 minutes of 7 that I can think of off the top of my head.  VERY easy to get around.  If you're the Starbucks type (like me), you'll be happy to find one 50 feet from the front door, straight across the street.

The staff is always very attentive and quite responsive.  Ed at the front door pulls cabs out of thin air, Gabor behind the front desk takes good care of you too, both great guys who stand out from an already excellent staff.

Looking forward to my next trip this summer.  Finally, my wife will be joining me, and it will be for fun, and not for work.",5,2013,05,16
125,"Modern, clean, superb.","An overnight stop in this hotel wasn't long enough! We had a wonderful room with a view of Nelson's Column. It was spacious and very white with a floor-length mirror - always a bonus for us ladies! 
The Light bar was buzzing (Saturday night) and cocktails, while quite expensive, were very good!
I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2013,05,16
125,Nice Hotel & Good Location,"We stayed at this hotel for one night on Valentine's day. 

The check in and check out process was very simple and straight forward. The room was very clean and well-equipped. 

The room was modern. White deco and bedding. The bed was really comfortable and bathroom was nicely furnished and decorated. The room had good facilities with an ipod doc. The room has floor to ceiling windows, which was really lovely as the sun came streaming into the room. 

We stayed a 2nd night in London, which we hadn't planned to do, so we chose to try out another hotel for the next night. This perhaps indicates that whilst the hotel was nice and couldn't fault it, it didn't grab us enough to want to stay for a second night. 

Would I stay here again - not sure, to be honest. I think that for the cost, I would probably choose to give another hotel a try.",4,2013,05,14
125,Charming and trendy,"I stayed in this hotel, since it was conveniently located at walking distance of the venue of a workshop I was attending.
The space was gorgeous and very posh - subtle and elegant,
My room was rather small but very cosy: modern furniture and comfortable bed. The negative points were the bad acoustic insulation and the lack of coffee or tea in the room.
Great bathroom and amenities.
The staff was helpful and polite without being too formal.",4,2013,05,12
125,Outstanding!,"I have stayed at the St Martins Lane each year since 2009 and have never had a problem.  The staff has always been helpful, checking in and out was flawless each time.  The location is perfect for me since my main reason in London is attending the theatre.  The rooms are quite nice. The beds are amazing!  I usually stay in the deluxe queen room but this year when I come in July I may splurge and try one of the corner rooms or perhaps the room with a patio.  Decisions! Decisions!

In any event I'm looking forward to having another outstanding time in London!",5,2013,05,09
125,fantastic - truely memorable stay.,"Just got back from a truely memorable over night stay for my daughters 15th birthday. Booked a secret hotel through Lastminute.com. I phoned the day before we arrived to request a high room - the girl on the phone was polite and made a note of the request.
we arrived at 12.00, 3 hours early to check in - no problem our room was ready. escorted to our room with a very chatty and  he made a real effort to make my daughter feel welcome. 
the room was amazing - 519 - corner room full lenth windows on 2 sides of the room. amazing views. bright and airy.  
When we came back after a diner in Soho had a drink in the restaurant - the light bar is over 21's only. this was explained to us when we arrived. our drinks were amazing - virgin mojito served in a jam jar filled will ice and mint. the whole entrance was lite with tea lights - it looked spectacular. 
We both slept realy well no noise. no tea or coffee in the room but we brought  a  starbucks coffee ( literal just across the rd) back. 
Check out was very slick - offered to store our cases for us. 
Overall the staff were brilliant, very friendly and welcoming. Which is quite unusual for a 5 star hotel in the middle of London.  they made it a perfect birthday treat . we will definalty go back.",5,2013,05,08

125,Amazing Visit Yet Again,"After visiting this hotel time and time again we still have an amazing time. The service is above and beyond our expectations and our room amazing!. From the moment we arrived to the point when we left we were treated amazingly. One little treat to our surprise was we were offered an upgrade to the most fantastic room and what a treat it was.
I can not fault both this hotel and their resturant Asia De Cuba it is the nicest hotel we have stayed in London and certainly lives up to its 5 stars.
Its well situated for access to all routes both in, around and out of London and I certainly recommend this for a romantic luxury break for two.
We are looking foward to our next visit very soon where I hope it still remains as luxurious and amazing as each other visit.",5,2013,05,06
125,Outstanding. @ the Light Bar.,"We recently had a night out with some business colleagues here at the Light Bar, based in the St Martins Lane Hotel. 

Simply fantastic. The vibe was brilliant. The doorman, especially, provided an exceptional service.

We can recommend the 'espresso martinis'",5,2013,05,06
125,Best of EVERYTHING,"Booked VERY last minute, with a heavy price tag, but worth EVERY penny!!!!!
Perfect location , perfect high tech room, perfect service - GREAT !
We can only highly recommend this and will definitely be back!!!!",5,2013,05,06
125,Wonderful Experience,"Stayed overnight for a friends birthday celebration in Leicester Square, and shall certainly be staying again!
From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredible. The service was impeccable without being too formal (as often experienced at other top end hotels) and as a result we felt extremely welcome.
The room we booked was a deluxe king, which was spacious and modern. The bathroom was lovely too, especially the large shower. It would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room, but I believe had we asked they would have been available. I'm very glad I had previously read on trip advisor that the room numbers are written on the carpet or it probably would have taken us a long time to find our room!
The only decor which wasn't to my taste was the hotel lobby, it just looked a little bit dated. 5 years ago I would have likely taken many photos of the furniture which is more art than function, but in 2013 it just didn't feel quite right. I suppose the fact that I comment upon it means it is doing it's job and evoking opinion.
Breakfast was good, though had it not been included in the room price I'm not sure it would've been worth it.
The location is excellent, very close to Leicester Sq tube station and easy walking distance of Covent Garden, Leicester Sq, The Strand etc.
If you are looking for a chic hotel, with great service and a friendly atmosphere which isn't too formal, look no further.",5,2013,05,05
125,Overall good hotel but too trendy for my taste,"Stayed for 3 nights on a recent business trip to London. I chose this hotel for the location. The room was large and clean and the bed was comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There were just a few things that keep it from really being a great place to stay. First, the rooms are not well insulated enough and were too noisy. Lots of noise from people in the hall, and could also hear my neighbors in the bathroom. Housekeeping began vacuuming at 7:00 in the morning in the hall outside the room. I would not have been able to sleep if I had wanted to sleep in. The rooms also really could use a comfortable chair. There is no where in the room to sit, except the small chair behind the desk. You either have to stand or sit on the bed. The room also really could use a coffee/tea maker - although fortunately, Starbucks is directly across the street! The quality of the restaurant varied. The first day, breakfast was not fully cooked and the coffee was cold. The second morning, breakfast was very good. Would I recommend the hotel to others? You can't beat the location and overall, the experience is ok. You need to be prepared for the d√©cor. I think the place is just trying too hard to be trendy and it all doesn't quite work - but that is just my personal taste. Some undoubtedly will love the decor - I just kind of ignored it. Look carefully at the photos to make sure that you're comfortable with the atmosphere before booking.",4,2013,05,04
125,Birthday treat,Sorry for late review... Stayed for my birthday weekend... Had great corner room on top floor with fab views. Staff were all very good.. All attention to detail thought of.. Ate in the restaurant  on the Saturday night really fab and funky ... Great food and ambience. Thought the cocktail bar was a letdown! Fantastic location for theatre land.. Loved it.,4,2013,05,04
125,Great for Theatre trips,"Lovely and clean hotel, very modern as can be seen from photos on web site.  Fantastic bathroom and comfortable bed Fantastically situated for Restuarants and Theatres Staff are really friendly and helpful - down side? no Tea/coffee facilities in the room which in the morning is a must, giving a relaxed start to the day rather than having to get dressed and rush off to find a caf'e",4,2013,05,03
125,Fantastic.... You will be impressed. We were in room 505 and loved it.,"I booked this hotel for my partner's 50th birthday and what can I say.... words are not enough.  This hotel is wonderful from the minute you arrive.  Everyone is helpful, enthusiastic and service is second to none.  The rooms are lovely... we were upgraded to the 5th floor (505) which was a corner room with floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking Trafalgar Square.  Wow! 
Breakfast is to die for... good quality and excellent portions. 
But the staff just make the hotel. Nothing is too much trouble, they are a class of their own.  They also have the ability to be relaxed and fun whilst doing an excellent job. We loved it and will be back. Everyone we came into contact with was amazing.
Thank you to everyone that made this a very special day to remember.
Location is just superb.
Well done to everyone.

125,Great Hotel and Great Staff,"Just returned from another stay at the St Martins Lane Hotel.  It's most obvious strength is location being in the center of Central London but it has a great deal more that that.  It has a hip vibe and the rooms have a cool clean aesthetic  with a touch of warmth. Perhaps some of that warmth comes from the staff.  I had the good fortune of being checked in a few years ago by Morten who called me after I had reached my room for the first time to see if it was suitable and then continued to remember my name throughout my stay and subsequent stays.  The smiles, greetings and helpful hands never seem to stop here.  It may be hip but it also puts its customers at the heart of everything.    

It has become my home away from home since I travel there for business every three or four months.  Perhaps my only disappointment is that its holding company doesn't have a more formal frequent guest program.   The St Martins Lane you will enjoy the location, appreciate the aesthetic and love the superb, helpful service.",5,2013,05,02
125,Hip Hotel in a Fantastic Location,"My husband and I booked 2 nights in a Deluxe King room as part of a TravelZoo deal.  We loved the location of this hotel for our first trip to London - Trafalgar Square right around the corner, a nice walk to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park & Oxford not to mention the lovely shops, restaurants & theatres right in Covent Garden.
The hotel itself is trendy & hip with some experimentation with coloured light.  We found the room spacious and functional although not completely soundproof - we heard our neighbours in their room in the morning but not extreme enough to report.  The restaurant onsite was great - the food and cocktails were both fantastic although it's certainly not the place for an intimate, quiet dinner for conversation (it was loud!)
All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.  The selling point for us was the location - it could not have been better.",4,2013,05,01
125,Stay here -great value and SERVICE and fun,"Really rate this hotel,SERVICE is friendly and fun.Food and bar are relaxed.I stay at hotels weekly and this is the perfect spot for London - not trying to be cool but it is.Forget booking the new ME hotel (which I thought about) but food and service very poor. This hotel is great whatever your age or style.",5,2013,04,28
125,Super Hotel - maybe needs a refresh?,"Stayed in St. Martins Lane for the second time recently, this time in one of the larger rooms. Check in was efficient and friendly, although the 'Welcome back' felt a bit forced. The room was indeed very large but it actually felt quite bare. This is probably the minimalist look the hotel is going for but it somewhat diminished the luxury experience. The large bathroom suite has no door, which we found a little disconcerting even though the WC is in a cubicle within the bathroom and this has a glass door (with a broken latch). The beds in St Martins Lane are very comfortable and lighting is imaginative and quirky. 

The bar is pitched as an exclusive area - we had to reserve seats in advance and have our names put on the 'guest list' but we found it the most claustrophobic space with awful uncomfortable seats and 'too small' tables that your knees hit off every time you move. Service in the bar was excellent though.

We didn't eat in the restaurant but we did have room service which arrived promptly. Totally personal taste but I found the Cuban pulled pork and mustard sandwich to be almost incredibly smothered in mustard. The triple cooked chips were superb.

Overall its a lovely hotel if you really like this type of design - some of the fixtures looked a bit tired and some of Philippe Starcks designs (I'm thinking of the taps - so smooth you cant turn them off when your hands are wet) are just impractical.

Final comment goes to the excellent concierge service here - some of the most savvy staff I have ever come across and super friendly to boot. So a mixed bag, a hotel to more admire than love maybe?",4,2013,04,24
125,Brilliant location - Great Staff,"A modern, trendy place right in the heart of London.  A short walk to the tube at either Leicester Sq or Covent Garden.  Theatres on the doorstep.  Our room was modern and comfortable (yes the TV unit was a little odd), great bathroom.
We overlooked a pedestrianised side street so the room was quiet and we slept well in a comfortable bed with crisp sheets (heaven).

Bar staff were brilliant - quick and attentive.  Sadly something that is all too rare in even the best hotels.  Reception and check in/out was quick and friendly and they seemed to be genuine in making sure you had a good stay, rather than reciting the standard 'script'.

Can't wait to go back",5,2013,04,22
125,Design? Design?,"As I read the reviews, many people choose the St Martins lane hotel for its design, but I found the pictures on their website much more attractive than the hotel.

This is an hotel with a pretty good location. Staff is friendly and is willing to help. The restaurant (Asia de Cuba) is average and serve food at light speed. Breakfast is very good.
Rooms are flashy (so be ready to wear night vision lenses when you enter the lift and sunglasses when you enter your room), designed by Philippe Starck. To me, it looks a bit old fashioned. 
I stayed in the ‚ÄòPenthouse‚Äô (the hotel website, in French, even mention an ‚ÄòAppartement Terrasse‚Äô, but no terrace and no apartment. It is two rooms linked by an external corridor. Disappointing.
If you like to enter the warmth of the sun in your room, windows barely opens‚Ä¶
Wifi is pretty good at 5 Mbps.",3,2013,04,22
125,An amazing stay - exceptional service,"I have just stayed at St Martins Lane hotel for a night to celebrate my birthday and from the moment my best friend and I checked in the service from all the staff (especially Steff) was fantastic.  Everyone made a fuss of me as it was my birthday, I even had a cake with a birthday message delivered to my room which was a really wonderful and thoughtful surprise.

We were due to have dinner at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon but the restaurant had no record of my reservation even with a reference number and were very unhelpful when I tried to rebook so we had dinner at Asia de Cuba in St Martins Lane and the food was delicious.

The location of the hotel is perfect for the local shopping, theatres etc. which is why I chose to stay there.  I live in London but my best friend was visiting from out of town so I wanted us to stay in a central location so we could get around easily.  I will definitely stay at St Martins Lane again for a special occasion as the service and hotel were absolutely wonderful.  I had one of the best weekends ever!  Thank you :)",5,2013,04,21
125,Awesome hotel,"A friend and myself booked St Martins Lane as a present for our wives and they were not disappointed
Firstly I need to say that everything about this hotel was stylish from the gold teeth seats in reception to the marvellous all white rooms. 
On check in we were informed that we were being given a complimentary upgrade to a Garden room although I don't think this hotel does bad rooms. Everything about the room was right they had put so much thought into the design and functionality of the accommodation. 
I have to say I stay in different hotels at least once a week so it takes a lot to give me the wow factor but St Martins Hotel certainly gave this",5,2013,04,21
125,Faaaantastsic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The  hotel San Martin Lane is located in the same place as the restaurant,it was amazing service,clean,and so central in London! all ,services are really good,very cozy rooms! But no baths,anyway,we needed to be in the center,great place to stay for a weekend!",5,2013,04,21
125,Convenient,"Location is so convenient for a night out at the theatre.  Room very clean and lovely big bathroom.  The ""designer"" television cabinet actually rather horrid contraption made out of cheap laminate.  Really would expect to have tea and coffee in 5* hotel bedrooms.",3,2013,04,20
125,St Martins Lane Perfection,"I was having a root around T.A. and can't believe I forgot to review such a wonderful hotel. My apologies to the owner and staff.
We stayed at this hotel last year for my fiances birthday and from the moment you get to the door it has the WOW factor.
As we entered, I ignored the ""far too handsome"" doormen who greeted us, my fiance however took the time to say hello (no surprise there then :) and they helped with our luggage and showed us to the check in desk.
As soon as we walked in, it just felt & looked right for us.
Modern, contemporary & chic...it is visually stunning.

The Staff are tremendous, taking the time to explain everything to us, advising on near by attractions and what to see...brilliant!
Our room was amazing - beautifully laid out, minimalistic, stylish and more importantly very comfortable!
The location of this hotel is perfect, we walked to covent garden, we took in a performance at the theatre, ate at a near by chinese restaurant, as well as taking time to drink in the hotel bar, which, you may not be surprised to read, is outstanding!

We will absolutely stay there on our next trip to the capital and can't recommend this hotel enough.
Superb.!",5,2013,04,20
125,Fun place to stay,"Well, it couldn't be more conveniently situated. 
I love the adventure of staying at this hotel. The entrance is so fum with the quirky furniture. The rooms are nice and simple with everything you need but not all cluttered up. Great views from the rooms with floor to ceiling glass walls.
Nice practical bathroom
The staff are so friendly and helpful too.
Definitely going back.",5,2013,04,17
125,Worth a visit,"I have just stayed,6/4-9/4,with my son and daughter in law. The hotel location is superb for all sorts of theatre, museums, restaurants and the many highlights of London. The rooms are spotless and I loved the bright airy feel so unusual in some other rather claustrophobic hotel rooms. The most outstanding feature however is the staff. The welcome at reception the housekeeping etc were brilliant but special mention has to be made of Ed the Bell Captain whose cheerful welcome and continued advice made the visit even more enjoyable. Thank you Vicky Milner Jersey.",5,2013,04,16
125,Stylish,"A very stylish & modern hotel.  Beautiful, large room and bathroom (were blessed with an up-grade to a Deluxe Studio). All facilities extremely comfortable and staff friendly and helpful. 
The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because our breakfast poached eggs were over-cooked (very over-cooked).",4,2013,04,15
125,GREAT LOCATION! GREAT SERVICE!! NOISY ROOM!,"The location is fantastic!  It is in the heart of the theater district.  The Royal Opera in Covent Gardens is also in walking distance.  The staff was also fantastic.  The rooms are minimalistic.  My only complaint was the room was noisy at night.  This was perhaps because we were placed on the first floor.  I asked Nicole at the front desk for a higher floor, but told no rooms were available.",3,2013,04,14
125,Love it!!,"Will return to St Martins again and again....incredibly helpful staff on reception the duty manager Gemma is a top professional!!
On a busy busy weekend ...an air of calmness..amongst the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden
Fabalous pre dinner drinks in the light bar..quiet oh so comfortable rooms..with cloud like pillows & duvets..sparkling clean room and the bathroom was like new!!
Even at 5am room service with a smile...cant wait to return",5,2013,04,08
125,Nice but sure you could find better,"Pros: great central location, room was quite large, friendly staff, can stay in the hotel to eat/drink (tho many restaurant choices were near by as well)

Cons: design was questionable (minimalist modern vs. cold war soviet apartment building), couldn‚Äôt control the blinds (or at least I couldn‚Äôt figure it out)",4,2013,04,08
125,"Still Chic and Cool, Well Located","The St Martin's Lane Hotel is still chic and cool even after all these years.  The hipness quotient is pretty strong in this other option from Morgans Hotels in London (its sister hotel in London is the Sanderson).  Ian Shrager and Philippe Starck signature style is still alive and well here.  Check in was very pleasant and fast.  It helps if you are a frequent guest of Morgans to get extra special treatment (make sure you create an account on their hotel chain web site).  I arrived mid morning and was given my room right away.  The front desk staff was pleasant and helpful.  I was in my room within five to ten minutes of arriving.  The door staff/bellman were the weakest part of the entire stay - they always seemed to be either not paying attention, absent or more concerned with people watching or checking themselves out in the reflection in the glass (I have found this to be a common issue with door/bell staff at other Morgans Hotel properties so seems to be a pervasive problem).  The door staff also didnt have change on them for tips when trying to cash a larger note.  The room itself was great - bear in mind that the standard rooms at this property are quite small, even though they are chic and cool looking.  the fact that the rooms are all white helps them feel larger.  The bed was VERY comfortable with a good mattress and good down pillows.  Air conditioning was super strong.  Lighting was also nice, with dimmer controls on all of them.  front closet is not large but it was adequate.  Hangers were the thicker ones good for suits and jackets.  Included an iron and ironing board - the plug on the iron was quite short so hard to maneuver when actually using.  There is a larger safe to put your valuables and laptops within.  Also comes with an umbrella for those unpredictable London weather days.  Bathroom was good size. White towels were basically fluffy and absorbent - not so scratchy.  Toiletries were Malin & Goetze, a very nice higher end line.  Big fluffy bathrobes were also included.  This room only had a shower - no tub.  Water pressure was great in shower and it included a handheld wand if you prefer that.  The TV was not an LCD TV but rather an older model - very surprising for a hotel that is supposed to have the latest in technology.  There was an ample minibar - expensive as usual.  Windows covered with white drapes and mini blinds were encased between the double pane window glass.  View was nothing great - but this area doesn't have great views on lower floors.  Concierge was very helpful.  Houeskeeping was prompt when cleaning was requested.  Overall i am very happy with the hotel despite some smaller issues.  I would stay again.  The hotel is VERY well located for transportation (near Leicester Square tube stop on Picadilly Line, and easy for getting Taxis.  A few blocks from Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery, and a very short walk to Covent Garden.  Many theaters are located nearby as well as great pubs and restaurants of all types.",4,2013,04,08
125,Wonderful Hotel in a fantastic location,"Pros:
- SERVICE: Easily the best service I have ever gotten at a hotel. EVER.  One example: I stopped by the front desk to ask them what time I should leave the next morning, based on my flight time.  They told me, plus gave me directions to the best tube station based on traffic (all of this I would expect from any decent hotel).  Then they suggested that I get a wake up call, which I gratefully accepted.  Wake up call comes the next morning--which I pick up, hang up, and go back to sleep, which would normally guarantee that I would miss my flight.  Then a FOLLOW UP wake up call comes 10 minutes later, ""just in case because they knew I had a flight and they wanted to make double sure I made it"" (read: Because the wake up call guy noticed that I sounded half dead and figured there was no way the first one worked!).  Honestly, I know it sounds like a little thing--but the fact that there was someone on the other end of the phone, paying enough attention to know that (1) I was clearly not going to get out of bed and (2) I absolutely HAD to get out of bed on time meant a lot to me!

Also, I have to call out the concierges at St Martins Lane.  They are AMAZING.  Recommendations for everything, and they really go out of their way to make sure that you get reservations wherever you want and if they can't get them, they find somewhere even better to send you! :)  LOVE those guys/gal.

- LOCATION: just around the corner from the National Gallery, 10 minute walk to Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster, Buckingham Palace, and basically half of the other really cool attractions in London, and literally SURROUNDED by amazing restaurants.

RESTAURANT: Is delicious.  

Cons: 
- There's no sign out front telling you that this is the hotel.  I mentioned it to the front desk when I got there (""hey did you know that you don't have a sign and it's legitimately hard to find this place if you don't know exactly where you're going?"") and the guy said they liked to keep it on a ""need to know"" basis.  Which is just kind of weird...but not a deal killer, just odd.
- The gym is next door and has somewhat odd hours.
- The small rooms are small.  Like, SMALL.  For a single person it's fine--especially if, like me, you're basically just using it as a place to sleep.  But when my fiancee arrived and we were sharing the space, it was pretty tight.",5,2013,04,08
125,"Location, Location, you know the rest","lovely hotel and team, extras a bit pricey, breki, room service etc. We have stayed a few times and always get wifi included so do ask and you might also. You will be within walking distance of many of the cities best sites but you will pay for the privilege!",4,2013,04,08
125,You can't go wrong staying here!!!,I have recently come back from St Martins Lane I always stay at this hotel and it never fails to impress me. I surprised my husband for his birthday and we had a fabulous time here! Staff are fantastic and really attentive they can't do enough for you. Asia de Cuba is always amazing we went for lunch and ahi tuna with wasabi mash is a must in every visit! Cocktails are great especially pornstar martinis! Breakfast is also fab very calorific but a must if you stay here! Go for the waffles! The area is great if you are going to the theatre and also close to a lot of great restaurants really can't go wrong! Concierge are also very helpful and won't steer you wrong! Rooms are quirky and not meant to be the norm I have seen a lot if reviews about things needed to be updated but it's the style if the hotel. If you go some hotels in Mayfair you will get a nicer room but I doubt service will be on par with st martins lane! A true gem in London! Already booking our next trip! ,5,2013,04,07
125,Romantic break,"Visited the hotel which my partner booked as a surprise for us- very up market boutique hotel  with fabulous food - a very lush cocktail bar with some amazing cocktails , lovely but small room which was extremely functional, clean and modern. The breakfast was one of the best we have ever had the service and staff excellent everything you would expect from a very high end hotel :) will def return!!",4,2013,04,05
125,"Consistently Good, Excellent Location","I really want to hate this hotel - I do.  I've gotten over hotels that are too trendy for their own good, and this seems to be one of those.  However, I've stayed here over 125 nights and I can attest that the service, amenities and location are excellent.

First thing to note is that, if you get the smallest size room, you will be disappointed - they can be painfully small.  I've stayed in worse in London, but these rooms can present challenges if there are two of you.  No need to upgrade to a suite, but try to bump up at least one level from the ""standard"", if you can.

The rooms are typical Phillipe Starck minimalist, but it works well.  The mostly-white interior doesn't make the room feel cold and the floor-to-ceiling windows really open the room up and allow in great light.   The bathrooms are beautiful with an excellent shower and, in some rooms, nicely sized tub.   The rooms are simple, but functional and comfortable.  

The restaurant, Asia de Cuba provides some of the best hotel breakfasts you'll find, whether you take it in the restaurant or in your room.  The standard room service breakfast is huge and always perfectly cooked.  Room service at any time of the day is consistently excellent.

The Light Bar mixes excellent cocktails.  I prefer to skip it on Friday and Saturday nights, when it's too busy.  But for a after-work or pre-dinner cocktail, it hits the spot.  Be prepared to pay, though.

Service is excellent.  They staff may seem like they were hired for their good looks, but they are pleasant and helpful.  As a frequent guest, I have often been greeted by name and they very often recognize my loyalty to the hotel.  

Finally, the location could not be better.   You're walking distance to anything you'd ever need and in the heart of Central London.  Your public transportation options here are better than anywhere else in the city.",4,2013,04,03
125,Well worth a look,"I've been visiting this hotel for 10 years.  My company uses their conference facilities and we often eat in Asia de Cuba - consistently one of the best restaurants for large groups.  In all my visits at the hotel, I don't think I've had a bad thing to say.  The hotel never feels 'corporate', has a quirky sense of design and a great location. The welcome at reception is always friendly but efficient.  The rooms are a little small, but the space is very well used.  Plenty of bathroom space and good beds with high quality bedding.  IPod docking stations, well stocked mini-bar and fitted safe - the rooms have been well equipped.  The location could not be better - in the heart of theatreland, close to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.  Good for business and great for the weekend.",5,2013,04,02
125,Great hotel in city center,"I live in Paris and I occasionally go to London during the weekends, only couple hours train ride, so convenient. A friend recommended this hotel, so my gf and I decided to check it out. 

The location is great, very central, and near many of the city attractions: Leceister Sq, Chinatown, Trafalgar Sq, Covent Garden (my favorite spot to eat and shop), Savile Row, Hyde park, Oxford str... Ontop of all that, there are a bunch of restaurants, bars, clubs, musicals, theatres. Ideal location for a group of friends and young couples who enjoy a city lifestyle.

Like most of young hotels nowadays, St Martins Lane is very modern, minimalist, trendy and clean. The staff is well-groomed and good looking, friendly (hard to combine the two qualities these days), and very helpful;
One thing though, we found the staff to be over casually dressed, at a point where we thought some of them (the concierge or the people at the door) were guests.

We booked a Superior Queen rm, perfect fit for a couple. The colors are very pure, all white mainly, and is exposed to a lot of natural light through the high large windows. Although the outside environment is loud due to the presence of F&Bs, Jamie Oliver has one of his restaurants in the same street!, we couldn't hear a thing from our room (which was on the 2d F). The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom (no bathtub though) was alright, although there could have been a little more storage for our own things (mostly my gf's make-up, she brought a lot - love u babe xxx), the tv doesn't have a lot of channels (it never does in hotels...) but we didn't spend that much time in the room anyways. One thing we particularly enjoyed was the bedside light that smoothly changed colors; details, but very relaxing.We didn't try the restaurant but I heard they serve tasty English breakfasts, will add that to my to-do list.

Overall, I am glad I won't need to look for another place to stay on my next trip to LDN.",4,2013,03,31
125,St Martins Lane Hotel - best in London for service and hospitality,"We just spent a night at the St. Martins Lane Hotel and it was a simply fabulous experience. Right from the moment we dropped our car for valet parking the staff (especially Ed the lovely 
Bell Captain) were so kind and welcoming. It was out Daughter's birthday and the staff couldn't have done more to make the day special for her on her 12th Birthday.
The hotel is gorgeous and drop dead stylish and has been for years, but it is the kindness and care of the staff that makes this such a great hotel.
Our family of four would wholeheartedly recommend it for comfort, luxury, food and drink and pure cosmopolitan city centre glamour!
Book today if you can!",5,2013,03,30
125,Great for business travel,"Really enjoyed staying at St Martins Lane while in London for business. My room was beautiful -- all windows -- but really small. The bathroom was well updated and larger than I expected. Some of the hallway carpeting seemed a bit worn down but my room was really clean, well-kept and comfortable. Have to pay 10 pounds / day for Wi-Fi, but you can connect as many devices as you want. Danielle at the front desk is really nice and helpful - she was great to speak with after a long flight and graciously answered all of my questions.",4,2013,03,27
125,"Almost, but not quite.....","First of all, St Martins Lane is a very good hotel, and if you want to stay in the thick of the theatre district then I am sure you could do a lot worse. However, there are a couple of places in which I believe it lets itself down and if these areas were improved on it could be a truly exceptional hotel, worthy of the 5 stars it gives itself. 
Leicester Square tube is just round the corner, about 30 steps away, and there are bars, restaurants, and theatres galore within spitting distance. I think the price is as good as any of the big hotels nearby, particularly if you take advantage of the special offers, which we did. The staff are exceptional; we were greeted very warmly, and, despite arriving early, were told our room was ready. We were shown to our room by Ed (a real asset to the hotel), who took the time to point out the features of the hotel, including the concierge (who was also very friendly), and when in our room, showed us where everything was. He also recommended places to eat (which we tried, and he was right).
The room was a standard double, and it was reasonably small, but come on, this is central London people! Space comes at a premium cost and if you want to be able to do yoga in your room you need to get a suite (or stay on the outskirts and travel in). If you are spending your time exploring London and are only staying a couple of nights you really don't need that much space. There is everything you need: a wonderfully comfortable bed with tonnes of pillows, plenty of wardrobe space, a desk and large windows. The bathroom is huge with a fantastic shower and high-end toiletries, and there are lots of homely touches, such as plants (not often found in hotels!), mood lighting, candles which they light for you in the evening, and an i-pod dock. We had a problem with the air-con in our room (I think we misunderstood how to use it rather than it being faulty!) and they sorted it for us instantly. 
All good so far, and then......We were pretty disgusted to find that we had to pay for WiFi (¬£10 for 24 hrs); this would cost next to nothing to install, and it really is expected at this standard of hotel. There were no tea and coffee facilities in the room; there is room to put them, and when your basic Premier Inn/Travelodge is providing it, there is no excuse. If the room service menu was reasonable priced, this could be forgiven, but it is the most expensive menu I have ever seen in any hotel (including Cowley Manor and other 5 star country hotels where you can't exactly pop out for a coffee very easily). There is also, inexplicably, a ¬£2.95 charge for delivery to your room! Surely it is expected that room service items are delivered? To charge extra for this is totally ridiculous, and something I have never seen before. The price of breakfasts is astronomical: ¬£25 for a cooked breakfast, and ¬£17 for a continental one. I know this is London, but there are plenty of places to get a wonderful breakfast in Covent Garden for less than half this (Bill's in St Martins Courtyard up the road is an example). There is a Starbucks and a Pret-a-manger next door if you decide to stay here and don't wish to pay ¬£5 for a sausage. 
So there you have it; you can't beat the location and the staff are fantastic, however I believe charging for wifi and denying us the ability to make a cup of tea is a little cheap. It is an uber-stylish hotel and its bar and restaurant seem like places to be seen, so I am sure there are plenty who won't mind a jot about these minor points!",3,2013,03,25
125,The perfect London location and great staff,"This Hotel is just off Trafalgar Square and north of St Martin's in the Fields Church.  You are right in the heart of the West End Theatre District, close to Museums (1 minute to the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery), and close to some of London's best restaurants.  The Leicester Square Tube stop is 1/2 block away.  The rooms are modern and well appointed.  The best thing is the staff who treat my wife and I like family.  Everyone knows our name and we get treated like rock stars.  Many actors and rock stars stay at this hotel while in London.  The management staff, door men and consierge staff are really top notch.",5,2013,03,25
125,Fantastic staff and fantastic location,"Stayed last night with my friend - a stylish and cool hotel. The staff are second to none and give that little bit extra. Lots of cool lighting everywhere. We hit the Light Bar last night after going out to dinner - fantastic atmosphere. Will definitely be staying again. So close to shops, theatres restaurants Trafalgar Square etc.",5,2013,03,24
125,Disappointing,"I had long heard about this hotel so was quite excited about staying there.  Unfortunately our stay began very badly.  We arrived at check-in time (3:00) only to be told that our room (a very expensive suite) was not ready.  So we waited...........and waited.............and waited.  I had booked afternoon tea elsewhere at 4:30 and I explained this to the receptionist, that we had to get changed and get to the other location.  By 3:30 I was getting a bit fed up of being told that they were just putting the finishing touches to my room and it would be ready imminently (I had heard this three times by now) and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told they would come and see me but they did not appear.  By 3:50 I was frantic, my daughter was almost in tears thinking she would not have time to get changed and finally someone came to see us.  There was no apology, no eye contact and I found the attitude of this member of staff quite aggressive.  She said that our room was still not ready, it would only be a few minutes more.  I said that we needed somewhere, anywhere, to get changed to which she replied, ""Why can't you just wait ten minutes?"".  But it wasn't ten minutes, we had already been waiting 50 minutes for a ¬£400 room!  At that point, miraculously, our room became ready.  So we ran and frantically started changing.  I had told the receptionist that I still wanted to speak to the manager, and he phoned whilst we were getting ready.  Talk about pouring oil on troubled waters!  This manager was the complete opposite, he was friendly, understanding, helpful!  Immediately I told him what had happened, he cancelled our upgrade charge and said that he would send a bottle of champagne to our room for later (which he did, accompanied by chocolate strawberries).  Had all members of staff been like this, needless to say, my score would have been much higher.

As for the actual stay, the corner suite was very stark, completely white, with huge windows on all sides, so we had to keep the blinds closed the entire time.  Everything in the room (eg the sofa) was designed for style rather than comfort and I did not find it very user friendly.  For example, in this standard of room I would expect a complimentary bottle of water each, not one between two.

On the other hand, the cocktails in the bar were great and this was a good place for people watching.  Breakfast was a bit disappointing though as my Eggs Benedict had a rather strange taste.  They also tried to charge us for breakfast even though it was included in my package, but the receptionist dealt with this immediately when I pointed it out.

All in all, I feel the manager here is excellent, but maybe further training is needed with several members of staff and they should look to hotels like Claridges, the Corinthia, the Montcalm to see how to make guests feel special.",3,2013,03,24
125,Amazing,"We originally booked this hotel via Booking.com but then found it was ¬£200 cheaper for a 2 night stay to book directly with the hotel on their ""Lock & Save"" deal. We booked a deluxe double with garden terrace. As smokers it was a god send to be able to nip onto the terrace rather than have to go down outside. 

The room was quirky had all the nice touches you expect from a 5* Hotel and some on top - an umbrella (well it is London!!) that came in handy, the rain shower is particularly good, in fact its the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are completely wonderful nothing was too much trouble. Definitely staying again",5,2013,03,24
125,Excellent,"Great location, service, food.  Just make sure you book one of the larger rooms.  Studio room is really nice. Go for one of the top floors and you get a lot of sun and good view over the city.  Breakfast is good and Asia de Cuba for dinner is fantastic.
The place is better quality and more price-sensible then many London hotels.",5,2013,03,22
125,Fabulous!,"My business colleague and I are from Australia and have stayed at st martins lane twice. Terrific hotel, great location right in the heart of the west end, wonderful service and Ed Parkes the  Bell Captain has incredible customer service and great attitude. He could not have been more helpful and ensured that we were looked after. It was nice to see a familiar and friendly face, Ed is a true professional. St martins lane is our # 1 choice in London.",5,2013,03,22
125,Excellent Stay,"We had an excellent stay.  The location was fantastic - convenient for the tube, theatre, shopping, restaurants and attractions - but at the same time the neighborhood was not crazy.  The decor definitely is different but that's part of what made for such a good experience - you will never forget the lobby, elevators or the rooms.  Most importantly the staff was exceptional and went out of their way to make us feel at home.  From the doormen, the front desk, concierge (Amy and Joey) and wait staff in the restaurant everyone was pleasant, attentive and helpful.  They seemed to genuinely be interested in us.  When I walked through the lobby during our second day the person who checked us in the day before asked me by name how my day was.  Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2013,03,22
125,3.5 really,"This property is billed as a 5-Star. I would give it a 3.5 or maybe a 4.. The rooms are awkward and tiny. Fine for 1 person, but very difficult for two with luggage. The best parts were the products in the bathroom - first rate -- and the cool lighting.  Strange flower pot hanging from the way, when space is already tight though. Lighting was a nice touch though.

The location is fantastic though if you want to be in the theater district. 

The restaurant in the hotel is excellent quality and I would recommend a meal there. Lots of beautiful people coming and going from here.",3,2013,03,22
125,The most fabulous hotel I have ever stayed in!!,"The location was fantastic. Right in the middle of London, blocks from the main attractions, minimal walk to the tube, and the hustle bustle of the theater district/restaurants/shops. The place appeared non-assuming from the outside, but you walked into a unique flair of the modern juxtaposed with an older decorum piece. The rooms were large and comfortable. Excellent bathroom with tub and shower, good hot water and pressure. The windows in the corner rooms were a plus and so was the mood lighting. Beds were large and comfortable. The room was impeccable. The breakfast was complete, and tasty and the rum bar was a unique treat. BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE - the holiday was punctuated by the staff. From Edward Parkes at the door to his colleagues Martin and Richard to the Concierge staff Mike and Joey to the girls at the restaurant...ALL were genuinely concerned about your comfort, enjoyment and insuring your exceptional stay. After one week - I felt the entire staff was like family. I will miss the all tremendously and without them it would not have been the best holiday ever. So...a gem of a place! I recommend it most highly to all traveling to London. I have been to the Ritz and beyond and this was above all in my book.",5,2013,03,17
125,"Definitely not 5 stars, but quite nice","Staff:  Nice enough, not outstanding.
Room itself:  Tight for two plus their luggage, great for one person.
Bathroom:  Great modern fixtures and a really hot shower.  Products are fab and the tea lights are a really nice, relaxing touch that you never see in a hotel.  Who offers fire in a room these days?  =)
Bed + Pillows: Good, not fabulous.

The hotel design by Starke is interesting for a moment but then it becomes silly as its not functional nor made for high traffic and longevity.  I cant imagine this looking good in a few years not to mention it will be dated pretty quick.

Would stay again, but would rather go down the road to the ME.",4,2013,03,15
125,Interesting decor,"Very modern decor, with lots of quirky bits and pieces here and there. Room lovely bright and airy and a reasonable outlook for a London hotel. Also very quiet, no road noise in the morning.  Lovely shower, no bath. Only disappointment was being charged for wi fi and having 15% service charge added to ¬£20 bill for  two gin and tonics!!  The staff are all very friendly and the restaurant is excellent.",4,2013,03,15
125,Hidden Costs,"The hotel is fantastic prime location for most tourist attractions. The service was second to none! Very quirky place from 'gold teeth' and over sized flower vase in the foyer, to bare bulbs hanging over all the talks in the dining room. but beware of hidden costs i.e. VAT and taxes. These certainly mount up.",4,2013,03,13
125,SIMPLY THE BEST,"Myself and my husband have just returned from a 3 night stay at St Martins Lane Hotel. We booked through Secret Escapes website, for our honeymoon. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted by Ed, The Bellboy and made to feel at home. Throughout our stay, he and all the staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel very special. Once they realised it was our honeymoon we returned to the room to find a complimentary bottle of champagne, candles and rose petals on the bed, such a lovely touch. We stayed in a Queen Room which, although small, had everything we needed and more. The rooms are serviced morning and evening and are spotless! We ate in the restaurant one evening for dinner and each morning for breakfast. The food is delicious and there is so much choice. 
The location of this hotel is, in my opinion, the best in London and within easy walking distance of all the City has to offer. 
We had a fabulous time and didn't want to come home, thank you so much Ed and all the staff at St Martins Lane for making a very special occasion, extra special. Hope to return soon!!",5,2013,03,11
125,EXCELLENT LOCATION & SUPER HOSPITABLE STAFF,"I love travelling and trying out different hotels...this time I booked myself at St Martins Lane London,as it looked like a Design hotel that I thought Id like.But when I reached, I got more than I expected....right from the moment I checked in, I was super impressed with the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff- They are really too sweet...! I got an early check-in...so I didnt have to wait too long after a long flight.
The rooms are very cozy & modern. The location is just fab...as there are many nice places to eat just around the corner, theatres right there, and covent garden is in the next lane... infact its one of the best located hotels Ive stayed at in London...as its central but yet not too touristy and crowded.
St Martins also has an awesome restaurant- Asia De Cuba, with awesome food and a cool vibe.
The bar is also very cool...good crowd ..amazing staff.
Im definitey gonna stay at St Martins Hotel again next time Im in London.",5,2013,03,09
125,Again & Again,"Since I last reviewed this hotel two years ago I have been coming back again and again every other month and felt I should write another review to share my experience!
The location is superb for business and for pleasure. 2 Tube stations are nearby but most importantly you are walking distance from almost everything in Central London...
The staff are extremely friendly, some of them know me by my first name by now!
The rooms are clean, modern and well decorated to my taste. 
The beds are super comfortable and the bathrooms are amazing!
I am difficult with noise but have never had any problems listening to neighbors or slamming doors etc that happens often in other hotels. 
Asia De Cuba offers superb food. I try the breakfast everytime and it's very tasty, but I have had dinner here twice and the experience was even great with some exceptional dishes. 
All in all, it feels like home here and hopefully I will keep on returning to this marvelous hotel!",5,2013,03,05
125,Nice hotel in a great location,"Very pleased with my stay here. I usually stay on Shaftesbury Avenue or in Piccadilly. The hotel has a very modern / trendy style which normally I steer clear of, however, the rooms were great with nice views and the staff were very friendly. The layout of the room was different from you standard hotel, but this only added to the experience. Definitely a place I will return to.",4,2013,03,05
125,Quintessential Morgans Group where modern style rules,"I love staying at Morgans Group hotels, they have a chic modern style but deliver good old fashioned service at the same time.

We were in one of the'double double' rooms (essentially a twin) for 1 night - I live in London and last stayed at the Mondrian in LA so had a fair idea of what to expect.

Service:
From check in to check lout we couldn't fault the service and the staff were lovely (trendy hotels like this can often present themselves with cocky or pretentious staff but everyone we spoke with was really friendly)

Room:
The room was quite small but not offensive by central London standards and as expected it was fashionably equip with all the latest mod cons.

The beds were a good size and very comfortable with loads of pillows and good quality linen so in terms of product the room was good.

There are a couple of areas where style has definitely been prioritised over practicality and while this seems to be the standard across the brand, I imagine it would be quite annoying if you were staying for more than 1 night:

1: There are no door handles on the bathroom or connecting doors, in stead of the conventional method of closing a door you have to wrestle with a switch type mechanism that sits in the middle. 

This is a real hassle and also very noisy because the doors end up slamming shut which can be clearly heard from the other room around you whenever anyone goes in or out of their bathroom (even at 4 o'clock in the morning)

2: The lighting in the room is definitely set for mood and ambience more than anything else - with only a few small hanging lights and some adjustable coloured panelling behind the bed it can be quite frustrating at times (great initial impression but again I imagine that after a while you would start to crave some decent central lighting)

Light Bar:
I think this is my new favourite cocktail bar! 

We had a few drinks in the early evening before heading out for dinner and the cocktails were great! Huge menu to select from and they all tasted amazing.

Priced at around ¬£13 each and with so much choice its easy for the bill to slip away from you, but the cost per drink is about right for a Covent Garden hotel.

We returned after dinner at around 1am and decided to go back to the bar for a few more drinks -  it was packed! This is quite a popular up market haunt in the West End so be prepared if its a sat night like it was for us - the lobby was busy as well.

In terms of service in the bar I can't praise the guys on the door enough, they were wonderfully helpful and so lovely! When we arrived back to a busy sat night and told them we were guests they arranged for us to take our drinks in the restaurant (even though it was closed) because all the tables in the bar were full. As soon as a table became available they reserved it for us and came through to the Restaurant to let us know - absolutely brilliant! 

With a number of 5 star establishments to pick form, its the little experiences like this (and the service these guys provided) that differentiate the top hotels in London - well done.

Overall this is a trendy upmarket hotel in a great location. Everything is simplistically styled to within an inch of its life but that is part of its appeal and I wouldn't expect anything else from the Morgans Group.",4,2013,03,04
125,"Hip, cool and comfortable","I've stayed at this hotel many times and each time find it to be a very comfortable hotel, great staff, and super well located.  And, the restaurant is very good - some form of Cuban style, but all good food.  The bar is a ""hip"" place to be on the weekend.   There is one weird item - no chairs in the rooms - no place to sit and read (i hate using the bed) - with chairs in the rooms, i would have given it a slightly higher rating.",4,2013,03,03
125,Friendly and helpful staff,"From the moment we checked-in until, when we returned later after checking-out to collect our bags, all of the staff we very friendly and couldn't do enough to ensure that we have a very good stay. The hotel has a very clean and modern feel to it without compromising traditional values of customer service.The location is excellent for theaters shopping and restaurants, We would recommend this hotel without hesitation, and would definitely look to book it again for a future visit.",5,2013,03,03
125,Home Away from Home,"The staff and location are what make this hotel an excellent choice.  Everyone is friendly and eager to help and answer questions.  They know without pause which bus or tube to take, where everything is and what to do and see.  

The location is walking distance to so many historical and cultural sites.  Another review mentions some but omitted The  National Gallery, Portrait Gallery, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, etc.  Half a block in either direction are Charing Cross and Leicester Square tube stations from which you can get most anywhere.",5,2013,02,28
125,Cool Hotel with lovely staff,"Very modern funky hotel with charming helpful staff....breakfast amazing ..rooms small all white but comfy beds ,some noise from corridor ..Asia de cuba restaurant food was good ....though water expensive !!",5,2013,02,27
125,Good first Londen experience,"My first Londen experience was in November 2012 and it was perfect. We had 4 days and tried to see as much as possible from this vibrant city. The tube is the perfect transportation and takes you to your destination in minutes. St Martins Lane hotel was perfectly situated in the centre of Covent Garden, West End theatres and Trafalgar square. From here we visited Nothing Hill, The Eye, Tate Modern, Natural History Museum and the Science museum. We had a bicycle ride through Hide Park and in between we had so many delicious lunches. We also tried the restaurant in the Hotel when we didn't feel like going out. The restaurant was very good with an interesting menu. A mix of cuban and asian food. Oh and if you are going do not forget to have a cocktail in the bar. They make some amazing cocktails!

The room was very very cool! It was not big but for us that is never a problem as long as everything is clean. The room was perfectly clean and has some very nice designer touch items.
The only thing that kept me awake was the airco system but my partner didn't mind at all.

I would go back to the hotel next time in Londen. But because this city has so many cool places  I think I will choose something new to explore.",4,2013,02,25
125,How the Rich Live!,"A very chic modern hotel, so cool it doesn't have a Sign or Name outside, good job we arrived by taxi! The staff were very pleasant, welcoming and helpful in every way. Our room was beautiful and had outside space with table and chairs for smoking if required.",5,2013,02,25
125,COVENT GARDEN HOTEL,"I have stayed at this hotel since 2003.  Every time I go to London ... I have to stay here.  The last time I stayed here I noticed that some things were getting a little worn and they probably need to do a little restore.  But, will I stay here again?  Absolutely.  I love it.  It seems like this hotel is for the younger set, but I don't feel uncomfortable staying here nor am I treated like I shouldn't be there.  They are always so helpful with getting us a driver or helping us with reservations.  The drinks in the bar are awesome and Asia de Cuba has the best food.  We always go to the theatre when we are staying there and last time we went to see Matilda.  Many theaters are walking distance from the hotel.   I have had all types of rooms and they are always similar in style.  You can't beat the Covent Garden location.  The price can be high at this hotel, but location, location, location.",5,2013,02,24
125,Hip Hotel with Heart,"I stay at this hotel about once every other month when I'm lucky enough to accompany my husband on his business trips in London.  As other reviews have mentioned, St Martins is in an excellent location, is pristine clean and has a fun hipster vibe, but I'm not reviewing it for those reasons.  I'm finally reviewing St Martins because the staff is so exceptional.  EVERYONE.  From the super efficient and friendly bell men to the front desk to the excellent concierge advice. They know how to hire and keep great staff and that creates a great vibe.  

p.s. Anyone who complains about it being expensive should compare it to other Covent Garden Hotels - Covent Garden is expensive.",5,2013,02,21
125,"Excellent location in the West End, trendy, but overpriced","Stayed for three nights here as I wanted to be in the West End theatre district. Excellent location for that and easy to get to in a taxi from Heathrow via Paddington Station. Hotel was very clean and comfortable but just a bit too ""trendy"" for me, and I would say it's a little overpriced! Didn't worry about any meals in the hotel though, as there was an excellent place for breakfast next door and plenty of other eating places nearby. Room was very good and light, and on the whole tastefully done apart from the downright awful, tacky and cheap-looking TV cabinet placed awkwardly in the room. Only other minor complaints were, the metal table near the window could not be moved, which made it sometimes difficult to get behind and sit down, and while the bathroom was good, the shower door could not be closed from inside. However, the bed was just heaven... and absolutely superb for a decent night's sleep... one of the best hotel beds I've slept in, excellent!!!!

A little tip: If wanting to get tickets for West End shows, try going to the theatre and ask or book at their box office. Many theatres are in walking distance from the hotel. I was able to do this twice in 3 days including acquiring a top seat for the very popular ""Matilda"" at the Cambridge theatre just up the road from the hotel. For an excellent seat mid-way in the stalls on the aisle, it cost me (from the box office) 54 Pounds less than what the hotel Concierge said he could get me a ticket for. Not too sure where he gets his prices from!!!!!

In short... a comfortable hotel with quite good rooms, (room numbers are often hard to see as they are imprinted in the carpet & not on the door), but certainly, my room had the most wonderful bed to sleep in. Location is great with many eating places nearby, so why eat or drink in the hotel!!!! Check your own prices for theatre tickets before using the concierge, otherwise it is quite a friendly place. I'm not sure whether I'd stay there again though, as I'd probably prefer something a little less hip and trendy for the price, and there are a number of places in the area.",4,2013,02,18
125,The hotel is overpriced in comparison to other hotels of the same standard.,"The hotel is hip and trendy and I cannot fault the cleanliness however, it was overpriced in our opinion. The room, the most basic, was ¬£264 per night, and was very small indeed. There was no tea/coffee facilities in the room either. Breakfast ended up being over ¬£50 just for 2 Eggs Benedicts and some items from the Buffett. 

However, on arrival we had a great greeting from a lady called Deborah, which was a good start. The bar was buzzing and the table service was great.

There was nothing special about the experience really, even the very modern decor is now a little dated! Therefore we would not return or recommend, based on the number of other great hotels in London.",3,2013,02,15
125,Very comfortable and very well located,"Stayed here for a business trip for 3 nights and enjoyed my stay. The room was very artistic and comfortable, but the bathroom was excellent. I didn't stay much in the hotel room except for sleeping in the night but overall I would recommend this place to my colleagues and friends. Not sure, if I would want to stay here with my family though. 

Location is JUST RIGHT!",4,2013,02,15
125,Wonderful,"Loved this hotel, the staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant giving a good relaxed atmosphere. Nice to start a bottle of champagne in the bar and finish it in our room. Very good breakfast selection in good surroundings. Overall a good weekend in London.",5,2013,02,14
125,Very good location,"5 minutes walk to Leicester Sq station,
and covent garden station,
near to all the theatres and restaurants.

The rooms all have floor to ceiling window and it has a lot of lights in the room,
which I like very much.
The layout of the toilet, closet and the room is excellent.",5,2013,02,12
125,Stay Here!,"Hip, friendly, laid-back sophistication and contemporary artistic chic, in a PERFECT location, close and convenient to just about anywhere you're going to want to be.
Our room had plenty of natural light, an airy feel, and a comfy bed we were hard-pressed to get out of each morning.
The staff were at all times professional, knowledgable and accommodating, yet always in a relaxed and friendly way.
Our thanks for all their wisdom and assistance as we planned our daily adventures, which were many and varied. 
My only complaint- the haughty, arrogant air of some of the dining room staff and the way overpriced, lack-lustre breakfast that was two naked poached eggs on english muffin without so much as a sprig of parsley to give the plate some life or colour. 
Never under-estimate the merits of a bit of garnish!",5,2013,02,11
125,Great stay...I will be back!,"Stayed at St Martins Lane last week for a business trip and was very pleased with the accommodations and service. The room was comfortable and good sized for me and a weeks worth of business attire and equipment. The bathroom was beautiful...one of the highlights of the room, for certain! The location was extremely convenient to site, the tube, and plenty of great shopping and restaurants. One of my favorite perks was the use of the full gym just adjacent to the hotel. All in all the staff were very responsive, helpful and polite. I have to agree with the last reviewer, however, that it appears that the hotel is in need of a bit of TLC. The carpets and shelving in the room were a bit rundown. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!",4,2013,02,11
125,Exceeded Expectations,"We'd stayed at St Martin's Lane once before and booked a longer trip this time, from Jan 5-11 this year - and it was even better than the last.
Everything that I'd liked about it before - the cleanliness of the rooms, all contemporary white and crisp, fresh sheets, powerful showers - was there. The location is fantastic - close to theatres, Chinatown, shops and the train a short hop away.
What really impressed was the warmth and helpfulness of one of the front desk staff Maria, who checked us in and seemed genuinely concerned about our well-being during our stay. 
She stood out in particular because my request the first day to another staff (who was perfunctory and interested only in upselling) for a possible reduction in daily Internet charges (10 pounds a day) was turned down, non-negotiable. 
Given the length of our stay and that we were repeat guests, Maria said she would try to get it halved or even waived. We found out it was waived when we checked out. 
We were also moved from our first room - water from the shower tended to flow out and into the rest of the bathroom - when we asked and were given a room upgrade. 
I do feel though, that Maria was an exception - I agree with an earlier review that some of the staff seemed disinterested and unapproachable. 
I'm still going ahead with the excellent rating because all in all it was good value for money - I'd booked early so rates weren't as high, and I had a very comfortable, enjoyable stay.",5,2013,02,11
125,Brilliant Experiance,"Arrived early with a speedy check-in, lovely surprise of having a room upgrade! Thanks. The hotel is querky in all the right places, I loved it, my room was clean and tidy with even extra touches on turndown service, the only downside of it was although at night the hotel looks cool and sleek  with all the low lights and effects, you can't fail to see in the day  that the hotel overall is tired and deserves a refurb.",4,2013,02,09
125,Fabulous London hotel,"Expensive, maybe a bit over priced for what it is, but a fun and interesting hotel nonetheless. 
I very much enjoyed my stay at St Martins, great location near to all the theaters and shops,  beautiful modern decor and extremely clean and fresh. Everything was very comfortable. However, the room was very small - given how much we were paying (several hundred pounds per night) and staff seemed slightly snobby / unenthusiastic. I thought it was a bit cheeky to charge quite so much for the breakfasts - why not venture out into Leicester Square and find somewhere else to eat - there's lots of lovely, reasonably priced restaurants and cafes around.
A great hotel, that I'd like to visit again - and hopefully the staff might be a bit more cheerful!!",4,2013,02,07
125,Not bad....but not great either,"I recently stay at St Martins Lane for 3 nights and found it adequate, but I wouldn't recommend staying there. I also think it's a stretch to call this a 5 star hotel.

Pros:

Location is great and incredibly convenient to restaurants, bars, subway, etc.
Room had a nice view.
The bathroom in our room was terrific

Cons:

The hotel doesn't leave you with an impression that anyone is eager to help you. There often wasn't a doorman, and if there was, he was generally talking with another hotel employee or otherwise engaged. The concierge was either missing or on his computer sitting behind a desk that isn't labeled. The service wasn't bad, it just wasn't anywhere near the standard of a 5-star hotel.

The hallways seemed dingy.

The room is tiny and the bed was small. There is almost no storage so we were tripping over our luggage the entire time. It was too small a room for 2 people.",3,2013,02,03
125,"Out of date products in fridge, staff wandering into room without permission","Having cancelled The Holiday Inn in Mayfair to stay here because of the recent offers.  We are mortified to say it was the biggest mistake we could have made.  My Husband and I have wanted to stay here for a couple of years having 'tried and tested' many five star hotels to which we have always felt have given us 'value for money'.  This however - was disappointing in every aspect, small clinical looking room, cheap out of date furniture, bit of nice mood lighting, decent bathroom but more appallingly - out of date products in fridge which the staff just seemed to dismiss when notified. To cap it off we arrived at three as stated - went straight out to see some sights, returned at six to find our curtains had been closed and a candle lit.  We were not asked if we wanted this service and more tot he point - its our own private space until we leave.  We could have left any kind of valuables out or underwear etc.  That's not a tasteful service rather an intrusive way of checking up on people.  Dull hotel, noisy and over priced restaurant, minimal and contemporary (or rather sparse and uninteresting is a better valuation.  Save your money and stay at The Savoy or Dorchester.",1,2013,02,03
125,"Great location, modern vibe","I stayed at St. Martins Lane for nine nights in January 2013 on business. I would normally not be able to afford this class of hotel, so it was nice to know what 300 GBP buys you.

The hotel is very modern, with clean lines, sharp angles, and lots of glass, metal, and white walls. I almost felt like I wasn't cool enough to stay there. :)

My room, as these things are in London, was small (for this American), but probably average by London standards. The bed was perfect, very comfortable with a nice comforter. On nights that I wasn't getting over jet lag, I slept very well.

The bathroom was nicely appointed, and decent sized for London. The room had a flatscreen TV in a hutch above a mini bar. You can guess how expensive those items were.

In the entry hall was the only clothes-storage space: a small closet (but big enough for several shirts and sweaters), and four good-sized shelves on which to place the rest of your items. There are four hooks in the hall as well to hang your coat, scarf, etc.

Extras at the hotel were pricey, so beware of those charges you may rack up: 40GBP to park your car, 2.75GBP to make a local call, 20GBP for a nice, but cold, buffet breakfast, etc.

The hotel was minutes away from the Leicester Square Tube station and all of the attractions in the West End, so the location was right in the center of things. Plenty of food options just down the street, and more than you could possibly try in a fortnight within five minutes walk. Less than five minutes away is Trafalgar Square, so Parliament/Big Ben, and across the river to the London Eye are all walkable.

The front desk was very helpful and friendly, and very accommodating. I got a call after I had checked into my room after five minutes, to see how I was doing, and when I returned the room later that evening, found a nice handwritten note and some sweets to welcome me to the hotel.",4,2013,01,30
125,Weekend in London,"E hotel is really nice central location for getting everywhere.
We had a lovely room on the 3rd floor very clean. The staff are really helpful and can not do enough for you. The bar and staff are fantastic Saturday night is e time to go. The down side, the breakfast, Sunday ,owning it was busy but they had numerous attempts at getting the table next to ours e right breakfast and when ours arrived it was cold as was e coffee and toast, @¬£25.00 a person you expect more.",4,2013,01,28
125,Slightly confusing but fun!,"Once we had decided the taxi driver wasn't mad we entered the hotel which didn't look or feel like a hotel and were greeted by a very friendly and helpful receptionist ...the theme of the hotel for me was very smart,well dressed staff who seemed to care ...the room was very good ...slightly different but that's good ...who wants Holiday Inn? And you must try the restaurant which gets its own review...it is no ordinary hotel restaurant it is bleedin lovely.....
The only let down was breakfast which was badly organised and chaotic but again the team whilst harassed and a wee bit stressed were very apologetic and the food when it eventually arrived was very good....
Thanks very much for an excellent stay.....",4,2013,01,27
125,Struggled with service and design,"I am surprised that people are raving so strongly about this hotel. We are Londoners but decided to have a night in town to have some couple time. We had a deal so we got a deluxe room at ¬£195. Location is obviously good for Soho and most popular tourist areas.

I personally found it underwhelming. It is very ""designed"", using glass, shabby chic and minimalism to create an edgy space. The staff however were lacking. They seemed to never have been taught top quality service. They were friendly and nice but just didn't seem to have learned certain skills that would allow them to do their job in the best way. The receptionists checked us in very slowly, they seemed to struggle to make a seamless entrance, there is a lot of flapping which seemed to carry through any interaction we had.

The room was large and furniture minimalist but they haven't thought it through very well. There are visible wires to the tv and table. There are only 2 plugs on either side of the room. It is so badly laid out they provide you with an extension lead so you can use the hair dryer and look in the mirror.

The room had also just been painted which we could smell when we arrived.

In the morning we had to queue for breakfast, they had only set tables up in half their restaurant so it was one in one out until they worked out that they could lay more table. The manager was another person that wasn't really showing that she had the right skills. To bring a queue down she could seat several people in one area at one time but she took each couple across the restaurant individually. It was just the long way round. She also had to come back to take our order as the waiting staff seem chaotic and unaware of us. Classic line is that she was sorry but there is a massive queue for food in the kitchen but the good news was that we were in that queue - well I would hope so since we had ordered some food. It finally arrived, was wrong and one was stone cold. I just ate it because I couldn't be bothered to complain (little groggy from the night before). I did notice several other couples complaining the food was cold, service poor and generally frustrated.

All that said, it does the job, we didn't have any truly awful experiences, just underwhelming ones. I wouldn't go back, however my husband and I did decide that we were more classic that this hotel. The thing with modernism is that it gets to the point when it's had it's day and we felt that about this hotel. Vast, clean, tries a bit too hard to be cool but I didn't hate it, I just didn't feel that after being out in the cold shopping in busy London that I wanted to rush back to the hotel. It is not a home from home type of hotel.",3,2013,01,27
125,"Design, Style in London's Covent Garden","First time I stayed in this hotel, which was recommended by colleagues (for its nice design and the vicinity to my company's office). And I will definitely come back:

My second floor room was spacious for London measure and the interior design & architecture made the best of the available space - with cleverly integrated TV, Radio and Minibar (all well hidden in a sleek white tower) and an in-the-wall-closet, covered with curtains.

Overall color scheme in this hotel is light white and the smart lightning design in the hotel allowed to change lights with your mood (pinkish, greenish, yellowish).

Coming back to my room in the evening, I used to find the small tea light in the bathroom was lightened which made me feel welcome.

The room was absolutely clean and - what I really cherished - there was no scent from cleaning ingredients or any other odors. It smelled neutral in a nice way ;-)

Staff was friendly but not overly so you felt welcome and serviced but not over-protected.

Air condition can be switched off and modified by hand and the big windows can be opened, which should be a must (but isn't - there are many hotels where this isn't the case).

Overall a very good experience, but since the foyer is not cosy (but stylish) and the same goes for the hotel bar, I only rate it  4 ****, not 5.",4,2013,01,26
125,A bit too modern for me,"As others have remarked, this hotel does not have its name on the building; I‚Äôm not sure how that enhances the guest experience.
Entering the foyer, the first impression is of noise: over-loud pop music echoing in a large uncarpeted space.  Check-in was bit slower than it should have been, because the (foreign) receptionist has some problems with English.
Getting to the room was a learning experience, as the corridors are very gloomy, and the room numbers are not where you‚Äôd expect to find them, but woven into the carpet.
The room was well-equipped, though there was no tea/coffee.  Good amenities in the bathroom, with plenty of good-quality towels.  Sound-proofing between rooms was not very good.
There is a very small, two-place business centre.  Guests have 60 minutes free internet access, which is very good.  The homepage of the PCs has a link for checking in for your flight.  Click it, and you get a further set of links to an enormous selection of airlines.  Pick your one, check-in and print your boarding card.  Most hotels provide this kind of thing, but this is the most developed and easiest one I‚Äôve come across.  Other hotels should take heed and copy.
There is no guest lounge or similar space where you could sit and read or have a chat.  There is some seating in the foyer but, as mentioned above, it‚Äôs very noisy.
Other reviewers have commented on the trendy design of the hotel, and it is this that I would stop me going back.  There is an internal door between the room and the door to the corridor; an excellent idea, you might think, as it cuts down on noise.  Well, it doesn‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs just a large slab of wood that swings round but doesn‚Äôt actually fit into a doorway.  It doesn‚Äôt even touch the wall, so there no sound seal at all.  There is no door handle.
Another trendy excess is the (only) chair in the room.  It is of brushed aluminium, and it‚Äôs very cold to sit on.  There‚Äôs internet access in the room, but you would not be very comfortable on that chair dealing with your emails.
In the bathroom basin, the hot and cold taps are smooth cylinders.  Easy enough to turn on, but once you have soapy hands they are quite impossible to turn.
So my overall impression is of a trendiness that, instead of enhancing your experience, simply gets in the way.",3,2013,01,24
125,Very design conscious,"For trendy design lovers who like to see and be seen in the heart of the city. Fashionable and chic, hip hotel in a great location. Near to Soho and frequented by the trendy gay set, if you are a straight good looking guy i may stay clear, especially of the public loo's, yes my darling husband was solicited in the loo's and he was actually quite frightened and would not want to go back again. apart from that horrid experience it's a good place.",4,2013,01,22
125,I am not leaving this gorgeous glass box,"I have to start this review by saying that I have not had great experiences with Ian Shrager hotels in the past, which seem to thrive on form over service: lots of pretty people, but God forbid if you need someone to open the door for you at the entrance, let alone get timely room service or have enough light to read in bed!  

But I take it all back: my stay at this hotel has been close to perfect. I am staying here because the hotel is on my husband's employer's ""approved list"" and he is here in London on business. When I arrived, the doorman Martin, greeted my taxi, helped me out with my luggage and cheerfully showed me to the front desk. Our room was ready and I was quickly whisked upstairs. Sadly the first two rooms were WAAAY too small for a 5 night stay, and they were very patient with me as I tried to figure out which room would be suitable. In the end, they showed me to ""The Apartment"", which is the most gorgeous one bedroom apartment with kitchen on a corner of the building. The light, even on the greyest of winter London days is spectacular and the views over the gorgeous rooftops of London have made it hard to get out to explore. The food from room service has been hot, tasty, reasonably priced and timely. The maid service efficient and cheerful. The location is excellent: right in the heart of the West End, half a block to the National Portrait Gallery, 2 blocks to Trafalgar Square, and 5 minute walks to the shopping on Regent Street and Covent Garden.

We have lots of friends in London, so we have had a great time entertaining them in the apartment (thanks to the fast room service) as well as down in the very attractive bar and restaurant. Cabs in the morning are plentiful and it is a short 10-15 minute ride to Canary Wharf.  I will definitely be back.",5,2013,01,22
125,"Super good, super modern, super stylish","Wasn't really sure what to expect of this place - but it exceeded expectations anyway. Booked for one night just before Christmas so it was packed with office party-goers but friendly receptionist put me on the top floor (as requested).
Loved the 'mood-lighting' and the decor. Excellent en-suite with fun toiletries, walk-in shower etc. It was a 'base-price' room but the picture windows keep it light and I've certainly stayed in smaller, particularly bearing in mind that you are in heart of the West End.
Was on my way to my own 'office-do' so didn't try the bar but it looked fun. There seem to be various deals available through the usual price-comparison websites so try there first. For what I paid (and bearing in mind it was party season) this is great value.",5,2013,01,21
125,"High End, Reasonably Priced, Middle of Soho","I would have rated this a 5-star if it weren't for the construction going on in the set of rooms adjacent to mine.  Hammers were going full strength although, to be fair, I was trying to sleep in for a spell.  (My advice to the staff at St. Martin's: Put a 1 or 2 room buffer in between said construction and your guests.)

Was truly pleased with the accommodations.  Great, modern detail but also very comfortable and livable space.  As is typical with London, rooms were small but the bathroom and shower area was nice and open, and well-appointed.  Shower was magnificent.  Powerful and plenty of hot water.

Bed was comfortable and made for an easy rest (despite the construction/remodeling goings on.)  

Location was second-to-none if you're wanting access to Soho, Covent Garden, the Charing Cross shops and even the West End. 

Great bar downstairs.  Open late and with attentive staff.

All-in-all, given the chance, I'd stay there every time I made my way to London.",4,2013,01,21
125,Great Boutique hotel w great staff and restaurant,We spent a night at St Martins Lane. I had stayed before but it was a while back. I thought the hotel might have changed but it was even better then when I was last there. The room was small but was beautifully decorated in a minimalist way with very clever designs for fitting everything in. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful.,5,2013,01,19
125,Fantastic Staff,"This hotel is ultra modern in design, very light and airy. Our room on the 6 th floor had fantastic views of various London landmarks - which looked beautiful at night.

Although the rooms are minimalistic -which is totally my taste- I found the asthetics of mine a bit  'uber trendy' on a personal level. That said the real jewels in this establishment are the very professional staff who take customer service to another level by making you feel cared for in a way where you could be the only guest in the hotel.

My sincere thanks to Deborah and Ed at Reception for their warm greeting and personal delivery to my room.",5,2013,01,19
125,Great weekend stay,"Stayed in the St Martins Lane hotel for a weekend out in London on a ""Jetsetter"" rate. The room was one of the bigger ones (a ""loft"" room or sth similar).

Pros:
- Very big, well-appointed room with a lot of windows (corner room, so windows to two sides);
- excellent bathroom including a big bath tub and a great shower;
- nice toiletries and other touches (such as the mood lighting system);
- great breakfast included;
- very friendly staff in the whole hotel.

Cons: 
- Hotel looks rather ugly from the outside - the architect should never be hired again;
- Wifi comes at a price (although reasaonable - 10 GBP per day).

Overall, a really great hotel, in particular if you are staying in one of the bigger rooms!",5,2013,01,16
125,Staying at St. Martins Lane Hotel,"We had a double room for one night (when visiting Theatre). The hotel is grand and very modern. The service was really excellent, and all the Staff were very helpful and friendly. Pity the telephones in the room didn't work! The food menu was not to our liking, so we ate out, but that was OUR choice, not a complaint. Not sure about the Canabis candle available to buy in the room! The design of the room was very unusual, and delightful. Altogether, excellent, and I would be happy to return.",5,2013,01,14
125,Great location and friendly staff,"Lots of positives particularly location, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Got a deal on secret escapes at ¬£200 a night including wifi and breakfast. Room was a little small (for storage etc..) with a few minor niggles, but I suppose you can't have it all. Personally I would not wanted to have paid much more and we have had better rooms elsewhere for less.  However on balance it's a great place for national gallery, theatre and covent garden etc.. would recommend at around that that price point for a std room. Was offered a ¬£40 upgrade which I never checked but may have had some extra wow if it's a special trip... Also there is a gym but never got time!",5,2013,01,12
125,Great Experience,"I stayed at St. Martins Lane for the first time in December. It was a great experience due in large part to the wonderful attention of Jesper Soerenseon who works at the hotel and was eager to make my stay the best it could be. His extra care in finding a quiet room for me made all the difference to my three night stay. The hotel has an amazing design, helpful staff, delicious restaurant and ideal location. I will definitely stay here next time I am in London. Thanks for making it a perfect visit, Jesper!",5,2013,01,08
125,Amazing feeling throughout!!!,"From the point of check-in everything felt fantastic, the staff throughout the hotel were always happy, chatty and just so personable. This extends from the people on reception to the staff at breakfast the following morning, i don't think i've stayed at a hotel where everyone is so accomodating for the right reasons, i.e. because they actually want to be, rather than are paid to be. Prior to arriving at the hotel I had mentioned that it was a special occasion and upon entry to the room we were greeted by candles, rose pettels and a bottle of champagne, a wonderful arrangement which just helped to make our special day even better. 

The room, like the whole hotel is quirky and perhaps not to everyone's taste, though we loved it, it was 100% clean as you would expect and the mood lighting gives a nice twist.

The only marginal negative is the design oddity which means that the blinds can't be closed completely, this wasn't a problem for us but may well be for those who require a blackout in order to drop off.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the perfect central location alongside what really is a 5 star service.",5,2013,01,08
125,Staff is unbelievable,We had a great experience overall. I had a little accident with the revolving door and the staff was amazing. They took such great care of us and were lovely and friendly. The location is also fantastic!,5,2013,01,06
125,excellant place to stay in London,".....great location, easy walks to theatres, galleries, museums, historical sites, fine restaurants and  shopping.....pleasant, friendly staff......well decorated, bright and  modern facility....room had very comfortable beds......overall it was a lively, vibrant environment......tea/coffee facilities in the rooms should be a priority.....",5,2013,01,03
125,Great stay,"Stayed at the St Martins Lane hotel on New Years eve and was really a great hotel to stay at for the occasion. On arrival hotel reception v.helpful & dealt with me straight away. Very impressed by the reception area as well, very smart and modern.
Booked the Deluxe room which I was a little unsure about due to the lack of pictures/detail on the website, however once I was in the room I was really impressed with how nice, clean and modern the room was. Bed was a really good size & comfy, room also had desk which was handy and a unit in the corner consisiting of the T.V & mini bar which were also good.  Bathroom v.impressive with separate cubicle for toliet and shower & a good size - would definitly stay in a deluxe room again.
Only bad point I would say is the pricing of all the extras in the room. ¬£10 for wi-fi & was amazed when I checked out that I was charged ¬£10 for having two small bottles of water from the mini-fridge. Apart from that though really enjoyed my stay.  
Also to mention when I originally booked for New Years direct through St Martin's Lane webiste I booked the deluxe room for ¬£500+, however a couple of weeks later the same room for the same date was available on booking.com for just over ¬£300, so I obviously re-booked through booking.com & cancelled the other booking, so worth keeping your eye on the price/other sites.",5,2013,01,03
125,Special Stay - Made perfect by the St Martins Lane team,"St Martins lane is a great place to stay for any occasion. The design and cleanliness is most certainly 5* 

6* s must go to the team that work there. Amazingly attentive and offer the warmest welcome whatever you look like. Now a no1 place of ours to stay in London",5,2013,01,03
125,Fantastic staff,"We stayed at St Martins Lane on 12/31/12.   Late getting in, the door man named Martin helped us navigate to a good restaurant in the area that would be open on NYE.  Martin continued to make our stay the best possible the next day.  He was fantastic!  The front desk staff was also great.",5,2013,01,03
125,"Great Hotel, Great Location","I've stayed here a few times and its a great hotel.

Staff are always friendly and helpful.

Rooms are a bit small, but very cool and comfortable. Although they lack and tea and coffee making facilities, they are setup with an iPod dock and mood lighting.

The restaurant on the Ground floor, Asia de Cuba is also out of this world, again I've dined here a few times and its always been fantastic and the staff are great too.

I stayed with my wife for one night, so we could go to the theater, she was pregnant at the time, so this was the ideal location as it was 5 minutes walk from everything we needed, Covent Garden, The Strand, and the Savoy theater.

Its expensive, but a great experience, I would definitely stay again.",4,2013,01,03
125,Superb Service from a Superb Hotel,"This was my second stay at the hotel and it was excellent as usual. We were offered a nice big room on the fourth floor with good views. The room was big, airy and well maintained and serviced. 
What makes the hotel so special is the fact that their staff remembers your name from your previous visit and they all offers superb service from just a very friendly greeting to going out of their way to get you a taxi.
This centrally located superb hotel is a must stay for anyone on holiday or on business.",5,2013,01,03
125,A great place to stay!!,"The hotel is funky, modern, cool and the staff is friendly and fabulous. Alex the concierge steered us to wonderful unique restaurants each night.  The location is great - walking distance to theater and restaurants.  The rooms are clean and light; ours had big windows. The breakfast buffet is great, and the light bar in the lobby is a trendy fun spot. All in all, our third time here and we wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2013,01,02
125,Superficial,"The place had no vibe whatsoever. It was too cool to even be cool. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, and if you want one to your room you have to pay nearly $7 just to get it there! Staff were helpful at times but if they were in deep convo with other staff that was way too important to stop. Never will stay again.",2,2013,01,01
125,Great hotel!,"We stayed a week here in December 2012, and had an absolutely wonderful experience. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful without being tip-grubbing or obsequious - for all the comments here about the staff having attitude, we experienced none (though many of the guests were pretty rude). The room was great, and the decor is as slick and hip as other Starck-designed places. Room service and housekeeping are very accommodating. Location is wonderful, especially for a theatre trip - only a few minutes walk from most West End theatres and several Underground stations. There's a 24 hr convenience store and a Starbucks right across the street as well. The only thing I could think to complain about would be the excessively slow response time on the entertainment system - but that's extremely minor. We will definitely be back!",5,2012,12,27
125,Needs a bit of polish,"Stayed on my first night back in England.  I'd been on a 24 hour flight from Australia so I was pretty tired and cranky when I checked in.  All the staff even the uber stylish doormen are extremely attractive. I have to say  a few are a little up themselves. I guess that's part of the brand.  The guy that checked me in was so busy chatting and giggling with his colleagues - which didn't stop when I walked up- that I felt uncomfortable. My arrival seemed to irritate him!  Overall check in was fine but first impressions were extremely poor.  Most of the other staff were professional and they more than offset the bad start.. 

The hotel is extremely stylish although starting to look a little tired.  I loved the decor but could imagine the eclectic mix not to everyones taste. The rooms are tiny but extremely well designed.  The tv cabinet designed for a CRT tv now looks a little out of place and somewhat dominates the room.  The lighting is a little confusing but the coloured theme sets the room off beautifully. The bathrooms are excellent. 

The hotel provides some gorgeous little touches that were  cute.  I've had a million little welcome notes and gifts but somehow these were just a little better. Being Christmas  I had a plate of mince pies left for me. Whilst my friend next door got a gin and tonic. No ice bucket though. 

We dined in the restaurant which is fusion Asian and Cuban.  Sounds weird but it actually works. It's quite noisy but the vibe is awesome and the server was so lovely.  Really knowledgeable about the food and made some really helpful suggestions. 

",4,2012,12,26
125,Couldn't have been better,"What a lovely hotel. Dead after an overnight flight, they let me check in at 11AM, and go straight to bed. Great room, not large but very functional and pretty, like a little jewel. Breakfast was included and they had super hours for it. Front desk, and restaurant staff were helpful and kind. The Doormen helped me, even in the rain,consistently. They found a place for me to park my very large scooter. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if travelling alone and want to feel secure.",5,2012,12,25
125,Designer Hotel In An Excellent Location.,We stayed for 2 nights in November for my birthday. I got a fantastic deal on Secret Escapes otherwise the hotel would have been way out of my price range. The room was minimalistic which I liked but we were disappointed that there were no tea and coffee facilities and the iron didn't work. The hotel were very quick to give us a kettle and replacement iron when we asked. The bar was lovely but quite a few of the seats were ripped and when we mentioned it they knew about it. Hopefully they are now repaired!! Breakfast was excellent and so were breakfast staff. Included in our deal was breakfast and free wifi. Wifi is expensive and charged for each item not the room. We liked the hotel and had a lovely weekend however I think the normal prices are really high and definitely NOT worth it. Thank you to the hotel for giving me a bottle of wine for my birthday. That was a very nice touch.,4,2012,12,20
125,"Great location, but fading...","My wife and I recently stayed at the St Martin's Lane Hotel, and all I can say that it is a great property that seems to be fading...

The positives:

1)  Fantastic location - next to Leicester Square and very close to Covent Garden, Soho, Trafalgar Square, etc.  Very walkable to Westminster, Picadilly Circus, and the Western fringes of the City of London

2) Still a very hopping location and hotel (if that is your thing), with a bustling restaurant and bar

3) Access to gym below, which is a great facility for Central London

4) Service was generally very good during our stay

The Need to Improve areas:

1) The place looks the same as it did 9 years ago, the last time I stayed at the hotel.  While still stylish/minimalist - it does seem in need of an upgrade.  Painting/finishing, etc. seems to be on its last legs

2) The rooms are ok, but minimalist taken to an area where it almost seems cheap.  As an example - TV stand has all of the character and feel of an IKEA piece (would not be surprised if it is one!)

3) Even the information packs have a cheap feel, with printed normal paper pages that have seen better days - and the information just isn't enough (doesn't say where breakfast is, when the gym is open/where it is (you have to go outside to different door)

So - all in all - worth staying for the location and good service, but you can certainly find better rooms in London.",3,2012,12,20
125,"Great location, solid service and a touch of (cool) attitude","I travel to London frequently on business, usually near the Strand, Covent Garden and Piccadilly Circus, and have stayed at many, if not most, of the better hotels in the area, including The W, Le Meridien, the Savoy, Mandarin Oriental, One Aldwych, The Ritz, and all are very good in their own right (though some play it a little over the top).  But I rank the St. Martin's Lane above all others.  It's a great location to venture out to Covent Garden, Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square and the general area, including many great restaurants.  The rooms aren't huge, but very comfortable and clean.  The front desk service and room service are both solid and responsive.  The restaurant, Asia de Cuba, is also top-notch, though be forewarned ... it's ""expense account expensive.    And the separate bar area is a great place to convene and have a few drinks.  Some of the tables are reserved, so get there early enough to grab a good seat--to view the scene and the people.",4,2012,12,19
125,Style and Substance,"My husband and I stayed here as a birthday treat for my 30th at the beginning of December and we booked through Secret Escapes so it was extremely good value. I think it's perhaps over-priced otherwise, although that is probably just because the decor is not quite my style. However, you definitely receive 5 star treatment here and as soon as we arrived we received a very warm welcome from the porter, receptionist, concierge and restaurant receptionist. 

The hotel is decorated in a slightly more clinical style than I usually like but the atmosphere throughout the hotel is so warm that you really feel at home. We stayed in a Deluxe King and we were very happy with the facilities that the hotel provided in the room and the shower was amazing. The products were also really lovely and you had the option to purchase larger versions if you so wished.

We didn't eat in the restaurant but we had breakfast in our room both mornings and the food was fantastic. The breakfasts were huge - we had a full English both mornings, including one vegetarian breakfast and actually both with poached or scrambled eggs as opposed to fried; we also had yoghurt, fruit, juice, Champagne. It was all delicious and I would recommend staying here for the breakfast alone!

The bar is really lively and could be pretentious but it just isn't. We stayed up until the small hours trying different cocktails and the staff brought me out a special birthday cocktail with birthday doughnuts as the clock struck 12am which was a lovely touch.

The location is absolutely amazing. We actually live in London but it was brilliant to be right in the thick of everything and it made seeing friends/familiy visiting for my birthday much easier. 

I want to give the hotel 5 out of 5 because the staff really couldn't do enough to help and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our stay. Thanks for adding to a fantastic birthday celebration!",5,2012,12,16
125,For those who love it in style (P. Starck) and convenient,"I've stayed in St. Martins now repeatedly for several days and loved it!

It's so central that (almost) everything seems to be within walking distance. 
I asked for a room with a view, which was no problem to get, really enjoyable and quiet (much appreciated). 
Beds are large and of really good quality.
Room and bathroom are of fair size, modern and impeccably clean, with panorama windows down to the floor. 
Apparently Philippe Starck did not only design the lounge chairs, but the interior, too, (though I didn't like the desks put across the corner).

Breakfast buffet is good, though not exceptional.
But the staff is one of the best I've ever came across. Extremely attentive, relaxed and sincerely friendly.",5,2012,12,14
125,The only place to stay when visiting London!!!,"Just amazing as always, my favourite hotel in London. Location is fantastic, the best part is Asia de Cuba without a doubt a must when you are there!
Rooms are very quirky along with mood lighting in corridors, concierge and general staff really go out of there way for you making your stay very special!
Definately recommend you will not be disappointed!!!
",5,2012,12,13
125,"Super swanky, swish place to stay","This place is really lovely, very very moden and all the staff seem to be compleaty gorgeous so you feel a bit like you are in the middle of a film shot which is funny.
The rooms are nice but the corridors are really dark and the numbers of the rooms are dimly lit on the ground so that can be really confusing when you are looking for your room.

I was impressed that there was an iPod docking station in the room and although mine wasn't properly working I am sure this is not the case in all the rooms.

The cocktail bar is lush, some amazing cocktails to try.

This seems to be a great place for spotting famous people, we saw 4 just that evening in the bar and restaurant where the food was really good and the service was top notch.

Fab little hotel, a little hard to find and doesn't look at all like a hotel from the outside and I walked past it 3 times!!!!",5,2012,12,12
125,Trendiest Hotel in London !!!!,"My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights on 23/11/12. 
The staff are very friendly and approachable while remaining professional. 
The rooms are minimalist, but modern and very trendy. Very expensive bed linen - the beds are so comfortable and I'm usually so fussy about my pillows, but they were just right!
The Asia de Cuba restaurant was amazing - it has a sharing menu, which makes choosing difficult because every thing on there sounds fantastic. We had the Asia de Cuba salad for starters (amazing) and the Tuna with wasabi mash ( amazing) among others!!! Great wine selection too!
Hotel is ideally located for all our needs as so centrally located to all the sightseeing and a short walk to Covert Garden, Soho and Leicester Square.
Amazing STAFF, ROOM, RESTAURANT and BAR. Cannot fault it.
With thanks, Martin and Christian",5,2012,12,12
125,An excellent hotel.,"Stayed here for the weekend. Great hotel, well situated, friendly, helpful staff. Really comfortable room with the best bathroom configuration of any hotel I've stayed in anywhere and I've stayed in a few. We booked through Secret Escapes which of course saved us money. Had we paid the full price I would have to question value for money hence four star rating and not 5. We found the bar to be extremely busy and noisy but it is Christmas and if you can't party at Christmas when can you party. I have to admit to being old too. The only real downside for me was, no fish, except smoked salmon, on the breakfast menu. I love smoked haddock or kippers and I didn't like the maple syrup, but that's me being picky and you can't please all of the people all of the time",4,2012,12,10
125,St Martins Lane,"A last minute trip to enjoy a night in London.
Had a room booked through Last Minte London Rooms, all went well.
Hotel upgraded our room for a small fee probably wouldn't do that again but well worth staying here.
All the staff good, from the guys on the door through to the girls looking after breakfast.
All very good.",4,2012,12,09
125,Hot Spot,"Stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks. Very nice hotel if you can afford it. Rooms are clean, minimalistic, a bit noisy, but comfortable. Excellent shower. Service is good (especially restaurant). Restaurant Asia de Cuba very nice and you can even order room service from the restaurant menu. Great gym. Guests (fortunately) not the average tourists and generally quite trendy. Location is excellent (Covent Gardens, Chinatown, Trafalgar Square, theaters, restaurants, shops, all within walking distance). The only reason for not assigning an overall 'excellent' grade is that I was a little bit surprised to find out that I had to pay GBP 50p/n extra for a room with a patio (to be able to smoke one sigar in the evening outside without being forced to leave the hotel) whereas a colleague of mine got one with no extra charge and without even asking (same booking as mine). The distant acting girl at the reception appeared to be surprised when I kindly turned down her 'generous' offer.",4,2012,12,08
125,Far below expectations,"Location is pretty good, and some parts of the interior design are pretty nice - I think the bathrooms are the best part - but that's pretty much it. Oh, and the AC is working, although it's pretty slow.
The outside of the building is kinda ugly and completely unrecognizable if you haven't seen a photo of the hotel beforehand and just searching for the address/name. No labels with the hotel name in the lobby either.
Tried to pay with a debit card - ""I'm sorry, we don't accept that type of cards"" - ""Okay, tell me what types you accept so I can give you the right one"" - ""Every other one except this"". I hand him a different card - ""Oh, no, we don't accept that either""...
Room is pretty small, TV is medium sized and unresponsive.
Internet is paid for at ‚Ç§10 per DEVICE per day - so if I pay for my laptop and then want to use wifi on my phone for a few minutes, I have to pay another ‚Ç§10. And as if that's not enough, the internet completely stopped working for a while in the evening.
The experience was far from what I'd expect from a five star hotel, especially since the previous hotel I was in (a few hundred meters from that location) provided a better service, more spacious room with a bigger TV and free internet at 4 stars and lower rates too. Maybe the design was not as fancy, but oh, how much I care about this.",2,2012,12,04
125,great place!,"i have stayed here twice and both times i had a really great experience. the rooms are simple, clean, but a little small. the decor is modern, with clean lines and a lot of white (the lobby decor is much wackier than the actual room decor). i especially liked that the room bathrooms had little aloe vera plants - nice touch!

the staff at the front desk, doors and concierge was really friendly and helpful on both visits. the business center had large, new computers, albeit only two. the room service i ordered was really exceptional - it might be the best room service that i have ever eaten, in fact! i also dined at asia de cuba one evening and i recommend it. the desserts were amazing so definitely save room.

the covent garden neighborhood cannot be beat! lots of great shopping around the corner from the hotel and plenty of pubs and restaurants to choose from. i recommend bill's restaurant for casual brunch (it is tucked into some weird alleyway - hard to describe how to get there - google it and you'll figure it out). there is also a great travel bookstore on one of the main shopping drags - the name fails me at the moment but it is huge, so you'll find it.

i definitely plan to stay here again in the future.",5,2012,11,30
125,Top Top Location,"This has to be the ultimate location in West End. Less than 5 mins to Traf Sq, Covent Garden, Soho, China Town and Leicester Sq.

Visited Asia de Cuba restaurant in hotel - and had a great waiter looking after us and recommending dishes (and what not to have), and suprisingly reasonable value.

Light Bar was massively overpriced though

Rooms clean and modern - but have had better and paid less.

All in all a great experience and the staff throughout were excellent",4,2012,11,29
125,Enjoyed,"Recommend this  hotel, its nice and central, near to national gallery,  unusual different, staff very pleasant. The Restaurant Asia de Cuba had a pleasant  atmosphere with excellent food and service, epecially the desserts, like a work of art !",4,2012,11,25
125,Hip hotel in the heart of London,"This hotel is everything you'd expect of a Phillipe Starck design; funky decor, great lobby art installations and minimalist rooms that let the close-up views of Nelson's column and the Coliseum theatre spire provide the visual focal point. We were on the 5th floor in quite a large room which I'm sure made a difference. Asia de Cuba was an excellent restaurant for dinner and we were spoilt for choice with literally hounds of restaurants within a kilometer radius. Theatres everywhere, a short stroll to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Soho and Coventry Garden. Our only criticism was the lack of in room tea or coffee making facilities.",5,2012,11,23
125,"Excellent location, √ºber trendy","The hotel has location on its side, being close to Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. We were disappointed when we checked in as we got a room on the first floor facing an alley which sometimes lacked piracy unless we kept out curtains shut all the time, which also made it dark. Definitely try to stay away rom the first floor. The rooms themselves are nice and starkly white, which we liked. And the gimicky yet somehow endearing LED light color adjuster by the bed. There was enough closet space and a safe for our iPads etc. The bathroom was nice with the trendy soaps and gels you'd expect, although to me the rum-scented body was smelled like a hangover. If, like me, you wash your underwear and clothes as you go to save packing, the bathroom was a bit frustrating as the sink had no stopper, so I used a plastic bag to hold the water, and managed to tie my cloths line to a nub in the minimalist wall to the shower door. Interestingly, the hotel will wash workout clothes for free because they have an on site gym, so that might get you your underwear and socks done at least.

The hotel had an odd mix of sophisticated executives and moneyed partiers, who for the most part behaved themselves sound-wise, though we witnessed many a bedraggled walk of shame back through the halls as we made our way downstairs for breakfast. But we never had any disturbances to our sleep. Breakfast, btw, is a fantastic spread, including expensive fruits and fresh berries, good cereals, and really good pastries and cheeses. Our room rate included wifi and breakfast (a great deal BTW, as wifi was otherwise 10GBP per day too!) and breakfast included not only the buffet, but any menu items as well. Can't fault the restaurant for its food, though the servers are a bit weird. They all seemed to be women from former East Block countries, and would alternate between being nice and professional and being very overly familiar and saying things like ""the juice is over there, don't be lazy, use your legs"" or ""you are on vacation, yet we are all working, so we hate you"", which was meant to be cute and funny, but came off as astoundingly rude. I think it might be a language/culture boundary thing. For the most part the hotel staff do go out of their way to help. When we were having problems with our door lock, the engineer was on it in 5 min, and said to call at any time if we needed anything at all. 

Overall I think we might have been better off staying at the nearby newly renovated Citadines for less money, but for a trendy stylish splurge in the middle of the action the St Martins Lane Hotel is probably your best bet.",4,2012,11,22
125,"Minimalist Design, Maximum Service","I can understand how this hotel gets some of the poor ratings, the comments are probably valid.  You need to know what to expect and how to be.  And yes, everything about the hotel is pricey and just a little pokey.  Don't stay here expecting the Ritz. A tip, eat out, there's plenty of fantastic places for BLD nearby and the drinks in the hotel are overpriced - a lime soda on the last day cleaned out 10 quid. However, I've stayed here many years ago and knew what to expect.  Great location, great relaxed vibe and friendly service (if somewhat careful to some - who don't look as though they belong).  To Mike, the Head Concierge and his team, a million thanks for booking what we wanted, recommending other things and just being extremely helpful. We had some fragile things delivered to the hotel that arrived before us and it was looked after.  The rooms are still dark and lacking in storage space but we'd spent 5 weeks in chateaus with huge rooms and our Deluxe King was fine for a few nights.  Did I mention the service - yes they were that helpful.",5,2012,11,21
125,Poor value for money,"On the plus side: great location, friendly welcome, funky design, Asia de Cuba restaurant (on site) great lunch.
On the down side: no complementary wifi, 15% service charge added to everything, shampoo etc in room half used when we arrived, confusing lights (took ages to work out how to make the room dark!), no tea or coffee making facilities in room, light bar cocktails disappointing and seriously pricy (¬£15 plus service for a cocktail or gin and tonic!), no morning papers offered to room.
Our summary: funky, good for an illicit liaison if you only want to drink and admire the design. Not so great if you want to have a lie in with coffee and the papers in the morning.",2,2012,11,19
125,Rude and Overpriced,"A friend of mine kindly treated me to a night in a Corner Suite midweek. When I arrived and tried to check in it turned out he had given his credit card details but hadn't confirmed the room yet. The receptionist spoke to him on the phone and asked him to email a confirmation with a form they would send him. Five minutes later he text me to say he'd received no such email, so I re-approached the desk whereupon the staff became suspicious of me as I had a different name to my friend who had booked the room. A manager came out and took his telephone number and said she would call him but when she came back she informed me that she had in fact called her area manager and that the only way I could stay in the room was if I put the charge on my own credit card. I asked her why she couldn't call my friend to confirm but she was very effusive and rude, stating that there had been 'too many name changes'. I put the charge on my debit card which meant that the room price escalated from ¬£569 to ¬£818, including a ¬£100 discretionary charge for room inventory or something equally as weird. I dropped by later with my friend who gave them his credit card details and they informed me that I had been refunded - I've just checked my bank balance: no such luck.

Onto the room itself. Considering it had cost ¬£800 for one night, I was expecting fireworks. What I got was one free bottle of warm water - in a double room. I was placed on the 1st floor which had none of the 'London views' the website bragged about. The carpet was wet, it had just been cleaned. There was a light attached to the back of the TV which didn't turn off until I unplugged whatever it was from the wall. Wifi costs ¬£10 per day. The minibar and toiletry prices were extortionate. I understand the target market for this hotel but it seems to me the perks of paying for an expensive room are little to none, especially considering how criminalised I'd felt by the front desk. Apart from that the room was a good size, the TV was difficult to manipulate, but the bed was comfy. And no, breakfast wasn't included.",2,2012,11,19
125,Fantastic hotel and staff,"Just back from a whirlwind trip to London, celebrating a friend's landmark birthday. We planned to eat in Asia de Cuba but decided to go for the whole experience and stay in the hotel too...WOW! 

From the moment we booked the care and attention we received was second to none, the staff at St. Martin's Lane really took heed that this was a special weekend. When we checked in there was a welcome gift and having spent a glorious Saturday afternoon checking out London's galleries, we got back to our immaculate room to be greeted by a peronalised note from Steffi welcoming us and a lovely bottle of red too!!...

I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, the quirky bar, the minimalist foyer, the gorogeus guest rooms all made us feel we were on a luxury break but it was the staff, their courtesy and attention to detail that will make St. Martin's Lane my number one place to stay in London from now on.

Thanks to all.
...oh, yes and Asia de Cuba has THE best Ahi-Tuna ever, not to mention their super cocktails!!",5,2012,11,19
125,Still great!,Have been there regularly now and the hotel is still the same. Small rooms but well decorated as well as bathroom. Great staff and welcome. Great location and good value for money in London. Will return!,4,2012,11,13
125,Very central in the Teather District and close to Piccadilly,"It is not the standard of Delano (another Morgans) but is located very central to all Theaters, Soho and Piccadilly Circus. We paid the room in advance and does not looks like very expensive for London.",4,2012,11,12
125,Staff was lovely. Treated like a queen,All staff was so friendly and would do anything to make your stay special. Very chilled. Bed was so comfy. Shower was so nice did not want to come out. The free shampoo and conditioner got top marks not like the rubish you. Get in some places ,5,2012,11,11
125,"Location, location, location","St Martins Lane Hotel is... over-designed, expensive but it has the best location possible. You just walk out and you enter the Trafalgar Square. Few more steps and you see the Big Ben. If you have money to spare and value your time, this is the place to stay if you want to see as much as possible of the ""London London"". 

The hotel itself didn't wow me. Modern design is nice but the hotel is overhyped. Golden teeth and colored lights above bed is just a gimmick. Otherwise the room was nice and clean with LCD TV.

The food in the asian-cuban fusion restaurant is fine, just be aware of the sticky rice. Its really like a glue. The breakfast was spot on - beans, sausage, fruits... I really enjoyed it - except for coffee which was terrible. Good thing there is Starbucks just across the street.",4,2012,11,11
125,Impressed with first stay at St Martin's Lane,"Stayed for 2 nights having booked a good deal via secret escapes and my wife and I really enjoyed our stay. The location is excellent and the hotel is very modern and stylish - if you're happy with minimalist and white rooms - which we are. The Deluxe King Room was a decent size and the bathroom was top-notch.
Breakfast was very good with pretty good service and a good choice of hot and cold foods that were regularly replenished. The bar is good and was quite trendy - although not a patch on the Long Bar at their sister hotel, the Sanderson. I would definitely stay here again if I could find the same sort of rate again but would probably think twice if I was paying the full rack rate.",4,2012,11,05
125,wasnt impressed,"Only stayed 1 night but overall service levels were not what I would expect.

Arrived at 3pm to be told room wasnt ready as it was a Saturday and they were busy! After waiting for 30mins went back to the desk and then reception managed to find a room.

Food-wise can only comment on breakfast which was good and reasonable priced.",3,2012,11,05
125,Excellent Service - AGAIN!,"Fourth trip back to St Martins Lane and once again perfect service from the staff.
This time Matt from reception bent over backwards to accommodate a request to change rooms part way through our stay. It was my partner's birthday and he arranged a little gift and made sure that we had everything that we needed. He also managed to help us source some soap dishes (strange I know, but true).
Once again the rooms were amazing (and spotless - no other hotel is ever as clean); the lightbar cocktails were delicious; the mini bar was very perfect (and empty by the time we left); room service delightful and the concierge Amy very helpful in booking a dinner reservation for us.
Can't wait to come back again in a few weeks for a one night stop over.
I don't know how this hotel does it - their staff are so friendly and helpful but it's like they do it almost without trying - they just genuinely want you to have a great time.
The location couldn't be better either
I can't rate this hotel highly enough!
If you are dithering about whether to book - just do it - this might sway you - room service is always delivered on a table into your room and the waiter will set up the table properly for you to dine in your room - you seriously do not want to leave the room. Oh and get the romance package - roses, candles and champagne - sounds naff, but not naff at all.",5,2012,11,05
125,"A good value, stylish 5 star hotel in a great central location","Living so close to London, we rarely stay there as we find the decent hotels overpriced. However, for half the price of the Four Seasons and, in my opinion, a better hotel than The Soho, St Martins Lane was a real find. We have eaten at Asia de Cuba (the hotel's restaurant) in the past and were impressed by it but had forgotten that there was a hotel above.

I booked a deluxe king which was a nice room on the 6th floor with views across to the London Eye but I could smell cigarette smoke. After a quick phone call to reception, it turned out it was coming through the (locked) adjoining door from the next room. The receptionist was very apologetic and moved us immediately to the corner suite (Room 621), a vast room with full length windows on two sides. This was very impressive

What you do notice that all the staff are very informal. i was addressed at all times by my first name and the receptionist even made jokes as we checked out which we found refreshing and not stuffy, it suits the overall ambiance of the hotel. But they were enthusiastic and seemed to enjoy working there.

All in all, this is a good quality, stylish hotel and would recommend staying there. Just a note, there is no signage outside so you have to know that it is there!",5,2012,11,04
125,Good base,"I stayed here in October for 3 nights due to some heavy work commitments which involved late nights in the west end. The hotel is in a good location, the wifi works well, and the rooms have a small desk to work from.
The funky look of the reception area is echoed in the guest rooms. I thought the mood lighting was a nice touch. Very Good overall.",5,2012,11,03
125,Special weekend celebration,"This hotel is creative with design, functional, great location but the best feature are the staff.
Our family celebration weekend was a 21st birthday for our son. We took in a show within walking distance. From the time we arrived he was made to feel special his room had a cake and a bottle of wine arranged by steffi, the food was high quality and cooked to perfection and presented with humour by the cosmopolitan  waiting staff. Mood lighting throughout the hotel from our room to the cocktail bar was effective and pleasing to the eye. The only thing it lacked was a chill out area for a coffee. Thanks to the staff of St Matins lane for a fantastic weekend from all of us.",5,2012,11,02
125,Great hotel in a fabulous location,If you are looking for somewhere nice to stay in central London - look no further. It's chic and cool but also very comfortable. A 2 minute walk to Leicester sq tube station and in the middle of everything London is about ,5,2012,11,02
125,Excellent hotel with little to improve.,"Very good 5 star hotel, great location, center of London, next to National Gallery and Leicester Square subway station. 

Not a biggest room, but with a great view (floor to ceiling windows), very well designed, stylish illuminations, comfy bed, big bathroom, great complimentary cosmetics, cleaned 2 times a day ‚Äì so it had everything I needed in this kind of a hotel. 

Great, well-thought, stylish lobby. Staff could align more with to five star hotel (I was misinformed re: internet and what staff agreed with my boss). But generally service was good. Pity for the internet price - 10 GBPs for a day? Come. On. 

Breakfast very good, variety is more than enough, really great. 2 restaurants (one more like a bar).

Pity I was extremely busy on every day of my 3 night stay there, so I couldn‚Äôt spend more time in the hotel and it‚Äôs bar and restaurant. Next time maybe.",5,2012,10,31
125,Very nice Hotel with good location,"I stayed here for 1 week for business trip. Hotel is perfect, service is excellent. Special thanks to Cassandra for her warm reception in this hotel.

125,"Ultra modern, trendy and fab location","We stayed here as we had a birthday party to go to in covent garden, and the location was perfect, a short walk away from the club we were going to. The hotel is very modern and minimalistic, with very clever lighting. We chose to stay in a corner suite, which was very nice and again very modern, but a little clinical and despite assurances it was a ""big room"", I have to say we were a little disappointed with the size of the suite and bathroom. But on the whole a nice experience with comfortable bed.",4,2012,10,30
125,"A very chic, and central designer hotel","We stayed here for the weekend as part of my wife's birthday present, it is fabulous!  Very designer, very chic and much trendier than me!!  The ambience is lovely and friendly, the staff are very good without being unctuous.  The light bar is fantastic, especially for people watching.  Our room had fantastic views over London.  
The hotel is only just off Trafalgar Square, so very easy access to central London on foot, right in theatreland, with restaurant all around serving early and late.  Go...you'll love it!",4,2012,10,29
125,"Beautiful Hotel, Perfect location","My family and I stayed at the St. Martin's Lane hotel in August based on a recommendation from my cousin.  We couldn't have been happier with the choice.  The hotel has a very contemporary look and the room was spacious and clean with a beautiful bathroom and comfortable bed.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  However, the best part about this hotel is the location.  You couldn't ask for a better location to tour London from, with the tube, theaters and plenty of restaurants all within walking distance.  We highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to London.",5,2012,10,26
125,Best Location in London!,"This hotel was great from the start. I arrived at the hotel at 9:00AM from Boston and rather waiting to check in at 2:00PM they were very accommodating in finding me a room right away. (Which is nice when the jet lag is starting to set in.) They were helpful in providing a map and explaining where everything was. The hotel itself is right in the theater district, steps from Covent Garden, which is great for shopping and dining. It's only a 15 min walk to Buckingham Palace and close to Piccadilly Circus. 

The room itself was a little small but that was to be expected. However, it was clean and very modern. If I were to come back to London I would stay here again.",4,2012,10,25
125,A funky hotel with great service,"My husband and I have just come back from a night at St Martin's Lane.
We loved the trendy feel to this place, the staff were very friendly and made you feel welcome, we stayed for our wedding anniversary and mentioned this when we checked in, whilst we were out for a couple of hours a note had been slipped under our door wishing us a happy anniversary and offering us a complimentary drink each in the bar which we used of course and more besides!
Great rooms, although fairly small but had everything we needed. Two small criticisms a slight smell of damp in the corridor and room and no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room, but it didn't spoil our stay.",5,2012,10,21
125,20 Visits in the last year,"I seem to spent half of my life at the St Martin's Lane so I am remiss in not reviewing it earlier.

It's beautifully modern,immaculately clean has really comfortable beds and crisp fine linen ( real feather pillows people ) with a great turn down service. A personable, kind, efficient staff make staying here a pleasure. Forgotten iPhone plug? not a problem, tickets to a sold out show? effortless, my dad lost without a phone at Heathrow ? they found him... ( not kidding on that one). Honestly if I could live here I would.  
It is placed in the centre of London near the Leicester Square tube stop and is in walking distance of the West End Theatres and the Royal Opera House. It also has a GYM BOX gym next door ( an amazing gym ) that guests use for free. Could not be better.",5,2012,10,20
125,Over-trendy Spendy,"Stayed 4 nights in the deluxe pation suite so i could smoke and not have to go downstairs and outside- twas a very expensive stay...

Pros- Excellent Staff and Service!!!! Very Clean and excellent location- Great room service
Cons- double IKEA bed, no bath, funky small layout, and everyone can hear you in the loo-Yikes!

They've outdone themselves with trying to be too trendy- do I need a tv in the elevator with grass blowing or to sit on gold teeth in the lobby? Perhaps I do but paid over 400+ US/Night and saw friends room at the Trafalgar which I would have preferred.
Enjoyed it for the location the service and the sheer fact that I love Morgan Hotels but wouldnt stay again-
10 quid a day for internet was also another bummer",3,2012,10,19
125,Excellent,"Stayed three nights. Superb location. From the moment you arrive you know this hotel is a little special. Superb greeting at reception from very friendly staff. The rooms are well presented and for couples I would suggest they are wonderful, however being alone there was no need for the mood lighting or the candles in the bathroom. The restaurant exceeded expectations. I ate breakfast and lunch on all 3 days and was not disappointed. The flavours are truly to be savoured. Being on business essential to me is wi-fi and a good cup of tea/coffee whilst working, so I was disappointed that the wi-fi was extra and that there was no tray in the room. Overall a wonderful experience and on my list for that special occasion",5,2012,10,15
125,Best breakfast in London,"My wife and I have stayed in many London hotels and have been happy with all of them. But the stand out feature of St Martins Lane is the breakfast. There is a menu with a huge variety of cooked items and those we tried were excellent. This is complimented by a buffet with everything from juices, cereals, bread rolls, pastries and fresh fruit. During our stay this included strawberries and raspberries in addition to the usual melon, apple and oranges. The waiting staff were friendly and very helpfull in pointing out what was included in within your room rate.
The hotel is a little different form ""normal"", the first thing you notice is that there is nothing to identify it from outside the building. But as long as you know you are looking for tall revolving doors, and it is next to Gymbox it is easy to find.
The room was bright and spacious for London, clean and with everything we could want. The bathroom was especially good with plenty of room and a large shower. A nice touch was the hooks on the walls to hang things up. The only disappointment were the coloured lights that feature in the photos. I was expecting the whole room to be bathed in coloured light, but in our room it was just a rail of light above the bed. It is just a minor thing and  will not stop us returning to this excellent hotel.",5,2012,10,10
125,loved this hotel,"my husband and myself stayed here on the 30th september for our first anniversary.We absolutely loved it.staff were really friendly and very professional.The rooms were fabulous maybe not to every ones taste.but we love minimalistic.

125,Great location and excellent staff.,"Had a great trip to St Martins Lane Hotel.

Booked this hotel as a birthday surprise and the staff did everything they could to make it a memorable visit.

The hotel is in a very central location with everything on your doorstep. The hotel is very unique and won't be to everyone's taste but it was very smart, clean and friendly.

The hotel is a little ""worn at the edges"" but the service and friendliness of the staff more than make up for this.

Food in the restaurant was excellent as was the choice.

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for service, food and location. 

I llok forward to another visit soon.",5,2012,10,08
125,Falling off the Wireless Grid ?,"Been back at this hotel more times than I can remember. As always, I have enjoyed my stay immensely. The staff are very accommodating, and very keen to please the needs of the traveller. I am extremely grateful for kettle in my room, and that my specific roo  requirement are met almost every time.
However, I am starting to get the feeling that the management of this property is beginning to leave the traveller in the rain. This is a high priced hotel, with a high star rating, and yet I have to pay ¬£10 per day for WiFi! Fortunately I am not restricted by policies of where I need to stay, but unfortunately this is the deciding factor for my decision of where to stay. 
I am not interested in packages that includes ""this"" and ""that"" - this is the year 2012 where technology rules - and I strongly believe that free WiFi should be a standard in all hotels, specifically targerting upper class clientele.",4,2012,10,08

125,Overpriced,"One night stay for business meetings. Room pristine and all white (a little 'Swiss clinic' for my liking)...bed very comfortable.  Bar extremely pricey (like the room), and - like the room - quite dark in places. Didn't sample any of the food.

Pleasant hotel with great location in Covent garden, but I think very expensive and (for my taste) a little pretentious.",3,2012,10,08
125,Great location!!!,"The hotel is located in Covent Garden near Leicester Square.  It is just steps from Trafalgar Square, the National Portrait Gallery, the theatre district, as well as 3 tube stations which makes getting around very convenient.

The front desk/reception welcome was mediocre at best.  The staff was efficient but a little cold.  It's always nice to be received with a warm smile and a few kind words particularly after a long flight (our original flight was cancelled and we were diverted to Ireland before getting to London 6 hours later than expected).  Our experience with housekeeping, room service attendants, and the bell hops was much better. They were very friendly and accomodating.  

Our room was on the 6th floor and it was a long walk from the elevator.  The good thing about the location of our room is that we were not disturbed by street noise.  We heard revellers once but considering that we were only on the 6th floor it was fairly quiet. The view was okay but not spectacular.  Our room was small but the bathroom was spacious.  The only big negative about our room (620) was the dirty carpet.  There were stains near the mini bar/tv cabinet that were apparent and should have been cleaned long ago.  I am very particular about the cleanliness of hotel rooms and the dirty carpet is why I only gave this hotel 4 stars.  Bathrobes and slippers were available but one of the robes had a very large hole under one arm.  One thing I forgot to mention to management was the electric current coming from the desk while using my laptop.  When I leaned on the desk I felt a little jolt
on my arm.  It was not very painful but it's something that should be addressed.

We had dinner in the hotel at Asia de Cuba.  Service was great and the food was very good.  Although we never went to the bar there were beautiful people coming and going all night.  

All in all we had a very good experience.  We would definitely stay at St. Martin's Lane again.",4,2012,10,06
125,Lovely,"Very nich hotel, lovely rooms, friendly staff, and right bang in the centre of the Theatre district, I would recommend this to anyone.  The reception staff were very friendly, and offered us a free drink when we arrived in the bar.  Rooms were very clean, lovely shower room, and the view over london was great, we stayed on the 6th floor and we could see right over to the London eyc.",4,2012,10,01
125,If Ikea could design a hotel it would look like this.,"Great hotel, with a perfect location. The only complaint would be the rooms are small but nothing that I'm not used to in Europe. I would suggest this hotel to anyone who is looking for a trendy place to stay.",4,2012,09,27
125,Design hotel with sub-par and extremely impersonal service.,"Stayed on the 1st floor, street side, in superior room.

First the positives: The bed itself was really comfortable, with great linen. It was relatively quiet though the hustle and bustle on the street could be heard, especially at night. We were allowed early (9AM) check-in and complimentary 2PM check-out. The bathroom is very big and the (Malin & Goetz) products were a nice treat.

On the downside: The welcome was nothing short of rude. We were greeted by the woman with long brown hair with the stray bobby pin in her hair. She made it seem like we should be thanking her for staying at the hotel. The credit card used for the booking did not work, neither did one other attempted. We pulled cash out of the ATM, and upon return, she spread the money across the front desk, counting each individual bill as if it were the first time they had to deal with cash. This was a waste of time and quite indiscrete. 

As for service, nothing is complimentary. The lack of wifi is quite surprising (10 pounds surcharge per day), especially given the price of the room (approx 350 pounds per night).  I thus had to ask the ""concierge"" for the way to a gallery, and he sent me across town from the address (which I later found on google) only to realize that the address was wrong. There is no water kettle, let alone a free tea bag or coffee. The minibar is overpriced. There is a DVD player, but if you haven't brought your own DVDs, movies are about 10 pounds to watch on pay per view. 

The room was minimal, verging on a rather sterile. Two concerns: There is no spring on the bedroom door, the door will slam if you open and close it (since it has no handle). There is no electrical outlet anywhere near the bed, so if you would like to work on your computer, you will have to stay at the table. It's design for design and not design for function.",3,2012,09,25
125,Hip venue; great restaurant; incredible location; great service,"The hotel is hip (incredible furniture), staff are hip and the location cannot be beat. Small bedroom with lovely white fluffy bedding. Decor is hip/modern--African stool, white sculptural TV stand / mini-bar. Bathroom has shower, no tub. Amenities (soap, shampoo, conditioner) are hip. 

Staff are outstanding. From the moment we arrived, from bellmen to front desk to concierge and waiters/waitresses -- we got outstanding service. Great visual impression, too -- their clothes, acessories and glasses are hip as are their hairstyles.

Their restaurant Asia de Cuba is Asian-Cuban fusion. Wonderful. Great location -- wonderful restaurants/bars/cafes/shops nearby. (We particularly loved Gordon Ramsey's Grill at the Savoy.) Easy transportation to other parts of the city. 

Negatives: Just wish the room was a bit bigger and the bathroom had a tub.",5,2012,09,25
125,London Calling,"London has so many wonderful sights to see it would take many months to get through them all. I was there for a week, attending two Design Exhibitions as well as theatre nights, dinners and a myriad of other places, the OXO tower was a wonderful restaurant for lunch, we were very close to Covent Garden and Soho along with all the theatres.

I look forward to returning again soon",4,2012,09,24
125,How colours can really make a difference,"Stayed here on Saturday 22nd September as part of a Secret escapes hotel deal.
Price of ¬£184 for a deluxe King Size room which included the ¬£25 per head full breakfast.
Nice touch on arrival with the delivery of a complementary luggage tag, but what is really striking is
the use of lemon and lime in the foyer and the low level and wattage lighting in the corridors.
The use of colour is everywhere, with an above the bed option of lighting in mauve, turquoise,
green etc. Rooms are strikingly white and modern, beds tend to be firm and our room had a private garden and separate toilet and shower room.The only thing missing was tea and coffee
making facilties, though there was a mini bar. Umbrellas were available to use and in room merchandise involved hashish candles and tee shirts! Products were interesting including rum soap and cilantro hair conditioner.
Staff were plentiful and welcoming and security visible. On a Sunday breakfast runs from 7am until midday and products are well cooked, with rich ingredients and pastries were exceptionally fresh. Black coffee though is like rocket fuel
On this Saturday night the bar area was mostly reserved and very busy. There may be a quieter area for residents but we didn't find it.
The colours combined to make a psychedelically uplifting experience which we will definitely 
repeat.",4,2012,09,23
125,Great experience.  Excellent service.  Every time.,"I have been staying at the St. Martin's Lane Hotel for several years.  It is consistently a great experience.  The location is perfect for work and pleasure, with easy access to business districts, restaurants, and theater.  The restaurant Asia de Cuba is in the hotel, and the bar is cool.  Rooms are modern and comfortable, services are spot on, but the most amazing aspect is the professional and friendly service, from the doormen to the front desk to the concierge.  It is more fun and memorable than a lot of the luxury hotels in London.",5,2012,09,19
125,"Swish, stylish, central","Modern stylish hotel, still has what it takes to be a good central london hotel.

* Great location - in the heart of Covent Garden, close to shops, tourist sites and nightlife
* Whitewashed modern rooms, nice furniture, novelty desk 
* Nice bathrooms with Philippe Starck fittings (but no natural light)
* Great 'vibe' - less family, more single or couples

* Can be noisy at night or in the morning (most rooms overlook a busy street)
* Can feel 'too cool' with doormen slow to help
* Expensive bar and restaurant",4,2012,09,19
125,Very trendy,"Right in the heart of London with easy access to all the cool places in Soho. The hotel is very modern and has a nice lounge/bar. Can get very busy and impersonal, but very slick and definitely memorable.",4,2012,09,18
125,Modern and minimal with great friendly service,"This was the 4th time I have stayed at this hotel over the past 5 years and for London it is well priced, offers a simple and edgy style and the staff, without exception, are really helpful and very friendly.  The location is well suited for the tourist, close to the theatres, Convent Garden, SOHO and Trafalgar Square for example.  It is not the type of top end hotel with uber luxury features that I would choose if I wanted a truly self indulgent holiday with top restaurants and spa but I was in London to spend time with my daughter who was about to have surgery, so not much ""me time"" planned.  

A couple of constructive suggestions I would offer to the hotel is that I preferred the minibar contents of goodies from previous stays (not just the nut and crisp options) and I also preferred the organic, British toiletries from previous stays too.  However, the room I chose had it's own private outside courtyard with lots of natural light pouring into the room and it was quiet, I slept well and it was perfect for the 3 nights we had in London.",4,2012,09,16
125,"Great room, plenty of space","We were very surprised by our stay here. First, we arrived early, around 11 AM, and they had a room ready for us. They also gave us a welcome card with a small gift, a bright yellow luggage tag. The doorman was great, and Cassandra at the desk was fantastic. The doorman showed us to our room, and the lift was plenty big enough for 3 adults and our luggage. We were shown how to change the color of the lighting in the room (which was so cool) and after we had time to settle in, Cassandra called to make sure it was satisfactory. The bed was comfortable and the room had plenty of space for us and our luggage. There was even a separate Wii room, that had a TV and a Wii, and you could borrow free of charge Wii games (and movies as well). the bathroom was large and had a nice shower and plenty of vanity space. Great location, easy walk to the tube and Covent Garden. Lots of bars and restaurants, as well as theatre's, as it is in the Theatre district. Absolutely recommend this hotel!",5,2012,09,12
125,Gone down hill,"This is the third time I have stayed here, and this time, I was disappointed. the hotel looks shabby! for a hotel that prides itself on its funkiness....well now it's just shabby once you get above the lobby. walking along the corridors to your room used to be darkened lights which added to the groove, now it seems to highlight the carpet that needs desperately to be replaced and the paint that's shabby.
these guys are resting on their laurels.
the staff used to be super helpful, now they seem too cool to do their jobs. 
room service...chips were basically raw.
the cleaning staff were always in the room, but the cleanliness has gone downhill.
the power points are located in bad positions, u have to clim",2,2012,09,11
125,The perfect location,"This is a lovely hotel with an amazing position, a few minutes from Leicester square and covent gar garden. It is a very modern property, the reception area being very minimilistic, probably a little too minimilistic for my preference. Checking in was a pleasant experience, we did have to wait till 3 as the hotel was busy, but they took our bags no problem. 

The room was spacious for central London, the best part was a nice sized bathroom, not having a bath wasn't a problem.  The toiletries were great. The room also has sky sports, a bonus for me but not the mrs! the bed was very comfortable and the AC did its job. 

We ate at Asia De Cuba and had the taster menu. It was quite expensive at ¬£60 pp plus service but it was amazing, as was the service. Most people sat near us shared a starter and main.

We also had breakfast and that too was outstanding. I the minute steak which was lush.

Overall a great experience.",4,2012,09,06
125,Good location. Overpriced for what it is.,"Stayed 2 nights for my final leg of my trip.
Location is simply amazing. I cant even begin to describe how central and good it is.
Watch out though when trying to find it as no name is marked and no numbers so I walked past it more than once in my 'jetlag' state of mind.
Checkin was good, speedy and friendly. I had a lovely australian girl and she was a pleasure to deal with. I had a few questions the next day with a gentleman and it was not so good. Imagine he was having a bad day...
The hotel itself is very cool to look at. Very very modern which I loved. Great lifts and mood lighting.
I had a patio room. So my own courtyard which was nice. The room is very oddly designed. Its big but no room so people may find it frustrating as I did as I had more than one suitcase and was tripping over them to go to the toilet or shower. The shower and toilet are in the middle of the room on opposite sides. You could not do more than a few nights in this room. But I still enjoyed it. Its super clean.
I have to make mention of the front doormen who look like they belong at a nightclub (big and burly) they were so helpful and so much fun! running up the street to get me a cab was over and beyond.. loved them so much! thanks to them!
The thing that got me about this hotel is its 5star but no Free Wifi - its 10 pounds a day! insane when you think its free in many cafes in europe and even other 5 star hotels in London.
There are no tea/coffee making facilities if thats what you like - you have to get roomservice which charges for delivery AND gratuity so be warned a 18pound burger ends up being 25 when all added up. 
Although a special note, on checkout I was allowed the extra hour with no charge so that was nice.
Overall there are better options for the price but if location is your thing then you cant beat it. ( it's perfectly located for Shaftesbury Avenue, Covent Garden,Soho and shopping in Regent Street).",3,2012,09,06
125,Great location,"Service was ok, food was ok. Breakfast was excellent and location was pure perfection. The big minus for me was the size of my room. I couldn't even get in with my bag and had to climb over the bed to get  to the bathroom. Expensive cocktails but worth it because the golden bar was amazing. Nice walk from Soho nightclubs.",4,2012,09,05
125,Not your parent's hotel,"From the moment you walk in, the St. Martins is cool, smooth, and modern.  Our room had lots of chrome, smooth white furniture, and clean lines.  The tiny alarm clock seems to say this is not a business hotel.  The bathroom was tops -- great water pressure, good heat, and the sink/toilet were also designed to be both functional and fit in with the design.  Comfortable beds and great TV service were also plus factors.  You also can't the neighborhood.  Would certainly think about staying there again.",5,2012,09,04
125,excellent service,"My wife and I stayed at this Hotel, last weekend for a two night stay, we were delighted at how well placed it is, they also have a very good concierge service which we used constantly, we will certainly re visit this Hotel soon",5,2012,09,02
125,Great location amazing staff especially martin the doorman,"This location is fantastic and the staff very helpful the only thing a little annoying is the noise on friday and saturday night if you are on the street first floor.
If you need anything just ask Martin the doorman he is just amazing.",4,2012,09,01
125,What a great hotel,"I treated my girlfriend to 4 nights at this hotel. We were upgraded to a room with a treadmill. The design is modern, and the bathroom is awesome! The whole experience was just romantic. The concierge guy helped me arrange a romantic evening in the room for my girlfriend, coupled with wine, rose petals and candles everywhere. Location is great and service as well, although a bit pricey. Will return.",5,2012,08,31
125,A special weekend,"We stayed for a weekend and I had asked for lots of speical little touches beforehand which the consierge was very helpful with and they all worked on time.  Check in staff excellent, car parked for us and returned qucikly, room comfortable, bright and clean.",5,2012,08,28
125,One of my favorite Hotels in London!,"Its one of the nicest Ian Schrager hotels I have ever been to. I have probably stayed here 20+ times and never had a bad experience. Huge rooms, comfortable beds and clean bathrooms. Its a modern hotel as you would expect, but still classy. 

The breakfasts are the best I have had in London. Asia de Cuba is simple excellent, would eat there every time I stay with them. 

Good service and connections for good clubs and restaurants through concierge. 

Good location.",5,2012,08,26
125,Great service,"We stayed at St Martins for one Saturday night after looking at loads of different hotels.  We've stayed at their sister hotel, the Sanderson, and were a little disappointed with how small the rooms were and also that the restaurant had changed just before going.  St Martins was a much better experience.  We arrived quite early (10am) but we were able to check in and were offered an upgrade to a deluxe loft room which was great.  The staff at reception (Ed and Matt) were great and they explained exactly where we were located so that we could get to the places we were going to visit.  The room was quite large, painted white throughout and it had a bath and a separate shower.  The lobby was very trendy, with plenty of seating.  The only slight niggle would be that there is only one bar and it was very busy in the early evening.  We managed to get a table but the service was quite slow (20 mins to get a drink) and if we'd known we probably would have made a reservation.  That said, it's a small negative and the overall stay was very good.  Final point - it's perfectly located for Shaftesbury Avenue, Covent Garden and shopping in Regent Street.",4,2012,08,26
125,Most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.,My experience at St Martins Lane was generally good.  The location was great - walking distance from lots of shopping & attractions.  The lighting was a bit trippy.  Some of the decor in the room and lobby felt a bit over the top (trying too hard to be trendy).  The best part - the bed.  I slept 10+ hrs my first two nights there because it was just that comfortable.  I had to drag myself out of bed to go out in one of my favorite cities in the world.,4,2012,08,24
125,Crazy bathroom,"In the ""Standard"" room layout there is no door to the bathroom only a separator which separates the main room (bedroom) from the front door/closet area/bathroom. To enter or exit the hotel room you have to pass through the bathroom. This made orchestrating use of the bathroom between my wife and I very complicated. Being unable to re-enter the hotel room without walking through the bathroom while someone is using it is a pretty big problem. Being unable to leave the room while someone is using the bathroom without walking through it as well.

The floor of the shower is flush with the floor of the bathroom. As a result water leaks out of the shower into the bathroom floor. Evidence of this can be seen as all of the wooden pieces of the bathroom that touch the floor are warped and water damaged (shelving, legs of the sink table). Additionally, the shower head in the shower faces the shower door and can't be aimed elsewhere. This results in either water spraying through the gaps in the door, or that while showering one must stay between the shower head and door at all times to prevent water from spraying into the bathroom.

Finally, the bathroom sink has the wrong faucet for the bowl style installed. The sink bowl is designed for a sink faucet that is much taller. With the short sink faucet you have in the bathroom, the result is that there exists only a 1 cubic inch area of space that one can wash one's hands or use the sink since the faucet is about an inch away from the bottom of the bowl.

In summary, the bathroom design is so poor that it basically makes what would be an otherwise extremely beautiful and comfortable hotel an unacceptable option when I next stay in London.",2,2012,08,24
125,The most trendy hotel in London with a great location,"Just came back from 4 nights staying in St Martins Lane London. When we get a hotel for a vacation, one of the most important things that we consider is the great location.  This way, you can stop by the hotel quickly to change outfit or to take a quick nap if needed. St Martins Lane is right next to Covent Garden where a lot of shops and restaurants are around.  The nearest subway station (they call it ""Underground"" there) was Leicester Square (only two blocks away) from the hotel but the Covent Garden stop was not far from there either. 

There is a small 24 hr day super market on the same block which allows you to get some water and fruit anytime you need. Since it is also a theater area, there are a lot of lunch special and early dinner specials in the near restaurants. The price is 9~14 pounds which are pretty good for the food you are getting. All the restaurants that I've eaten in London were all great without fail. I've been spoied living in NY for all sorts of great food from all over the world, so you can take my word for it! 

This hotel's interior design is simply amazing! When you walk into the hotel, you will feel like that you are in a modern museum exhibition.  The isles to your hotel room has some orange light from the bottom wall make the isle look like a catwalk runway. The hotel room is pretty small but it was made very effectively. However, be aware that the ceiling is particulary very low, so if you woud feel confined with lower ceiling, you should give a second thought.

One thing that you should aware: You will need to pay 10 pounds a day for a wifi service. On the description for the hotel, it said ""Wifi available"", so we automatically thought that it is INCLUDED in the deal. But, it meant it is available so if you want, you will need to pay - that's what it meant! 

All in all, I had a great time staying there and highly recommend the place.",5,2012,08,23
125,Chic and stylish. Perfect for our anniversary.,We stayed one might in a deluxe double. Fantastic room. Amazingly comfortable bed (and we have a tempur mattress at home) and extras like the wii in the bedroom and complimentary drinks made for a perfect stay. ,5,2012,08,21
125,Tired.. not 5 Star!!,"Stayed here for a birthday weekend.... Staff attentive at reception and the porter, however it went downhill from then....!! Very modern hotel which is fine....  as is my house....However as you walk into the foyer you will notice a very grubby looking limestone floor and paintwork in need of refreshing. Got to room which although upgraded to Deluxe King was dissapointing. Carpet grubby, chipped paintwork and for a 5* no sign of a coffee machine!! Towels small and scratchy, and considering it is a Starck establishment I would not expect the toilet to be the cheapest thing I have seen, no sign of Duravit!!Boasted Down pillows but on inspection were feather and rather hard... Corridors had grubby carpets that had seen better days and the ceiling looked so dented that it could have been from a scene from Die hard!! Desperately trying to be modern which is easy with a tin of white paint if you don't look beyond!! Bar good... as were the cocktails , but then you would expect that for ¬£13.50 a time!!
Breakfast in Asia da Cuba ok but service not great...asked 3 times for a coffee!!... Overall... apart from attentive reception staff choose another 5 * that is worthy and not resting on the trendy vote!!",4,2012,08,19
125,"Great location, pity about the service.","My boyfriend and I were after a romantic weekend in London and got a last minute deal at the St Martin's Lane Hotel.

It's fabulous central London location meant that we were able to pack loads in & all within walking distance - boat trip on the river from Embankment Pier, National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's in the Field and the opera at The Colloseum a few doors down.

The hotel bar is very trendy, which means it was very busy on Friday and Saturday night - even as residents we couldn't get a reservation for a table and so had to stand. The cockails were delicious, but so they should be at those prices! Similar story with the restaurant, Asia de Cuba, though we were able to get a reservation on the Friday night. The food was great - if you like fish, you'll be happy here. The service was a bit hit and miss e.g. We would have had desserts had the waitress actually come back to take our order! Instead we walked out and had champagne from the mini bar for dessert instead! As usual in London, breakfast wasn't included, but there's plenty of options nearby - Brown's does good Eggs Benedict! 

The room was very sleek and stylish. The bedroom was a little on the small side, though the bathroom was a good size with a shower that was big enough for two!",4,2012,08,19
125,still one of the best creative designer hotels in the world,"comfort, breakfast, scene, design, architecture and above all a great service! I can write the longest review to tell you how good the hotel is, but i decided to say its seriously one of the best hotels in worlds - in all aspects. if you can afford it, with no doubt its the place to be in london.",5,2012,08,19
125,"Great hotel, great location","Just returned from a 2 night break and had to write a review immediately to say how much my husband and I had enjoyed our visit to this hotel.  We usually like a traditional hotel with afternoon tea etc. but from the moment we arrived  we knew we had made the right choice. The friendliness of the reception staff, and Gary who showed us to our room and explained the lighting etc., made us feel very special.  The breakfast was a great bonus and very well served.  The location must be the best in London able to walk to a vast majority of the major sites. St Martins lane itself had some lovely restaurants and a continental feel to it, even though it was only round the coner from the hustle and bustle of Leciester Square.  Hope to return again on our next trip to London.",5,2012,08,19
125,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here on a weekend and really enjoyed it. The rooms are typical of the Schrager hotel group, all white, very clean and comfortable. We stayed in a corner room with floor to ceiling windows and the view over Covent Garden was great and despite it being winter our room had lots of daylight.",5,2012,08,14
125,Great modern boutique hotel in excellent location in the heart of London,Very modern and trendy hotel. Excellent in all aspects. Generally better for the trendier design oriented with design taking precedence over comfort. Rooms comfortable but a bit small. The hotel does keep the air conditioning on at high levels so it can be cold in the corridors and most people need to adjist their room temperatures. The breakfast is excellent.,4,2012,08,11
125,Amazing hotel,"The hotel is fantastic,specially for those who apreciates Phillppe Starck's style.The rooms are so stylish and futuristic,with glass wall from the floor to ceiling.There are well trained and frindly concierges.The location is excellent,so close to the best attractions.The Asia de Cuba restaurant and the light bar inside the hotel are stunning and both are great options to have a nice night.The entire staff is very helpful,polite,frindly and patient.I really enjoyed it!!!",5,2012,08,09
125,Very nice hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights, alone in london for work, room clean and nice, and nice size bath, very comfortable beds and nice room decor.

The food in Asia de Cuba is really good, and the staff are polite and helpful, great location near the subway,",4,2012,08,08
125,great location and excellent service,"We have stayed here o several occasions ad have always felt that the experience definately provides good value for money i such sensational surroundings where staff always give you the feel that they enjoy working there.

The bar area is great, serves good cocktails, has a friendly feel and stays open till late to allow you to carry on the evening if you so desire.

Would definately recommend this to friends and Business colleagues in the future.",4,2012,08,08
125,Just perfect,"Stayed in the Hotel for 3 nights during the Olympics. It is a modern hotel with all the facilities you need in a hotel. Nice rooms and bathrooms, excellent breakfast buffet with seperate menu for eggs and some other plates. All the personell is very friendly and they have a great cocktail bar. 
Location is on walking distance of a lot of London's touristical attraction and the shopping area.",5,2012,08,08
125,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We stayed in this hotel during the Olympics at a very busy time, we loved it, the hotel is very chic and the staff were just wonderful,nothing was a problem to them.  We were on the fourth floor and had a great view over the roof tops. The location is one of the best I have stayed in London and will definitely stay there again in the future. The Hotel restaurant was very good with a great variety to eat.  Would give this hotel five stars.",5,2012,08,06
125,Chic hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for one night, Saturday 21st July with husband. Booked a secret escape through lastminute.com, double room for ¬£175. We normally stay in 4 and 5 star hotels and have fairly high expectations these days.
The hotel was very easy to find, 2 minutes from Leicester Square tube station, although I didn't notice the hotel name on the outside of the building so had to ask the doorman.
At check in we were greeted by a very friendly lady who promptly checked us in, we took up the offer of an upgrade to a deluxe double with a bath. The bath alone was worth the extra ¬£40, it was huge with great toiletries. 
The room was very spacious, big corridor to main room, massive bathroom with separate loo and shower and a separate dressing/wardrobe area. The bedroom area was also big with a king-size bed which was one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in (second only to the Kings Hotel, Christchurch because of its 10cm down mattress topper). Loved all the white walls, furniture and bedding too.
Also at check in we were given a free shot voucher to be redeemed at the bar. After a day out and about we returned to the hotel for a cocktail only to be asked for a reservation. This took me by surprise as I didn't even think we'd need a reservation to have a drink. It wasn't a problem we were seated and had two amazing mojitos and two complimentary strawberry cheesecake shots. They cocktails were a bit expensive at ¬£31 for two in my opinion but I guess we were paying for the location.
We didn't use the restaurant for dinner or breakfast so cannot comment.
Overall a top hotel in a great location, for the right price would definitely return.",5,2012,07,31
125,Poor service in an otherwise nice hotel,"I'll start with the good.
Location: can't be beat in terms of being central and close to tube stations.  
Rooms: definitely on the small side of things, but modern and funky, which I liked
The bar: fun overpriced drinks in a people-watching setting.

Now the bad. 
Service: worst of any hotel I've ever stayed in anywhere in the entire world.  The staff takes the opinion that it's a privilege for you to be a guest at their hotel.  Nah, it's the other way around. When I asked for a shift manager after an attendant refused to hail a taxi for me, the shift manager started yelling at ME!!!???  Not once in my 300+ or so hotel stays have I ever been yelled at by a staff member.  Never again.  Never any Morgans Hotel Group properties again after this experience.  

The hotel takes the opinion that it's ok to be dismissive to as many customers as they like since enough people have good opinions of their other North American properties to keep the rooms full in their own hotel.  Not so.  This hotel should be promptly banished from the group because it gives legitimately nice hotels like the Mondrian and Delano a bad name.  

If you're a customer who values exemplary service, this is not the hotel for you.  If you're just looking for location in a modern-ish hotel and expect to be treated rudely by the hotel staff, then this might be a good fit for you.",2,2012,07,29
125,We loved this hotel,"We stayed at St-Martins Lane during our first stay in London and we must say we absolutely loved this hotel. Up from the start we received impeccable service from the staff and the doorman could not have been nicer.

Upon arrival in our room, we received very nice attentions and the room was as expected: clean, comfortable, modern with vast windows and interesting lighting.

We did not try the bar or restaurant but the lobby is lively at night and both spots seem like they draw a crowd. The music playing throughout the hotel was always enjoyable and the modern decor and ambient lighting gives it an interesting touch.

But most importantly, this hotel is perfectly located. It it makes it so easy to enjoy Soho and explore London. We loved this hotel because the price was right, we had no complaints about the room, the personnel was lovely, the hotel was buzzing and the spot was perfect.",4,2012,07,29
125,Very nice,St Martin's hotel is very nice and would be particularly appealing to those who like very modern and minimalist design. Rooms are a little on the small side but have everything you need! Great location and really nice bar for evening drinks.,4,2012,07,23
125,Good but not good enough!,"St Martins is a well situated hotel with some style, in it's Lobby and restaurant areas, at least. Our standard room offers a comfortable bed but in very tight space with little room to stow luggage, or hang clothes. A basic table offers stationary but no pen? The tv is malfunctioning so cant tell you of the choice! Wifi is extra ¬£10/day which is miserly at these prices!  The bathroom is well designed, but as with the room, there are quite nice, but high priced items to use if you wish. A single traveller is better served here, rather than a couple. We have better alternatives in London at this price point and would not recommend this hotel because of that.

",3,2012,07,19
125,Highly Recommend for casual or business travellers,"I am a frequent business traveller and spend a lot of time in London.  In the past, I've stayed at the larger chains.  A few years ago, I discovered St. Martins based on a recommendation of a colleague. I stay there every few weeks, and from my first stay there in 2008/2009 through as recently as my last trip last week, the service is A+.  Location is fantastic, staff is friendly, rooms are extremely clean (although some are smaller than others, this is really a small concern given all the other pluses).",4,2012,07,18
125,A Perfect Location,"I've stayed in both this hotel and the Sanderson over the years and i have never been disappointed. The location is brilliant, the staff are attentive and friendly and the rooms are the most relaxing I have come across. 
The beds are comfortable with the best pillows I've used in a long  time. Ok my one gripe with this hotel is the lack of tea and coffee facilities - I feel churlish as Starbucks is literally across the road and open most of the time...but not late at night or very early morning. 
The stunning Philippe Starck's designs are out of this world and a pleasure to see. Both the restaurant and room service offer a great selection of foods.
The location is brilliant, Soho, the West End and Covent Garden all within a short walk. 
A perfect stay and I cant wait til I go again",5,2012,07,17
125,not a five star hotel,"very poor service, 3 people behind reception either talk to each other or on the telephone and let me wait for almost 10 minutes. room is exceptionally small (and cold, remote control for air condition had to be searched for). i booked the room for gbp 394.8 per night, at the end they billed my credit card with a room fee of 475. after complaining via email, no one seems to care or even read their mails. no response after 4 days, nothing. how can this be a five star hotel?",1,2012,07,17
125,So good. So so good.,"Amazing staff, incredible designer rooms, every comfort taken care of, sleek interiors. I just loved this place. Hip, fun, lively and cool - the rooms are comfortable and practical, the restaurant great value and delicious, the bar fun and open late-ish. Great position in London town too. Super.",5,2012,07,15
125,Great trendy hotel in fun location!,"Recently stayed in London for 3 nights and I absolutely loved this hotel... The hotel is located in very fun neighborhood.. Close to Covent Garden, Leicester square and soho.  Easy to walk to all the main sights and very close to the tube!  Staff is extremely helpful and friendly.. Great bar scene at hotel... My only complaint is that the hotel room is very small, but that's europe for you!!!",5,2012,07,13
125,Nice hotel but TINY rooms,"I was really excited to stay here on a recent business trip, having eaten in the restaurant a number of times. However I was utterly disappointed as its just not worth the money. Having stayed at the cheaper and nearby Covent Garden Hotel recently I had high expectations (which just weren't met).
Firstly on arrival my room was just TINY. I could barely get my suitcase (not to mention smaller case) in the room. I had to fully unpack and stash the case under the desk! A first for me.
In addition there's no gym - which you expect for a hotel of this price and calibre. You have to use the one next door which has really poor opening times on the weekend. 
On the up side the breakfast was nice (if overpriced), the staff are great and get a DVD movie as they deliver free popcorn with it.
But really? I won't be going back its just not worth the money.",4,2012,07,13
125,Nice boutique hotel near Trafalgar Square/National Gallery,"I wound up at St Martins Lane as part of package deal for a quick weekend getaway to London.  I was very happy with the hotel.  The travel agency (affiliated with an airline) screwed up my reservation, so the hotel wasn't expecting me when I arrived.  The travel agency was unavailable due to a holiday, but once that I could show that in theory I had a reservation the hotel put me in a room right away. After an overnight flight from the US, I greatly appreciated the hotel not exacerbating the agency's mistake.   I think they still hadn't straightened things out with the agency a few days later when I left, but they never bugged me about it.  

My room was excellent.  I beleive I got upgraded or something because I suspect the room I was in (some sort of loft-type room) cost a multiple of what I paid.  Once again no hassles from the staff.  My rate included a full english breakfast, which was really good.  One night I had room service for dinner--this was excellent.  I think the food must have come from the highly regarded Asia de Cuba restaurant in the hotel.   I had been consuming a lot of steak so I ordered the chicken--probably the best chicken I ever had.

Hotel was very sleek/modern, btw.  I believe Phillipe Starck designed it.  Cool bar off the lobby.",5,2012,07,13
125,great hotel night,"Great hotel, brilliant staff and great food.  Lovely rooms.

Located next to Trafalgar Square.  It doesn't come any better.  Will stay again.",5,2012,07,13
125,Continues to Maintain High Standards & Stay Funky/Cool,"My second stay. The high levels of service with people clearly empowered, natural, helpful and attentive. Spent 5 nights and built good relationships with the door and reception teams who were happy to connect with guests. The same with the Asia de Cuba team for breakfast and dinner. We had a great time at Asia de Cuba, two memorable dinners in particular with exceptional food and a great wine list. Knowledgeable staff . 

The hotel keeps its high standards and after staying at both Sanderson and St Martin's, Morgans Group continues to keep those levels high.

Congratulations and see you again soon",4,2012,07,13
125,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for one night in room 419, which was a lovely corner room with a view. Check in was quick enough, although I was rather concerned when the lady printed off the form I had to sign detailing my room etc, it had completely the wrong address and other personal details on against my name! The form had the address and details of somebody from the USA on it. That was however quickly rectified and I soon made my way up to the room.

When I entered the room there were four complimentary macaroons and a handwritten note welcoming me to the hotel, which was a nice touch. Also had a call from reception within a few minutes asking if everything was to my liking.

Bed was comfortable, shower was nice with a decent pressure. No kettle in the room as mentioned by previous reviewers, but this wasn't a problem as one call to reception and a free coffee was soon on its way up. Everything else I could have possibly required was however there, iron, hairdrier etc. There is also a Starbucks directly outside if you do want lots of tea/coffee or a hot choc. Toiletries in the bathroom were seemed very nice (Malin & Goetz).

I was also handed a couple of free cocktail vouchers for the Lightbar which was also a nice touch. Couldn't comment on the food in the restaurant as I didn't eat in there. 

Overall I was happy with my stay and would happily return. If I were to nitpick I would say that the floor area to the elevators behind reception looked a bit grubby, but perhaps that isn't a massive surprise as I imagine the area gets a lot of people walking on it every day. Recommended.",5,2012,07,09
125,Uber cool hotel in the heart of London,Stayed at St Martins first weekend in July and loved it. Rooms are a vision in white; white walls and crisp white bed linens. Lots of natural light and well stocked bathrooms make it a must stay. Great to have the option of purchasing a razor or forgotten ammenities (even a clean T-shirt - in white of course!). Staff are professional and friendly - that our room was ready at noon was a bonus. Bar and restaurant are quite fabulous and worth a visit just to check the design. Only negative which is obviously not St Martin's fault were the unsupervised kids loudly sprinting up and down the corridor past our room early Sunday morning.,5,2012,07,09
125,Great location with exquisite breakfast,"Location is excellent, both for tube and Covent Garden. Starbucks right over the door.
Excellent breakfast, not as good as Mandala in Berlin but very good eggs Benedicte.
Expensive small rooms and bar however.",3,2012,07,09
125,Stay here!,"My husband and I stayed at St Martin‚Äôs Lane for the last night of our honeymoon. We had both lived in London so knew it well but had never stayed in such a central location. The staff were incredibly helpful from the outset and there was no hint of pretention which I‚Äôd been a little concerned about. Our room was upgraded and we found rose petals and champagne in our room ‚Äì a fantastic touch. The concierge was really helpful and gave the impression this hotel was perfect for younger people who liked to have a good time ‚Äì this fits our description and it‚Äôs the first time a hotel has really acknowledged that. I wish we‚Äôd had more time here so we could have dined in the restaurant and checked out the gym. Next time! The room was stunning, the products and bed were heavenly. Go and stay here if you can! A perfect end to our honeymoon.",5,2012,07,08
125,Best experience of London yet!,"As a native Londoner I like to regularly treat my city as a tourist would, so assessing hotels has become a bit of a hobby. St Martins Lane had the warmest welcome, the staff were sensitive to all I required and the location is perfect for all London has to offer. My room was luxurious without being oppressive. Faultless!",5,2012,07,07
125,Amazing Time Yet Again,"Warm welcome from all the front of house staff, great location and luxurious rooms.  Everyone I dealt with here couldn't have been more helpful.  I'll definitely be back.",5,2012,07,07
125,Calm in the centre of Chaos,"A lovely three night stay in the centre of London. It was fabulous to be able to have a luxurious base to head to in between daytime excursions and evening socialising.

The staff were friendly, professional and funny, without any of the attitude that you might expect, or have experienced elsewhere in Britain.  It really is the staff that make a place like this.  

The hotel is still pretty funky and the rooms slick. However, they don't seem to have changed the decor much since first opening in 1999 so it may be time for a bit of a refresh.",4,2012,07,04
125,Loved St. Martin's Lane.,"Stayed at St. Martin's Lane for a week on business in May 2012.  Loved the hotel and would gladly return for a vacation.  Was very warmly greeted and received an upgrade due to the length of my stay.  Room was very large and comfortable, and loved the adjacent gym next, which hotel guests can use for free.  Hotel is steps from Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden; it is an exceptional location.  I would happily stay at St. Martin's Lane again and would gladly recommend it to everyone.",5,2012,06,30
125,Excellent location!,Gorgeous rooms and a perfect location- will definitely be returning!,5,2012,06,29
125,Poor customer service,"The physical hotel is in a good location within London and is modern and well presented to a physical standard that would not disappoint.  Unfortunately during an overnight weekend stay on returning to the hotel late in the evening, my small party and I were spoken to in a rude and condescending manner.  Rasing this with the duty hotel duty manager at the time, I was advised to raise the incident with the actual hotel manager.  Having attempted to raise my concerns formally directly with the hotel, I find it disappointing that the hotel manager has not had the decency to even acknowledge my concerns with some form of apology.  In summary, a reasonably nice hotel overshadowed with poor customer service.",2,2012,06,27
125,"Chic, modern, and convenient!","I stayed at this hotel in December 2011 for a week. The hotel is so close to everything! Here's what I loved about it:

Bedroom
I loved how the bedroom area is neat and clean. The white theme made the room look spacious. Oh, if you're bored with the white theme, you can change the lighting to a different color. Lovely!

Bathroom
I loved how large it was. I loved the bath amenities-- quality products! And I loved how the candles in the bathroom were lit at the turndown! Nice touch! The closet area also has ample space.

Fitness
I workout even when I travel. I loved how St Martins Lane offered a free membership at Gymbox right next door. They have great equipment! If for some reason you can't make it to Gymbox, the hotel also has a little gym as well.

Restaurant
We had dinner at the restaurant one night. They offered a pre-show menu as well. The prices were very reasonable. The food was also tasty. I ordered room service a couple of nights and the food was pretty good. I loved the decoration of the restaurant as well. Avoid the peak hours if you can. It can be very loud. And yes, the restaurant gets filled up during peak hours!

Location
Needless to say, this hotel is close to everything. It's right next to Gymbox. Starbucks is right across the street. Restaurants and theatres in the area. Loved it!

Staff
The staff was nice, professional, and chic. Differently the place to stay!",5,2012,06,25
125,Exceptional,"My first stay at this stylish 5 star city centre was quite a revelation. From the incredibly friendly welcome on arrival to the prompt attention at check out, everything was pretty much perfect. The one existing memory I will never forget was sleeping in the most wonderfully comfortable hotel bed I have ever experienced. It was sensational: so much so that I have already contacted the manufacturer to see if I could buy one! 
The location is pretty much perfect for access to anywhere in the city and, whilst the hotel is located in a busy street, inside it was a haven of calm and tranquility. The white minimalist styled bedroom was perfectly appointed with so many little special touches which added to the experience. 
The Asia de Cuba Restaurant requires no comment as its reputation precedes it. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the service was friendly, stylish and just perfect for the style of venue. 
I will certainly look forward to returning to this lovely hotel on  my next trip to London and would recommend it without any hesitation whatsoever.",5,2012,06,25
125,For me it felt like home,"Love this hotel and try and stay here every time in London beware of being allocated a room low down at the back as kitchen noises travel and putting the rubbish out at 6 am 

this hotel always puts me in a good mood , the staff are great and helpful , its a true 5 star
not a pretender , its position is fantastic as not far from everything :) , certain rooms are great as you can see nelsons statue , decor is funky, staff are great , its just the place to stay",5,2012,06,20
125,"Once again, a wonderful stay!","My boyfriend surprised me with another stay in St Martins Lane end of februari 2012. I think he asked for a ""romance deal"" or something like that. When I entered the room, I felt like I was in a movie (Things like that don't happen in real life, just in movies ;-)) The entire room (and bathroom) was lit with candles, rosepetals covered the entire room, nice chilled bottle of bubbles , ... the mood was set! (so guys... if you want to surprise your gf with a romantic stay... ask for their ""love - romance - package"" ;-))
Again we got a very comfortable bed, hotel staff was friendly as always, housecleaning very good (because we were often in a rush to leave, i left the room with all of my beautyproducts all over the place... I even felt bit guilty afterwards of leaving the bathroom looking like bombs have been exploded in there. After coming back it was nice to see they took care of the mess I made). 
I don't think I got any bad comments to leave for this place...",5,2012,06,19
125,Highly Recommended,"I stay at St Martins Lane Hotel everytime I am in London, and so for a variety of reasons. 
Firstly, the location is perfect in central London ‚Äì walking distance from almost everything. There is almost no need for the tube or cab ‚Äì most of the shopping and nightlife is around the corner. 
Secondly, the rooms are right up my alley, and decorated to my liking - minimalistic, crisp and comfortable. Beds are perfect, bathrooms are elegant with excellent supplies, and the turndown service is brilliant. Would however enjoy in-room coffee/tea making facilities. 
Thirdly, the personnel, who are always friendly, attentive and extremely efficient. In particular, Marcin and Ed, who makes me feel more than welcome each time I arrive, and almost makes me guilty for leaving! Gabor has been more than patient and accommodating, friendly, and always seems to keep his cool.
This hotel is definitely highly recommended!",5,2012,06,19
125,Absolutely wonderful - didn't want to leave,"At stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel for 3 nights on business.  The rooms were small but not claustrophobic - they were extremely comfortable and clean, bathroom bigger than most and the beds were great!! The hotel location was amazing.  You are placed right in the heart of the theatre district, near the National Portrait Gallery (a can't miss), Trafalger Square, and a short walk to the Palace.  The best part though - it was quiet - no outside noise. The staff was excellent and attentive.  The breakfast was great as well.  

I highly recommend this hotel, you won't be disappointed.",5,2012,06,18
125,Divine bedding,"Stayed here for 2 nights on business. 

The room is very simple (which I like!) with great mood lighting. Gorgeous shower room with fabulous products. Note that the shower room/toilet does not have a direct door - so if travelling with a newish partner be aware. There is a door from the bedroom to the hall/wardrobe area though

The bedding and bed was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo divine! I could have stayed in bed all day

Had a loud, what seemed like large group, in the room next door so did not sleep as soundly as I should have onb the first night

Try the cocktails in the Light Bar! Amazing

If you are looking for a swish central hotel, within walking distance to great shops and theatres, this is one to go for",4,2012,06,16
125,Great Location & hotel,"We arrived during the Jubilee celebrations really early. Our flight was really early and we arrived at the hotel at 7:30am and the front desk staff was extremely helpful and nice and gave us a room right away. She even upgraded us to a nicer room on the 6th floor and with a great view.
The rooms are small, with modern sleek decor and the view is totally worth it. The location couldn't be better, steps away from Covent Garden, the theaters and the national portrait gallery.
Surprisingly, for the noisy and vibrant location of the hotel, from our room we didn't hear any street noise in the evening.
Would totally stay here again in my next trip to London!",4,2012,06,15
125,"Beautiful interior, central location","Stayed here while in London for a short business trip. Although it can be a bit hectic in this area, the location is very central and the interior is very slick and modern, which is what I tend to enjoy when traveling for business. The lobby area is very unique and a great contrast compared to the streets just outside. Food at Asia de Cuba is nothing spectacular (in my opinion), but it is very convenient when staying at the hotel. So, from a business diner's perspective (expense acct), it is  great. 

Will most likely stay here again.",4,2012,06,15
125,Wedding Bliss,"We stayed for two nights over the weekend of our Civil Partnership as the venue was close by.  We had a number of guests staying as well including family.  The service was amazing, nothing was too much trouble and they made everyone feel special.

All the guests loved their rooms but our room was beautiful, we had loft room and it was perfect.  They'd even put some complimentary extras in our room for our arrival which added to the excitement of the weekend.

Having the use of Gym Box next door is great, got to work out some of the nerves before the big event, really cool gym.

The Location is great, especially for our family and friends who had come from outside London, you couldn't be any more in the heart of it if you tried.

Would recommend St. Martin's Lane to everyone.",5,2012,06,13
125,"Fantastic hotel, great location...","Regularly stay, and always enjoy the unique experience. The hotel is quite different from the bland business hotels I usually stay in and always relish my visits. Great food in the Asia de Cuba, and drinks in the Light Bar. Step out the door, and food, drink and entertainment surrounds you.",5,2012,06,12
125,Great Location,"We stayed at St Martin's Lane just before the Jubilee Celebrations for the weekend. I remember when this hotel opened and wondered how the upkeep on an almost entirely white interior would wear over the years, however I was pleasantly surprised. The Hotel has no name and is only distinctive by its perspex white/transparent glass exterior, coordinated with handsome doormen dressed in black ! Check in was friendly and smooth even though they were experiencing technical issues with the key card machines. Complimentary drinks vouchers were given for the Bar as well as access to GymBox fitness centre next door to the hotel. The rooms were as I remember them,(all white!) and bathrooms are very spacious and clean. There are no tea/coffee making facilities however a kettle can be delivered to your room if needed. A nice touch at turndown is the Tealights in the bathroom. Restaurant service for Breakfast was a bit hit and miss but all in all an extensive breakfast menu with a good spread of continental breakfast items. The Concierge was great and very friendly and assisted very efficiently with my questions. The location of this hotel is second to none in the heart of Covent Garden and minutes away from Leicester Square tube station. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a short break and would definately visit again.",4,2012,06,07
125,Fantastic yet again....,"We stayed here with our 2 boys aged 9 and 12 last year and it was amazing. We have stayed at many 5 star London hotels with our children and this hotel is not withstanding the very best in London. We booked to stay for 3 nights over the Jubileee weekend with my parents and all 3 generations had the most amazing time. It's trendy but not intimidating, the staff are wonderful from the maids to the reception to the door man and the security. Please could you thank all of your staff for superb service and making me and my family feel some welcome again. Their advice was spot on and it varied from when we should leave to see Coldplay in concert to the best place to stand to see the Queen. Five star all the way and we will be back soon.",5,2012,06,06
125,Fantastic hotel,"We love staying at this hotel, and during our last stay we even got a free upgrade to a wonderfull and slightly bigger room! The staff are very friendly and helpfull and the beds are fantastic, and it's really hard to leave then and to get out to explore the city!",5,2012,06,03
125,Wedding at St Martin's,"Our son was married at St Martin's on 26 May.  We all had the most wonderful day.  The staff could not do enough for us and worked extremely hard and were helpful, happy and cheerful throughout a long day.  The hotel is modern, very clean and the food at the wedding breakfast was outstanding.  I would thoroughly recommend holding a wedding here.",5,2012,06,01
125,Underwhelmed and dissappointed,"I found St Martins very disappointing for a 5 star hotel and it fell very short of our expectations. So much so that we actually left early. 

The room was very small, the toilet door did not lock (which I spent 10 minutes of my time fixing) the carpet was stained and there were no facilities to make a cup of tea?? You could however order one for ¬£3.50 plus ¬£3.50 delivery and 15% service charge. It felt like the hotel was trying to be 'Ultra Modern'....... it would have been...... In the 90's!! The bed was overshadowed by a large white cabinet which housed the fridge, TV and DVD player and it felt like we were being watched by a very large robot!!

Breakfast was Included in our stay thankfully as it was ¬£25 per person for a full English. They managed to get our breakfast order wrong the first time (2 full English) and when they got it right the 2 breakfasts were actually different?? 

The location was excellent but I don't feel that this should excuse the hotel spending a little money revamping the rooms etc. ",2,2012,05,28

125,"Location, Location, Location + Style and Service","This hotel, part of the Morgans hotel group, was for us the perfect place to be while in London.  It is well situated in the West End and within walking distance of many of London's great museums and popular tourist sights.  The staff, as is true with all of the Morgans' properties that I have stayed in, are well trained, engaging, helpful and friendly, always willing to try and accommodate a guests concern or need.  The hotel design is modern with a creative and whimsical spirit - not everyone's taste to be sure, but not boring!  Our room was a pleasure to be in.  Everything was well thought out and beautiful; the closet area apart from the sleeping area and concealed by a pleated curtain, the spacious and easy to use bathroom with separate shower and tub, the lighting was both soft, ambient and had utility as well.  We were happy in our room and took notes for ideas to use at home!  Breakfast was terrific - buying the breakfast package well worth it.  Given it's location and upscale feel and service this hotel is a good value.",4,2012,05,25
125,"Nice, clean hotel.","I had the pleasure of staying at the St Martin Hotel recently and i will agree with many who mentioned about how impressive the lobby way, def. got my attention there as well. Check-in was a breeze and the bell man was helpful to ensure i was settled in my room with ease. Housekeeping was great- fast service and very pleasant overall. 

1. Ok- on to the room, very clean, the bedding was VERY comfortable which i was most concerned with. Mood lighting was a great touch- perfect for those intimate moments. 
2. The view was ok but i def loving the floor the ceiling view out- absolutely a great view out of the day. 
3. The shower was clean and great water pressure. 
4. The door to the loo- when closing- somehow will drag on the floor to a secure lock- wasn't too impressed with due to the loud sound it makes during closing but overall- didn't bother me too much.

This is definitely a very Trendy Hotel and will appeal to more of the younger crowd and business travelers than leisure travelers. Even tho it didn't bother me much, i can see where a leisure traveler may think its too ""busy"" than being more relaxed.

I will say however, its very convenient to everything- from SOHO to Regent Street and Oxford to Big Ben and the Eye of London and Buckingham Palace- literally minutes! Oh yea for the clubb and bar hoppers like myself- mins walk!

I would def recommend as a place to stay for sure while in London and i will be def consider staying here again on my next holiday visit.",4,2012,05,23
125,Very trendy hotel in fab location,"Seriously trendy hotel near covent garden. Nice bar and fab rooms. I love the decor and the really nice toiletries in the bathroom. The complementary bottle of champagne was a nice touch also! Great location - handy for shops in covent garden, Chinatown and the west end.",4,2012,05,21
125,Good but not great,"Pros:  LOCATION- perfect, ideal, etc.  In the middle of everything.  One of the best restaurants, trendy night scene, cool vibe.  Staff was great.  Room service prompt, food very good.  Mood lighting and dimming in room great.  Loved having the outdoor patio.  Bed comfortable.  Bath products fabulous and size of bathroom is very nice.

Cons:  Hotel is getting outdated- time for a bit of a makeover in certain areas.  Walls thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallway outside the room.  Patio sleeping room wreaked of cigarette smoke - check your room first as you may require a move.  Lights take a while to figure out- 18 different buttons and lamps to work.  Marble floor in bathroom is VERY slippery- I nearly slipped and killed myself after getting out of the shower- be very careful!",4,2012,05,21

They were so very helpful and nothing was too much trouble, also smiling to greet you every time you walked through reception area. It makes such a difference to your stay.

125,Fab atmosphere & Excellent location for the colosseum!,"We booked this hotel from the advertisement on the reverse side of our Tosca opera tickets - Excellent location for the colosseum.

Staff extremely friendly & helpful

We received a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe King room - Gorgeous!

Returned to the hotel after the opera (around 11.30pm) feeling peckish. Even though the restaurant was full & we hadn't made reservations we were told our table would be ready shortly, so we had a sneaky drink in the funky bar while we waited.

Buzzy atmosphere & the food was delicious!

I would definitely stay & eat here again :-D",5,2012,05,14
125,Great Location - Little Pretentious,"Just back from 3 night stay.
Pros - best location ever, close to everything. Nice design to hotel. Standard room bright, airy, quiet at back, great shower and Malin + Goetz toiletries.
Cons - pretentious hotel and bar. Room sheet ripped with stain. Small things like no towel heater in bathroom a little annoying. 
Value - paid 200 quid per night on a deal. Much more expensive normally. Think I would go to Radisson next time ",4,2012,05,12
125,Great hotel. Great location.,"Spent four nights at the St. Martin's Lane in April.  The location is fantastic.  Easy access to bus/tube and close to lots of shops. restaurants, and bars.  It's does have a stark/modern design and the lobby area can get crowded or loud.  But if none of that will bother you than this is the perfect place to stay.",4,2012,05,11
125,GREAT Location GREAT service,"This is the 7th or 8th time we've stayed at St Martins Lane over the years. it's nice to see the same staff.. Location is excellent. First room was patio room and smelled terribly of cigarettes through and through (pillows and comforters). They moved us the next day to a delux room which was MUST better. Nice property great location, great staff, hard to get a great room though and definitely on the pricey side. Good location to tubes and major sites.  Will come back because it's familiar and we have good memories here. ",4,2012,05,11
125,Not sure about this place,"I should have loved it here but I didn't. I often visit the bar and Asia de Cuba restaurant but this is the first time I had actually stayed. Something is missing here. Service is okay, rooms are cool, hotel is hip and entrance is stunning. Bar trendy, restaurant lovely as mentioned. It's too cool, I think that's what it is. A group of us booked up for a big night out and wanted somewhere central. Location is really good right in the middle of everything. So I think the problem with this hotel is that other hotels are doing the hip/trendy concept better. It hasn't really evolved much during the time I've been coming. I know that's probably because it works but the rooms and the service need to be slightly more indulgent. It's too impersonal, service is a bit removed, bellboy non existent, no warm welcome, no little touches. I think I prefer a warmer experience all together, rooms are too bland and too small and staff are too wooden. London has millions of top hotels, you can definitely have a better experience for the same price or less. Not memorable at all.. Always wanted to stay, have stayed now moving on.",3,2012,05,08
125,Nice experience and not like any other hotel,"The hotel has a nice atmosphere - trendy and charming. 

It is good standard, but not top, but only because of small things such as a little hole in the linnen and the carpet in the hall seems tired.

The shampoo etc. in the bathroom is delicious.

We were given a voucher for the hotel bar when we arrived. So we headed for the bar one evening and we were given a tiny shot and in an instance the waiter asked if we wanted to order a drink. Not so charming. But the bar is lively and a nice place to hang out.

The hotel is well situated near Covent Garden.

All in all - small things and I would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,04,27
125,3 Nights in London,"Excellent hotel, close proximity to everything in London. Very friendly staff. Room was fantastic. We will be back. Loved it!",4,2012,04,26
125,Great design hotel in a perfect location,"I'm a big fan of trendy design hotels, so I wanted to stay at St Martins Lane Hotel.
Location is perfect, in the middle of Covent Garden, just a few minutes walking from two underground stations, Leicester Square and Charing Cross, and 3 minutes walking from the National Gallery. 

The lobby is beautiful, (I think it's Starck design), very trendy.

My standard queen room was nice, all white, very clean, with a very comfortable bed and top quality linens, but very small.

Light bar was not so busy, except on Saturday evening.

Good choice for breakfast (buffet).

Overall it's a great hotel, but probably less hype than the Sanderson hotel.",4,2012,04,25
125,"Gorgeous Hotel, Great Location, Glorious Time!","St. Martins Lane Hotel, was prob the best hotel experience I had while traveling to Europe. Their Concierge's are just lovely and will help you get any reservation or needs desired while on vacation. They are highly knowledgeable about the hot spots in London, and will bend over backwards to make sure you get what you want! We stayed in the Deluxe King room which was perfect! We got a great deal too bc of Easter Holiday! The shower was by far the best part of the room, great pressure as well as great free Malin and Goetz Soaps. The bed was also very comfy as well. The room service food was also delicious! Lastly this hotel was in the west end, but I must say the perfect location. Right down the street from buckingham palace, surrounded by all the exciting broadway shows, centerally located to all the shopping areas easily accessible by cab or tub. I loved staying here, and the next time I go back to london, I hope to stay there again! It is well worth your money! Enjoy and take my word, you will not be dissapointed!",5,2012,04,23
125,A night in london...,"Stayed for one night, good Friday. Note the hotel does not have its name on the building?
Good friendly welcome, as we arrived earlier than checkin we did not expect the room to be ready, howeve it was! Complimentary drink provided, wow...
The Room: Tiny but sufficient for a one night stay
Big let down: NO tea or coffee facilities, expensive room service, at least starbucks was right outside.
The Light bar, or should I say the Dark bar, long room actual bar closed but waitress service supplied. Used the complimentary drink voucher, it was a shot, not a choice of drink.

Dinner the AsiaCuba restaurant: we were with a large party, it was good food but overall I would say it was average, but would reserve full judgement as large party might not be the best way to judge the food.",3,2012,04,23
125,Upmarket,"I stayed at this hotel in an emergency in February with my wife. We turned up at the hotel at 1.00am on a Sunday morning with no reservation. The front desk was very helpful and was able to provide us with a room for the night.

The hotel is furnished very tastefully and it is clean and modern. The room was spacious and very comfortable. We were very grateful for getting a room at such short notice but there was a price to pay as it was expensive.",4,2012,04,23
125,Amazing Hotel,"I spent a week at St. Martin's Lane on a business trip in March.  I arrived very early on a Sunday AM, and Isabel at the front desk was extremely accommodating in finding me an available room for an early check in after my long flight from NY.  The hotel location is amazing, the rooms are very clean and modern, and all of the staff were very helpful.  My only complaint is that the bed was not very comfortable at all.  Very hard mattress.

Additionally, upon check out I accidentally left my mobile phone in my room, and Isabel sent me an email later that evening letting me know that I had left it and offered to send it to me back in the States.  Luckily, I was still in London, so I was able to retrieve it from the hotel.",5,2012,04,17
125,Carolyn the front desk supervisor needs more hospitality training,"Ok, so I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but quite honestly, I am so irritated with the hotel front desk supervisor named Carolyn...I must write a review while currently here.  Upon walking by the hotel after a dinner out, I noticed a familiarity with this hotel and realized the connection to The Mondrian in LA (the white color palette).  The doorman was personable and sincere, so after inquiring about a rate at the front desk, we booked the reservation the next day.  Let me say, EVERYONE from the check-in staff to the doormen have been superb.  It was only til about the third day things changed.  I realized I had received an email promotion (likely from my previous stay with the Morgan Group) that offered me a reduced rate for what I booked.  I call downstairs to use the promo, but this Carolyn informs me that if I want to use the promo, they'd have to downgrade my room and move my family to another room (sounds a bit like blackmail).  Let's see, I booked a standard double double, and this new rate is for a standard double double, no issue right.  Apparently not, she informs me that since they gave me a room upgrade, the courtesy doesn't extend with this new rate.  Huh?  I thought upgrades came with availability?  Or even gracious hospitality? Remember, ""the exceeding my expectations part""?
If corporate offices want to offer an incentive rate promotion and you have availability, the rate should be honored for what was booked-upgrade or not.  I imagine lower tier hotels would try this tactic, but because I really do appreciate everyone else's STELLAR performance, this hotel is definitely worth staying at...just try not to deal with Carolyn, she simply doesn't understand how hospitality works at this level.  Would have given it five stars had it not been for her and her ridiculous rationale that was borderline insulting.",4,2012,04,12
125,"Cool, young, trendy and fabulous!","I can't think of a better location then this!..the hotel is right in the middle of bustling London night life!...walking distance to all the theatres, restaurants and bars..
I loved the minimalist, modern furnishing throughout the hotel..The special lighting added an interesting atmosphere in the rooms...everything in my room was decorated in white. It was clean and efficient. The bathroom was very big compared to other 5 star hotels I have stayed in.The staff on the front desk were very informal in a good way, helpful, polite and friendly.
The amazing ""Light Bar"" with live music was fun and the cocktails were delicious...I definitely enjoyed my stay in here.
I just wish the price wasn't as high so that I could return more often!..",4,2012,04,10
125,Beautiful stay,"I booked this hotel as a special weekend away for my partner and I and after much research contacted St Martins. I dealt with someone called Andrew Crookston who made the stay amazing for us. 

Throughout the stay, the staff were very helpful and cheerful. In terms of location, you can't go wrong - right in the heart of the city. Once ou are in the room, the noise of the city disappears and the white, clean lines of the room really help you to relax. 

The hotel is a beautiful place to stay. To give you an idea of our taste, recently we have stayed at the Lindos Blu, Andels Prague etc and this hotel would certainly rate up there.

Thank you so much  to everyone member of staff who worked the Easter weekend - we had a memorable time.",5,2012,04,10
125,Stunning Hotel- Ideal Location,"My partner and I have stayed here on numerous occasions and we keep coming back. The hotel is not easily located for the busy London life but also a hidden gem.
The rooms are stylish but well equipped. We have eaten at Asia de Cuba the hotels resturant an absolute must! the food amazing and huge portions and the cocktails with it too are a defiante.
Visiting again in June hoping its still as amazing as we remember
Overall a stylish hotel high quality food and furnishings and you get what you pay for.",4,2012,04,08
125,All the Best,"When you stay at St. Martins Lane, you really do have all the best of London right at your feet.  The hotel location is excellent, the hotel staff is always welcoming--and always helpful and efficient in seeing to anything you need.  Had room service every night and it was always perfectly done.  Wake-up calls came on the dot. I used the Gym Box each day I was there as well as the free hotel service which washes your gym clothes and has them back to you in no time.  Room was always clean and made up after a long day out--lit candles always lovely to come back to.  Just a great hotel.",5,2012,04,06
125,Different in a funky way,"My husband & I stayed here recently as we were going out in London, love the reception area, very arty & funky so didn't mind being ignored by the receptionist at the empty check in desk...gave me time to take it all in. A very smiley guy came to check us in and was very helpful asking if we needed help making arrangements etc etc...
Corridors are rather dim lit up from the floor are to highlight the room numbers. Our room was nice & bright with everything we needed plus more...items for sale in the bathroom incase you've forgotten anything..including a cannabis candle! Ipod docking station which was great, & mood lights in different colours. Wifi was chargable at ¬£10 a day which was a bit off but hey. Had time before a quick drink before our show, bar was very busy with lots of reserved signs on tables so we now to prebook next time.....we didn't mind sitting at the bar. Glad we tried this hotel but didn't get excited about it...",4,2012,04,02
125,Friendly and Fabulous,"The staff were very friendly and efficient, the rooms were excellent, very smart, clean and comfortable.  Bathroom was well equipped and the bed very comfortable.  Were only able to stay the one night so unfortunately didn't get the chance to try out the bar and restaurant ... Wished we could have stayed another night or two!  Location is perfect for Covent Garden.  Love this hotel and would like to stay again.",5,2012,03,31
125,Seriously lacking for a five star hotel,"Having stayed at numerous top class hotels, I found this to be seriously lacking.

The location couldn't be better for a night in the west end for shows, etc, and the decor is very funky and great fun - however the service was very very mixed, and frankly offensive at points.

On arrival I was made to wait for a good twenty minutes to check in - there were only 2 people ahead of me but the staff were painfully slow.

Having been out in the evening we returned and wanted some drinks in the bar.  Initially we were given a ridiculously small table for 4 of us, and offered pathetic little stools to sit on, but then were moved once a better table became available.  Admittedly the bar was busy, so this couldn't really be avoided but it was done without an apology and we all knew the celebrities sat in the corner wouldn't have been treated the same way!

Having called ahead twice to inform the hotel that I am gluten intolerant and so they would need to let their kitchen know for breakfast, I was frankly amazed at what happened atbreakfast.  Having explained on arrival to the waiter that I was gluten intolerant I asked for some gluten free toast, and was then sent back by the chef apparently to ask if I can eat butter.  Gluten intolerancy might not be common, but I would expect a chef in a five star hotel to know it is in wheat and not in dairy products.  Having explained to the waiter what gluten is and that eating it can make me ill, I was then informed that there was no alternative to be provided to the normal breakfast menu (all of which was gluten-containing).  Upon asking to speak to a more senior member of staff I received an apology and some gluten free french toast eventually, but was left feeling slightly concerned as to whether it was indeed gluten free or not!

It wasn't only myself that had problems at breakfast - my Dad's eggs benedict had to be sent back as it was cold, and his girlfriend gave up trying to request cheese in her omelette after the waiter misheard it as toast for a third time...

After breakfast my family left and I remained in the room a little longer.  After approximately an hour, as I was getting out of the shower, housekeeping let themselves into the room without so much as a knock.  Having heard my shriek they left again, but I then received a rather abrupt phonecall from reception demanding that I identify myself - they had apparently thought the room had been vacated (despite the fact that i still had both room keys in the room) and were basically accusing me of some form of squatting.

When I left the hotel I did receive an apology for the interruptions to my morning and the accusatory phone call, and I was assured that the kitchen staff would be spoken to regarding their knowledge of common food allergies/intolerances, but I was still left feeling that the hotel takes its 5 star status for granted now, and has rather stopped putting in much effort unless you are currently in Heat magazine.",3,2012,03,25
125,"First trip to London, 1st class hotel !!!","I joined my wife in London, September 2010, on the tail end of her business trip and she was already booked at St Martin's Lane through her company. 

The location itself was wonderful, very close to everything including the Square, Theatres, Shops, excellent restaurants; just had a very good feeling about the area when I was there. I had no idea that the building itself was a hotel when I first approached it, although I had a heads up about its location. I was pretty wowed when I entered. The hotels front desk staff were very courteous and professional. The decor is really amazing, the elevator ride is quite the trip (in a stylish good way). The room was very clean, the bed was absolutley comfortable and I really liked the bathroom arrangement. 

I extremely was happy with my stay at St Martin's Lane. Thank you to all the staff, you do your jobs very well!",5,2012,03,24
125,In the middle of it all for those who like that,"I love the West End.  The Salisbury for a pint, Covent Garden up the street, Leicester Square a short walk away, the National Gallery at your fingertips.  Theater,  two opera houses, plenty of restaurants and a Starbucks across the street.  I can't think of a better location.  The staff is friendly albeit a bit too informal.  The rooms are tiny but who is hanging out in their room in one of the best cities in the world? I love the bar and the bar menu here. I travel alone for business so the enormous portions in Asia de Cuba don't work for me.  There are so many new hotels in London but I just csn't give up this place.",4,2012,03,22
125,"Super cool, certainly an experience","St Martin's Lane is cool, no doubting that. Once the taxi had dropped us off, we couldn't see any name at all on the exterior of the hotel so we just headed through a revolving door and hoped for the best. This hotel does things differently to most others. Reception doesn't loook like most hotel receptions you have seen. There is a seating area but it looks more like an art installation, I certainly never saw anyone using it ot sit in and I wouldn't have felt at all comofrtable trying to lounge and read my Sunday paper in it! Yes there are staff but as you're not sure at this point that you have actually arrived in the hotel and they have no name bades or hotel uniforms you remain a little unsure. However, the staff are very friendly and polite. They'll ask you all about why you are visiting and try and strike up a conversation about what you will be doing to enjoy yourself - which is all perfectly nice. They won't tell you how to get to the lift (the hotel really doesn't like signage so you need to ask how to find the lifts), they won't ask you if you want a newspaper in the morning (we went across the street next morning and bought one) and they won't ask you if you want a wake up call (there's an nice little alarm clock in your room). They certainly don't tell you that there are no numbers on the bedroom doors and it will take ages to work out that the room numbers are actually in the carpet on the floor by your bedroom door (its the signage thing again). Anyway, after a challenging start, we thought our studio bedroom was excellent. It had lots of hidden storage areas with all the things you might have forgotten and might want to purchase. The bathroom was very roomy, beautifully laid out and the complimentary products excellent. The shower was the most powerful I have come across in a hotel. There was an HD TV with DVDs available from reception, including a full range of adult titles listed in full in the information booklet. The bed was super comfy, the whole room spotless. Our studio room had floor to celing windows on two sides so the light in the room was great. I had requested a quiet room on a high floor and got a room on the thirs floor on a noisy corner of the hotel. I'm not sure if our requets weren't possible for our type of room, but the street noise certainly kept me awake, but that is normal for London. The thing that most surpriused me was that the hotel is only five floors high. A floor to ceiling vista is stunning if you are on a high floor looking out across the sights of London. In fact our fabulous windows saw us looking across in to offices and other people's flats so it wasn't quite what we had hoped for. The location is perfect, close to trafalgar square and covent garden. We had a hurried dinner in Asia de Cuba as we had to get to the theatre so we didn't get to fully appreciate the food. The service was impeccable, we thought the food we had was ok but not remarkable however, with more time we might have appreciated it more. Breakfast was very good indeed with the same high quality of service. We didn't use the bar, it was so dark in there and I like to see who I'm with. I had hoped to use Gymbox next door but I didn;t have time on the day of arrival and as we were only staying one night the place didn't open until 10am Sunday morning so my plan for an early Sunday gym session was not to be, which really disappointed me. So, all in all, service is good, the place is a very contemporary experince and special feeling, but in all honesty I would book somewhere next time where I just feel more comfortable for my five stars.",4,2012,03,12
125,The Best Hotel in the World!,"Simply best hotel in the world in a great location in the heart of London, with spectacular service, friendly and professional staff, and relaxed and cool atmosphere.",5,2012,03,08
125,Actually a good hotel!,"It has quite a rep, for being high end, a bit snooty, over-priced party hotel with small rooms etc.
But I have stayed here a couple of times, for a longer period of time, and every time it was a thoroughly enjoyable stay.
The decor is very modern, so either you like this, or you don't.
The cheaper rooms are of course smaller, but travelling a lot, I have stayed in much worse places, and a lot smaller.
The location is very central.
Yes, the lobby is busy, and on the weekends it packs up, and yes some people come to see and want to be seen, (as some celebs also seem to favour this hotel) but the staff remain friendly, helpful, and the service is good.
Just ask for a room on one of the higher floors and you should be OK.
They have a great complementory membership offer with the Gym Box next door, and unlike many small, not very well equipped hotel gyms, this is the proper deal!
The restaurant serves great breakfast, lunch and dinner too, although personally I like to go out for dinner when in London.",4,2012,03,06
125,We keep going back so they must be doing something right!!!,"We have stayed in St Martins Lane 5 times in the last 18 months and apart from 1 occasion have never had any problems. The rooms are great very modern, we like having a bath so you have to go up in the rooms to get one but we have stayed in 5 different rooms and can't really complain about any of them....Penthouse definitely the best!! 

We've had room service which was really nice, which most hotels fail to get room service right it's normally cold and not great here very nice. We've eaten in the restaurant, service was great, they have a very casual attitude so it doesn't feel forced it has a nice atmosphere, the guy who served us was very good explained that 2 starters and 1 main would be enough for a table of 2 as they were big portions he was correct. Food was really nice and would recommend it. 

We always go to the Light Bar and would highly recommend it but also booking in advance as they get very busy. The service I find is always good you never really wait around to have your order taken...Toffee Champagne and Strawberry Cheesecake shots are delicious!! It had a great atmosphere but if you are after a quiet night this isn't necessarily going to work for you. 

This isn't an overly expensive hotel has a great location if you want to explore London. 

We had an issue with service on a visit from a staff member at the front desk however when we checked out this was taken seriously, I was sent an email apologising and also asking that the next time we booked to contact them directly and they would oversee the stay and make sure everything was great. We stayed last month and this was very true they were very good and was an amazing stay.

I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2012,03,04
125,..very nice,"I enjoyed my stay here - this was my third time.  It is in a very good location, the rooms are well proportioned, clean, comfortable and stylish.  The staff on the front desk are friendly.  I can recommend this hotel.  It's good enough that I don't have much to write!",4,2012,03,02
125,Great place,"The hotel is located in the middle of everything and right near the English National Opera.  Despite being in such a busy area, it is very quiet inside, well minus the lobby area, that seems to be busy with people going to this amazing restaurant on the ground floor right near the bar area where people even dance late at night.

My room was located in the corner and had floor to ceiling windows on two sides with a hallway leading to the massive bathroom which could have constituted another room.  So, extremely large, simplistic but well designed and everything of top quality.  One could have  a party easily in the room: is massive.",5,2012,02,24
125,Great Hotel but needs a little TLC,"Great reception, great lobby, hip bar friendly staff but rooms a little tired. In need of renovation but didn't totally spoil a good experience. Only problem was at checkout when they charged me 75 pounds on a fully prepaid booking claiming it was for a currency exchange mistake. What BS is that??? Prepaid is prepaid. My objections fell on deaf ears. When I wrote to the hotel to complain I got no response. Might have a lot going for it but it's the little things that count. For that I wouldn't book it again.",4,2012,02,22
125,Style over substance,"I hated it. The staff seem more concerned with how they look than helping guests. I waited 45 minutes for tea and toast. Others came in 15 minutes behind me and had their breakfast order taken. I think the staff, complete with their Armani model looks and poor grasp of the english language, should be re-trained. I would never stay again.",1,2012,02,21
125,I¬¥m definately coming back!,"Me and my husband stayed at the St Martins lane hotel for a weekend during the London fashion week. Although the hotel was fully booked and the restaurant and bar hosted venues daily, the staff still maintained to bring us excellent service. The were all helpfull, polite and really did their best to make our stay perfect. 
The design of the hotel and the rooms are magnificent and it¬¥s carried out through the entire building. We were given a room on the top floor, with spectacular view- we could se the Millennium eye and parts of the famous London skyline.
We are definately coming back and we will gladly recomment this hotel to anyone.

ps: location is great- 3 min. walk from Leichester square.",5,2012,02,20
125,Close to city vibe,"This is now our third visit to this hotel and it always impresses. I decided to upgrade to the romance themed offer as a christmas gift to my partner and was pleasantly surprised by the way in which the room was made up with candles and rose petals.

The main downside to two of our stays here is when you provide specific requests at the booking stage for delivering champagne to the room - they just don't seem to deal with this efficiently as both times I have had to prompt concierge/reception.

Overall a good stay if not memorable.",4,2012,02,20
125,Very Nice hotel,Hotel is really central and very friendly staff! Price is a bit high but think that is while it's in London! ,4,2012,02,20
125,First trip to England,"Wife and I had a five day stay at a greatly reduced rate, apparently due to the off season. Also
Had terrific airline rates. We were enthralled with our location in Covent/Leicester section of London right next to Trafalgar Square.

We are about 35 years older than the usual clientele and the hotel is what I would call edgy.
However, the staff were terrific and courteous. Very helpful in providing sightseeing info. Rooms
were very modern and neat and hotel staff very reliable. Did not eat or have a drink within the hotel since there were plenty of pubs and dining establishments in close proximity so unable
to give a review on this topic.

Entire stay was unforgettable and would gladly use this hotel again.",5,2012,02,17
125,Pretentious,"We have stayed in lots of London hotels and this one is definitely the worst. I am actually amazed that it has such a good reputation! Upon arrival the foyer does admittedly look impressive, however we found the greeting at reception rather uncomfortable. We were checked in and given extremely unclear directions to the room and no offer of help with our bags. When we found our room I have to say we were underwhelmed. The room was minimalist, but to a fault. It felt very clinical and was very cold. We understood what the room was trying to achieve but it fell short on quality and comfort. There was no bath in the room, just a shower. The room had stone flooring, but no underfloor heating so it was very cold. The overall feel off the room was claustrophobic and not cosy at all. And now to the restaurant. We had a table booked at Asia de Cuba. We had really been looking forward to eating here but the service was so poor and we were made to feel so uncomfortable that we left (we had sat at the table for 30mins without anyone taking our order or bringing us a drink!) In order to give a balanced review I must add that the breakfast we had in our room was faultless and the man on reception when we checked out was really friendly and took the breakfast off of the bill when we told him about our experience in the restaurant. But all in all this hotel is over rated and over priced and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.",2,2012,02,15
125,"Great staff, not great room...","Let's say you're traveler and you're looking for a comfortable hotel room in a great location in London, near theater and a tubestop. Let's also say that you're Philippe Starck, the noted French hotel designer and architect.  He'd definitely enjoy the St Martin's Lane Hotel, because he designed it. But if you're NOT Starck, then it's a little iffier....

I stayed at the St Martin's Lane for four nights last week, traveling as a single woman. I knew the hotel was ""trendy"" - I read the reviews - and I also know that I am NOT trendy, but decided I could put up with a little ""trendiness"" for four nights in a superb location. I was welcomed to the hotel by a front-desk staff and concierge who were the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered on my many trips to London. A grade of A+++  to the staff. The helpfulness and good cheer were in evidence throughout my stay. The room, though, is a different story...

When I stay at a hotel for more than one night, I ""set up"" the room - finding space for my computer, locating easily-accessed plugs for the many chargers I bring, putting a box of Kleenex on my bedside table, etc. And I don't mind a small room - as long as it's well appointed, I find it ""cozy"". The problem with the room at the St Martin's is that it was small, but contained furniture that all had extremely sharp corners. The platform that the mattress was on was a walk-by hazard, as was the long, rectangular table at the edge of the room. The plugs were located across the room from the bed, and were barely accessible. There was no night-stand on either side of the bed and I found a small brown stool that I placed next to the bed. The bed had a counter in back of the head-board but it was awkwardly placed and would be impossible to use as a nightstand. The stand that held the TV and other music components was also sharply cornered. If the room wasn't so small, then all the sharp-cornered pieces wouldn't matter, but as it was, ""surviving"" the room was difficult without bruising. The mattress on the bed platform was comfortable, as was the duvet and other bed linen. The room was about half bathroom, half bed/desk area, and also included a charming outside enclosed sitting area, that is probably great fun and enjoyable in the warmer weather.

I discussed the room with one of the concierges and he said all the rooms had the same furniture and basic set up. He also said the hotel was - perhaps - going to go through ""refurbishment"" in the near future. I said I hoped the designers and the manager and whoever makes these decisions would spend a couple of nights in the hotel, using the same rooms offered the guests. Let THEM try to get comfortable and avoid bruising! Maybe they would remake the rooms with softer corners and see what amenities of comfort most travelers - whether ""trendy"" or not - expect in a hotel room.  In my case, the staff made up for the uncomfortable room and I will return to the hotel when I want to stay again in the West End and Covent Garden area. For others looking at the hotel, please think about what your priorities are in a hotel stay and plan accordingly.

Oh, and I booked through hotels.com and got a very good room rate. I paid a small upgrade charge when I checked in and was upgraded to the room I occupied throughout my stay.",4,2012,02,15
125,Perfect central hotel.,"I stayed here for two nights in December. The location is just wonderful, very close to a tube station and the theatres I love so much.

The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, I didn't want to leave!

Quite high priced, if 10% cheaper I'd make it my base when in London.",5,2012,02,09
125,Lovely all around!,"Service was fantastic, better than I expected.  Location is central and walkable, rooms are very comfortable.  This might be my new favorite London hotel.",5,2012,02,07
125,Design goes over comfort and practicability,"I have been a previously staying in a Morgan Group hotel (in San Francisco, see my review on tripadvisor) and it was an excellent experience for the price. Therefore, I had certain expectations. Those were mostly ruined during my one night stay in St Martins Lane. I am a regular traveller to London and decided to stay in St Martins Lane based on my work colleagues recommendations. I guess my disappointment was also fueled by the price of 330 GBP per night and the expectations related to that. Overall, St Martins Lane is for a place where design goes over comfort and practicability. Further, at this price level customers can expect certain services included, such as Wifi, breakfast and a TV which is less than 5 years old (Well, the old TV was hiding in a new designer closet). I had booked with a special company arrangement (including Wifi, breakfast) which I didn't get, even after asking the evening of arrival and the morning of departure at the reception. After a lengthy and not very friendly discussion I've got my take-away breakfast which was not very fresh and smashed into a fancy take-away box. I decided to have breakfast with Starbucks across the street. It might sound a bit picky but my 12h stay at St Martins Lane was just not meeting my expectations of what I should get for 330 GBP.",2,2012,02,05
125,"Sorry, not a fan","Let me start by saying that this hotel was a designer's dream. They obviously gave someone free reign over place and were playful in their implementation.  Kind of Alice in Wonderland meets South Beach.  But unlike Morgan's Delano on South Beach where the wind gently sweeps through the lobby blowing the long white drapes and you wonder why you hadn't visited sooner, I just kind of felt like I wasn't cool or artsy enough to hang out downstairs.  So up to my room.  Hey the bed and desk are floating on pink neon.  Maybe cool for the ultra lounge but how do you turn these off?  The door to the restroom, I think it took 5 minutes to find then figure out how to open.  The bed, looking quite cool floating around all of the glowing neon, had a mattress that could not have been more than 3 or 4 inches thick.  Not comfortable for my 3 night stay.  Definitely a case of fashion over function.  

I've eaten at the restaurant downstairs and it's really good.  I saw some famous folks waiting outside the club.  It's in central London and all of that.  But as someone who travels a bit, I don't really care for the feel of the place and definitely think they should have put more money towards the mattress and pulled back on some of the high design.",3,2012,02,01
125,Pleasantly surprised by great service at this '√ºbercool' hotel,"Although I've been to the bar and restaurant at St Martin's Lane a number of times this was my first time staying in the hotel and I was really impressed. And, I have to say, surprised. I have stayed in a number of other '√ºbercool' hotels both in London and around the world, which have turned out to be 'style over substance'; lovely to look at but lacking any warmth or real character... so it was a really pleasant surprise to experience both during my stay last weekend. I was staying with a group of friends to celebrate a special weekend with a friend. And the hotel team helped make it extra special for her and for us. Most of our rooms were upgraded, which was a lovely surprise. My friend also received a bottle of Laurent Perrier in her room. Another great touch. And we were really looked after by the concierge - both during the week in the run up to our stay - and over the weekend.
It goes without saying that the rooms are lovely, comfortable and indulgent; the bar and other public areas in the hotel are really stylish, but this can all become a bit beside the point if the service and attitude of the staff are not high quality as well, and if as a guest you are not made to feel welcome. Happily for us, we experienced all of this during our stay. I am already planning a weekend back with my husband.",5,2012,02,01
125,A fabulous hotel,"We stayed at this hotel last week and found it wonderfully relaxing. The bedrooms are minimalist - so soothing and delightful. All the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. The decor of the public rooms is fabulous and the food was delicious. We definitely want to come back! Thank you.",4,2012,01,31
125,"Great hotel, staff & location","Difficult to find if you have not been before as it has no signage but  its next to the Gym next door which has a huge sign! The rooms are simple but stylish. We had deluxe room on the 6th floor which had great views and well away from the busy street noise below. Size of room was adequate but not overly large. Staff were very helpful especially when we had rowdy neighbours in the adjoining room next door. Management eventually quietened them down by 3.30am and knocked ¬£100 off our bill which helped. We did not get to visit recommended Asia de Cuba but we did have a few drinks in the 'trendy' bar which we found to be dark, a little dreary and too loud for conversation. Great location and we would definitely stay again, but dont think its worth more than ¬£230 per night (our room only deal on lastminute.com.",5,2012,01,31
125,Very Smart !!!!!,"This is an amazing trendy hotel right in the heart of London. From its swish lobby to the cool mood lit bedrooms, it's got it all. It's not cheap mind so expect to pay top dollar for any extras, there are no in room tea or coffee facilities so take a travel kettle if you like a brew when you wake, and at ¬£12 for a tea tray for two ( no biscuits either ) you can soon rack up your room bill. It is on the doorstep of theatre land with Coventry garden just around the corner, every other attraction is within easy walking distance. Asia de Cuba has a great intimate feel, the food is good but not the best I have had for the price. However I must say that my customer experience from start to finish has to be commended, from the lobby to the young Italian waiter who combined charm with a total knowledge of the menu to provide world class service. We stayed at a Morgans Hotel in New York ( The Royalton ) and I have to say that I have been very impressed with both venues. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, just make sure you have plenty of cash to splash.",5,2012,01,30
125,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Despite being long past young and trendy, my husband and I really loved this hotel on a 2 night stay en route to our Spanish house. The staff, Ivan and Tim who greeted us, were first class, the doormen too (loved their beanie hats). The decor is fantastic, terrific lighting, super bathroom, we loved it all, the only adverse remark would be that a basic room which we had would be too small for more than a couple of days. As retirees, we like to sit and read or watch the news while we get ready to go out and we didn't like having to sit on the bed instead of a chair, but there was no room for chairs (except the one at the desk). We would have a larger room next time. However, the bed was extremely comfortable. We got a very good deal through Trivago of ¬£360 for 2 nights. The location was perfect for us, just off Trafalgar Square, near Covent Garden, Simpson's on the Strand for dinner and a reasonably short walk to Regent Street and Bond Street, and next door to the Coliseum, unfortunately no Opera was playing while we were there. We didn't try the restaurant in the hotel because we always go to Simpson's and we had been recommended to Goodman for the second night, but next visit we will try dining in the hotel. Definitely to be recommended.",5,2012,01,24
125,not sure i would again,"super location of course, great bar, somewhat irritatingly ""cool and trendy"" staff and lobby.  standard rooms are tiny and hidden down long corridors with low ceilings in a very un-boutique kind of way.  good bathrooms and pretty good value.  but all a bit cold, false and soulless in the end.",4,2012,01,23
125,unique experience,"We spent a 3 day trip during earlies january,the hotel is well known because of phillip starck and its central position. a friendly couple stayed and recommended to us.
the staff ok, so frigid, but really we did not care,we just felt like living in a museum of contemporary art for three days. loved loved loved the lift,the lobby the corridors, generally i am fond of design and this hotel combines everything.do not miss a drink to his cuba bar!",5,2012,01,21
125,Night at St Martins Lane Hotel,"My partner and I spent a Saturday night in November at the hotel, the reception staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our Garden Room was amazing. We ate in the Hotels Restaurant and the food was out of this world. We had cocktails in the Bar which were to die for! All in all totally worth it and an enjoyable experience. Sonia who helped arrange our stay was Fab giving us all the info we needed will defiantly go back hopefully sooner rather than later....",5,2012,01,20
125,"A true 'designer' hotel, with the service to match!","The St Martins Lane has done for hotels what Dyson has done for vacuum cleaners, Apple has done for mobile technology and Nespresso has done for coffee at home. This hotel evokes lifestyle over luxury, personality over pretensions and art over beauty - although it wants for very little regarding luxury and beauty. If you're a finger clicking fuddy-duddy, you won't feel comfortable. The staff are familiar and prefer to call you by your first name rather than the usual 'Sir' or 'Mr/s Blah Blaah'). The public areas are crafted to stimulate creative minds and confuse accountants (except for the accountants that work at the hotel - I would have thought). My room was white! There was a turn-down service which I didn't expect (a little unnecessary these days)! Ice was delivered to my room within 10 minutes! The bed was very comfortable (although you need to experience a Sofitel for real bed comfort). Biggest criticism was the ¬£10 daily charge for wifi... PLEASE!! I recommend you request a room at the front of the hotel and use the free Starbucks connection from across the road! Charging for wifi these days is NOT acceptable and certainly NOT commensurate for a lifestyle branded hotel like the St Martins Lane. Thank you Starbucks... get with it everyone else!",5,2012,01,19
125,Great location. Don't expect good service.,"I received several emails after I booked 3 rooms recently. Several welcomed me and asked if we wanted upgrades etc.
By chance I had printed them out. There is no hotel sign but I recognized the hotel exterior from the website .
I approached the desk and stood there with 3 staff saying nothing . When I stated my name I was given blank stares and asked 'who?' I thought I may have been in the wrong building so I asked if this was St Martins Hotel and the response was yes. I then said I would like to check in. So I'm not sure what other people say. Maybe there's some code word. Maybe we were too ordinary or maybe it was the family thing they don't like. ( 4 adults and 2 teenagers)
Then they didn't have me booked in at all.
That's when my print outs became handy. Still nothing was said and I had to ask if there was a problem. It was quite awkward as I had given my sister the stay as a Christmas gift and she was standing right there and I had to just accept their attitude. They did offer us a drink in the bar but we really wanted to go to our rooms.

After check in there was no directions given as to our room location and it was 3 hours before our luggage was sent to our rooms. We had just arrived from Barcelona ( staying at the fabulous Casa Camper) and wanted showers. The next day I received an email to say that our booking had been cancelled. 
Who is running the web site??? Who is training the front desk staff??
The rooms were small but comfortable but the bathrooms quite big for London. I had no problem with them and the cleaning staff were efficient and friendly although my sons' room smelt of smoke which is quite difficult to get rid of.
We had just spent 3 weeks travelling around Europe staying in superb hotels and apart from the fabulous location it's not offering 5 star service.

I would complain to the hotel manager but don't know how to contact them.",3,2012,01,18
125,Can't wait to stay here again,"There is no signage on the exterior which looks like an office building, the main landmark being the marquis with Gymbox, the gym next door available to hotel guests.  Once you step inside the clean, airy and light, well-designed lobby with touches of quirkiness such as gold teeth-shaped stools, you know you are somewhere special.  My white room was spotless, furnished with impressively absorbent towels, and toiletries by (Malin+Goetz) which are packaged beautifully.  The mood light over the bed was turned on and a candle lit in the bathroom as part of the turn down service.  Asia de Cuba, the hotel restaurant, is pricey, but delicious and worth my first night splurge.  The location is ideal, within steps of the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, theaters; and close to Convent Garden and Chinatown.  I hope I have another opportunity to stay here again in the not so distant future.",4,2012,01,16
125,"Excellent hotel and a ""surrealist"" experience (in the artful sense of the word)","Excellent hotel, very well located right in the heart of Central London (key to a sucessful stay in this highly energetic but somewhat extended city).
Expensive but unique : at first, disappointing, you enter a hotel set in an average building at the end of St Martins lane, almost at the entrance of either the National Portrait Gallery or the local musical th√©atre. And just after crossing the entrance with its huge glass doors, the journey begins : no reception but it looks like you enter a business building reception. The check-in is quick and easy, then you decide to visit the famous bar. The bar is at the back of the entrance, looks like a dark grotto and past the entrance and it's two cerberus, you feel like you are in a luxury purgatory : colored seats and walls, a wall of bottles and changing pictures at the roof, lusty looking waiters in very short dresses...the lift receives you in a blue light and shows either aquariums or clouds in a blue sky displayed on TV sets, the corridor is lit in dark orange. What is definitely quite something is the room : although small (we are in central London), it offers a unique experience of colors displayed by LED lights that you can play with from your bed. Magic.
But the most impressive with this hotel is that whatever direction you look at, you seem to be inside a surrealist painting, and this is really where the magic lies : you are a part of the Chef d'Oeuvre. When I first took the lifts, I had two Drag Queens coming with me, and belive me I felt I was inside a Paul Delvaux painting. Thanks Philippe Stark !
If you want one of those experiences only London can offer, try the St Martins Lane Hotel. I'll definitely come back next time I come to London.",5,2012,01,13
125,Theatre experience,"St Martins Hotel is ideally located for the west end, in fact within eyeshot are the Duke of York & Noel Coward Theatres & Leicester Sq Underground is 100 yd away. The hotel standard rate is very expensive & I suspect aimed more and the Co-orporate visitor, if you can use Hotel.com, Trivago: Last Minute.com etc webpages as we did then it becomes ideal, however breakfast @ ¬£25 was OTT. Staff etc were 1st class and helpful, room was also very good.",4,2012,01,12
125,"Culture, theatres and food.","Having read previous reviews I felt the location and style of this hotel would be great. Yes, it is tricky to find if not arriving by taxi but after asking we were directed easily. Check-in was smooth and straight forward and we had a nice corner room on the 4th floor. Standard rooms are small but nicely decorated with a decent comfortable bed and good lighting. What stands out for this hotel is its location. Couldn't be better! We were there to see the 'Leonardo Da Vinci Exhibition' and this was a 5min walk away in the National gallery as were lots of theatres and restaurants.Only negatives were a 4am alarm call for someone else(quick apology but no follow up) and an automatic lock- in when we tried to check out at 11:40am on the Sunday(assured previously that check out was 12midday). Staff were pleasant if a little distant.",4,2012,01,10
125,London Weekend - St Martins Lane Hotel,"Absolutely Brilliant. Don't hesitate to book. The Light Bar has great atmosphere and Asia restaurant first class. Above all the location is very Central to Covent Garden, Soho,  and Oxford Street just a short walk away. Staff courteous and friendly. All in all a great stay and decent value considering a 5 Star hotel right in the thick of it!!",5,2012,01,09
125,Great location,"Took us 4 walks up and down the street before we found the hotel, no number or name anywhere on the front of the building!
 We stayed for 2 nights and wanted a very central hotel to all the tourist sights and this one certainly fitted the bill, Covent Garden, Leicester Sq. Trafalgar Sq. all on your doorstep as well as theatre land.
 Very strange uninviting lobby, does trendy have to mean uncomfortable? The rooms were no bigger than I expected but there was really only room to hang about 4/5 things in the 'wardrobe', but clean and comfortable enough and the bed was very comfortable. Staff were all very friendly.",4,2012,01,09
125,Outstanding,"Part of the Morgans group.  We have used the Shore club in Miami run by Tim Nardi which was excellent.  This one didnt disappoint. The staff were outstanding!  The rooms terrific everything one needed.  Very modern. The location of the hotel is outstanding. Accross the road to the theatres or at most 3 minute walk.  Trafalgar Square 3 minute walk, 2 minutes to the tube and 10 minutes to Buckingham Palace Whitehall and Downing Street.
Anne and sonia really made our stay. The hotel is outstanding.  Staying in London and sightseeing ior going to the theatre this is the hotel!",5,2012,01,09
125,Fantastic Hotel!,"St. Martin's Lane is an incredible hotel with a great combination of location, comfort, and style. The hotel is located a block away from a tube station, right in the centre of everything, and most importantly, sits on a lively street that never quiets down (in a good way). Leicester Sq does not shut down and there is always lots to do nearby. 

The staff were wonderfully competent, accommodating, and extremely friendly. There was no hint of snobbiness or reservedness you sometimes find in design-centred hotel staff. The team is obviously very close knit, properly managed, and customer oriented.

The room itself was fantastic. The bathroom is easily one of the very best I've ever seen in a hotel room and the deep soaker tub was the perfect thing at the end of a long day. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not feel that the room was dated, unless you prefer the hypermodern designs in some of the more corporate-focused hotels in town, which I do not. My room was on the top floor and was generously large, especially for London.

This hotel was the best I've been to in London and I plan on coming back each time I visit.",5,2012,01,08
125,Pretty dam cool,"It's been around for a while but still
holds it's own as a design hotel. 
From the discrete entry, through the outlandish lobby, into the lifts (which are a party themselves), the stark Starck rooms (excuse the pun) offer a peaceful respite from gritty London. 
Room is cosy, but it is London afterall. 
You'll enjoy staying here... & the bar. ",5,2012,01,07

125,Amazing Hotel in Great Location,"My wife and I just spend 4 nights 12/29-1/2/11 at St Martins Lane. I booked the Standard Queen but upgraded to a Standard Queen Corner Room for 19 pounds more/night. Although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable. It reminded me of my old studio apartment in New York City. The location was amazing. It is in walking distance from most of the main sites in central london but it is away from the craziness of pica dilly. The street is quieter than most which is a good thing. We did not eat at Asia de Cuba as we have that in NY but we did go to the Light Bar numerous times. Staff was friendly and attentive and the drinks were delicious. Tim, the concierge was amazingly helpful and answered all our questions. Overall, I would definitely stay here again when I return to London.",5,2012,01,04
125,Earns my 'Worst Hotel Experience of the Year' Award!,"In 2011, I was fortunate enough to be able to experience many quality hotels like the Copacabana Palace in Rio, the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, with other memorable stays at properties managed by Shangri-La, Four Seasons, Fairmont, JW Marriott and more. Out of the 12 different hotels that I visited during the year, the experience at St Martin's Lane was sorely at the bottom.

My girlfriend and I stayed there for a long weekend trip to London in November. Not everything about it was bad:
We came mainly to do touristy things and see the city. The location is great.
The concierge was very helpful with our requests.
The doorman (I think his name was Chris) was very friendly and helpful.
The floor to ceiling windows and oversized floorstanding mirror in the room are not common in London. I liked the modern feel.
I like to workout regularly and when I do, I spend most of my time in the weight room so having access to a real gym was nice (but note there is no pool). 

Unfortunately, the negative aspects of the experience at St Martins Lane were significant and made clear that it is not a high-end hotel:
The hotel decided that undergoing extensive construction on the exterior of the building would best be done on a Saturday morning, nevermind that guests might actually want to sleep. The construction was on all sides of the building and no warning was given. I understand that work needs to be done on a property, but at a quality hotel this would take place during normal business hours and guests would be given notice so that they can plan accordingly. Not at St Martins Lane.
At least we were offered a free breakfast to compensate. My girlfriend ended up paying for it quite dearly though, as the eggs she was served were undercooked and she ended up with a case of violent food poisoning that night. I got to pay for it as well, with an unauthorized $90 charge to my credit card for the breakfast after departure. This was cleared up with a call to the hotel after returning home (on my own time and long-distance expense), but again, if a free breakfast is offered, a least put a note in the system not to charge for it. Having read reviews for this hotel on Tripadvisor, it is clear that this is the not the first time the hotel has taken liberties with customers‚Äô credit cards.
We also stopped by the hotel bar on our final night. We ordered one of the signature ‚Äúwhisky shares‚Äù which is presented in a decanter with two tumblers; the bill arrived simultaneously with the share yet somehow we were charged for two doubles of the chosen whisky for a total price of 15 or 20% more than the share. To make matters worse, one of the patrons in the bar decided to be verbally abusive to my girlfriend without provocation. Security removed him and I understand the hotel can‚Äôt control the behavior of clients but I have a preference for frequenting hotels whose guests are civilized.
Finally, another mysterious and unauthorized charge showed up on my credit card in the amount of $20. When I called regarding it, St Martins claimed that it was for a shaving kit which they said I requested from housekeeping. Unfortunately for me, I did not request any shaving kit and had I known that St Martins charges for toiletries that are free at nice hotels, I would not have taken the basic razor, extra shower gel, or q-tips when I packed up. Oddly enough, since the razor was definitely in the room for longer than just the day of check-out, one would think the charge would be in their billing system and available for review and payment or discussion upon check-out. This was not the case and the item was completely absent from the bill which was presented (and paid in-full) at check-out, and once again they took the liberty to charge my credit card without any authorization on my part or communication on theirs. Clearly the standards are very different at this hotel compared to Four Seasons, Taj, and probably even Best Western.

My advice for travelers: bring earplugs, Cipro, some Skype credit to dispute the hotel's fraudulent credit card charges, and your own toilet paper in case they try to bill for it after check-out.",1,2012,01,04

125,Stylish & minimalist with great location,"From the stylish and minimalist reception to the dark but atmospheric bar- this is a hotel with modern design at its centre. Double Rooms are not huge and the decor is  ""all white"" - ours had a good walk in shower but no bath - and are spec'd with all you would expect plus iPod charger, DVD player and a huge library of films available. We were on the 6th floor and had very little street noise, which for central London was a pleasant surprise. Service was very attentive. Stepping out into the middle of Covent Garden, Theatreland and Leicester Sqr is pretty unbeatable location-wise. Would stay again.",4,2011,12,31
125,"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING, a home away from home!","After a horrific 26 hour business class flight on Etihad with no working Entertainment system I arrived at St Martins Lane Hotel.  The moment I stepped through the door I was greeted by Ed who mentioned that a large group had just arrived and could he take my bags and recommended an amazing pub just around the corner to go and relax in whilst the group was sorted.  I went back and started the check in procedure with one of the best concierges I've met to date, Ivan.  Unfortunately I hadn't travelled in Europe before and didn't realise that the new Visa Debit from Citibank meant that I had to pay the full accomodation up front and another 100GBP per night (I was staying 10 days).  He helped me by changing my booking therefore giving me time to transfer funds to cover the amount.  At no time did he make me feel embarrassed and was very help with giving me wifi access so I could complete the transfer.  

I got up to my room and I couldn't have been happier.  I live in a modern apartment in Prahran with all the mod cons and I felt that I had arrived to a mini version of home.  The bed was large and comfortable, the pillows soft but firm, the lighting (although a little gimmicky and takes getting used to) excellent, the bathroom was large and spacious and I can't even begin to describe the shower!!!

The nightly turn down service was amazingly discreet, after a hard day shopping and sightseeing I'd arrive back with candles lit in the bathroom, the bedding reset and pulled back, the lights turned down, the temeperature of the room set perfectly and a weather report for the next day on the bedside table.  I wish I had that service at home :-)

The locate is perfect, a short walk to just about everything and if not then a short tube ride.  The nightime buzz, even at 11pm is something to experience ... it has such a great energy and it was funny to see people peering into the hotel at night obviously enjoying the unique styling of Philip Stark with garden gnome stolls and larger than life chess pieces.

The lifts alone are a work of art with tv screens in the walls displaying a different picture each day and funky music playing.  It was always a fun thing to get into them in the morning not knowing what you'd see!

I'd have to say that my only negative comments are not about the hotel but the restaurant and bar.  Although funky and cool, the service in each is lacking with staff who's primary language is obviously not english and who's customer service level is just not there compared to the hotel staff.  The food in the restaurant is fantastic, although a little pricey but the rudeness of some of the staff lessens the experience for me.

All in all an excellent stay and a hotel I will definitely be returning to on subsequent trips to London!

A big thank you to Ed, Ivan and Stef who all made my stay pleasant, relaxed and comfortable.

Not one of the cheaper hotels in London but definitely worth the money!",5,2011,12,29
125,"Great Hotel, Great Service, Great Location","My husband and I spent 4 days at St. Martins Lane during probably one of the busiest holiday party weeks in London and we were  impressed.  We've generally enjoyed all  of the Morgans Group hotels that we've been to  but this was our first time in London.  This is a trendy hotel in the most perfect location - close to all the theaters, steps from National Gallery, walking distance to the Buckingham Palace, walking distance to many great restaruants and bars (including two in the hotel) and right next door to a trendy gym where you can work off all those delicious dinners! But we were most impressed with the hotel service. It was impecable.  Big Thanks to all of the concierges - Alex, Mike, Dino, Cam (hopefully I am not forgetting anyone) - for organizing a fantastic program for us, including a guided tour with an amazing personal tourguide+car (7 hours of 1x1 guidance through London - AMAZING).  They got us reservations to all of the trendy restaurants well in advance of our arrival.  It was great not to have to worry about waiting for a table. They took care of all our transportation and even treated us to a champagne toast during our dinner at Asia de Cuba. We've been to the one in Miami several times and the one in London is better in our opinion (service, ambiance and food). As the result we had an amazing trip - Thank you guys! But its not just the concierges - the entire hotel is very well run.  Room service is fast and always percises (food is delicious).  Same can be said for housekeeping.  We will stay there again!

125,Great Hotel,This hotel is in a great location with lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance including a very trendy restaurant and bar inside the hotel.  I only stayed 1 night so cannot speak to some of the amenities they have or dont have.  The rooms were smaller but makes very good use of its space.  I would stay at this hotel again.  The day I arrived the entrance was lined with paparzi for guests arriving to a private party.  It definitely seems to be a trendy hotel with a good scene.,4,2011,12,22
125,"Trendy hotel in a great location, at a price","Unbeatable location in Covent Gardens, a trendsetting boutique hotel in every sense of the word. Gym with boxing ring, check. Packed bar every night, check. Renowned restaurant, check. Funky Philip Starck designed rooms, check. Great service, check.

Only complaint I have is that the standard room I booked was far too small for two people. By small, I mean afraid-we‚Äôd-hurt-ourselves-by-banging-into-stuff small. We upgraded to a deluxe room for an extra forty pounds a night, which was much better, but it was a little disappointing that a standard room (which is supposed to be a double) couldn‚Äôt comfortably fit two.

+++:
Location: Honestly a fantastic location in the center of London. Two minute walk to a tube station, close to great breakfast, lunch and dinner options. A stone‚Äôs throw from broadway, cinemas and shopping, don‚Äôt think I would want to stay in any other location.

Rooms: Despite the tininess of our original standard room, the deluxe was wonderfully designed, with well-sized and functional bathrooms. Great beds, robes, iPod dock, funky table that lights up; we also had a kick out of the mood lighting right above the bed. 

Service: Very solid service. Christine at the front desk and Chris was of great help on the first day and very friendly. Any amenities needed were brought up promptly.

---:
Price: Perhaps its just London, but everything seemed √ºber expensive here. Drinks at the bar (which were great and meticulously prepared) and room rates were pretty pricey.

Size of room: Obviously, rooms are small, but the standard room is really tiny ‚Äì if you‚Äôre traveling with more than one person, I think that a deluxe is a necessity",5,2011,12,21

The bed linen was gorgeous and the bed was very comfortable. The shower was great and the complimentary bathroom products were lovely. The room was compact but there was a space for everything and the iPod doc was very handy. The hotel was spotless. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the lunch we had in the restaurant on our last day was the best meal we had in London!

The entire staff is always incredibly friendly and attentive-   from front-desk to staff in the restaurant. And while the hotel is more designer than I am, I still find it comfortable and comforting to return to.

I've come to love the rooms.  As I've noted in previous reviews, they're a bit small and the desk and metal and chair can be a bit cramped.  But somehow, I've gotten used to the space.  The lighting is good, the desk big enough to spread out some documents, computers, and other gadgets. 

Asia de cuba, in the lobby, is a great place for breakfast.  Cheaper options exist within a few blocks, but the food and service are top-notch.

I'll certainly return.",4,2011,12,03
125,Quality Location and Hotel,"Stayed for 1 night with work colleagues. I was offered a complimentary upgrade on arrival which was really nice. The room was more like a very large appartment and was as stylish as spacious. Quality lighting and fittings and very very clean!
Location great for West End as within walking distance of some many shows and attractions. Great bar and restaurant with excellent food and service. 
Even bumped into Daniel Beddingfield so great for celeb spotting if your into that sort of thing. Bungalow 8 nightclub well worth a visit as cool, funky and again a celeb hangout.
The only negative thing I can say is the length of time it took to check in and check out! Think of Rowan Atkinson in the film ""Love Actually"" and you wont be far off!
Definately not the cheapest hoterl in London but well worth a stay if you can get a deal like we did at ¬£340 per night.",5,2011,12,03

Nicely designed rooms - very different to the normal room layout. I really liked having an enclosed outdoor area. The mood lighting is cool (as is the music in the lifts that changes depending on the time of day). The lights shining on the floor showing the rooms numbers is a nice little design touch too.

Good food in the restaurant. Breakfast is outstanding.

My new favourite London hotel.",5,2011,11,26
125,Best Location!,I'm not too familiar with London and wanted to be centrally located ... This hotel offers the absolute BEST location EVER! The rooms are very well appointed and the lobby is such a great vibe!  Service is incredible as well!  STAY HERE!,5,2011,11,22
125,Fantastic Hotel,"Just spent the weekend with 20 friends for my birthday at this hotel. Staff in this hotel are exceptional. Extremely friendly welcome on arrival at check in which you don't always find at 5 star hotels. A bottle of champagne was sent up to our room to wish me a happy birthday. Of all of the couples staying here there was nothing we could fault. We had an evening at the long bar in the Sanderson ( sister hotel) again excellent service from staff returning to our hotel bar both nights. This bar is brilliant, great music and the door guy...can't remember his name was probably the best doorman I have ever come across for keeping the place upmarket yet enabling us all to have fun. Great thanks to Ahmed who runs a fabulous bar. This bar alone is a reason to stay here on a Friday/Saturday night. The next time we return to London we will be staying here.",5,2011,11,21
125,Very good hotel,"I've stayed at St Martins Lane mid september 2011. Location is great, close to all the touristic attractions london has to offer. Lobby is very modern. Rooms are a good size, lighting behind the bed is a nice touch, helps you create a certain mood in the room. Beds are extremely confortable (the room I was in had a Kingsize bed). Rooms and bathroom are very clean. Malin Goetz products are a nice touch, as in all the morgan hotels. Hotel staff was friendly. Bar is nice, the asia de cuba restaurant is even better. If you can, go to Asia the Cuba, but beware of the rather big portions :-) 
Very nice hotel! If possible I defenitely go back!",5,2011,11,17
125,"Stylish hotel, great location, outstanding staff","St. Martin's Lane is my default choice for where to stay when visiting London.  The rooms are sleek, stylish, and very comfortable, and the central location is perfect for getting around London on foot or by Tube.  What really sets St. Martin's Lane apart is the very friendly and helpful staff -- I have never had anything but an exceptional experience staying at this hotel.",5,2011,11,16
125,"Trendy, but not worth it!","I stayed here as part of a corporate function and really did not have any expectations beforehand.  I am glad that I did not as the overall experience and post care was appalling.

The Good: 
 
The ambiance of the hotel is nice if you are part of the hip and trendy set.  There is some interesting art in the hotel bar and the lobby has some cute furnishings.  We had a reception at the hotel restaurant and it looked like somewhere I would eat in the future.  

The room itself is not too bad, it was tiny, but they put some thought into how to make this accommodating.  The bathroom was very nice and the provided supplies were of high quality.  

Staff in the bar was quite attentive, but then again this was for a corporate function, so mileage may vary.  There appears to be a free membership with GymBox for your stay (and supposedly free laundry of your gym kit), but this was never explained on check in.

The Average:

It‚Äôs hard to find what is average for the hotel based on my experience, I suppose the following are some quirks which are not truly annoying, but fit into the ‚Äútrendy‚Äù category.

1)	Finding your room is an adventure.  As the numbers are not indicated on the door.  Instead they are integral to the carpet next to the door.  Bear in mind the whole hotel is bathed in mood lighting which makes for an interesting approach to finding your room

2)	The lifts have TV‚Äôs incorporated which play different ‚Äúscenes‚Äù based on the day.  Either clouds or a field of wavy grass.  Nice, until the loud music is piped into the lift.

The Bad:

The front of house was appalling.  Again, perhaps more suited for the trendy vs. business set, but a very cold process for check in and check out.  Nothing was explained on check in, just provide a credit card for incidentals and get out of our hair.  I felt that I was inconveniencing the staff with my presence.  Perhaps check in could be replaced with airline style self check in kiosks and the front of house can be reduced to menacing Dieters.

My room was broken into at 0100.  Fortunately I had the deadbolt engaged or who knows what I would have been presented with.  I was provided an explanation by the front desk manager after my stay which is included below, but none the less, I would very much caution anybody staying here.  At the least, you might have a poor night‚Äôs sleep, being awakened by security, at the worst, who knows.

Again, from a front of house/guest experience perspective, I was given a wakeup call at 0730.  Bear in mind, since the front of house didn‚Äôt feel like engaging, I never asked for a call.  Perhaps the hotel was desperate to turn the room.

Lastly, check-out was the same as check in.  However, it was probably for the best, as if I would have been asked how my stay was, I would probably have ripped somebody‚Äôs head off.

I thought hard about writing a review for the hotel as I did get a post visit survey where I afforded the hotel a chance to respond.  I did receive an e-mail from their front of house manager apologising for my experience.  What I was told could be summarised by the following:

1)	The hotel management system failed during my stay and some discrepancies were noted in rooms.  They were not sure if some rooms were vacant or occupied.  In this situation security is sent to the room to see if the room is occupied and depending on a discreet knock, they attempt to enter the room to see if somebody is in it.

2)	The hotel normally informs you of this, but no notice was provided which the hotel acknowledges

However, the hotel was still unable to account for why a ‚Äúvacant‚Äù room merited a wakeup call at 0730 and being treated with such disdain.  

Further, the front of house manager did want to discuss with me via e-mail how they could ‚Äúwow our guests and exceed their expectations‚Äù in a future stay, but on response they have fallen silent.

As a very frequent traveller both to London and many other locations where Morgan Group hold properties, I could not recommend this hotel.  A hotel of this calibre should be working much harder to either prevent such an experience happening in the first place, or when it happens, work to make amends.  There are plenty of other hotels of equal calibre of style in the city, with much more attentive customer service.",1,2011,11,16
125,"Great location, small rooms, very pleased with itself","I spent two nights at this very well placed hotel just off Trafalgar Square in central London. Well equipped but very small rooms, noisy bar. Funky modern design, very pleased with itself. Very clean. Certainly does not beckon me to returm although the free pass for the GymBox next door is very attractive.",3,2011,11,15
125,Great Place; good location for tourism,"I recently stayed at St Martin's Lane. It is very trendy and located close to lots of theaters, bars, restaurants and cafes. I had to travel a bit for all my business meetings. The rooms are very nice and clean. Staff is friendly and very responsive.",4,2011,11,13
125,Trully Wonderful,"I had never stayed at a a 5 star hotel  before and was a little nervous that I would feel out of place. How wrong could I have been! From the moment I walked in I was made to feel as though I was the hotel's most important guest. The friendliness and welcome from the reception staff was wonderful, as was the totally unexpected room upgrade and voucher for a free cocktail!

The room was superb - spotlessly clean and immaculately decorated - a little piece of heaven! The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in - oh how I wanted to take those sheets home! lol The bathroom was luxurious with lots of lovely added touches.

Whilst I did not eat in the hotel restaurant, I did sample a delicious cocktail or two in the Light Bar - amazing art work and again superb service.

The hotel is very handy for the Tube, Trafalgar Square and the National Art Gallery - where I spent a wonderful afternoon. All in all a superb hotel that I can not recommend highly enough. Will definately stay there again.",5,2011,11,13
125,"Hip, trendy clean - loud","Stayed for a night. 

Great central location - 2 minutes from Underground station Leicester Square which goes directly into Heathrow Airport (40 mins). 

Walk to dozen of shows and restaurants. Eateries for all tastes and prices.

The place is cool and hip, the front desk people dress and behave cool as well. Rooms nice and large enough to survive. Even could open window as air in the room was somewhat stale. Bathroom's clean with shower and full equipment. And: everything worked. Restaurant Asia de Cuba is cool, pricey and not really special. Only caveat was the noise of  music in the lobby. It created a somewhat stressful atmosphere when entering. That's not cool.",4,2011,11,10
125,"Great place, nice location","my first stay was couple years ago, it is still the same....clean, great service and fun experience. The hotel is in a great location. I highly recommended. They offer gym access via 3rd party gym, it is under the building, we didn't care for it, other than that, we enjoyed our stay.",5,2011,11,04
125,Another splendid stay at St Martins Lane,"I recently stayed at the hotel for the second time in late October for my mum's 50th birthday. The foyer still appeared as impressively uber modern as when I visited a few years prior, especially with the addition of a large sci-fi vending machine that sells novelty gifts and gadgets.

While St Martins Lane is no doubt a high-end sleek, sophisticated hotel it thankfully does not embody the same stoic atmospheric I have otherwise experienced at other so called 'boutique' hotels. Rather, the staff are friendly, easy-going and helpful and go out of their way to make your stay as relaxed as possible. On arrival the door staff automatically collected our luggage from the taxi and took it to the reception desk inside. Similarily, when departing we did not need to prompt the reception staff to book a taxi for us or to hold our luggage for us in the baggage room until later as this was again automatically addressed.

The room is certainly not a dissappointment either. The crisp, crease free virginal white bedding is a minimalist spectacle to behold. The housekeeping is impeccable with fresh sheets and towels if required on a daily basis. The evening turndown service is also a luxurious touch with the curtains drawn, the TV cabinet opened and tealights lit in the bathroom for you. The room also comes equipped with many complimentary toiletries and an ironing board, robes and slippers, umberella and a hairdryer. As an avid black coffee/tea drinker my only criticism is the lack of a tea/coffee making facility in the room. The 24 hour free DVD rental service with complimentary popcorn may prove a winner with children or room bound shoppers whose legs have finally decided to give up on them. 

For an evening meal look no further than the hotel's restaurant Asia de Cuba. The decor is again chic and atmopsheric and the food is out of this world. As an vegetarian, Asia de Cuba offers so much more than the usual drab offerings of second rate pizzas and pastas that you could find on any supermarket shelf. At first glance the menu may seem pricey yet is actually good value for money as the portions are gigantic and are in fact intended to be shared (the staff recommend ordering two starters and a main course).

You also could not ask for a better location with the hotel literally being around the corner from Covent Garden, Leicester and Trafalgar Square and thus also three major tube stations. Covent Garden and Leicester Square are buzzing with life both during daylight and night-time hours, housing dozens of shops, cafes, bars, restaurants and not to mention theatres.

In short, this is a decadent hotel in a fantastic London location. I have stayed at St Martins Lane twice now and certainly would not hesitate to visit a third.",5,2011,11,04
125,Loved my weekend here...,"I spent a weekend, October 28-30, in a Deluxe King rom on the top floor overlooking the London eye and other features.  I loved the hotel, I thought that the people tried to go out of their way to help me, and the location is amazing.  Repeat amazing.  The cons-not much-are that the rooms seem small, but well appointed.  I guess this is expected in a large City.  Everything was great, will stay there again for sure.  Sure, the lobby contains some hot and happening clubs, which means crowded and louder than normal, but if you are ok with that, then great.  Also, the lobby is not ""plush"", but high design, which is fun.  It may not be for everyone, BUT, it was perfect for me.",5,2011,11,03
125,"Great room, great location, trendy and cool hotel","I stayed at St. Martins Lane for three nights in August 2011.  I have never stayed in this area before as I normally stay at Bloombury but discovered this location is actually very convenient for buses in addition to the Tube.  This is a busy area and on evenings and weekends, the numerous restaurants nearby attract a busy and sometimes noisy crowd, but then again, you will always feel safe even late at night as there are lots of people about. 

The room has lots of cool factor features including a lit from below marble-look desk and a mood light headboard.  It was also quite spacious for a hotel room in London.  Minor complaints are that the shower is not well designed with the door failing to keep water from splashing out to the floor of the bathroom, and the sink is designed in such a way that it is difficult not to splash the water outside the sink when you turn on the faucet. 

The hotel lobby has a trendy club that seems quite busy (with a line-up outside the hotel door with a few people waiting to get in all the time), and many pieces of cool whimsical furniture such as stools that look like gold teeth and little tables held up by the dwarfs from Snow White.  Entrance to the gym next door is included in the hotel price and it was a very well equipped gym by London standards. 

The hotel is normally quite expensive but I found a stay 3 night pay for 2 special on Expedia.ca which made it quite affordable.",4,2011,11,01
125,Absolutely brilliant......,"Just stayed here for my husbands birthday, everything is superb, from it's central location, you couldn't ask for a better one to the staff who are always there waiting to go the extra mile for any requests.  The rooms are light and spacious, the bathrooms are everything you would expect and the beds extremely comfortable with superb linen, pillows and covers.
Would definitely stay here again without hesitation.",5,2011,10,30
125,Clean modern hotel with a young vibe,"Having walked past St Martin's Lane hotel numerous times on nights out in London, my wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a stay there for our twentieth wedding anniversary. And we were delighted with our decision!
On arrival we were greeted warmly for check-in by Ivan who ensured that we felt totally at home. He even phoned up to our room15 minutes after our arrival to check that we were happy with the room and facilities - needless to say that we were!
Our room was on the 6th floor and had a fantastic view taking in Nelson's column, the Colisseum, and the London Eye. The interior was dominated by very cool, clean and sleek white walls furniture and bedding, coupled with some very innovative and modern lighting. The bathroom was excellent, with a large shower stall , again with a range of intersting lighting options to create an appropriate mood. 
The Light Bar and Asia di Cuba are the on-site bar and restaurant, and both retain the sleek modern design led theme. We thoroughly enjoyed the house shooter cocktail.
The hotel staff were very friendly and really made us feel like welcomed and valued customers throughout our stay.
In summary, we felt that our stay was money well spent, and will consider coming here again for future special occasions.",5,2011,10,29
125,not what it used to be,"i've stayed there for 4 nights in the mid of October  .
the location is good if you want to be next to the theatres  , the rooms are totaly white with windows from floor to ceiling But - you can feel the hotel needs a renovation .. it feels too used.. 

the concierge - you can never get hold of him over the phone - they are always busy because there is only one concierge at  a shift , so you can e mail him and get an answer after a few days , but if you are trying to arrange your trip in advance and need to consult with him - no chance. from all the concierge team i would choose Tim , at lease  he tries ...
the lobby ?? there is no place to sit and relax .. all those "" unique "" furnitures are so Passe..
so - if you want  to have  a cooffee or a glass of wine in the after noon  - you must enter the bar which is trendy ,noisy and very . dark . and most of the good sits are blocked with "" reserved "" ..
the team of the reception is mostly  friendly exept Izabel - she hates her job , she hates the guests , she is arrogant   she is awfull !!!

at the end of the day - with the price you pay at the St, Martin's Lane - you can get a much beeter hotel...",3,2011,10,29
125,Great service and clean modern rooms,"I visited London for a business trip and found the St. Martins Lane very nice.  The lobby is a bit too modern for me, but the room had a really comfortable bed and nice linens.  The staff were very nice and helped me with directions and ideas on places to eat and were super friendly.  

If you are a fan of clean, sleek design you will like this hotel.",5,2011,10,27
125,Great hotel,"This is a really nice hotel in one of the only few nice places left in London, Covent Garden! The rooms are comfortable and spacious. The hotel looks fantastic and the attention to detail in this place is superb. The food is good and the staff are really nice as well.",5,2011,10,26
125,St martin Lane,"Best in town, friendly staffs , always make u welcome and feel like home !",5,2011,10,22
125,Top Hotel and People,"My wife and I stay in London a few times a year and find St Martins the best hotel we've stayed in.  The location is excellent virtually in Covent Garden, within easy walking distance for the bars and nightlife of Soho and only a couple of minutes walk to Trafalgar Square.  The staff are brilliant, helpful and friendly, always ready to help with anything. The hotel is very cool, modern slick decor, rooms are comfortable and the housekeeping is excellent. The bathroom is spacious and the beds are ultra comfy! We stay here every time we travel to London and will continue to do so. A great Hotel, staff and location which is something you don't get very often especially in a city hotel, but St Martins has it all! I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends or anyone wanting a cool place to stay in London.",5,2011,10,16
125,"Top location, best beds, will return","We booked St Martins Lane more than 6 weeks in advance, which got us a good price (especially if you compare it to the standard rate of 479 pounds!). Although we initially had some trouble booking (the website did not seem to work properly), Morgans Hotel Group/St Martinslane followed up accurately when we e-mailed them.

We took the standard room (queen) which was small, but well laid out. It was not as small as comparable hotels in Tokyo or New York (like the Hudson). The bed was extremely comfortable, and so was the shower. Good selection of organic bath products. Nice details around the room such as LED moodlights above the bed, small candles in the bathroom, and actual plants (alive) in bath- and bedroom. A little cupcake from a nearby bakers welcomed us upon arrival, together with a handwritten note wishing us a nice stay.

The location of the hotel is superb. Right of Trafalgar Square and Leicester, and a short walk to Charing Cross and Leicester Square tube stations.
The staff was friendly on arrival, and so are the doormen. Not the grumpy bouncers you see often in other hotels of this class.

The only thing we liked less was the smell in the corridors. A sort of chemical smell from maybe painting, or carpet. It is unclear where it comes from, but sometimes it makes it into the room. Unpleasant.",5,2011,10,16
125,Great Location & Staff,"Never having been to London before, we loved the location on St. Martin's Lane!!  It the heart of everything!  Few minutes walk to Trafalgar Sq., St. James Park, even the river!  The staff was friendly, nice, & helpful.  Particularly Michael the concierge, recommended an amazing restraunt!!  The door & bell staff were nice & welcoming as well everytime we came back.  Ultra modern decor & rooms a bit on the small side but packed with amenities.  Reminded me of the Standard Hotel in L.A.",4,2011,10,14
125,Great hotel - great location - great service,"I stayed at the St. Martins Lane hotel for four nights in Ocotober 2011. We got in quite early in the morning - at 10am. Our room was already ready and staff (reception and concierge) were really very very friendly. 

My request for a high floor room was fully taken note of. We got a room on the 6th (top) floor with great view of London, Big Ben and the London Eye. Room was of good size, bathroom has a very good layout, all very clean and everything can be found that you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. Room was quiet and in very good shape - everything worked without any trouble. The bed was very comfy.

Breakfast in hotel restaurant is top. We had full english breakfast included. That means you get a very good choice from the menu (cooked dishes) and the cold buffet as well. Service is top and again very friendly. 

Going to the bar in the evenig also is quite a nice experience. Here, service is a bit slower and less attentive. Maybe the mix of hotel guests and party people walking in gives them a slower pace.

Location is unbeatable. This is really the place to be. 2 mins to Trafalgar square, 4 mins to Covent Garden and 4 mins to Leicester Square. Perfect for a real city trip - the hotel is almost always just round the corner.

Would highly recommend the St. Martins Hotel to everybody who seeks perfect location, perfect service, high quality and all that in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.",5,2011,10,11
125,Great hotel - great location,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location - Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square close by.  Our room was spacious and peaceful and the bed very comfortable.  All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The late opening of the bar was a godsend after a night at the theatre followed by a late dinner.  Will definitely stay here on our next visit to London.,5,2011,10,08
125,Wow! Too good to sleep even after long haul flight,"You could not get a better location in London, just around the corner from Trafalgar Square. The staff are so obliging and helpful, nothing is too big a hassle for them to help with.

And the room....well small but it is London. 

The restaurant is brilliant. Seriously great food, a fusion of Cuban and Japanese (I think) sounds odd but works.

A very funky place to stay.",5,2011,10,06
125,Amazing hotel,"I stayed here with my siser for her 30th birthday and we both loved it! The staff are very friendly and really made an effort - free birthday cocktails, champagne AND a happy birthday teddy in our room. We stayed in a Double Double room which was perfect for our needs. The bathroom is huge and spotless, the minibar has loads on offer and the concierge was able to get us on the guest list for Whisky Mist which was fantastic.
We ate in Asia de Cuba which was excellent (another complimentary cocktail here!) and also had breakfast one day - I would say this is a little overpriced at ¬£25 per person but we did try it and had no complaints!
Overall I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel - and make sure you tell them if it's a special occasion as they go all out to make it even more special.",5,2011,10,04
125,Beautiful Hotel - Great Location,"St. Martins Lane is one of the most beautiful boutique hotels I have ever stayed in. The attention to detail is what makes this hotel special. Everything from the room keys, the illuminated panels on the wall, the lighted desk in the rooms - the modern design and feel of the entire hotel is great. Easy walk to Piccadilly Square, plenty of things to do near the hotel. Only loses points because there was a water leak from an upstairs room running down the wall behind the bed, but that type of thing doesn't seem to be common.",5,2011,10,04
125,Best location/value in London,"My husband and I just spent 5 nights at this hotel and loved every minute of our stay.  It is located in Covent Garden in a wonderful neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, shops and tube stations close by.  The rooms were very clean - large bathrooms - unusual for London - beds linens were great quality (all white).  The hallways are very dark but when you enter your room you have floor to ceiing windows making it extremely bright and inviting.  We will definitely stay here on our next visit to London.  Front desk staff were very pleasant and accommodating and concierge made great dinner recommendations - you must have the fish and chips at Sheeky's - just a short block away.",5,2011,10,02
125,I wanted to love this hotel more but....,"This hotel is certainly above average but then, considering the price of the room (we paid ¬£310ish), I wanted more than 'above average', I wanted an incredible stay.  So let's start with the positives first: 

1 Staff incredibly friendly and helpful
2 The reception area is beautiful and quite unique
3 We had a Deluxe Room with Private Patio.  A little haven in the centre of London
4 Lovely towels, linen, toiletries and the bed was incredibly comfortable
5 A well stocked fridge and plenty of things (to buy) in the room you may have forgotten - a lot of thought had gone into that.
6 iPod docking station (although remote control didn't work).
7 A wonderful wet room with a powerful shower.
8 It is certainly contemporary - it's white, white, white!

The negatives:

1 We were in room 110 which was right above the bar which, on a Thursday night, was playing dance music until gone 1am.  This didn't disturb our sleep but it was definitely audible.
2 The lighting was all over the place.  So many lights, even 'mood' lighting but none of it really set a relaxed tone.  It seemed to be lots of bright lights or none at all. Kind of killed the mood.
3 No tea/coffee making facilities.  I fear this is becoming the norm in 4*/5* hotels and I just feel it's a greedy way of making you pay inordinate amounts for room service.
4 The quirky layout soon became more quirky than practical.  Toilet in one room, shower in another and the sink in a common area overlooking the patio.  Just a bit impractical.
5 Don't bring a Range Rover to the carpark, the height limit is 1.82metres.
6 The lighting on the patio wasn't working so I had to get an engineer out - neither light was working due to blown bulbs.  This should have been checked and not left to a customer to discover.

All in all it was definitely a stay I'm glad I've experienced.  I've attended a few business functions at the St Martin's so was keen to stay in a room for the night.  Would I stay again?  Not in a hurry as it has huge competition but its location and quirkiness certainly is appealing.",3,2011,09,30
125,Disappointed,I booked a Loft King room (¬£515 per night) for 24th September - it was a 40th birthday treat for my wife ....... the web site states Loft Kings have two walls of windows and city views so was expecting quite an impressive outlook with some wow factor. What we were given is room 138 (first floor) which has three windows looking out onto a brick wall - so quite a disappointment and certainly not as described on the web site....noisy too given there is a lane under the windows....not to mention the bottle dumping from the bar on Sunday morning which provided an early wake up just after 7am. I went down to reception on the Saturday to query the room we were given and was told  it was a Loft King and was basically dismissed by the staff .......that happended again on Sunday when I queried again. I did see the hotel plan and the room was referenced as DLXST ....sounds more like deluxe standard than Loft King???  Given we were trying to enjoy the time away rather than arguing with the hotel I left it on both occasions and submitted a complaint to the Hotel through their web site - no response received.  This all certainly tainted the experience particularly as it was my wife's 40th and I can't help feeling I've paid for a lesser room than for the one I booked ............ my advice is check what room gets allocated to you to avoid disappointment,1,2011,09,27
125,Best hotel in London,We stayed at St. Martins Lane in early Aug 2011 for my partners 40th birthday.  We were greeted warmly and upgraded for a very reasonable fee.  Half way through the evening we were moved to a different room given there was a sick resident located next door (we were talking a bit loud with friends after a few glasses of champagne!).  The room we ended up staying in was at least twice the size of the original and simply stunning.  We also received a complimentary bottle of champagne for the bother (which it wasn't).  We'll definitely be staying here again.  Much better service than the Sanderson.,5,2011,09,21
125,When it's good it's great,"I've stayed here several times and this hotel has a lot of good things going for it.  Great restaurant, excellent bar, super comfy beds, though small rooms, great location for exploring the area with pubs, theatres and restaurants as close as can be.  The design is trippy in a fun way.  For example, the hallways are quite dark and the rooms are super bright and everything in it is white, except for the minimalist touch of fluorescent green accent, all made possible by floor to ceiling windows.  The bad is that I found the front desk staff inconsistent and completely unhelpful in resloving a billing issue after having  two rooms each for ten nights on my third of fourth stay there.",4,2011,09,21
125,Best bed in London,"We currently live in Dubai but go back to London a few times a year, we usually stay at The Hoxton, but fancied giving St Martin's Lane a try as a treat. It did not disappoint.

Check in was very smooth and they accommodated us arriving early due to a red eye flight from NYC.

We were allocated a lovely corner room, full of natural light.

Great space for a central London hotel.

Bed to die for.  I still think about how comfy and lovely it was now.  Want to have that bed at home!

This hotel has been around a long time now and I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good experience or not.  The staff at hotels like this can sometimes be off, but at SML they were just lovely.  I'm impressed by the Morgans group, so much so that we are starting our honeymoon at their San Francisco 'The Clift' next year, purely based on our lovely experience at SML.",5,2011,09,17
125,It's unbelievable,"I just come back to my room, after having been away for 9 hours since 7 am and the housekeeping has still not passed by. (it's now 4:15pm) can you believe that at 456 pounds per night their excuse is that the maidservice works until 5 pm and that I should have requested the service if I wanted it earlier?",2,2011,09,16
125,My new go-to hotel in London,"Everyone at check-in was extremely friendly, especially the concierge, Michael. Initially, I was disappointed to be on the first floor, but I wound up liking my room because it has a small patio attached, so you can at least get some fresh air. The bathroom is huge, the water pressure in the shower is great and I loved the cruelty-free products. The bed is big and comfy with pristine white linen. 

The room has a small desk that is comfortable for working on a laptop. 

The only downside is that the hotel isn't very well sound-proofed and each night I was awakened by other guests, or what sounded like chairs scraping the floor above. And the hallways are eerily dark.

Still, my new go-to hotel while in London for location, cleanliness and comfort.",4,2011,09,14
125,"One big cool, happy family","I have been at practically every type of London hotel: the small yet functional ones (where you marvel at how tiny a full functional bathroom/bedroom/closet combo can be), the grand old dusty ones (where you search frantically for slippers or socks before walking on egads! the spooky carpet!!!), the very posh I-feel-appreciated ones (where five people greet and talk with you before your card key hits the door), and even the damn-what-a-beds.com-mistake ones (whatever, forgive and forget). 

But this one, is, as Goldilocks would say, just right. 

The bed? Perfectly soft. The bath? Fit for a lady, a man or both (candles, lovely amenities, shower and towels galore). The lighting, sensitive to my mood (simple, intuitive and easy to set). The breakfast, divine (served on a nice tray with real tea, bless your British souls). I give the Asia de Cuba and Bar venues also a big star, delightful lighting, food and servers.

Only one problem with this property. Now I will be miserable when I can't stay here.",5,2011,09,12
125,Like Living in an iPod,"I stayed here with my fianc√©e and her family for the London Marathon earlier this year. There is no doubting the style of this hotel, but there is a definite lack of warmth. It's a bit like ""if apple did hotels""- lots of white and clean lines which gives the place a very sterile feel. However, the rooms were immaculate, the bar was excellent (if a little dark and expensive), the location couldn't be better for experiencing London and the staff were first class. If you are the type of traveller who is looking for a high end, modern establishment, you couldn't do better than St Martins Lane. In fact, my criticisms are not really criticisms. This hotel will tick all the boxes for a lot of people. It is flawless but it simply isn't to my taste.",4,2011,09,12
125,Simply the BEST!,"I travel a lot and have stayed at some very nice hotels around the world. Never have I experienced a hotel that is this modern and chic, very clean, comfortable beds, great bars and restaurants but most importantly, the best staff I have EVER encountered at a hotel. 

I had an issue with my cell phone and the guys at the front desk allowed me to use their phone to call the US to sort it out. I didn't even ask, they offered! And it wasn't a 5 minute call but that didn't seem to bother them. They were more than happy to do it. Also, we would see them every night and it wasn't just a simple hello. We'd stop, talk and have a good laugh with them. They were AWESOME!!!

Having drinks at the hotel bar was even great! The door staff and bartenders were friendly and kind and they truly made you feel right at home. The drinks and appetizers served were quite delicious too!

Next is the concierge. Having only been to London once before and many years ago, having the assistance of the concierge was great because not only did he have great recommendations but he also got us on guest lists, reserved 3 amazing seats for Wicked (that were much cheaper than what you would pay in NYC and the seats were center stage-12 rows up). Unreal. It also happened to be my birthday and when we returned to our room, a bottle of champagne was waiting for us. Took my breath away. What a wonderful gesture!! Dino is top notch-he really knows what he's doing and delivers the best service possible!

I can't wait to go back to London and stay there once again. Thank you for making it the best experience I have ever had in a hotel. You guys are all truly missed!",5,2011,09,09
125,An exceptional experience. Absolutely perfect.,"My wife and I have now stayed at St. Martin's Lane hotel on a number of occasions over the last 12-18 months. On each occasion it has been a tremendous experience. Prior to staying at the hotel on the first occasion we would have stayed in a number of different hotels, always enjoying somewhere new. After our first stay we were so happy with the hotel that we decided to keep returning and I can truly say that each stay has been absolutely wonderful. From the moment you arrive the staff are courteous and helpful. They cannot do enough and are friendly in a way that makes the hotel feel like a 'home away from home'. The restaurant food is exquisite and the ambience perfect. Throughout each of our stays it is the attention to detail which has really stood out, the extra warmth, generosity with 'extras' and genuine staff who are able to take time without leaving one feeling that they have been bothered in some way.  It is all too often in many hotels that the staff seem to simply tick boxes, fake smiles, half listen, bill for the smallest items, show no signs of generosity. Not this hotel. The fact that St. Martin's  Lane is managed so wonderfully and that these values have disseminated through to the rest of the staff is really of credit to this hotel. Stay there and enjoy. INCREDIBLE.",5,2011,09,04
125,Best location ever...,"My wife and I stayed during the weekend. Loving covent garden, soho, shopping and good food this was a perfect location for our stay. We booked a standardroom. It was clean, cool and fancy in every way....not so big rom however. 
Totally the place to stay next time...if we can afford it:)",5,2011,09,04
125,Getting tired,"Had a night here for our wedding anniversary & overall very nice but for the money, not outstanding. We had a standard double which wad small & looked out onto a brick wall, and was very very minimal. However, gorgeously comfy bed, nice bathroom. The hotel itself is nice in style / feel but didn't really feel very '5 star' - staff weren't that helpful at reception. The restaurant however was a different story, the most amazing breakfast, great produce, lovely environment & awesomely helpful staff, couldn't do enough. The bar is also well worth visiting - fabulous cocktails & lovely atmosphere. Good for celeb spotting if you like that kind of thing.....!! ",4,2011,09,03
125,Outstanding,"My wife and I were celebrating our 43rd wedding anniversary and decided to give St Martins Lane a try on recommendation,and we couldn't be happier, the service we received was superb, the front desk staff are a really happy bunch and we were made feel like part of the family, nothing was a bother to them.

When we got to our room it was beautifully decorated with Rose petals and candles
It was really wonderful, our heartfelt thanks to you all.
We would also like to mention Ivan and the lovely Australian young lady on reception who welcomed us in such a friendly manner, much appreciated after a long travel.
To the maitre de in the restaurant thank you so much for your kind attention you all helped make our weekend a memorable one.
St Martins Lane will be our hotel from now on, on our visits to London, thank younall again and again.......Arthur and Valerie Clulow",5,2011,08,31
125,Amazing hotel!,"Booked a one night stay in a studio room for my partners birthday and loved it.
The whole design of the hotel, lobby and rooms is fantastic.  Its minimalistic but very very modern. I would disagree with comments made about it looking like a hospital and sterile.

Could see nelsons column from our room and 1 minute walk from tube station so ideal location.
Didnt eat in the hotel but went to the bar for a few drinks which were very good and average london price.

Avoid the minibar as the prices are very expensive, do what I did and take your own wine and request an ice bucket!!
Its quite expensive to stay but well worth it for a treat.",5,2011,08,30
125,"Great Service, Great style, Great Location.","Benefiting from an impressively central location, and equally impressive style and service, St Martins Lane was a welcome respite after some long haul travel, and equally tiring nights on the town.

The service is superb, if not a little pricey. we were shocked to be charged for room service, on top of the already pricey cost of the room service menu. + the items in the mini bar are extortionate. so I would recommend a quick trip over the road to the off license for a couple of bottles, if that's to your taste.

The rooms are bright, airy and clean. with a lovely bathroom and a cool lighting and ambience system that allows you to choose from diff styles of colored lights. Perfect for 'setting the mood' ;)

The rooms however are very small. but to be fair that really didn't bother me too much as the location and style and comfort more then made up for the lack of cat swinging space.

Breakfast buffet was included and was very nice, with super helpful staff.

Overall I loved this place and would certainly be hitting it up again.

Make sure you get your self a few cocktails from the light bar on the group floor as well, fantastic white Russians, Dude.",4,2011,08,29
125,Average 4 star hotel,"When we entered the receptionist was busy on the phone and told us to wait until he was finished, which took around 10 minutes ... ! Nice entry ! the rooms look like hospital rooms, everything is white, I mean really everything. This gives the room a very sterile kind of hospital look and feel. The restaurant Asia de Cuba inside the hotel is of very good quality, but you can visit this place also if you're not a hotel guest. We couldn't enter the nightclub of the hotel for non specific reasons. Overall a very overpriced 4 star hotel, with a rude and unprofessional staff. I would never visit this hotel again.",3,2011,08,28
125,A great find!,"We have just returned from a one night stay at St Martins Lane which we booked as a ""package"" with theatre tickets. It is a real gem. Modern but comfortable with some stunning design features. The reception was efficient and welcoming and the concierge really helpful. A huge plus point is its location - really central for the Soho and the theatre district. We had a deluxe room which was spacious and airey with floor to ceiling panoramic windows. The breakfast was huge, well cooked and well presented. We'll be back and will also be trying one of the other hotels in the Group in New York.",5,2011,08,28
125,Comfortable restful stay in the minimalist yet luxurious st martins lane,"Good good deal online, otherwise very expensive listed prices. Cannot fault this wonderful hotel with 2 minor exceptions; they tried to upsell a more expensive room on check-in ( I don't wAnt to hear about the room I didn't book unless it's being offered as a free upgrade) and they reception staff obviously didn't check our package on checkin as the restaurant staff told us (incorrectly)  both mornings that buffet and not full breakfast was included.",5,2011,08,26
125,Welcoming and we will return,The hotel made our stay very relaxing which was just what we needed after flying for 13hours with 2 young ones. Its rare that one can have absolutely no complaints about a stay but the room was perfect and the staff were so helpful and courteous. Breakfast was also good and again the kids were accommodated well. We will be back.,5,2011,08,24
125,"Funky, fun and friendly boutique hotel in a fabulous location","The SML is a great model for boutique hotels: trendy without putting off more conservative travelers, funky without being uncomfortable and incredible service. 
This hotel isn't for those who want the grandeur of the Dorchester. It is modern, well-appointed and full of whimsy. Like a lot of London (and NY) hotels, the rooms aren't large, but they are well planned.
The room service is good, and you have the option of getting Asia de Cuba, which is a real treat.
Good showers and bathroom toiletries. Plush towels, and plenty of them. 
What makes this hotel is the staff -- they can't do enough for you. They'll sort out problems, make reservations, provide recommendations and are incredibly well-connected throughout London.
The rooms aren't completely conducive to lots of work, but they are comfortable enough that I've been able to spend hours at night on the computer.",4,2011,08,20
125,we had a super time and would definitely go back,"The hotel location is superb - very central. Staff were all pleasant and efficient. 
We booked a de luxe room which had a really gorgeous bathroom.",4,2011,08,18
125,Amazing people,"I heard about hotel from my close friend. They were always saying about this very cool place called St martins lane hotel with very comfortable beds,amazing restaurant and outstanding staff all over The place. 
After my stay there I think exactly the same thing. 
Front desk staff is always helpful and ready to joke with you. Specially isabel!!! Mental women ( in a good was of course) 
I went to check out the food in Asia de Cuba. Portions are just huge and taste just amazing. Try Ropa Vieja of Dack and Scallops for staters, black cod for main......delicious!!!!!!
Our waitress (Asian Lady) gave us really good service being at the same time very ...very funny with her small talk. All staff looked like very happy in this place. 
We spent a lot for ths dinner but in the end was worth it. 
Only issue for me was charges for Wi-fi. ",5,2011,08,18
125,It was an amazing weekend and we look forward to going back!,"Even though the room wasn't available when we arrived we were well looked after during our wait.  When we were shown to our 6th floor corner room, it was just fab!  We could see all over the Covent Garden area and beyond.  The decor was simple but tasteful, the accessories in the room were luxurious and even an umbrella was provided.  Thank goodness we didn't need it.  In the evening we had a new dining experience in the Asia de Cuba restaurant on the ground floor.  The service and attention to detail in the restaurant was excellent and although the restaurant was busy the atmosphere was enhanced by this.  The food was absolutely delicious and the portions very generous.  We will definitely be coming back here!!  After dinner we had a couple of drinks in the Light Bar.  The bar with its subtle lighting and unusual artwork had a good feel to it and the same excellent service to match the hotel and restaurant.  The weekend had been arranged to celebrate a birthday and this is one we will definitely remember!",5,2011,08,16
125,Beautiful hotel and great service!,"I had the opportunity to stay at St Martins Lane end of July, and I just had to write and complement you on your service. Never in my life have I been so well looked after.Thank you to all staff at front desk, and particularly Alex from concierge. Not only did you organise dinner reservations for me in London, but you also made reservations for me for my following week in Paris. 
Thank you all for a fantastic stay!",5,2011,08,16
125,The perfect finish to my marriage proposal,"The service I received at St Martin's Lane was the best I have ever know; very possibly faultless to be honest. From the moment we arrived, we were acknowledged courteously, welcomed warmly and treated like we were the most important people in the hotel. It really was superb. I had earlier proposed to my girlfriend and had had a wonderful day in London with theatre, london eye, meal etc. This was finished beautifully on our arrival back at the hotel though. We walked into our room to find rose petals spread everywhere including in a heart shape on the bed, scented tea lights giving a wonderful glow to the room and a bottle of champagne on ice. I could not have asked for more. Impeccable",5,2011,08,16
125,My favourite hotel for business in London,"I love this place, I always make sure that I stay here when I'm travelling to London on business despite that it's a trek to get to where I work.

There are hotels with bigger rooms, there are hotels closer to the city, there are cheaper hotels, however, the staff here are exceptionally friendly.
Victoria and Ed are always incredibly welcoming and the whole front desk team really try and help out whenever I have a request.  I often manage to check in early and am recognised as a frequent guest.  They really go the extra mile to make you feel at home.

The rooms are exceptionally clean with great bathrooms, and the beds are a dream to sleep in (excuse pun).
The only tiny criticism I'd have is that the tvs are all a bit dated, and there's no easy tv menu.",5,2011,08,16
125,"Location, Location, Location","Have stayed here several times on business. Great service, superb location, funky rooms.",4,2011,08,14
125,Great place in a great location...,"Fantastic hotel located in one of the best area for someone that wants to enjoy London...
Only few remarks: the price (18 pounds for person for breakfast...) and the music in the lounge (too loud).
For the rest I would definitely suggest this place...the cocktails are amazing!!",4,2011,08,12
125,Part of the London furniture - a good design hotel,"St Martins Lane is one of these hotels that have been around since some time and still don't disappoint. Indeed rooms can be small but then, you are in London. And, you will probably spend most of your time (re)discovering this great city anyway.

The hotel's location is really ideal, in the middle of lively Soho.

Great design, great restaurant and happening bar.

If you are looking for a warm, cosy hotel with super friendly staff then you're probably better off in another hotel. If you are looking for a stylish base in an ideal location with good service, then this could be your choice.",4,2011,08,12
125,My new London home away from home!,"I travel to London about every 4-6 weeks and have tried out every hotel that is in walking distance from my office in Soho Square - and FINALLY I have found my home away from home. I stayed at St. Martins Lane in the past, but not for the last 18-24 months. I always had an ok experience (the service was ok, but just ok) but the small rooms were canceled out by the affiliate gym - GymBox - that is the best gym I've been to in London and the in-hotel outlet of Asia de Cuba which is always a crowd pleaser. 
I am not sure what happened, but I assume there is new management or a super strict training program - my experience last week at the hotel was BEYOND.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, the amenities were fantastic, room service prompt and delicious, they washed my gym clothes for free each night, the in-room programming was great. The bed was divine and the bathroom towels, shower and products perfect. They did all the little things that made my experience just so special and comfortable. And the location simply cannot be beat. I never do this on business trips but actually saw a show (much ado about nothing) and the concierge suggested an oyster bar just seconds from the hotel that is now my favorite haunt in London (and owned by the Caprice group so will always stay top notch)  I am thrilled to have finally found a hotel that helped me tick all of the boxes of what I need to be in top shape on my trips to London and can't wait to go back!  p.s. Bungalow 8, the lounge in the basement, is faaaaaaaaaabulous.",5,2011,08,11
125,Gorgeous Hotel in West End,"We chose this luxury hotel as a couple traveling with a teenager because it seemed to be one of the few hotels in the theater district that provided two queen-sized beds in a room (whereas most hotels offered only one double bed or one queen bed or two singles).  The room we had was spectacularand spacious with floor to ceiling windows and a very sleek modern design, all in white.  The beds were incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was beautiful, but had one major drawback - no door.  There were opaque glass doors to the shower and to the toilet, but the bathroom area itself did not have a door.  Becasue of the zigzag hallway from the bathroom area to the sleeping area, there was no visibility from one to the other.  Still, this was a bit uncomfortable.  I do not know if this is typical of the other rooms or was unique to our corner room.  That aside, it was a great place to stay, well located and very comfortable.  The staff was uniformly friendly and accommodating, especially the concierges.  They provide free DVD rentals delivered by housekeeping upon request, accompanied by freshly popped popcorn, which was very fun after a long day of touring.  The hotel is expensive, but we felt it was worth it.",5,2011,08,08
125,"Cool, welcoming, friendly, great location and overall hotel perfection!!","St Martins Lane is located near to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, The Strand, so you couldn't choose a better place to stay. Right in the middle of the city center. My girlfriend and I stayed here last night on 7th August. We have stayed in 4, 5, 6 and 7* hotels around the world and St Martins Lane competes and beats the best of them! The hotel staff are just fantastic and helpful in all areas. This place is seriously cool but not pretentious which makes me warm to it even more. The rooms are clean, classy and perfect size. Good quality spec throughout and very nice bathrooms indeed! If you want to impress someone with a hotel then choose this one!
Good food, great bars, fantastic atmosphere and everyone just wants to give you the best service which is so nice to experience. Money well spent!! Cannot wait to return!",5,2011,08,08
125,Highly over-rated,"The design is cool and fun, but really its just another deign hotel. Very 2000 and late, as the song goes. The location is great for a theater weekend, and the restaurant really is super from a to z. The music is a bit loud and you can hear the disco going on well into the morning hours, but I guess that is the charm of the place for many.
Its the service that was really a problem. The keys demagnetized a bit too often and the doorman left me alone in a check room full of other people's luggage. Unsupervised. Wifi was 10¬£ a day. 
Most disappointingly, the concierge (a reason I stay at luxury hotels when I have no time to really plan a get away) was worse than useless. He reserved a post-theater dinner for us at a restaurant whose kitchens had closed by the time the show was out, DESPITE the fact I'd asked. On the 2nd night I asked him to recommend a post-theater meal in the theater district (the first night's show had been south bank), and he couldn't think of anything!?! We were sent in the wrong direction when heading out the the theater that evening and finally, he made afternoon tea reservations at a hotel I had said I did NOT want to go to. Useless.",2,2011,08,08
125,"A wonderfully designed, top contemporary hotel in a fantastic London location!!","My partner and I have stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel twice in the last year where it has offered us a perfectly stylish accommodation, in the heart of London. The vibrant energy and buzz of the hotel coupled with its exceptional service originally urged us to revisit here recently; the atmosphere offers a contemporary and exciting, yet relaxing experience suiting a variety of customers. The open, spacious reception area immediately invited us in as the staff greeted us with a professional, yet friendly tone. The restaurant and bar area were superbly designed, again with welcoming and accommodating staff and service. The rooms are presented beautifully, with a modern design, which enhanced our experience here. We will be sure to return to St Martins Lane when possible; we are confident the fantastic service and accommodation will be replicated and we look forward to it!",5,2011,08,08
125,Perfect!!!,"My husband and I are regulars at St Martin Lane and every time it is faultless!

What strikes you first is the sereneness when you walk through the door. You literally go from the hustle and bustle of London into pure tranquillity! The hotel is immaculate, and as a person who is obsessive over cleanliness I always feel extremely comfortable here. The rooms are pure white with beautiful mood lighting, and we are usually greeted with a nice little amenity!

This time around we ate at Asia de Cuba and I would highly recommend that also! The service was fabulous, where they offered great advice on what and how much to order. Refreshingly they did not sell the most expensive dishes and they soon notified us if we were over ordering (ADC has a great sharing plate approach). We had the calamari and short ribs between us to start then shared the black cod with sticky rice for main, it was stunning. The cocktails were fabulous too!

We always end our evenings at the Light Bar, great music, fabulous drinks and a real party atmosphere.

I genuinely cannot recommend SML highly enough, it is our home from home, and a real treat every time we go. If I had to sum up the hotel and all it has to offer in one work I would simply say exquisite!",5,2011,08,08
125,Perfect for a West End Theatre Break,"I stayed here on the first weekend of August for 1 Night with my partner. We were celebrating our Anniversary and decided to enjoy a Theatre Break in London.

St Martins Lane Hotel is in a great location. 5mins walk from Leicester Square Tube Station, and 15mins walk to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station. Its right in the Heart of the Theartre District, with Restaurants and Corner Pubs everywhere you look.

I thought The Hotel was tricky to find to be honest. I even used Google Maps Directions on my Iphone from Leicester Square Station and still struggled to identify the Hotel. This is due to the very modern look of the St Martins Lane. Its a big glass building that looked like offices at first. No name on the outside of the Hotel also made it tricky to find. After a little confusion though we found the entrance and was ready to check in. *Tip*- Head towards a building with the words 'GymBox' in big white letters written on the outside. The Hotel is next door to this. 

We checked in at around 1.30pm, and got told our room wasn't quite ready yet. (No problem, as the website clearly states 3pm check in). So the hotel kindly stored our bags, and told us they would call me when the room was ready. (Which I thought was a nice touch). We headed out for lunch to the Angus Steak House which was lovely, and 30mins later, as promised, I got the call to say our room was ready! Perfect! 

Jamie (The Doorman) was really helpful, and carried our bags up to the room, and also gave us a quick 5min brief of how everything worked in the room and where everything was. Cool guy! 

The bedroom was gorgeous. Very modern, ameneties included an iPod Docking Station, Flatscreen Tv, Cd/Dvd Player, Air Con, Funky Mood Lights that you change the colours to suit your mood, ironing board, hair dryer etc.. etc.....
The bathroom was very modern too. It had a walk in shower, and a walk in toliet (separated by frosted glass).
I loved the room, and found it very cosy and private, however they ARE very small. There isn't that much space to store bags and things, and you seem to get in each others way when getting dressed. However this didnt put us off one bit, as we managed fine.
Oh, The Hotel also offer a complimentary DVD list where you can watch a large variety of films for free! We ordered a DVD to our room and it came within 10mins. Although it did mention in the room that we'd get some complimentary popcorn with the DVD, and this never arrived. Not to worry though! I thought this was different and a nice personal touch that the Hotel provides. I stay in Hotels all the time through business and this was a first for me. 

We did have a drink at the Bar in the Lobby before we headed to the Theatre, as we were given a free complimentary drink voucher by the Hotel when we checked in. I did have a look at the drinks menu as well, and the prices were very steep. I think the cheapest drink was ¬£11. So after our free drink we swiftly moved on!

Asia de Cuba restaurant looked busy and a really nicely designed Restaurant. If I come back to this Hotel in the future I would like to try a bite to eat in there. The other reviews on here say the food is lovely so I'll be sure to try next time.

12pm Check Out was a breeze. No problems, all done within 5mins, and we were on our way! 

Overall, a lovely Hotel and I shall be back. If your planning to stay between 1-3 Nights, then St Martins Lane is more than adaquet. Any longer and I feel the room may become a little claustrophobic.",5,2011,08,08
125,Wonderful hip hotel!,"From the moment we arrived this hotel was wonderful.  We were met at the door, greeted with a friendly greeting and immediately shown to beautiful rooms.  Public rooms are shiney, crisp and clean.  The bedrooms had high quality linens and a wonderful bathroom with a terrific shower.  The staff could not do enough and always greeted sincerely (not just the usual hello looking the other way you find at some hotels).  Food was excellent but wait staff at breakfast was slow and did not always get the order right even though there were not that many tables full.  Concierge arranged massages in our rooms and answered all of our questions.  Restaurant recommendations were fantastic.  We would definitely stay here again.  If you want a true 5 star + hotel, this is it!!!  Thank you St. Martins Lane Hotel!!!",5,2011,08,05
125,Lovely but ...,"The hotel is lovely and we had a really nice room - but I couldn't help get the feeling that the management spend their time thinking up ways to extract every possible penny from you rather than concentrating on providing a wonderful experience.

For example, no tea or coffee making facility in the room (but you are welcome to order one from room service), a mini bar with prices that put even other hotels to shame (eg a 60p chocolate bar for ¬£2.95) and a doorman who virtually mugged me for my small bag on the way out (despite my protestations that I didn't need any help), carried it the width of the pavement to a waiting taxi and then hovered for a tip. I'm usually very happy to tip but I'm afraid this guy went empty handed.

Another minor irritation - and maybe this is old fashioned - but it's the first time I've had hotel check in staff I've never met before call me by my first name rather than Mr.

So - a lovely hotel in a great location - but not quite the customer experience I'd expect for the price (or even for a much lower price).",4,2011,08,02
125,Nice and comfortable for a business traveler,"Extremely comfortable and centrally located. Great for someone who is in London for a few days for work. The breakfast is amazing and the service is quick. This is great esp  when you have to rush for work early on. 

Would definitely recommend this to friends and colleagues.",4,2011,08,02
125,Superb - one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"The location is perfect - 2 mins from the crowds of Trafalgar Square and yet the room was completely silent - couldn't hear people next door or even in the corridor outside.  The front desk staff were delightful - some of the friendliest I have ever come across - and staff uniforms beautifully understated. The vibe is glamorous but completely laid back - none of that slightly disapproving stuffiness you can get in more formal expensive hotels.  The room was fab - loved the design - every tiny detail considered, plus the lighting and the cool TV unit totem.  Great and very reasonable room service and superb breakfast in the Asia de Cuba restaurant, served by lovely staff guy who hailed from Tibet.  Modern laid-back 'design-aware' luxury at its best.  Absolutely loved it.",5,2011,08,01
125,Great location and wonderful rooms,"We got an upgrade to The Garden Room as it was my 30th birthday yey! Check in staff was very friendly and very welcoming. 
The room was minimalist conforming to Philip Starck's designs. Huge bed with a view of the little garden that had garden chair and table and lovely plants -  a great place to have a drink before a night out. The bathroom area feels like a spa with dimmer switches, candles and some plants. The toilet and shower room are separated with misty glass doors. 
It never felt that we were in London whilst in the room.....we could have been anywhere in the country. 
We got a few drinks vouchers for The Light Box bar at the hotel - that was very much a let down. Small bar, felt like it was a corridor that they decided to make use of. Not really sure what kind of a feel they were going for, but even at 11:30pm it felt like it had no life in it. I think it was trying too hard to be exclusive but definitely did not feel it. 
We have dined at Asia de Cuba before and that was lovely. 
I would stay at the hotel again, eat at the restaurant but felt that the bar did not fit with the concept of the hotel.",5,2011,07,31
125,Nice hotel in a great location,"My wife and I are in our early 40's and we spent an extended weekend without the kids in London. We loved the location of this hotel because of it's close proximity (walking distance) to many of the top ""things-to-do"" sites that a tourist would want to visit.  Also very close to many restaurants of virtually every cuisine and great shopping nearby too. The hotel itself is very modern/contempoarary in it's style. The rooms are on the small side but still comfortable. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. There is a world class restaurant (Asia de Cuba), a nice bar, and a full-on gym (no extra charge) located right in the hotel. I would stop short of rating this a 5 star hotel - it's not the Four Seasons but definitely would give it a 4+ star rating. Would definitely go back!",4,2011,07,30
125,At least once a month,"I've lived in London my whole life, I've stayed, partied, dined and visited the majority of the 5*'s in the capital.
St Martins Lane is the only one with the ability to pull me back at least once a month. 
The magnetic force I think is mainly down to the staff. The 'reception sisters' as I call them are an absolute delight every time I stay. Helpful, charming, efficient and great banter!
Upon entering the hotel I always feel relaxed right away, the personal touch from reception desk always makes sure all the stresses dont make it through the revolving door.
Everything about the hotel and its services has been thoroughly thought through and executed flawlessly.
I've stayed over half a dozen times this summer, and just spent two nights in a corner suite (I checked out, then came back that evening as I wanted more! Thankfully the suite I was in was still available)
Thanks again reception sisters! Fully relaxed and ready to take on the rest of the weekend!! :-)",5,2011,07,30
125,Top notch service in London!!,"I have stayed in various Morgans hotel group properties before and this is the first time in St Martins Lane in London, heart of Covent Garden.  I had an early arrival from San Francisco, arrived at the hotel at 8:30am Sunday morning hoping I can get a real early check in.  The receptionist was most friendly and even apologetic for not having a room available at that time since the hotel was fully booked.  They offered to keep my luggage and promised to call me whenever a room becomes available.  I felt very welcomed and the receptionist was very friendly and sincere.  Since it's early on a Sunday morning, they suggested a few options - enjoyed the restaurant in the hotel, Starbucks across the street or Pr√™t a manger at the end of the block since they open early.  I opted to walk to Pr√™t a manger and enjoyed their coffee and free wifi.  I went back to the hotel looking for charging station when my ipad and iphone ran out of juices.  The receptionist offered to charge my devices behind the service desk, I was very appreciative of the offer but opt to charge it more discreetly behind the wall at a corner of the lobby.  The lobby is beautiful in an understated and modern minimalist way, a few eclectic pieces of furniture but very inviting.  The receptionist called me around 10am to let me know my room is ready, I was very happy and appreciative to have a room available to me so I can shower and relax after a long flight.  
I have one of those smaller but efficiently decorated minimalist room and it was definitely enough for a single traveler.  The TV is stored discreetly behind a tall white lacquered cabinet that swivel.  The writing desk is cool and transparent and the best part is you can turn the light underneath the desk on at night and it turned into a piece of art!!  I also enjoyed the mood lighting on the bed; very cool indeed and best of all the bed is very comfortable!  The bathroom is small but well appointed with wonderful MALIN+GOETZ products and the shower was wonderful.
I took my niece and her boyfriend to the Asia de Cuba restaurant for dinner.  The service was attentive and wonderful and the food quality and quantity were more than I'd expected so it was a pleasant surprise.  
I had a great experience staying at St Martins Lane Hotel and what stood out the most for me was the attentive and warm reception and service I received, they made me feel welcome and comfortable as if I'm a friend, not just a customer.  I had to say this is by far the most unpretentious friendliness I received in my many stays at 5-stars hotels around the world.  Keep up the good work, St Martins Lane Hotel, your guests will definitely return and you can count me as one of those returning in the future!  This will be my hotel of choice in London!",5,2011,07,28
125,A perfect stay in the heart of London!,"From the second my husband and I walked into St Martins Lane, we knew it was going to be a fabulous experience. The location is supreme. It is right in the heart of the city and we could walk to numerous destinations from the hotel. Being theater junkies, we were thrilled to be able to walk to all three shows that we were seeing. From the reception (shout out to fellow Torontonian Jeremy!) to the bellmen (Ed the head!) to the concierge, the staff was beyond amazing. They were over the top friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about their city. I almost didn't want to leave the hotel! :) The hotel is cool and chic and provides a great and inviting atmosphere. The room was ultra clean and refreshing. Gotta love the mood lighting! Hotels around the world could take lessons in customer satisfaction from St Martins Lane! Not only would I highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London..I can't wait to return there myself!!!",5,2011,07,28
125,Fantastic,"Major kudos to the management, they have a fabulous team of people working for them. From the moment we walked in we were treated like Royalty.  Loved everything about this hotel. Would definitely go back.",5,2011,07,22
125,fantastic - what a good placed to stay,"Only stayed one night as it was a business stop over
the staff are attanetive, the hotel clean and what a great location

I will definately go back",4,2011,07,21
125,I always stay at St Martins Lane,"The hotel is going for a hip, chic, minimalist vibe (which it achieves)---but at the heart of it is great service. Example: if you rent a movie (Thelma and Louise, in my case), they give you a giant bowl of fresh popcorn. Little things like this keep me coming back multiple times a year. I also appreciate that it's located in the heart of the theater district (which, for this theater geek, makes post-work shows easy). I love the layout of the rooms, helpful staff, restaurants (solid breakfast)---I even like the new shampoo/conditioner/body wash. Overall, a great place to stay for business travel.",5,2011,07,17
125,Loved our stay and great for families!,"This was our second stay at the Saint Martins Lane Hotel in London and each time we stay we enjoy it more! This time we were staying with our 2 kids so we took 2 connecting rooms, and I cannot describe how great these rooms were! We felt like we were in our own private apartment! In addition, each evening my husband and I went out to dinner while our kids (a teenager and a 10 year old) stayed in the room to enjoy the free DVD rentals and the free popcorn that comes with it! 

Although the hotel does not give the impression that it is a family hotel, we found it to be excellent in the services that it provides to its guests who come as a family. 

The concierge Mark/Mike (sorry bad memory) was outstanding! His pleasant and cheerful attitude was contagious, and he guided us to a walking tour that very few people know about. He also gave excellent restaurant recommendations!

Asia de Cuba restaurant was outstanding both in the creative menu, the service and the lovely design. Definitely worth a visit while in London.

We look forward to our next trip to London and staying in the Saint Martins Hotel again (we hope)!",5,2011,07,16
125,A world-class hotel.,"We stayed here for a week and had a pleasurable experience. The service was exceptional, especially at Asia de Cuba where the staff entertained us and remembered our names each day for breakfast. I highly recommend staying here.",5,2011,07,15
125,One of my favourite hotels in the world!!,"I stayed here weeekend of the 9th of July , this was my third stay at the hotel and again was fab!! The room is perfect , I loveee the breakfast to die for! The hotel looby is just so chic and glam.  I throughly enjoyed my stay! The stay at breakfast were so great, had good chat and very pleasant and always on hand. Cant wait to returnn!!",5,2011,07,15
125,"Amazing Hotel, great location and fabulous staff!","As a regular visitor to The Sanderson, I decided it was time to try its sister hotel St Martins Lane whilst I was in London for three days for a number of concerts.  

I was not disappointed..... The location of this hotel is absolutely great. All of the staff were welcoming and I felt completely comfortable and safe as I was a lone traveller on my first nights stay.  The concierge service was exceptional and they organised both fabulous places to eat (that I'm sure we would have not got into otherwise) and great drivers.

I had a room on the first floor was I usually find to be noisy but there was no noise, the room was very clean and had all necessary amenities, including an extension lead so I could get comfortable in front of the mirror in the room to do my hair!

Room Service (Breakfast) was very speedy and warm and tasty with good sized portions.

A friend and I had a few drinks in the bar late one evening and found it to be lively and welcoming without being too loud to chat and enjoy our drinks.

I am back in London in a few weeks time and will definitely find it hard to choose between staying at St Martins Lane or The Sanderson!!",5,2011,07,15
125,This is easily one of the best hotels in London,"I have stayed at this hotel on business on over 350 times over the last 5 years, so much so that it is a home from home when I am in London.  The location is sensational, for all of my clients in London, as it is so central, and also for all the west end of London has to offer of an evening.  The rooms are excellent, the restaurant more so, and The Light Bar a very entertaining place to hang out for a bit of recreational cocktail consumption.

The main thing about this hotel however, is the staff as they are streets ahead of any other hotels I stay at anywhere else in the world.  From the front desk, to the concierge, the bar staff, the room service staff, to the cleaners, they all without exception go the extra mile, and as a repeat guest they only ever give me reasons to stay with them again and again and again.

This hotel and all of its staff are a class act.  If you don‚Äôt love this place, you‚Äôll never love anywhere and are probably one of those people who are never happy. . .

Book it now!!!",5,2011,07,11
125,St. Martin's Lane - A fantastic hotel,"I spent one night at this hotel and was spoiled! I was able to check in at 10am, a true rarity among popular hotels.  In addition, the staff learned my name within minutes and greeted me by name during the day. The wait staff, bartenders, bell men, were all top notch.  My room was quite stark but had all the amenities I needed.  The hotel is a little over the top in its minimalist decor, but I still loved it.  Its incredibly expensive but if i could, I'd stay here again.",5,2011,07,10
125,Superb hotel!  Will be back!,"My boyfriend treated me to two nights here for my birthday and it was stunning.  On arrial we were amazed at the modern and gorgeous interior and excellent check in service.  We went to our room and I was astonished at the beautiful candles, and flower petals that covered our stunning suite, even in the large spa like open planned bathroom.  We immediately enjoyed the chilled champagne which started our stay off in style.  The location of the hotel meant that we could keep coming back to the hotel in beween exploring and eating.  We also enjoyed drinks in the exclusive hotel bar and had some very tasty cocktails and some complimentary shots.

Amazing hotel, amazing service, amazing stay!!! Will definitely be back!!",5,2011,07,09
125,SUPERB HOTEL - LOVED EVERY MINUTE,"Fantastic hotel, great location - superb friendly staff from the concierge, to the maids to the security team....wonderful",5,2011,07,08
125,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed at st martins lane last weekend, and it was the best hotel we ever stayed at. The staff was wonderful, they helped us with everything you could imagine, always with a smile. 

The room was also a wonderful experience, so light both in color and daylight, and with a wonderful view over the city. They also included everything you wish for.

Added to that you can't find a hotel with a better location, in the middle between covent garden, trafalgar square and Leicester square and specially good for thoose who want to stay close to soho's all gay clubs. 

This hotel is worth every pound. Once you stayed here, you won't pic another hotel in the future.

Best regards niklas and Pierre",5,2011,07,08

The breakfast was ok and was served in the marvelous Asia de Cuba restaurant and we really liked the Light bar too.
Its also in a fantastic location!",4,2011,07,05
125,Super comfortable bed in a great location,"Stayed for a night whilst out wth friends in London, we got a special rate of ¬£240 so worth it for a night, not sure we would pay the rack rate, however super clean room, lovely comfy bed, super-efficient & friendly staff. rooms not huge but bathrooms great.",4,2011,07,04

125,Not What Its Cracked Up To Be,"Been meaning to stay here for years. Decided to treat myself so I could have a lay in and go to work in 5 minutes. Wouldnt say its rubbish but too clinical for me (and I love ultra modern). Plus, the room size and layout was just not good enough. If you want something like this but an alternative then go to One Aldwych. Next stop is the new W for me.",3,2011,07,01
125,A fantastic hotel!,"My co-workers and I have stayed at this hotel for many years and have found it comfortable,fun and conveniently located.  The hotel staff is very accomodating and makes our stay even more comfortable than other other hotels in the area.  I recommend this to not only business travelers, but also to anyone that wants to be in a chic environment with many ammenities.",5,2011,06,29

We will go back again.",5,2011,06,23
125,5 stars Elegance and originality,"After having booked my tickets Opera at  Covent Garden, a few local friends told me that the most original and elegant place to stay in London was St Martins Lane, very good coincidence. My friends were right
From the first minute at the reception for the check in until our departures, we were surrounded with smiles, service, and rare professionnalism, including the concierge.
We arrived early in the morning, and check out early in the morning too. Still, our room was ready, wich was very appreciated, as we tired because of our early flight.
The sober white decoration of the room was perfect to relax and sleep. We had street view room, it was still very calm.
The staff is always properly dressed in a very sober manner, wich is very relaxing for the clients, it makes you feel more comfortable, comparing to very strict way of dressing of the other 5 stars hotels.
The location is amazing, next to a lot of theatres, the Opera,  the National Gallery, and shopping streets.
Definitely the place to be in London,

125,Excellent staff - great relaxed atmosphere,"Everything was exceptional, from the initial contact with Dino [concierge] before arrival; to the reception staff; housekeeping;  room service;  Asia De Cuba and the Light Bar. The staff are pleasant, down to earth and keen to ensure that you enjoy the stay. 
The corner suite was beautiful. The roses arranged by Dino before we arrived in the room were perfect. The room service great, except for one very dodgy desert which was like a brick.  
I am quite demanding of hotel staff and expect to be dealt with courteously and efficiently at all times...St Martins Lane staff certainly lived up to this. I had to call for people to deal with changing reservations, broken glasses, bottle of champagne over the duvet, eye masks...although my request for an eye mask at 4am in the morning could not be dealt with, I felt like the staff had at least tried. [Word of advice, if you plan to be out all night, take an eye mask, otherwise you will find yourself sleeping in sunlight..beautiful though the curtains are, they are not full blackout curtains].
I am already planning to stay here again on 2 more occassions this year. 
The only service that I have experienced which has surpassed the service here was at Christina Ong's Cocoa Island [Como Shambala] in the Maldives.",5,2011,06,21
125,We'll be back!,"We booked this hotel for a group and meeting.  It's in Covent Garden, central location and close walking distance to almost everything.  Great restaurants in and around the area.  Walked to all major attractions.  Could have taken the Underground but enjoyed walking and seeing everything.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their stay.  I think the location had a lot to do with it and the service from the entire staff was terrific.  The rooms are small, but then again I think that is true for all Morgans Hotels.  Housekeeping did a great job in keeping the rooms clean.  Everyone we came in contact with was so friendly.  Cam the Concierge was amazing and full of recommendations of where to eat and what to see.  It was nice to be remembered by the staff each time we returned to the hotel.  Kudos to all for us please.",5,2011,06,20
125,Superlative service and style.,"We found St. Martins Lane through a travel site and chose it based on the photos.  This was the best choice we made for our entire trip to London!

We might have expected snobbishness based on the uber-hip appearance of the lobby.  However the the entire staff at St. Martins Lane was exceedingly pleasant, helpful and accommodating.  The bedroom (two double beds) was cool and well appointed, the beds extremely comfortable.  The washroom was gorgeous and featured a wonderful rainfall shower head.

Following a bad hotel experience closer to the Docklands convention center, we were happy to return to St. Martin's Lane unexpectedly for a second stay during the same trip.  The staff remembered us and made us feel like we were coming back home.

We're looking forward to our next opportunity to stay at St. Martin's Lane.",5,2011,06,19
125,"Anniversary treat, will return","From beginning to end of our stay, the staff were very helpful, friendly and polite, they couldn't do enough for you, we had an excellent romance package which was perfect, bottle of champagne on arrival, candles, rose petals, breakfast in your room, perfectly presented on trolley-table and food was plentiful and perfect, and late check out of 16.00hrs. Which was perfect for our wedding anniversary. The room was spotlessly clean, fresh and the lighting perfect to set the mood, all was very chic and sophisticated, reception gave us a complimentary drink to have in the light bar, it was a delicious strawberry cocktail, the cocktails are a must. We had a superb meal in the Asia restaurant and portions were huge, such tasty food and well presented. Staff excellent. Perfect location to theater will return soon, thanks for a perfect stay.

125,They looked after me when I most needed looking after,I checked into St Martins Lane Hotel to recuperate for an extended period after an emergency operation. The staff were magnificent sourcing for me anything I needed and regularly making sure I was ok. I had a lovely bright corner room which was a great place to rest. I felt like I had a second family looking after me as everyone knew why I was here and was on standby to help. I don't think i have ever had better service. Restaurant Asia de Cuba is excellent; Bar is also excellent and location in middle of Covent Garden is one of the best in the West End. Having stayed at several London Hotels St Martins is the best by a long way,5,2011,06,18
125,"Spectacular Location, Cool Trendy Hotel, Awesome Service!","Our Family had never been to London and of course, the unknown is especially difficult to plan for; and luckily for us, after weeks of research, we stayed at this wonderfully staffed and eccentric hotel.  The location is near the Trafalgar square and the theatre district which made our vacation that much more exciting.  To walk outside and already be in the middle of the city was so convenient.  We were able to walk to the London Eye, the Thames river and pick up a tour bus or cab within minutes maybe seconds.  And at night walk to the theaters and be near great restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner is super convenient when traveling with hungry teenagers. The Hotel is filled with whimsical features, cool furniture and a very knowledgable concierge.  They booked a tour for us to Windsor Palace, made numerous restaurant reservations and suggestions throughout our stay on where to travel, being museums, sights and historic interests.  The hotel room was cool white, lots of mirrors, great bathroom and comfortable queen size beds.  The room service was quick and excellent too!  They even let us borrow some extra electric cords to convert our electronics with American outlets.  We will definitely be staying there on our next visit to London or at any Morgan Hotel in the future.",5,2011,06,17
125,Phenomenal,"I have stayed in St martins lane maybe 10 times over the past 3 years I think it is by far the best hotel in London.
My job requires extensive traveling and in every hotel I stay in I draw comparisons to St martins lane nothing comes close.
The rooms, the view, the cleanliness and the food are phenomenal.
Of course the hotel is also situated in one of the nicest areas in London.
However all the above fades away compared to the service . The guys there really go out of their way to make your stay great. Ask the concierge for anything and you are guaranteed they will give you the best answer and advise .
Steffi whose exact job I don't really know is my guardian angel there she sorts out your reservation and just takes care of you in a genuine friendly way.
My advise to anyone booking try to get a room in the fifth or sixth floor.
The only drawback I can think of is that the air-conditioning needs an overhaul,however I read a review on tripadvisor that they are doing that now.",5,2011,06,17
125,Excellent hotel for couples,"We found this hotel great. The location, service, and a good view from the top floor. The bedroom, the marble bathroom with a great shower, and all public areas were very clean and stylishly decorated. We booked through their own website where they have special offers which makes this hotel, in this location, good value for money.",5,2011,06,15
125,My London go-to spot,"The quiet lobby where you check in during the day is transformed to a party at night.  Very hip hotel, minimal yet upscale rooms.  Staff was exceptional.  Concierge found an employee who knew how to tie a bowtie for me - came up to the room and helped - really cool.  A fun place - way better than ""doilies on the furniture"" stuffy London hotels.  Asia de Cuba is a fun restaurant.",5,2011,06,14
125,Good hotel.  Hip.  Check your bill,"St Martins looks like an office building on the outside, but it is a nice place inside.  The rooms are very nice.  Good modern furnishings in decent repair.  Has a ""boutiquey"" feel.  The bathrooms are nice and big, which is a plus for me.  Free internet if you ask the front desk.  Bed is comfortable and climate controls work well.  I like a cold room.  Turn-down service lit candles in bathroom at night.  Nice!  No noise problems.
Expect to pay high rates, as it is in central London.  Restaurant has excellent food, priced as such and is fairly exclusive -- you may not be admitted when it is busy.  I presume guests get an exception.  A taxi queue is right in front most of the time - I never had to wait for a cab.  Steps from the tube, and within a very short walk to your choice of restaurants and theaters.
Be careful - they charge you for the stuff they leave on the work desk - even the stuff that says ""with compliments"".  Didn't answer email about the billing problem.",4,2011,06,13
125,Great Location and super friedly,Great location for walking to everything.  I'd stay there again.  The staff was super friendly and housekeeping was great. Both function conferance rooms were terrific and our meetings went very smoothly. the working lunch from Ais da Cuba was fantastic,5,2011,06,10
125,Great hotel in central location,"This is the second time we have stayed at St Martins.  It is in a great location and is perfect for shops and nightlife! Everything is clean and very modern - we love it.

It is expensive - as is the bar and breakfast.  However, we managed to get a special price as we made a late booking!

Also if you drive into London the NCP nearby is ¬£40 a night!",4,2011,06,06
125,"OK,  but not for the price","Initial shock at the cost of the room. Then disappointment at the room, I was hoping for wow. Our room was stuck in a corner with narrow corridor. Despite the other reviews I've read staff didn't really seem to have the time for guests. 

It was my fault for enquiring about the pool after I'd paid. At this price I assumed they would have a pool. Also at this price I assumed breakfast would not be extra. Again I was wrong. 

I'm in a minority for not rating this hotel. But I've stayed in plenty of London hotels over the years and I'd say this is about 3 times more expensive than it should be based on my stay. But based on the incredible location and limited availability at other hotels in and around theatre land, St. Martins will be able to get away with mediocre.",3,2011,06,06
125,Lovely hotel convenient for all the London sights.,"We stayed for 3 nights in April the week before the Royal wedding. The weather was lovely and flags were being put up down the mall so we really felt the atmosphere!!
The hotel is lovely, very modern, we loved our room!  Comfy bed with an interesting array of lights which changed colour if required!  
The staff were all brilliant, so helpful and pleasant, they were always there to help us.
Breakfast was really special, lovely selection of fresh fruit, pastries etc.  Freshly cooked hot food if required which was delicious and excellent staff.  What more can we say?  
Convenient for all the sights, we walked everywhere, on the whole we had a lovely stay, highly   recommended!!",5,2011,06,03
125,Gorgeous rooms and location,"This hotel is walking distance from theatres and Covent garden which makes it a great sightseeing location. The staff are very friendly and attentive, and the room we had was very large, particularly for London! The bathroom
was gorgeous with a large shower and bath, complete with lovely products. We ordered room service supper after returning late from the theatre and it arrived in under 30 mins and was of a very high quality( and hot!!) Wonderful home made chicken noodle soup and club sandwich, and the portions were very generous! My son had a cheeseburger and frankly we could have shared it!!
The whole ambience of the hotel is chic and sophisticated , but is also friendly and welcoming!
I would certainly stay here again!!",5,2011,06,03

I had a very cool,comfortable and spacious,south facing deluxe room on the 5th floor with good views,an enormous bed and a really lovely,tranquil bathroom.You can order dvds if you fancy a night in or just a lazy afternoon in bed.There's a an ample selection to choose from,and they are brought to your room in minutes,free of charge,as is the huge bowl of sweet,salty or butter popcorn  you can order with your movies.A very nice touch! I ordered the Cuban Brownie with chocolate sauce,butterscotch thingy and brownie ice cream from room service three nights in a row,it was that good!

Also free internet in the Business Centre.

If you want the centre of London,the West End,moments from Covent Garden,Theatreland,Clubland,culture,amazing shopping,food and the beautiful parks - and also want to feel welcome and comfortable,check in at number 45 St. Martins Lane.

Will come back very soon, greetings from sunny LA!",5,2011,05,29
125,Morgans touch never fails.,"Having stayed, drank and dined in quite a few Morgans hotels, I was quite pleasantly surprised by the lovely St Martins Lane. This particular property is much quieter than the other hotels in the Morgans group where guest rooms sometimes feel as an afterthought to the lobby-bar scene.

The hotel is in a great location, stones throw from a tube station, Starbucks and quite a few pubs. A short stroll can take you to all major shopping enclaves. 

Speedy, friendly service in the airy lobby. Decor is outstanding, in the expected and very much appreciated Starck way. Oversize chairs, whimsical touches (hello garden gnomes) and a restrained, modern elegance.

I had a standard room, it was expectedly on the small side, but very cozy and made the absolute most of the available space due to great design (desk, minibar, closet, etc...). This is not a hotel you can spread out in but as a solo traveller i was just fine. Bathroom was quite large and the Malin + Goetz ammenities were simply outstanding! Bed was very comfortable and the color control lighting was good fun.

Looking forward to staying here again!",5,2011,05,26
125,"THE BEST LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION IN LONDON!","I decided to celebrate my birthday this year in London and Paris instead of my customary Las Vegas celebration this year.  It had been a few years since I had been to both cities and my last memory of London was rainy and wet.  

I love all the Morgans Hotel Group Properties in the USA and was familiar with both Sanderson and St. Martins Lane.  Upon deciding where to stay a few key requirements came into mind.  First and foremost, location, location, location.  After traveling a lot for both business and pleasure I find that it's always best to look into the location of the hotel.  You might get a better rate elsewhere, but how much time and money will you spend going to where you want to be?  The second thing I look for are the restaurants, nightlife, shops, boutiques, sight-seeing, etc.   After finding out that Asia de Cuba was inside St. Martins Lane and realizing that St. Martins Lane is centrally located to everything I wanted to see and do my mind was made up!  

I stayed at St. Martin's Lane from 05/07/11 thru 05/12/11.  I have nothing but rave reviews about everything about the hotel.  Let me begin by saying that St. Martins Lane is definitely conveniently located to everything within a very close proximity to:  The London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus, The National Museum, Trafalgar Square, etc.  Furthermore the best places to eat are close by as well.  I had a wonderful time dining at Asia de Cuba (2x), La Cusine de Joel Robuchon, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, The Ivy, even Nobu was a quick cab ride away.

Our hotel room was beautiful and extremely well done.   I had lots of closet space and even place for my shoes.  The bed was really comfy and the hotel had recently installed brand new thermostats so the airconditioning worked perfectly.

The staff provided exemplary service the entire time we were in the hotel.  They were helpful with suggestions on places we wanted to go to and also they were more than accomodating with any requests that we had.  I was most impressed with Steffi who not only remembered my birthday celebration, but made sure that I was taken care of on all levels.  She is definitely an asset to St. Martins Lane and really an outstanding staff member.

On a side note I must also mention that during our stay we did venture to the other Morgans Hotel Group property called Sanderson.  It was a beautiful hotel as well and we dined at both Suka and attended the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.  I liked the Sanderson too, but I found it not as centrally located to what I wanted to see and do in London.  I will say though it was in a good location as well and very close to Bond Street.  But since I wanted to do a little more sightseeing and walk more I definitely found that I made the right choice in picking St. Martins Lane over Sanderson.

Other things that stood out about the hotel which may or may not be mentioned are:

1) The hotel has a business center on the 1st floor and there are two MAC computers which you can use (for free).  One computer allows about an hour and the other was about 20 mintures free usage.  I found this very convenient because I could still check work and personal email, Facebook, Twitter, mapquest, and even print airline tickets without the need or necessity of lugging my own laptop to Europe to use in the hotel room.

2) The hotel is directly door to a gym called Gymbox.  As a hotel guest, you can work out there for free.  The hotel room even has a white laundry bag that you can put your workout clothes (socks, shorts, tee, etc.) and they will wash it for you so you don't have to keep wearing dirty work out clothes!

3)  I was most impressed with the location of the hotel.  It really is in the best location of London and walking distance to everything.  

My partner's birthday is in December and we are already thinking about going back to Europe to celebrate and I will definitely recommend and rebook at St. Martins Lane in the future!

I will always remember my birthday in London and the amazing time I had staying at St. Martins Lane.  What a wonderful hotel!",5,2011,05,22
125,"Third time here, there's going to be a fourth one!","St. Martin's Lane is always the best spot for me in London. The location is great, right at Trafalgar Square. The hotel is very modern and reminds me of the Ws, which I love. It's all white and very trendy. The beds are just amazing. The staff is wearing t-shirts without loosing the touch fo a perfect 5 stars. The breakfast is very genuine, and so is the room service menu (24hours). Not that expensive, it's worth it! Can't wait ot go back!",5,2011,05,21
125,"Fabulous hotel, brilliant service, great location!","Myself and my husband have stayed at St Martins Lane hotel a couple of times and have thoroughly enjoyed each visit. The service is attentive and friendly without being over the top. The rooms whilst not huge (we stayed in a Superior Queen) are well appointed and 'minimalist'. It would be my dream bedroom...clutter free, white and flooded with light. Gorgeous bathrooms and products. 

Larger rooms are available but considering that you're slap bang in the middle of town and probably going to the theatre or shopping you don't have to spend a fortune. I have also stayed in a 'double double' room for a friends birthday which was great value.

The Light Bar has a brilliant atmosphere and feels very exclusive. Great unobtrusive service and an extensive cocktail list...try the rhubarb and vanilla martini or the pineapple and basil martini...highly recommended':-) Breakfast is served in the Asia De Cuba restaurant and is of a high standard with plenty of choice.

All in all my favourite hotel in London....I wish we could stay more often but as we only live 5 miles north it's hard to justify!

Special mentions to Steffi and Victor who always look after us so well.",5,2011,05,20
125,"Looking a bit dated, entry level rooms very small and very hot! great location and good staff","We stayed for one night on our wedding anniversary -  the room was a little dissapointing for the money -  the double bed fills most of the room and there is very little space either side, the decor is nice as are the linens but there were a few small things that irritated, the volume control on the ipod dock was broken, the dvd player was not connected and the air con would not go low enough to make the room a comfortable heat.... not brilliant for a 5 star. As it was our anniversary reception gave us 2 vouchers for free cocktails in the bar which was a nice touch and worth about ¬£25 I guess. The ""funky"" decor in the communal areas I think looks a bit dated now and could do with  updating.... same goes for the breakfast room.... Breakfast was okay  - the full English is HUGE though!  great that you can have breakfast until 11am too
We got back from a night out and decided to give Bungalow 8 a try.... my tip to anyone is not to bother with it -  l think it's had it's day... I hope the same won't happen to this hotel.",3,2011,05,20
125,"Absolutely Fantastic!!Great Location, Trendy Bars &Clubs, Helpful staff","I stayed here on saturday night and was so impressed. Dont be put off its a little hard to find, after walking past a few times finally noticed it- look out for green glass doors there is no sign. But from the minute we walked in it had a great vibe, service straight away from super friendly staff. The room was beautifully decorated in white linen, with a massive bathroom & mirror for getting ready, & even an ipod dock for tunes to get you started. I would highly recommend this hotel not only for a comfortable business trip but also for anyone looking for a night out !! Perfect location, 5 min walk to heart of leicester square!! And make sure you ask at reception to put your name on the guestlist for bungalow 9 so if you head back early you can have few drinks before bed. I Would definately stay here again!!",5,2011,05,19
125,Bad Hotel - great location!,"small rooms / small beds / window, or even blinds in the rooms can not be opened / the walls are like paper - one can hear every word (and other things going on...) from the rooms next door / smelly, dark hallways / the stuff is busy checking out each others tight suites and talking about it - no time left over for the customers... they now do have bikes for customers, which is nice. great location!
the hotel is trying to live from its hippie reputation years ago - not worth the money!",2,2011,05,15
125,BEST HOTEL EVER!,"It's not the first time I stayed in St Martin's and surely it' s not the last. For the last 15 years I've stayed in most of the top hotels in the centre of London but this one is the only one I strongly recommend for its location, its style, its qyality of living there. The staff is the most friendly and helpful young people you've ever met. Always kind, always with a smile, never rude or arrogant (as the staff in other ""central"" hotels). Not to mention the superb Gymbox, just next door! No wonder why important people prefer to stay here (Steven Hawking was checking in just before me!!!)",5,2011,05,14
125,Fantastic!,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and both times I was bowled over by how fabulous the hotel is.  
First time with husband on mini grown-ups break away from kids.. perfect!
Second time, with girlfriends from up North to celebrate my birthday.
The hotel is beautifully decorated, super cool to look at and the staff are great.  All very helpful, all seem to be happy to be there and keen to make your stay easy.
Special thanks to Ed the Bell Captain for making us old girls about town feel great!
The hotel is located right in the heart of the West End, we spent the weeekend in and out of local restaurants and bars and theatre...perfect.
Our room was gorgeous, nice nd light and trendy, great views and just the right size.  The price was good value, particulalrly for a good quality hotel int he heart of the west end.
I shall most definately stay here again.
thank you!",5,2011,05,13
125,St Martins Lane London - A Pure Delight!,"I just arrived back to the States after spending three nights at St Martin Lane.  You cannot do better on the location - the hotel is 2 blocks walk from Trafalgar Square where I spent two of the nights people watching on the steps well into the night.  The next morning I put my running gear on and ran the 1 mile or less distance through trafalgar square and down the mall to Buckingham Palace - my favorite solo moment of the trip. The weather this time of year is absolutely gorgeous - high 60's -70 degrees and sunny nearly every day.  Covent Garden, Leicster square are all within a few blocks in the other direction.  The hotel staff could not be more accommodating and friendly.  Ivan at the front desk, Michael at Concierge and Chris (I think - greeter) went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy and well taken care of.  The hotel rooms are small (about 300 sq feet and on the 1st floor for a standard room, but we had everything we needed and they event comped us complimentary drinks at the swanky hotel bar, which is buzzing at night. Thanks again St Martin's Lane. I was duly impressed and will certainly be back.

125,Different Experience,"In January I wrote a review on this Hotel that was less than flattering. However though the response to my complaint was very  slow ,eventualy Victoria Stewert the Hotel manager contacted me and Invited us to a complimentary night and a meal in the Hotel restaurant ""Asia de Cuba"" This time our visit  was totaly different. Hotel staff polite and attentive, though people on the door not very good at meeting and greeting. Room excellent.
Restaurant was absoulutely wonderful >Food as good as any Michelin we have dined at. Waiting staff as good as it gets. So much so that when we are in New York this week we have booked the ""Asia de Cuba"" In Maddison Ave. Victoria Stewert  the manager, did what a good hotel manager should do. Give us a good experience and hopefully our first visit was a one off disaster.",4,2011,05,11
125,"Fantastic customer service, really spoiling hotel stay!",I use St.Martin's Lane for business trips and it never disappoints. Staff are incredibly accommodating and it is really central resulting in short stays being stress free. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel on any level.,5,2011,05,09
125,Worst city hotel experience - ever!,"This trip a surprise birthday treat for my husband.  The hotel reception was rude, slow and ineffective.  We had cocktails in the bar and bento box dinner - the service was aweful.  We were asked (aggressively)""Are you last minute?"" we had no idea what the waitres meant but she roller her eyes, snatched our menus and stromed off.  The room was tiny and not very well equipped.  The one high light was the consierge!  What a star - getting us great thatre seats followed by dinner at Sketch, all at less than 24hrs notice!!  I would not stay at this hotel again - but I would steal the consierge if I was running my own hotel!!",1,2011,05,06
125,"Incredible service before, during and after our stay...","We selected St Martin's Lane Hotel for our stay in London for its proximity to Covent Garden where we were attending an event. The reservation and service staff could not have been more accommodating as we were a group booking - despite many changes, additions, cancellations, alterations etc...Throughout the stay the rooms were spotless, comfortable and with some great modern touches but not too OTT you feel out of place. We took advantage of all on site facilities including Asia de Cuba and The Light Bar and have no complaints at all. Thanks to all for an amazingly successful group stay!",5,2011,05,05
125,No place else i'd stay in London,"If you're into a great boutique hotel, in the middle of everything - this is it. The rooms are funky with their adjustable mood lighting, The bars are awesome, great mix of music (the dj's even let me pick music for 1/2 hour in bungalow 8). The conceirge service is second to none - theatre tickets etc.. They'll even keep trying for un-gettable tix, just awesome effort. 

You're in the midst of everything but yet tucked away on St. Martin's lane.  Museums, curry houses, theatre, nightlife, the palace is just a short walk away.  Really no place else i'd rather stay - been going there a few times a year for the past 4 years.",5,2011,05,03
125,"Bright,modern and roomy","Spent two nights in a double queen loft suite.The room was large and bright with huge windows-we had a corner room facing the courtyard so minimal noise.Very large bathroom with great tub and shower.Great bath products.White walls that were extremely well kept.
Very nice bar in lobby with great drinks and snacks.Helpful and courteous front desk and concierge.Cant beat location for theatre and sightseeing.
The double queen lofts seem to be next to elevator shaft therefore could hear the elevators at night when quiet outside.Minimal noise therefore did not impact our stay.Would def return to this hotel.Just five minutes to underground for Heathrow.",5,2011,05,02
125,Fantastic as allways - I'll be back!,"As allways staying at St Martins Lane Hotel was great pleasure. I've been there for both business and pleasure now, and I'm never disapointed. Great service, friendly smiles, great rooms and tempting restaurants. The staff is at there toes to service and support you. I'll be back",5,2011,05,02
125,Amazing and,"Have stayed in London many times before but have now discovered a new favourite hotel - not the easiest to find but when there it's truly an experience. Loved the design, room quite small but with a great view. Very quiet which was a pleasant surprise considering the fantastic location. Very friendly staff. Fantastic to find such a great hotel in such a central spot.",5,2011,04,25
125,"Fantastic location, warm welcoming & modernly fun atmosphere","I'm a fan of the morgans hotel group, so jumped at the chance to stay here while in London.  The modern whimsical decor in the lobby is just my style, so instantly made me feel welcome.  The rooms are mainly white and calming - extremely well-appointed, spacious and comfortable.  Our request for a quiet location was accommodated to our satisfaction and even included a wonderful view.  Check-in was welcoming and swift and the location is really marvelous - easy walking distance to just about everything -- without feeling like you're in a touristy area so much. (Especially theater and restaurants!)  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2011,04,24
125,Home away from home,"As ever, Stephanie and co provided the very best experience. I've stayed here over 50 times over the last few years and it's the best. Great room, attentive service and personal recognition - Brilliant!",5,2011,04,24
125,A saint of London hotels,"As a seasoned traveler, it is rare to find a hotel in London that exceeds expectations especially when the hotel in question has for the last decade been in the pages of the most fashionable periodicals.

Not only has the hotel personality but thankfully so too does the staff,  the rooms do vary but tell the front office staff what is important to you and they will find a room subject to availability that is perfect for you.  Thank goodness the one size fits all doesn‚Äôt apply here and I ended up with a bathtub large enough to fit the Titanic and a shower cubical that a rugby team could shower in. 

Even though the hotel has been open for over a decade the hotel rooms are in very good condition and very well maintained. With added mood lighting, the atmosphere is perfect for couples or those hoping to entertain.

I am not sure what the breakfast staff have in their coffee especially Monica but breakfast staff that are pleased to see you in the morning, full of life and speak English ........ did I fall asleep and wake up in a hotel outside London !! 

The bonus attractions of the hotel are the facilities like the Light bar and the vodka martini's were mixed to perfection and unlike my previous visit the waitress was both beautiful, friendly and a great conversationalist. 

Whilst the hotel does attract the mandatory beautiful people, the face recognition among the front office staff was excellent and turned me from being a guest into a friend so top marks for Morton, Kylie, Victor and John.

The concierges could be more helpful and didn‚Äôt seem to have any clout and getting what I wanted luckily I know London so it wasn't a problem.

Would I stay again, absolutely.",5,2011,04,21
125,We loved it - it was relaxed and comfortable and the staff were great.,"We stayed here for a weekend in April 2011 just so that we could ""do"" some of the London-based activities that we had never got around to before  -  The Royal Opera House, London Eye, Tower of London etc plus a bit of shopping. 

We liked the vibe that this hotel had.  It is extremely comforable and incredibly well-situated for London's theatres.   The staff were friendly and could not have been more helpful.  The breakfast was the best we have had in a London hotel and the kids liked the boxes at Asia de Cube.",5,2011,04,21
125,Loved it,"Friendly service, a gorgeous room, and a phenomenal location.  We love modernism, so the design of this hotel was a real treat -- loved the dial-a-color mood light above the bed, and the bathroom was wonderful.  Our room had a comfortable bed, desk with chair and a spacious bathroom/closet area.  Skip the bilndingly-expensive-but-just-okay restaurant and walk down the street to Joel Robuchon or any of the other great food you can find in the area.  Did I mention the location?",5,2011,04,20
125,Excellent Stay,"This was my second stay in St Martins Lane hotel for a business trip. In both cases the entire experience was superb. The location is great, right next to Covent Garden, Soho and the Theater District. Charing Cross and Leicester Square tube stations are both really close by. 
The check in and checkout were quick in both cases. Breakfast was served from 06:30 until 11:00. The buffet wasn‚Äôt huge in selection but the scrambled eggs and the cappuccino tasted great. 
The room itself was spacious and very clean. The whole decoration was in white and minimalistic which suites my taste.  
The bathroom was amazing, made of granite, a self standing tub, a separate shower and toilet. 
The mood lighting was a nice addition.  Along with the Iphone/ Ipod dock and the flat TV and DVD.  I also used the complimentary DVD service at the room. You get 3 DVDs per night plus free pop corn delivered to your door. Really cool! Also nice was the free to use Business center with 2 iMacs and colour printer, great for printing your boarding pass.  My only objection was the wifi, which I think should be free for the hotel guests in such a hype, and trendy hotel, which attracts mostly a young crowd. 
I am also a light sleeper. Light and noise disturb me. The black out curtains block fairly well all the light coming in from the huge floor to ceiling windows. In addition despite the fact that both times my room was facing the entrance of the hotel and the club on the somewhat busy St. Martins Lane, the noise was blocked really well by the double glazed windows, so I couldn‚Äôt understand some complaints about noise by other reviewers.  Also there was a second stylish door which if closed was isolating the bedroom from the entrance to the room thus blocking the noise coming from the hotel‚Äôs corridors etc. Very few hotels have this really useful feature.
So overall my stay was excellent and I would definitely be returning to St Martins Lane again.",5,2011,04,19
125,Fantastic hidden design in London,I've stayed in London many times and discovered a true gem! The staff were friendly and ready to go the extra mile. The rooms were spotless and the design was great for the size of the room. It was the perfect location- a place not to be missed!,5,2011,04,19
125,Perfect Room in a Perfect location,"I recently stayed at St Martins lane for a romantic weekend with my partner, as was blown away by the experience.  From the moment we stepped out of our cab we were treated like royalty. All the staff were really friendly and helpfull.
The rooms, though compact, are spotless and functional.  Great design and wonderful attention to detail.  
I would definately return!",5,2011,04,19
125,The best in London,"It was my third stay at the St Martins lane Hotel and it was most delightful !
This time I have stayed for 5 days and the room offered was luxurious , wonderfully lighted and so very spacious. The hotel was , as always very welcoming and the staff was very helpful and very polite helping with the luggage and with couple of office matters i had. 
I must say that out of many hotels i perviously stayed in, this hotel is a Home away from home , the best you can wish for .",5,2011,04,12
125,Excellent service!!!!!,"I booked this trip for my Mother-In-Law for her 65th birthday, and because she does not ""do"" the internet, I'm completing the review for her.  First and foremost, because it was her birthday, they were upgraded from a Queen to King which they were grateful for.  Second, the staff were extremely polite and accommodating, mentioning the fact it was her birthday throughout the entire weekend.  When they arrived on the Friday, there were cakes waiting for them in their room, which, might be standard for all guests, but they appreciated the gesture.  Also, on Monday, her actual birthday, there was a bottle of champagne waiting for them when they arrived from their day out.  

This was definitely a ""treat"" for my parents as they don't normally stay at 5* hotels, and they loved the fact that they were treated just like everyone else who would stay at a place like this regularly.  Their primary ""likes"" were a) the minimalist decor; b) the cleanliness (according to my mother-in-law, who is an absolute clean freak, it was SPOTLESS); and c) the friendly and accommodating staff.  All in all, an excellent experience.  

The only ""negative"", and I'm not even sure I would call this a negative, was the experience I had with the reservations desk prior to their stay.  A bit too convoluted to explain here, but in short, went around the houses a bit enquiring about purchasing a room upgrade, etc.  This is the only place where their Customer Service ""fell down"" a bit, and again, the trip, and stay itself were faultless.",5,2011,04,11
125,need to pay a lot more attention to the reception service,"Liked the decor & the food, but had a disaster at check in & checkout with random amount of money being deducted from cards of myself & my colleagues. Amounts deducted again on checkout, took 2 weeks AFTER the stay to settle it all down and ensure that we had not been double billed. All through this the very attractive and stylish reception made us feel like it was out fault that they had not been trained properly. Got a fairly dismissive email from Management a week or so later after complaining in writing. 
Rather amusingly, Simon Schama, one of my favourite historians/authors ,was having an arguement with reception about them having screwed up his reservation, as we checked out. We exchanged wry shrugs and raised eyebrows. Best part of the stay really.",3,2011,04,01
125,Perfect this time,"While things didn't go well last time round, the hotel contacted us in response to our complaint, asked us to come back and promised to do better next time. Well, they exceeded their promise by far. 

Everything was perfect from check-in until leaving the hotel. Found a personal note and a bottle of champagne in our room - which was a couple of levels better than the one we had originally booked. Staff were delightful, super-friendly and charming. 

We only had the time for a shorter trip this time and thus unfortunately did not manage to enjoy Asia de Cuba and the bar but it seemed that both places were in steady demand Friday and Saturday night.

If the last weekend was the ""usual"" SML, they are certainly at their very best (again)!",5,2011,03,28
125,"Uber Cool, Super Trendy Hotel - Superb Location and Amazing Service","Wow, we stayed in St Martins Lane Hotel for two nights and I can honestly say, it was an amazing experience from the moment we walked in the door to when we checked out. The lobby is very trendy but the service was the good old fashioned quality not often seen in London.

We loved the room, especially the bathroom which was huge and really stylish. The location of the hotel is spot on, you are seconds from all the great shows, art galleries and the tourist traps. When we checked in the desk helped us with the local restaurants and sorted out reservations.

Breakfast every morning was great, the buffet is really different from anything you normally see in England, great selections, great quality and really fresh. 

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.

We will definitely stay here again. (and we live in London)",5,2011,03,25
125,Style over substance,"Nice looking stylish hotel , with great design features and the wow factor- friendly and efficient front desk-
Air conditioning didn't work properly in the room, and the hotel corridors were boiling hot
Bar experience was very poor, unfriendly , and quite snotty
Breakfast took ages, and at ¬£ 25 each was poor value for money.
Didn't  notice until afterwards that a 15% service charge had been added .. Not worth it
Shame that the service let's down what is a very nice Morgan hotel 
Would not stay again - this is a shame , as the location just off trafalgar square is brilliant",2,2011,03,22
125,Nothing was too much trouble,"I was lucky enough to stay at St Martin's Lane on February 26th 2011 and I must say from the moment I walked in to the moment I collected my luggage the experience was just unforgetable. 
When we arrived we were checked in by friendly staff who told us everything we needed to know . We then entered the room and It was very kwirky which I loved , was very white and clean. I loved the space ship style TV and mood lighting . 
We dined in Asia De Cuba and my mouth is just watering from writing this as the food was just simply sublime and melted in my mouth , also had the most intense flavours which just made you want more and more. The waiter that we had was really lovely and made us feel very welcome indeed and was quite humourous too . After dinner we decided to have a cocktail in The Light Bar , I was loving this and also had a complimentary strawberry cheesecake shot !! The cocktail and service was just great .
The next morning we decided to try out the gymbox which is probably the best hotel gym I have ever been to , was state of the art equipment and so much choice. After working up an appetite we then had breakfast , the buffet pastries were so fresh and the hot food was cooked to order and was fit for a king !!! 
I would definately return to this hotel when I get the chance as it just had style , service and value",5,2011,03,15
125,Modern Hotel in the heart of London,"My husband was sent to work in London and we were put in in this hotel.  You can't beat the location especially if you're a theater buff, located in the middle of London's West End.  But also located centrally you can walk everywhere if you wish or there are multiple Tube stations all around.  Pubs, Cafes, Restaurants surround the hotel as well.  We had a wonderful stay partly because we got a good rate on the hotel and when we got there because we were staying for a week we received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room which is larger with a King bed so it really made our long stay much more comfortable.  Hotel staff was superb, anytime I called for anything they sent it right away (I even asked them to empty out the mini bar so I could use it as a fridge and they obliged and came up to clear it out) housekeeping was excellent, they came right away when called and cleaned the room thoroughly.  Only thing to keep in mind is that because the hotel is centrally located you will hear outside hustle and bustle at night so it's not super quiet but not really loud either, if you're looking for a quiet hotel stay you'll have to look outside central London.

We had dinner at Asia De Cuba (restaurant inside hotel) one night and the meal was delicious.  If you won't be making it out to Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood to dine at the one located in the Mondrain Hotel then you must try it in St. Martins.  The food is pricey but they give you lots (family style) and so yummy, their signature dish is the Lobster Mashed Potatoes so make sure you order that.",5,2011,03,15
125,Expecting so much more.,"We just got back from a trip to London and Paris.  This is not the first time I have been in Europe so I am not an American looking for large rooms and judging this hotel based on what I have found in the US.  On the contrary I am basing this review on what I have found and comparing it to boutique hotels in Rome, Paris and simply on it's own merits.  The hotel is not impressive on drive up.  It is next to the gym which is supposed the best in London.  The outside is not attractive at all.  While expecting contemporary I was not expecting cloudy glass windows and no art work of any kind.  The lobby is not at all inviting it has practically no where to sit but on little seats that look like teeth.  There is no art of any kind.  The walls are white.  The feeling is that of a hospital, however the hospital does more in the way of decorating.  As for the rooms, while small is expected, the room was so small with no dresser and no where to even lay your suitcase.  There was about a foot on each side of the bed.  I did pay for an upgrade and while the new room was well worth the $45 a night they charged me it was not what I would expect of a superior room either.  I still only had one piece of decor in the room and that was a clay pot hanging from the wall with fake flowers in it.  Yes I mean an eight inch clay garden pot.  
I did like the bathroom in the upgraded room.  The showers were nice size.  The only difficulty is that the plug is in the bedroom. They do provide an ext. cord.  However our American appliances do not have long enough cords to make it to the mirror.  Their blow dryer was fine.

As for the location, it was great. Near shopping, theater, and any option for dining that you could want or need.    I found London to be an amazing city.  The food, the people and the options for activities were wonderful.  I would definitely return, I just would not stay at this hotel again.  

I was their during the fire alarm episode that was discussed by another reader.  I guess this could happen anywhere.  So it did not have any bearing on my review.  If you are staying here and want to try a good restaurant, try Browns.  Of all the restaurants in Paris and London I went to, this was one of my best surprises.  The food and service were great.  The prices were very fair and we were with 10 people and we all felt the same.  It is just a few steps away from the hotel.  I had the best Chicken Pot Pie at the Tower of London.  Who would have expected that.  Their food was wonderful.",3,2011,03,13
125,5* in every respect,"A superb boutique hotel, right in the heart of theatre land. Everthing about this hotel oozes class from the amazing manager Ms Stewart right down to the person who opened the door of the taxi when we arrived with a real welcome and not one of those meaningless ""have a nice day"" that annoyes everybody these days. 
Definitely one of the best beds we have ever slept in and 99.9% satisfied. (if there was a nice easy chair in our room it would have been 100%!
Doesn't get much better than this",5,2011,03,12
125,To pricy - Fire alarm went off in middle of night...,"First of all, to pricy for the small rooms, and bar and lobby are not cosy.  Some kind of nightclub run beside the bar, clearly with no security as one guest pulled a fire alarm, causing evacuation of the hotel at 3 o'clock in the morning.",1,2011,03,08

125,Abuse of personal credit card information,"I stayed at St Martins Lane Hotel in February'11 and paid all the amount for 2 nights stay. 

However, I realized that 90 GBP more charged to my credit card one week later I left the country. Without giving any information and getting approval from me! No invoice was sent to my address or e-mail, either. I just realized it in the credit card expense summary.

It is really a shame that such a hotel (!!!) did not give any information while using personal credit card details. I really did not see that situation even in the worst hotels. This is definetely the abuse of the information given.",1,2011,03,04
125,"Hip, clean, great location, excellent.","All in all, a very good experience.

Typical Morgan's hotel- very hip & quirky lobby, with great service. The room was decently sized for London, clean & well designed. The desk is a bit odd, but it works. 
The bed & pillows were extremely comfortable as well.

Used the GymBox (free w/ stay) next door, which was quite convenient. 
Great location by the theaters and Leicester Square, and a short walk to where I was going. The restaurant was good for a late dinner, but absurdly expensive. 

Some similarities to the Sanderson, but I like St. Martins Lane a lot more.
I'd recommend it and will probably try it again.",4,2011,03,01
125,Fantastic Hotel,"Myself and Motherinlaw stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel on the lead up to Christmas.
We had a fantastic time and really enjoyed the hotel.  The rooms are so luxurious and the staff were so friendly and helpful.  Over all this is the best hotel in which I have stayed and will certainly be staying here again on my return to London.",5,2011,03,01
125,Love it....,"This has got to be one of my favourite London hotels. Stylish, contempory and lashes of modernism. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the the drinks at the Light Bar were just amazing! The bed is the most comfortable ever slept in.
Only downside was the amount of noise the other guests made that night, with a huge argument going on a couple of doors down, but no fault of the hotel ofcourse.
Thank you St Martins Lane, for making it a great night!",4,2011,02,28
125,Why stay anywhere else,"I have been to London several time, and this is the second trip from the US for my wife and I with our daughters.  I love TripAdvisor and as we travel a lot I always look at the reviews and take things with a grain of salt.  Some of the negative reviews were ridiculous. 
Too dark in the elevators?  It's called style and ambience.  It's not like bulbs were out.

The location is perfect for sightseeing, its really a 15 minute walk to most tourist areas.  We had stayed near Piccadilly previously.   While we loved that, this hotel gave you location with some charm attached.  The rooms were cool and a great size for Europe.
The service was friendly, helpful and not stuffy.  If you like a cool, current vibe this is a great hotel for you.  The lobby has a collection of some of the most interesting pieces you will ever see.

The concierge was nice and knowledgeable. So important in my opinion.   They had welcome amenities for my kids, that they emailed me about in advance so they could be personalized.  You want coffee at 7:30, it arrives at 7:30 whether you put the sign on  the door or call at 7:20.  I could go on, but 5 days and no negatives, why would I bother to say more?",5,2011,02,25
125,They've spoiled me for anyplace else!,"I have been in love with St Martins Lane since I was living in London 10 years ago and some friends who came to visit me stayed there.  However, for the past 9 years I have stayed in various other hotels on my twice-yearly trips to London.  Then I took advantage of a very good rate and finally got a chance to stay at St Martins Lane.  And after staying at SML twice now, I know I will never stay anyplace else.  Yes, it's aesthetically extremely pleasing, and it's definitely a ""cool"" place to stay, but the thing that has ensured I will always return is the absolutely excellent service.  From the very beginning of my stay, each time, the staff have been extremely welcoming, accomodating, and generally always willing (no, eager) to go the extra mile.  And they seem to be extremely loyal to repeat customers.  For instance, I met Lindsey (one of the reception staff) when I first checked in on my first visit and she was so helpful and just lovely - she knew I'd been traveling all night and went out of her way to find me an extra-nice room, hours before check-in time.  I was looking forward to seeing her again when I returned, and I was blown away that she remembered me! I imagine there was some sort of note in the computer but it still made me feel good. I spoke to John (another one of reception staff) on the phone prior to my second stay, and he went well out of his way to ensure my every need was catered to during my stay. Jose was also extremely helpful, as were all of the concierges I interacted with.  In general I constantly felt like the entire staff had a common, singleminded goal to make sure that my stay was happy and that all my needs were met.  I wondered where they got the time to take care of the other guests, since they were lavishing so much care on me!!  At a hotel like this one, the staff are often a bit snooty, I suppose to maintain the image that this is a very posh, exclusive hotel, but this is absolutely not the case at St Martins Lane.  I can t say enough great things about the hotel and especially the service. Felt like a queen during both visits!!  I actually spent some time trying to figure out what important person they had mistaken me for before I realized this is just how things are done at St Martins Lane.

Also, as others have noted on this site, the location is absolutely incredible; it would be hard to imagine a better location - right in the theater district, near tons of museums, monuments, great bars, clubs and restaurants, and very close to the Tube - the Piccadilly line, which is very important when you're arriving after a long overnight flight into Heathrow, loaded down with luggage.",5,2011,02,23
125,This is my new favorite hotel!!,"I cannot say enough about St Martins Lane... I LOVED this hotel!!  It has a super modern aesthetic, which may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it was right up my alley.  Really quirky lobby, dark blue-lit elevators with music and video screens, room numbers ingrained in the carpet, and beautiful (although small) rooms.  The rooms are entirely white, with the exception of some small bright accent walls and this fun lighting system that lets you choose the color of the light on a wall.  The bathroom was very modern and clean, with high quality products, and some SERIOUS water pressure.  The bed was the softest I've slept on in a hotel outside of the US (and that is saying a lot... beds in European and Asian hotels tend to be hard!).  They left little chocolates during turndown service and had live plants in the rooms.  Can you tell I pretty much loved it?!

I also found the service to be of the highest quality.  I was immediately greeted upon arrival and the people at the front desk remembered me and greeted me every day of my stay.  The tall cute Norwegian was especially nice.  :)  I had an issue with the heating in my room (the A/C wouldn't turn on, so it was stuffy and warm), and maintenance arrived within minutes of my call, made some repairs, and stuck around to ensure the room cooled down.  Very effective and efficient.  Breakfast in Asia de Cuba was included in my stay, and the morning staff there were also really friendly and attentive.  They remembered me and made pleasant conversation, as well as were great at their jobs.  They helped my day get off to a nice start.

Finally, the hotel is in a FANTASTIC location, right in Covent Garden, near Leicester Square and the West End theatre district.  It's within walking distance of great shopping on Regent and Oxford, and has tons of tasty restaurants nearby.  I had drinks and apps at the Light Bar in the hotel, and they were delicious but quite expensive. 

I can't wait to get back to London so that I can stay here again!  LOVED IT!",5,2011,02,21
125,happy stay in hip hotel - they went the extra mile,"We had a wonderful stay at St Martins Lane Hotel end August beginning September 2010. Everyone was so helpful and so friendly, nothing was too much trouble. We were greeted warmly on entering and leaving, our late night DVD selection and popcorn was delivered with a smile, we were given maps and directions to the restaurant of our choice, in fact the restaurants were booked for us. We loved the hip young feel in the foyer, the comfortable bed and spacious bathroom and the fulsome breakfasts. The cherry on the top was arriving back one evening from watching a moving play to find our bed and bath sprinkled with rose petals and a bottle of bubbly on ice. We can't wait to get back!",5,2011,02,15
125,A wonderful place to stay!,"This hotel has it all; class, coolness, great food and drink and FABULOUS service. I cannot fault St Martin's Lane Hotel at all. I have stayed here on many occasions and it is always an absolute pleasure to do so.",5,2011,02,14
125,"Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff","St Martins Lane hotel is in a fantastic location, staff were really helpful and friendly.  Dinner in restaurant for 15 people was excellent quality.  Looking forward to making another booking soon.",4,2011,02,09
125,Excellent Service and Fantastic Experience,"My sister and I visited London from the US to spend time with my niece, who is in school there for the semester.  To say that everyone at St. Martin's Lane was incredibly welcoming is an absolute understatement!  We arrived as typical American travelers after long, delayed flights and Chris graciously took our bags to our room, showed us all the amenities and welcomed us with his kindness.  
The room was fantastic--the beds were so comfortable that we actually needed to schedule wake up calls so that we didn't waste away our days sleeping in them!  The bathrooms were wonderful and well stocked and, if we needed anything, the front desk was always willing to help.  
Michael Fitzgerald is FANTASTIC.  We worked with him many times for recommendations for not only restaurants but sites, travel arrangements and directions. He must have printed us at least 15 maps to show us how to get from point A to point B.  He was so enthusiastic and helpful that I would go again just to say hello!!  
While we are not club goers, we were welcomed in the fabulous bar both in the lobby and within the restaurant.  The service was impeccable.  
Our return flights were cancelled due to a blizzard in the US and when we needed to extend our stay and have laundry done, they could not have been more accommodating and kind to us.  They checked on our flights, made transportation arrangements to the airport for us and helped us in every way.  
St. Martin's Lane will be our recommendation to other family members as they, too, head to London this spring and beyond.  I would give them 10 stars if possible.  It was one of our best hotel experiences in both Europe and the US, and we are well traveled.  
Thank you to everyone at St. Martin's Lane!  You've got a customer for life!",5,2011,02,08
125,Guests come last..... !,"To give some context here we are both regular business and social travellers and like to stay at a few boutique hotels every year. We have had some great experiences all over the country and so were looking forward to a long weekend at the St Martins Lane Hotel to take in a trip to the Ballet and to enjoy having central London on the doorstep.

Overall we couldn't fault the style of the hotel, great room (although had to move rooms once to get a bath !) great food and mostly good staff.

The hotel fails appallingly though when it comes to looking after the guests and also everything in room was stupidly expensive.

1. Looking after guests

- When we checked in our luggage was put over by the door, I asked the receptionist if someone was going to secure it, she said it was no problem and very safe, so safe in fact that after keeping an eye on it ourselves for a few minutes, we decided to retrieve it and take it to our room. No one noticed and no one ever queried where it was. For all they knew it could have been anywhere !

-At the end of the first night after returning from a night out we tried to get a drink in the downstairs bar only to be turned away by a hostess. The main bar was also for reserved guests only. Effectively if you are guest don't assume something as logical such as you will be able to use the Hotel Bar ! 

-On our second night we reserved a table at Asia De Cuba. Our reservation was at 9.00 and mid afternoon I changed it to 8.30. We came down to the bar at 8.00pm and were able to get a small table for a pre dinner drink. Before our drinks arrived though we were told that we must now take our table in the restaurant and couldn't stay in the bar, I have never heard anything like it !, This was because our table was now 8.15 and if we didn't go in we would lose our table. We complied with this ridiculous request so we didn't lose our table and as a consolation we were told we could come back into the bar later after our meal ! Wow what luck ! Unsurprisingly we didn't bother !

-Restaurant Experience was better, great food and drink slightly odd patronising service though with every waiter saying everything that we ordered was their favourite and we would adore it along with a weird approach to advising us how to order off a menu ! not exactly rocket science, I think if my wife wanted some cocunut rice, she didn't really need to be asked if she was sure she really wanted it !

2. Costs

We are very used to Hotels charging daft prices for things to take advantage of guests being in relaxed carefree states of mind but St Martins has to wind the award for lunacy.

Everything in the room had a price, ¬£20 for a laundry bag, ¬£25 for a small bottle of Vodka and ¬£8.50 for Barocca. Even the plastic coathangers had a price. I have no objection to inflated hotel prices but when paying over ¬£800 for a weekend is it unreasonable to expect that a cloth laundry bag thrown into the deal would be too much to ask.

So......

We won't stay there again....the main points to watch for / expect if you do are...

a. Everything is very very expensive (not sour grapes as I am happy to pay for great service) but just the highest costs I have seen ever for in room items.
b. The coordination between the bars, restaurant and main hotel is non existent. External Bar Guests seem to be more attractive to the hotel than residents. There is just no real choreography to make guests feel good something the management should urgently fix.
c. Process and income outplays customer experience every time, the bar experience was probably the main reason I will never visit St Martins again sadly.

Overall a very disappointing way of spending over ¬£800 for a weekend in a City with so much choice all around....",3,2011,02,06
125,"amazing bed, amazing sleep","We stopped in London for two nights on our way home after three weeks honeymooning in Italy, and when we got to our room, there was a big heart made of pink rose petals spread out on the bed. and more rose petals and lit candles throughout the room. and champagne on ice! This was a great place. the mattress was seriously amazingly comfortable. The hotel is kind of hip and fun, and the staff is really nice. the concierge called British airways for us when we couldn't get through. I will absolutely stay here again.",5,2011,02,01
125,"Slick, stylish what a superb location","We stayed at this hotel last weekend, for a dinner in London.  Great location and a superb vibe within this five star establishment.  Our welcome was first class and once we were in our room we were suitably impressed with the decor, the view and the cleanliness was immaculate.....the light bar sets the evening off well - great Mojitos.",5,2011,02,01
125,Still excellent in all departments,"The St Martins Lane hotel is still in a fantastic spot in London (of course), the design and feel of the hotel fabric is still chic / arty / stylish (of course), and the staff are still absolutely brilliant. In fact, despite the hotel's superb overall appeal, it is the staff's attitude and ability that make St Martins Lane outstanding.

There is no messing about with prices - it's expensive - but you pay for what you get. If you are basing yourself in or around Covent Garden, this hotel must be pretty much unbeatable.

Only gripe is the charge for Internet. This is not in keeping with the style and grace of the place and should be axed in this day and age.",5,2011,01,28
125,Dreadful,"My partner and I were having a relaxing weekend in London before starting a very busy business year . We booked into the St Martins on the first of January for two nights. Chaps on the door not that helpful when we pulled up, rather ignored us. However reception was fine as was the room. Cocktails poor. However used to London hotels not being up to scratch compared to Europe ot USA.  Though the excepthion we would say is the Langham. Real issue is we had breakfast on last morning. My bacon was rather a strange colour but having already sent back a very stewed pot of coffee I ate only a small amount.  Two hours late on arriving home I had food poisoning. My partner with medical knowledge had to look after me for two days I was very Ill. Wrote to Hotel when I recovered have Not had a reply e-mailed Hotel group have not had a reply. Local authorities now seems my only recourse",1,2011,01,27
125,Nothing special on a special occasion,"My (now) wife and I spent our first night (ie. the night of our wedding) at the St Martin's Lane hotel in 2010 and were left thoroughly disappointed. The hotel reservation team and the check-in staff knew it was our wedding day when I checked in, and my wife and I returned to the hotel around midnight and full wedding attire... during the entire stay not one ""congratulations"" from any member of staff, or simple acknowledgement that this was a very special day for us.

We proceeded to spend our honeymoon in Thailand where the Grand Hyatt in Bangkok laid on fresh fruit, a chocolate fountain, a bottle of Prosecco, a room upgrade, etc for us.

In terms of service and value I don't feel the St Martins Lane hotel lives up to it's price tag. Good location, rooms are fine, but definitely low on customer service!",2,2011,01,27
125,Excellent,"Great location, cool atmosphere and clean rooms with really nice staff. 
A perfect hotel. 

Asia de Cuba, the hotel restaurant, was very nice for breakfasts, but quite disappointing at lunch.",5,2011,01,16
125,Losing its Lustre,"I have always been a fan of St Martin's Lane since it opened - I had my 21st birthday dinner at Asia de Cuba almost 10 years ago and always thought it struck a great balance between being sexy, fun and chic. 

My most recent stay left me feeling a little bit cold, the hotel has begun to feel a little bit tired. Everything is showing signs of wear and tear. The rooms here were never huge but now they seem very expensive and pokey when compared to similarly priced offerings in the area from Firmdale and others. 

The service was absolutely fine, and the location is great but I was just left with the general sense that St Martin's Lane had lost its sparkle. It may just be that these hotels simply aren't as white hot fashionable as they once were but I was definitely left wanting more for my money.",3,2010,12,19
125,Possibly the worst hotel I have stayed in,"What a disappointment. Always wanted to stay here (it used to be Leo Burnetts London HQ) and went to a client do. Poor receptionists. Very dark lifts, very dark rooms. What's going on? Our room was tiny - very little space at all... Bed was fine. Huge price list in the room where you could pretty much buy everything - at a massive price -  ¬£5 for an average bottle of water, ¬£30 for the alarm clock?? . Wife complained about the light. The whole hotel is 'dingy' in that corridors, lifts and rooms are dark. Our room certainly wasn't clean - but then again how can the cleaners clean in that light. 

Very disappointing corporate dinner - soup ok, main course very overcooked and dry and totally uninspiring.

Strange bar with a bouncer on the door even though the bar is inside the hotel?  You'll need to show your room key to get in to the bar.

Breakfast at ¬£23 is very pricey - so ¬£46 for 2.  But that came to over ¬£100 on the final bill?  Telephone calls when I complained on checkout resulted in a free breakfast.

I'd avoid it - there are many better options in London. The only real thing going for it is the location which is great.",2,2010,12,05
125,Simply an 'AMAZING' hotel! Book it NOW! :),"I with two girlfriends (all under 28) visited SML Hotel for a 1 night stay (in a double loft suite) as a birthday celebration. We booked the 'Spread the love' package as this included champage and 4pm checkout along with 2 queen beds which was ideal. Beforehand we arranged reservations at the Hotel restaurant (Asia De Cuba) and spoke to the concierge regarding early check in, Bungalow 8 (the hotspot club in the basement!) and a few mentions of the 'celebration'.

On (early) arrival we checked in and much to my delight I was advised we had been upgraded to The Penthouse. We were escorted to the 6th floor and presented with a FANTASTIC room which was sleek yet understated including dining area ,sitting room, TV and bathroom with ajoining double bedroom. There was a private corridor as it wasin fact two seperate rooms! To say I was impressed does not quite cut it, it was absolutely divine and a perfect start to my birthday celebrations! We had champers in the bedroom along with the mood changing lights with the floor to ceiling glass overlooking Covent Garden which is the 'St Martins Lane' thing! We had a free-standing bath tub and separate shower - no door though so a tad awkward to use the bath tub without locking the main door to the bedroom but there was so much space it was fine to all spread out. 

Staff were exceptionally polite and helpful yet down to earth and far from snooty or pretentious in any way. The laid-back attitude was different to what I had expereinced in 5 star hotels but being informal did not take away for the standards which spoke for themselves. We had arranged to swap the extras with the package (rose petals/candles) for another bottle of champage as discussed with the concierge however there was a bit of confusion regarding this which is probably as there does seem to be a few different concierges. Nevertheless our 2nd bottle of champagne arrived before we headed out so no complaints! We did also have to arrange the set up of the rollaway (which was the largest I have ever seen!) but housekeeping were quick to deal with this.

We had reservations at Asia De Cuba which I read countless reviews on and had expected it to be rather plush but pricey. Far far from it (pricey bit). We were seated immediately and given compliementary champagne. Our waiter (Andrew) was attentive and full of recommendations but NOT pushy in any way. He advised us to share mains which we couldn't (due to diets!) however we skipped starters instead. I went for the slow-roasted pork which was the best pork I had ever eaten! The portion was very large so unfortuantely I only got through half of it as I needed to save room for dessert. We opted for a small portion of the mexican doughnuts and the sorbet to share which was ample for 3 - again perfection. The sorbet was presented on a dinner plate with a birthday message and candle - yes I felt special! Finally our bill was at least a third less than we expected even with a tip and very much worth it (around ¬£180)! Yes the music was loud, but the ambience of the restaurant was right up our street - vibrant & lively! We were surrounded by people from all walks of lives, families, friends and couples - we were quite dressed up but noticed that most people were quite laid back and looked comfortable. Sharing here is definately the done thing and the advised thing so don't hold back! Don't be put off by reviews shouting about the prices, if you like good food and great service then you must visit here. The atmosphere was buoyant - you can't put a price on that!

After a freshen up (and outfit change!) we headed to Bungalow8 which the concierge had confirmed our guestlist entry. Now I had read/heard this was only a members only so entry was only with a member, as a member or a small possibilty if you were staying at the hotel. Now we had NO PROBLEMS at all to get in around 1130 (and did have some add-ons!) so this was great. Drink prices were as expected but nice place although there were alot of stairs so be careful if you have had a few! A sign for the WC's would probably be a good idea...

We later headed off to out and returned early hours in the morning but didnt feel we need to be all 'proper' as there were clearly a few people in the reception who had being partying away and not being judged.

In the morning we arranged our breakfast (as there wasn't anything in the room to fill in) so I called down to speak with someone. Again there was confusion over whether it was going to be for 3 as reception were trying to tell me breakfast for 2 was included only. It was sorted in the end and room service arrived with our choices within 20 odd minutes. Good choice & very plentiful.

My final gripe is Wi-Fi is chargeable at ¬£10/per day (I'm sure this can be subsisised somewhere) and booking 'packages' especically if you change things seems to cause confusion! However I would without a shadow of a doubt return to this hotel and stay in ANY room as I do not think this affect how I wos treated. We wanted to splash out a bit to celebrate my birthday and I had THE best birthday ever and St Martins Lane Hotel was THE main reason.

To summarise.... highlight - THE PENTHOUSE. Downside - I can't move in there!
Highly recommended, cannot wait to book again!",5,2010,12,02
125,Not impressed!!,"This hotel is in a fantastic location.  I stayed here for a long weekend, and I have to say, I didn't rate the hotel or the service.  The reception looks impressive on first sight.  The staff reception was okay, but nothing startling for a five star hotel.  The guy on the desk overlooking the entrance seemed to spend all of his time on Facebook!!!  Very unprofessional!
Our room again was okay - definitely showing signs of age.  The light fittings in the room looked worn, and the bedroom lighting looked ageing.  
The beds were very comfortable and the bedding was very good quality.  The dressing gowns supplied looked off white/greying and old - not what I would expect of a five star hotel.
I can only describe the mini bar as a joke - but not really that funny!!!  ¬£5 for a small tube of Pringles crisps, ¬£5 for a small bottle of water.  I could go on....
The room service was extortionate - Just a rip off - charging a 15% service charge on top of a ¬£3.75 charge for the pleasure of an over priced pizza.
I just felt an air of pretentiousness here.  I really don't mind paying for a good hotel, but I felt let down by St. Martins Lane.  There are far better hotels to be had in London.",3,2010,11,22
125,"Beautiful, elegant and helpful attentive staff","The title says it all really.

wonderful hotel, right in the middle of the tourist area, the light bar is expensive but a great place to go, the cocktails are delicious.",5,2010,11,17
125,Another overhyped Stark Co hotel.,"Our stay started off all right. At check-in we received an envelope hand-signed in our name wishing us a pleasant ""experience"" at the St Martins Lane Hotel. The envelope contained a couple of coupons to be redeemed at the bar. Nice. 
Thing is, the coupons were turned down by a bar tender whose ego could easily rival with Kanye West's. 
It felt during my entire stay that the Hotel's policy was to make a quick buck on every little thing they could. I would understand that on budget hotels but for a five-star hotel charging five-star hotel rates, it's insulting.
Want an egg with an already expensive breakfast? That will be an additional 8 pounds.
That's maybe because the breakfast served exotic and experimental items such as expired yogurt or vintage croissants.
Need Wifi? You got to pay for it. Want to print out your boarding pass? Use the business center computer at your own cost. And what a cost. 
The elevator and hallway to the room reeked of half-baked 90's design ideas.  The room was clean but too small fit a suitcase on a suitcase stand. 
I had a lot of expectations for this Hotel and was deeply disappointed. On the upside, staff was quite friendly apart the occasional snide comment from the front desk. 
There are tones better, cleaner, friendlier, options in London. Unless aging, overpriced, overhyped hotels are your thing.",2,2010,11,10
125,A really terrific experience,"Located in the heart of London's theatre district, near SoHo, walking distance to the major sights of London, it's hard to go wrong with St. Martin's Lane Hotel. The restaurant Asia de Cuba, even though part of a chain, is terrific. The Light Bar a great place for drinks and light snacks. Rooms are done in Morgan style.

You will find the staff helpful and very little if anything to complain about.",5,2010,11,01
125,Perfection!,"My boyfriend took me here for a mini-break and it was just gorgeous. Beautiful room, delicious breakfast, amazing location. I felt like a million dollars!
The staff are super-helpful, especially the Manager (think she's called Victoria?) who made us feel so welcome. 
Book it today! I just booked my sister and her husband in for a night away from the kids, and I know they'll LOVE it.",5,2010,11,01
125,"Cool hotel, perfect location and really nice people","I really liked this hotel. I only gave it a four because the room was a little small but, that said, I loved the cool lights and the bed was so comfy. Bathroom was spacious and really nice too. Drinks are expensive at the bar at ¬£13.95 a cocktail and a lot of rich people hang out there - nice to go for one or two. 
Location is perfect, really close to Covent Garden and Soho.
The concierge, Alex, was really good too and was patient in trying to find a last minute restaurant and recommending bars for us.
Overall, I liked it, bit over-priced but in comparison to other London hotels its location I think its not bad.",4,2010,10,22
125,It's just easy...,"Stayed at SML early September for business.  Was lucky enough that other family members were in London for business as well and convinced them to get a room at the SML also--so I got the best of both worlds--got my work done and also got to enjoy some fun in the evenings.  As always when I stay at SML, everyone was helpful and friendly, from making my reservations to check-out.  Used the concierge services more than usual and Tim and Richard were great and always helpful in getting restaurants and a car for us.  Was lovely to find a bottle of wine and note from hotel management welcoming me back--even if the bottle was apprehended by my greedy sisters-in-law who snuck it back to their room.  :)  Was a wonderful trip.  It's nice to know as much as I travel to London that SML is always welcoming, always consistent.

125,"Awesome Hotel, Bar, Room Service and a kick a$$ location","I was lucky enough to get a great rate to stay in this hotel for the 10 days i was in London. Hotel's standard rate for one night was 245 Pounds but i got a good deal thro priceline.com and ended up payin 250 US dollars ( about 160 Pounds). The hotel staff were amazing and very welcoming. The hotel room service was very great. The room was quite spacious. the room lay out was very interesting and quite smart i have to say. The in room entertainment included a flat screen Sony Screen. Sony DVD and an excellent mini-bar. As part of hotel's complimentary service you were able to order a DVD movie from their DVD library shown on their Booklet that you find when you check into your room. You always get a free ""big"" pop corn bowl every time you order a DVD. I have tried the room service food menu and i was so in love with their Cheese Burger (the beef was from Scotland) absolutely delicious.

The hotel have a nice bar/lounge called the light bar. it was a great place to set and have a chat with the ppl there. Dress Code for this bar buttoned shirts no jeans.

The hotel's restaurant Asia De Cuba looked nice but i did not get to try it. The hotel's Gym (Gym Box) was excellent. This Gym is located at the outside in the corner of the hotel building, hotel guests get to use the GYm for free. The hotel has a business center if you need to use the net and print documents you may use it  (cost 4 pounds per 15 minutes) or if you just want to go online you can get a user name and password and pay 10 pounds for a full day internet access.

The hotel location was the best. Trafalgar Square was only few meters away, Leicester Square Subway station was only 300 meters away. If you want to enjoy a good walk, then you can walk toward the river Thames and enjoy seeing the London eye cross the river and Big Ben is about 15-20 minutes away from the hotel. During my walk i was lucky to pass through the Horse Guard House and i witnessed their daily change of the royal guard at 4:15 pm.

Near the hotel there are quite few good restaurants and great pubs. I have had a great time at Angel & Crown pub. Their food was quite nice and their staff were super friendly.

Good restaurants around, Angus Steak house, Bella Italia and few others. Also, if you are into go to theaters then you are at the right place as you are surrounded by many theater houses. And if you are in the mood to hear a musical performance then go to St Martins in the fields church. I was lucky to attend Vivaldi's Four Season tribute performed by Candle light.

All in all i have to say that my first experience in the great city of London wouldn't be as awesome as it was if it wasn't for the pleasant hotel i was at..

good luck everyone with all ur travel plans

125,It was a delightful experience!!,"St Martins Lane offers outstanding service with a staff that is friendly and informative.  We were greeted by name, regularly, and it was always a pleasure to return after a day of sightseeing.  Just a few minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, historical sites, theater, restaurants, shopping, and transportation provides this boutique hotel with a dream location.
We enjoyed a lovely pre-theater dining experience at Asia de Cuba.  Loved it!
Thank you St Martins Lane for a wonderful and relaxing experience.  We will, deifinitely, return!",5,2010,09,22
125,We love this hotel and will continue to go back!,"We got engaged here last year, and returned for the the first 2 nights of our honeymoon this year. Both times we have stayed in a Garden Room (Travelzoo special offer)
The staff here are exceptional - extremely genuine and friendly, and on each occasion they have been utterly delightful and eager to help in any way. We found complimentary champange and a lovely note in our room on the first night of our stay, and were given a cocktail in the bar. The hotel is super cool, young and vibrant. The location could not be better - about as central as it gets. There is a traditional and friendly pub on the other side of the road, and we had breakfast opposite in Browns. One of the bar staff recommend that we go to Hix cocktail bar just behing Picadilly Circus - loved it!
Just writing this makes me want to go back......",5,2010,09,17
125,Fabulous Location with Friendly Staff,This hotel is very modern and designed for the 'in' crowd however they made us feel very welcome and at home. We missed having tea/coffee in the morning but after mentioning this to the reception staff they immediately supplied us with a tea tray & kettle. Nothing was too much trouble. We even tried their delicious cocktails. It was expensive but right in the middle of every attraction (however very quiet) - well worth it.,5,2010,09,09
125,Mixed at best - a disappointment,"We had stayed at the St Martin's Lane 4 or 5 times before (my wife just loves it), most recently last weekend (as a birthday present to my wife and because it fitted nicely with our first anniversary). What's the first thing the gentleman at the reception says when we walk up to check in? ""Good morning, Mr [X], have you stayed with us before"". Right. Not a good start. If I can see all my stays in my online profile, presumably their customer relationship database should show that information too.

In fairness, we did not mention on what occasion(s) we were staying this time. We did inform them on other occasions before previsous stays and what we received was simply outstanding treatment (super-friendly staff, room upgrade, bottle of champage in the room, even room upgrades for the whole family when we spent a week-end with the inlaws before our upcoming wedding). Simply extraordinary (and we did bring them some original choclates to thank the manager and this team). As good as it gets. Or ""got"", rather.

This time? We did not want special treatment but just ""our"" St Martin's Lane. Apparently, however, that doesn't work. We understood at check-in that the hotel was full -- and it showed. Staff was obviously challenged by this and things were disorganized. At booking, I had put in a request for a bathtub -- we did get one but we has to ask again at checkin (as above: where's the properly maintained guest profile/database?).

Biggest hiccup, however: the aircon in our room was not working. We called housekeeping early afternoon who said they would send up an engineer ""at once"". We took a nap for approx. 1 hour. No engineer had shown up. We left for some shopping and on the way out spoke to reception about the issue. They promised to check and fix it while we were out. We return 2 hours later -- nothing had happened. We went downstairs to speak to reception again -- because we had to get ready for a night out at the proms, we stressed that it was getting time-critical. Again, nothing happens until I go down again and make a fuss. Of course, this hits the wrong guy (he had no idea that we had been struggling to get this sorted the whole afternoon) but after all, he has his act together and assigns us a new room literally within 10 mins. Well done. Why did it take 4 hours?

Don't get me wrong: A broken aircon can happen and is not a big deal in itself. To be unable to sort it our during a whole afternoon is - for me - a big deal and something that I simply am not prepared to put up with at a hotel like the SML.

Also, when reading through some of the other reviews, it appears to me that consistently good service is what the SML is lacking. As noted above, we have had wonderful experiences at this hotel but it's just a real disappointment if there's a relatively minor hiccup and nobody seems to be able to care/address the issue/be able to sort it our swiftly.

So, in summary: I believe all the reviewers who posted something negative (as well). It's really a pity because it's such a nice and great hotel: good design, excellent location, trendy, good restaurant (nice b/f even), good bar (although not as sought after as it used to be) but really, guys, you need to focus a little more on providing consistently good service to the people who pay for their rooms because otherwise guests will start looking for something else (we certainly would consider doing that next time, despite the fact that my wife loves the SML so much).",3,2010,09,06
125,Amazing,"From the moment we left the taxi the staff were super helpful - we managed to check in early and were shown promptly to the room.  We stayed in a deluxe room, which was very spacious and the bathroom was amazing - they had even left candles with matches to have a lovely bath.
We had room service for breakfast and the food was excellant - I didn't think the price was too bad either considering the quality of the food and that it is room service.
We dined at the restaurant and although it was great, I wouldn't recommend the taster menu as the portions were huge (not really tasters) so it would be better to select your own.
Check out was really quick too and the receptionist couldn't do enough - her name was Lindsay.
We've just booked again to stay in Oct ;-)",5,2010,08,31
125,BRILLIANT!!!,"If you want to stay somewhere cool and stylist in London without all the pretentiousness, snobbiness then the SML hotel is for you.  Its defo my hotel of choice when I stay in London and I've stayed at pretty much all the major 5 star hotels.
The rooms maybe small but what they lack in size they make up for in style.
I cannot fault the staff...they are super friendly and always keen to help.  Whenever I have stayed I have been made to feel welcome and comfortable.
The hotel manager, Victoria Stewart, particularly stands out as a star at the SML.
Defo a top pick for me and my girlfriend.
If you get the chance give the restaurant a good, we loved it!!",5,2010,08,23
125,"Cool, pop and stylish","Cool inner design with nice cromatic games and avant-garde furniture both in the hall and bar. Staff very friendly, excellent housekeeping service and all this in the very centre of west-end, near covent garden. I used also the Gym which can provide lots of different free classes and free entrance for the guests of the hotel. The Restaurant Asia de Cuba inside the hotel is one of the best fusion restaurant I've ever been",4,2010,08,18
125,"Great Place, but avoid the idiots in the nightclub Bungalow 8!!","Everything was great about our stay.  Our room wasn't quite ready on our arrival so we were shown to the bar for complimentary Champagne.  The suite was lovely.  Location perfect.  On our first night, the noise outside was unbearable from about 4am through to 7am as there was some work going on.
The only downside was the set up with Bungalow 8.  Recently, guests of the hotel have been granted access to the exclusive private members club.  The girl on the door was rude as she didn't recognise us.  On entering the club we were greeted by a room full of people trying to be something they're not, creating a terrible atmosphere.  I must say at this point that Bungalow 8 is nothing to do with the hotel, hence the world of difference in class and standards.  Go to the Light bar instead!",5,2010,08,10
125,Just returned from a visit to the st...,"Just returned from a visit to the st martins lane hotel for my wifes birthday. All I can say is it was fantastic, from the greeting we got whilst checking, the rooms, service And the location could not be better. The hotel also gave us complimentary cocktails in the cocktail bar which we thought was a really nice touch, but the icing on the cake was the complimentary bottle of champagne sent up to our room which we had before we hit the town. We will definatly stay there again and recommend it.",5,2010,08,03

125,Great Hotel; Amazing staff,"After having read some of these comments we felt that we must share the amazing experience we had whilst staying at your hotel in January for the start of our honeymoon. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by the hotel manager who was amazing; so polite and friendly. The reception staff were extremely welcoming. Our room was stunning; fantastic bathroom. We loved the free movie rental with the warm popcorn. The breakfast was beautiful. Concierge were very helpful and the borrowed umbrella came in very handy.

Overall the hotel was everything you would have expected from a 5 star modern and chic hotel. Thank you for looking after us so well and we will certainly be back later on in the year.",5,2010,07,30
125,Worst hotel I've ever stayed at,"I had to go to London recently for a business trip.  Read a few reviews and the SML seemed like a decent place to stay...and I figured that at GBP 315 a night it surely had to be quality.  Well, I was wrong.  This is hands down the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  Maybe it's a European thing, I hope not:  If I pay the dollar equivalent here in the US, I get a luxury suite in a Ritz or a Four Seasons, clean rooms with big TVs and super-friendly staff.  Not at the SML:  My room was TINY.  The interior was all white (or at least it used to be white when the room was still new and clean) and had the aura of a public hospital room.  I was facing a wall on one side of the room, and a dirty roofdeck on the other. The AC wasn't working.  Hotel staff was arrogant and unaccommodating.  
I hope I don't have to come back to London anytime soon, but if I do, I'll go for one of the standard US hotel chains.  If you're into weird Euro techno music in elevators, rooms without door numbers and funky colored walls and carpets, go for the SML.  If you're a regular guy looking for a pleasant stay, don't touch the place.",1,2010,07,18
125,One of the better Morgans properties,"If you've stayed at the Hudson, the Royalton, the Mondrian or other Morgan's hotels you know what i mean, they're all similar in theme. Design by Philippe Starck (as most of them are) you sort of know what you'll get before you walk into your room - Cheap Chic with a theme - in this case of this hotel - light and airy with a LOT of white. The room was perfectly appointed, beautifully finished, and the bed was amazing. The problem I have with these hotels is that at times it feels like they're trying so hard to be hip that they miss some of the core conveniences and comforts of a hotel. For instance a lobby that feels more like a modern art gallery than a hotel. Truth is, sometimes I actually want my lobby to be just that; a hotel lobby - not a thumping nightclub with beautiful  people milling about. 

All that said - the staff was extremely helpful, always accommodating and friendly, and served with a smile. 

My room, as mentioned, was well appointed, comfortable, and very stark. It was clean, crisp, but lacking in personality. The exception being the amazing little patio I had in the  entry way - a perfect addition.

Oh, one more thing. There's no sign and no street address number on the building, so I did walk past the hotel 5 times before i realized it was my hotel. I was tired and just off a 10 hour flight - so not thinking all that clearly! If you go, just look for the most modern building on the street, the one with out a sign - that'll be the one.",4,2010,07,17
125,Great location,When you see this hotel from the road it doesn't look like much but the inside is quite funky.  The elevators and hallways are very dark and the techno music played in the elevators makes you feel like you are still in the clubs.  The actual room was quite small but very quite.  I had a crappy view of other worn out buildings from my room.  The buffet breakfast was pretty good and included in the cost of the room.  You can walk to most anything from this place.,4,2010,07,17
125,Chic and great location,"This place is chic. Beautiful staff, white rooms, beautiful design details and a great location in Covent garden.

We were there for business and this place was just great for a chic base for theatre, restaurants and for shopping.

It was a simple enough place to be - but im glad i was on a business expense! It is for the beautiful people - but somehow i got in.

The level of service is very high and the place has great touches - loved the designer chairs in reception and had wonderful cocktails in the light bar.

Overall - good place",5,2010,07,04
125,Absolutely Appalling,"I was getting married the weekend I stayed at St Martins Lane and was using the hotel as a base.  The first night I spent with my two bridesmaids and the second night I was staying with my husband on our wedding night.  When we arrived to check in, our room was not ready therefore we could not check in until 5pm (this was at about 3.30 - check in time is 3pm).  No one offered help with our luggage which was fairly substantial given I was getting married.  The reception staff were vague and unhelpful about when the room would be ready and what had gone wrong.  Eventually I managed to persuade a member of staff to put our luggage in safe keeping for us so that we could go out whilst our room was being made ready for us to occupy. I had specifically asked that I stayed in the same room (a double double) with my bridesmaids as we needed a large room (I was prepared to pay extra) however we were told we had to move to a tiny double room on the morning of the wedding where I had two bridesmaids, my mother, makeup artist and photographer all trying to get on.  It made me extremely stressed on a day when I should have been keeping calm.  I was frankly appalled at the service I received at the hotel.  We are currently on our honeymoon at the Hilton in the Seychelles and the St Martins Lane staff could take a few tips from them.  The staff were rude, disinterested and unhelpful and I found most of them didn't know what was going on half the time or how things worked. I booked to stay at St Martins Lane as I wanted to stay somewhere extra special before and after my wedding but to be honest I think I would have received better service at a Travelodge!  Only upside is it is a brilliant location.",2,2010,07,02
125,Better than expected,"Having stayed at the Hudson in NYC, I was petrified to stay at another hotel by the Morgans Group. I was pleasantly surprised to find a large room with a huge bathroom, with a ton of closet space. The location of the St Martin's Lane is great, in the middle of everything with tons of restaurants and shopping surrounding the hotel.   

I had a few issues...the first room smelled of cigarette smoke and I found ladybugs everywhere. They quickly moved me to the same room on a lower floor. Oddly enough, I couldn't get a mobile or wireless Internet signal from the new room. And, I got a call at 6am the first morning to tell me my coffee was on its way (um, I didn't order any). 

It was unusually warm in London when I was there, and the air conditioning just couldn't get the room cold even on its coldest setting. Also, when it was on, there was a constant dripping sound in the ceiling, keeping me up the whole week.",4,2010,06,26
125,Overpriced and decadent,"I've been a frequent guest of SML, but recently returned there and was disappointed. While still charging their regular expensive price, the room was dirty, the staff was quite unfriendly (particularly in the club) and Asia de Cuba's food had better days.  The place also really needs a renovation by now, as anyone can see from state of the carpets. If you need to stay close to Covent Garden you can do better elsewhere.",3,2010,06,19
125,"Excellent hotel, great location, great staff what more could you ask for?","We stayed at this hotel for a weekend for my husbands birthday. We absolutely loved it, The location is great for getting around london walking or tube. The staff were very attentive and could not do enough for you to help. On arrival we got upgraded for free which we had not expected and also on the day of my husbands birthday he recieved a card in the room with some drinks vouchers inside which we thought was a great touch. The rooms were lovely, spacious and very clean. We could not find fault with the hotel. We would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, We will definately be back to stay in the future.",5,2010,06,07
125,We didn't want to leave!,"My wife and I stayed here for 7 days and we had the most amazing time.  This hotel is located in the best area (in my opinion).  The staff was super helpful and so nice.  I had requested a corner room prior to my stay and when we arrived, the request was granted, which was much appreciated.  The hotel staff made sure we were comfortable as much as possible.  I was impressed through my research, how the Director of rooms was so tentative towards not only positive comments, but negative as well.  Any negative comment I read seemed to be looked into as we had such an amazing experience all around.  Definitely take advantage of the Gymbox, which is complimentary to Hotel guests, as well as the free DVD rental (and popcorn) on request!  This trip was my wife and mine's last one before we have our first baby, and we were so happy with the St. Martins Lane Hotel and will no doubt be back!",5,2010,06,05
125,I don't mean to bore you...,"But just back from a stay with my teenage daughter and once again, SML was just fantastic.  We were in London for her birthday--and our stay was welcoming and seamless.  Arrived early in the morning from Paris and were ecstatic that a room was at the ready--but the best surprise was that we'd been upgraded to a suite.  Bellhops and front desk were incredibly friendly and efficient.  We were surprised that evening with a lovely bottle of wine for me and some sweets and firecrackers for my daughter--the little touches mean a lot.  I've stayed here so often now I don't remember how many times I've been--but I do know that I've not been let down once during any stay.  By far, they are consistant across the board in customer care and it makes a huge difference to the overall experience.",5,2010,05,28
125,Interestingly different hotel... where was the birthday surprise???,"We both loved the location of this hotel.. although you have to look hard to find it!
I rang a few days before to request a little something for my partners birthday... I was told we will see what we can do... I was surpised that NOTHING was done?
I booked this hotel/weekend as a surprise and the request would have been the icing on the cake, so to speak. 
I did not feel there was any personal attentive service, just treated like a number. Our room was small but we felt perfectly formed in such a tight space.
We liked the open feeling of the hotel a real sense of space.  In the evening we decided to go to the bar and were really surprised that this shut so early and although it was quiet, it seemed to take forever to get a drink.
A small bottle of water between two in the room felt somewhat cheeky and the dirty tissue under the information pack was purely down to a lack of standard.
This is not a cheap hotel and although the feel of the hotel is different, the standard of the above mentioned does not match the price tag.",4,2010,05,12
125,Super nice and understanding while stranded by Volcanic Ash,"I had my reservation about staying at a Morgans hotel as i am not a fan of tiny rooms. I was wrong! I had to find a hotel in a hurry when unable to leave London. They had a room and upgraded me to first floor garden. Room itself was very clean and comfortable. They never raised and in some cases dropped the rates for those stranded and gave some a discount on food and beverages as the ash situation continued. They were extremely accomodating about providing a flexible checkout date and time daily. The only complaint i had is that one time my husband had a hard time reaching me because no one was picking up the phone for over 5 mins to connect to room. Also, my company has pre negotiated rates so I can't comment accurately to the value of this hotel.",5,2010,04,23
125,Amazing Stay!!!!!,"We stayed at the St Martins Lane Hotel on the 16th & 17th April 2010 and had the most amazing stay!!

This hotel is situated right where you need to be, all the major attractions are within walking distance.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel has a great atmostphere!!

We will be back!!",5,2010,04,22
125,poor,"I stayed here with my partner for a birthday treat for him. I called up the hotel 2 weeks prior to our visit to advise the staff it was my partners birthday and if they could arrange a card and possibly a cake. When we arrived, the receptionist was friendly but not obliging. I asked if we could upgrade and she said she did. The super friendly bell boy showed us to our room but when entering the room, it was a standard (originaly what I booked) not an upgrade. There was no cake, no card and no champagne, which I requested. Our first nite was very noisy as the aircon in our room seemed to have a problem, we woke up feeling very tired due to a sleepness nite because of the noise from the aircon. Breakfast at the hotel was decent but pricey and the staff are moody and didnt seem to care wheather we waited for 20 miutes for someone to take our order. Never the less...the room was clean and a good size. The hotel is in a good location and the hotel itself is ultra modern. After a bad experience and a great big bill to pay at the end of it all, it is safe to say I wont be staying here again!!! its a shame, if the staff were more accomdating it could have changed my mind. But the money I spent here I rather spend it at another hotrel we stayed at year before last and they couldnt do more for me and my partner on his birthday....that is what I call money well spent.",2,2010,04,08
125,"Return Visitor, but unlikely to be back","I've stayed before at Morgans Group Hotels, first at the Hudson in New York, and once before at St Martin's Lane.  It was because of previous experiences that I wanted to stay there again when I visited London last month.

Previous reviews give a fair assessment of the hotel itself - brilliantly located, clean and comfortable, with a style which is still unusual but getting a little old ten years on.  But the compilation CD (vol 4 when I stayed there) in the hotel room comes highly recommended - buy it!

I did however have two concerns about my latest stay.  First, I booked through a promotional email I received from Morgans Group in January (as I was on their mailing list from my previous stays), which was billed as 'London Calling' rate and offered free breakfasts each night of your stay.  The confirmation email did state that I was booked under the 'London Calling' rate, but when I asked at the hotel, I was told that my rate did not include breakfast.  As breakfast at the hotel - quite delicious - costs ¬£23 (or ¬£46 for the two nights I was staying), this is no small disappointment.

I raised this issue on the email survey which was sent to me after my stay, and asked for a response, but two weeks later, I have not heard anything back.

The second issue is that like many hotels, St Martins Lane requires a card to be registered at reception when checking in.  I used my current account debit card.  After settling the bill on departure, I was alarmed to get home and discover that the hotel was still holding a charge of ¬£705 on my card.  Not only did this far exceed the cost of my stay (which had in any event already been deducted from my account), but it meant that until I sorted it out, I had no available balance in my current account.  It took some nine telephone calls - three to my bank and six to the hotel - to get this sorted out; it turns out that their system does not handle debit cards well and that if I had used a credit card, the charge held would have been released once I paid my bill.  The staff at check-in, apparently, should have spotted this and asked me to use a credit card instead.

The staff at the hotel's finance department were courteous but did make a mistake with the authorisation code when faxing my bank to have the charge removed, which delayed the release of the charge by another day.  Although I asked, I was never given an explanation for the amount held.  (Even the ¬£150 deposit stated in the terms, together with my two nights' tariff, would not have amounted to ¬£705.)  All in all I was disappointed by this, and left temporarily without funds, and for these reasons I would not currently consider returning to Morgan Group.",3,2010,04,05
125,This is my home in London,"I work in London at least 4 to 5 times a year, spending 1 week to 10 days each trip. Since 2007 I always stay at San Martins Lane. It is an elegant, cozy, trendy, interesting place to be.
The fitness is at the Gym Box, just beside the hotel, a truly complete training place.
The restaurant Asia de Cuba serves excelent food and you always can see beotifull around.",5,2010,03,21
125,Swanky and great service,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 1 week stay here. The location is very central - next to many popular theatres and shopping areas. Service is friendly and efficient. The minimalist comtemporary decor is striking and makes clever use of space in the room. Love the little touches like the mood lighting, ipod dock and complimentary gym laundry service. 
The hotel's restaurant, Asia de Cuba, has a delicious, eclectic menu with stacks of books in the column library to choose from while you eat.",5,2010,03,19
125,Is this a five star hotel?,"We stayed there for four nights and we were so disappointed with what someone can expect from a five star hotel. 
Starting with the public spaces there isn't actually a lobby because there is no place to sit at the lobby!
 We asked to use the internet and for 10 minutes use they charged us 10 GBP!
The room was so tiny there wasn't space for our bags or anything. The curtains weren't actually blackout and we were waking up early because of the light coming in the room.
The worst of all was that despite the fact the room was prepaid they used our credit card debiting it with the amount of 630GBP!!! When we asked them to cancel it they said they will keep only 150GBP fot insurance reasons and return the rest of the amount but they never did until after we left. And you know what they were SOO RUDE with us making us feel that we are not wanted in their hotel.
Stay away. I bet there are hundreds of other good hotels in London that at least they will make you feel wellcome.",2,2010,03,16
125,First Rate Hotel in an Excellent Location,"My cousin and I went to London to see Chelsea vs. Manchester City. We wanted a hotel near attractions and with a close by tube stop to help get us to the match. After some searching I discovered St. Martins Lane Hotel. What most drew us to this hotel was that it offered a room with two queen size beds. And if any of you have traveled in Europe, you know that two queen sized beds in a room means there would be no other room to move around in. Not so this. We had a very large corner room with two walls being nothing but windows (granted we didn't have much of a view, but the natural light was welcomed). A very large bathroom with separate shower and tub. Korres bath products. There is, however, no door (though there is a door to the commode). The room was all white with two desks, tv, dvd/cd player and dock for mp3 player.  Two of the window walls crack open so you can get some air if needed. Beds were comfortable.  Very satisfied with the room. The St. Martins' is more of a hip, modern hotel with funky designs in the lobby, a hip lounge filled with beautiful people on Friday and Saturday night and a very good restaurant. Excellent for singles, couples. Probably not the best for young children, but wouldn't rule it out. The hotel is steps from Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, Portrait Gallery,  and all the theatres. Very short walk to British Museum, Piccadilly Circus, and Bond Street. Two tube stops nearby, so rest of the city is minutes away. Also plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby. We stayed three nights and had a great experience at this hotel. Only flaw we found was the concierge wasn't of much help and he didn't seem to care. Front desk staff were excellent and we got good pub tips from the bell hop. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,03,02
125,not for me,stayed here for 2 nights with my wife and another couple and have very mixed feelings about this hotel.the plus side was location which was excellent.the hotel was clean and the reception staff and breakfast staff were friendly.sadly we had more downsides . the room was very small.......and yes i have stayed in london many times and the prices they charge in the bar was ridiculous.. that is after they allow you to enter !! .everything about this hotel for me was very prentious and if i am honest i felt uncomfortable staying here .overall i would not stay here again .,3,2010,03,01
125,"Stylish, comfortable and friendly","We stayed for one night. We were greeted at Reception with friendly staff who gave us a substantial upgrade to a corner suite. The room was fantastic. Very spacious and comfortable. We went for a drink in the Hotel Cocktail Bar before venturing out to a restaurant nearby. The Bar decor is very minimalist bordering on Spartan but with trendy lighting....and I have to say I have been in much better bars. However, the cocktails were fine and the service efficient and friendly. The breakfast was fine. They have a decent buffet and a full selection of cooked breakfast options. 

The Hotel style is minimalist chic, if you like that kind of look (we do) then I think you would enjoy the Hotel. I If you want to explore London then the location of the Hotel is great; right in the middle of things, very near to Leicester Square and Covent Garden. s it the best Hotel I have stayed in....NO but there is nothing wrong with it at all and i would happily recommend anyone to stay there.",4,2010,02,28
125,Amazing,this hotel was so beautiful.. Kinda expensive but it was a wonderful experience well worth the money. My friends and i had such a amazing time,5,2010,02,25
125,uber,"youve got to like modern hotels for this one, rooms are well equiped nice robes and smellys in the bathrooms all very sleek and cool.serviceis warm while being very cool.recomended if you want to feel a bit uber for the night.",4,2010,02,22
125,5 star stay!,"On arrival greeted with my name, very pleased with the added personal touch
Stayed from 12th-14th January 2010
Excellent hassle free check in!!! Very pleasant staff and exceptional customer service
Very impressed with room!! Decor was very cosmopolitan! Lovely comfortable bed!! Fantastic shower facilities!!! Entertainment!! 5* housekeeping!!! Well stocked Minibar! Room service impeccable! As were the funky lights over the bed! Very cool!!! Location of the hotel itself!! Perfect and within reach of West End and everything London has to offer!!!
Very ambient experience!! Loved the calming music and lighting in elevator!! Nothing was too much to request!!! Enjoyed a fabulous stay and hope to visit again very soon! Highly reccomended!!!",5,2010,02,22
125,Surprisingly superb,"I only stayed here because my usual haunts were full.Boutique hotels fill me with dread.Staff who may look smart but do not understand hotel service.
This was wonderful.The staff were lovely and the standards as good as Claridges.Evening  turndown saw all toiletries ,and they were great,replenished.Housekeeping was immaculate.My room, 515,was utterly silent even though the hotel is at the epicentre of the West End.Faultless.",5,2010,02,20
125,Amazing,"Booked this hotel as a Valentine's treat for my girlfriend and I absolutely loved it. The hotel itself is amazing and just a short walk from the Savoy theatre, perfect location. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout. 

The hotel is very funkily decorated and definately a hotel for the younger end of the market. 

The rooms are very well furnished, in fact I am now trying to find out where I can get one of the TV cabinets from!! 

Loved this place and will definately be staying again, am highly recommending this to all my friends.",5,2010,02,15
125,As good as always...,"Stayed 10-14 December 2009 in Deluxe King.

I have stayed several times at St Martin‚Äôs Lane as well as Sandersons. Like both hotels very much. Surprisingly they both maintain a high standard and rooms are kept in a good condition. Love the simple but cool rooms having floor-ceiling windows. Bathroom large and comfortable. As think mentioned in previous reviews, the hotel may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. Design, design, design and white. Hip and chic. Staff in general good although can sometimes be a bit stuffy. Light bar is nice even if not extraordinary. Asia the Cuba serving great food. Although cannot understand why hotel doesn‚Äôt have better influence with next door night club Bungalow 8. It‚Äôs literally located in the hotel. Shame. Anyhow, location is perfect. So, see no reason why shouldn‚Äôt return.",4,2010,02,03
125,Disappointing,"I was very excited to stay at the St. Martins Lane hotel during our long weekend in London.  Knowing the Morgan group quite well from extensive experiences with the Clift Hotel in San Francisco, I was prepared for a top notch experience.  Unfortunately, our experience was average at best.
First, from the website, I was expecting more from the decor.  During the week they tone things down, and it was not until Saturday night that the lobby looked even remotely as exciting as it had online. 
Second, it was dirty dirty dirty!  I wish I'd taken pictures, but the carpets in the hallways were filthy.  It may have been snowing, but in a 5 star hotel with a 5 star price tag, I expect the floors to be clean.
Third, we were upgraded to a Garden Room with a normal rack rate of 300 pounds per night.  It was fine for the price we paid, but if I were paying that much per night I would be angry at being put where we were.  The bathroom was nice, but the bedroom had an awkward flow, dated lighting, and the TV and its enclosure were flat out old..  the hair dryer provided only blew cold air, and the replacement that housekeeping brought up to me did not work.  The ""garden"" was a small strip of concrete. 
While we did not eat at the restaurant (we can go to Asia de Cuba in SF), we did have drinks both nights in Light Bar.  For a ""swanky"" hotel bar, I found it boring, the crowd a bit shady and the drinks heavily overpriced.  AND, the bartender double-charged us for a round, which we luckily caught while checking out.
Ian, the concierge was tremendously helpful the first day with getting us tickets to some of the touristy things and setting us up with a great spot for dinner.  We'd asked him about theater tickets as well, and on the last day of our stay, he, through a broker, found us tickets to Warhorse for 75p apiece.  This was more than we wanted to spend after traveling for several weeks, so I told him we'd pass.  His treatment of us went from best in class to acting like we were homeless people off of the street.  We inquired about other shows and he never bothered to follow up.  Highly insulting.
The only really good things I can say about this hotel are that the location was great and that it is located in London.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  I am sure there are far better and cleaner places to stay at the rates they chage at St. Martin's.  We had better amenities (minus the bar/restaurant) and better service at the airport Marriot.",2,2010,01,21
125,Modernistic hotel in a fantastic location with extremely nice staff,"We got an offer for 240 ‚Ç¨ for two nights at Saint Martin's Lane for Jan 2010 and had an absolutely wonderful stay. The hotel is designed and decorated by Philippe Starck and you can notice it up to the smallest detail. The room was smallish but very comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast was amazing - full English Breakfast included in the price. There is also a bar-lounge with live music or DJs featuring different styles each night. And the staff - soooo friendly and helpful! Plus, super location, minutes away from Trafalgar Square, Leicester Sq and Covent Garden. A definite recommendation for young couples or groups of friends, for a lovely weekend in town!",5,2010,01,13
125,Very impressive,"Having stayed at the sister hotel (The Sanderson) and being really pleased,  we decided to give this one a try on a night out in London, and were not let down. Car park round the corner, swift check-in and a surprise/welcome upgrade, and we were in a very modern and well appointed room that made the most of the space. The little garden terrace in the middle was a first for central London and having a glass of wine outside was a nice novelty. Really well located for the usual tourist-y stuff and a not bad bar that seemed to take itself too seriously. On the whole, really good experience and would recommend it - but The Sanderson beats it to my favourite place to stay.",5,2010,01,08
125,Wonderful Stay!!!,"We are a family with two young children - our daughter with very special needs.  We made sure that the hotel aware of our limitations and they made sure that they took care of all the details.  The more they provided, the less stress we experienced.  Our daughter's special diet was anticipated and the foods were there awaiting us!

Not only did they accommdate our daughters needs, but requested information on our son to ""make sure he wasn't left out of the special attention""!

On arrival the doorman, conceirage and front desk were anticipating our arrival and had everything awaiting us.  

Our rooms were adjoining and extremely comfortable.  We spend more time than most in the rooms and felt like we had found a home away from home - just off Trafalgar Square, too!

Incredible location, right in the heart of the West End theatre district, and just a walk away from almost everything London has to offer!  Plenty of restaurants and pubs just a walk away.   

We will be back, maybe one day without the children to experience everything the West End has to offer - and will most assuredly stay at the St. Martins Lane Hotel!",5,2010,01,01
125,Fabulous Christmas Getaway,"We chose the St Martins Lane Hotel because we found a special offer on it and have always wanted stay there. The Reception staff were friendly and helpful and even though we had turned up very early hoping to just drop off our bags, the reception lady found us a room and we were able to check in.   

The room was ultra modern but still comfortable, we booked a Deluxe King Room.  Bed was firm but still very comfortable with a range of pillows.  

The bathroom was spacious with a great shower, amazing water pressure.   

Along with this there were other nice little touches our room came with a ipod dock speaker and a dvd / cd player (with an extensive list of cd's and dvd's which could be borrowed - dvd's came with popcorn although we never got to try this).

we had lunch at Asia de Cuba the next day, again the staff were very friendly and helpful their recomendation of one starter and two main courses was more than enough food  - we had the spare ribs followed by the Cuban Chicken and the Steak.  All portions are designed to be shared which is what we did.

Location wise the hotel is perfect for Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Holborn.",5,2010,01,01
125,Great hotel,The hotel is located a few minutes from Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. The room we have stayed was great and hotel people very helpful.,5,2009,12,29
125,Always on my short list when visiting London,"This was my second time staying at St. Martins Lane hotel in London and it continues to consistently exceed my expectations.  It boasts an excellent location steps from the Leicester Square tube stop and housed in an unassuming, but modern building.

The hotel is incredibly clean and nothing seems out of place.   The rooms are small and stark-white, but the 'hip' design doesn't sacrifice comfort.  The bed is incredibly comfortable and there's well thought out space to store clothing.

Desk space is funky and maybe a bit too minimalistic if you're planning to hunker down and do some work.  The desk chair is aluminum and not designed for comfortable long sessions of sitting.

But there are lots of nice touches in the room-  the lighting can range from dim and relaxing to as-bright-as-you-need-it.  The tv and mini-bar are cleverly housed in a minimalist storage unit.  There's an ipod dock with speakers in the room and fast/easy-to-use wireless internet.  Guests get access to gymbox next door for fitness needs.  

The only regular hotel-room amenity I missed was a coffee maker of some sort-  give me some ground coffee, a kettle, and a french press and I'd be all set when jetlag wakes me before the starbucks across the street opens.

Breakfast in asia de cuba in the hotel lobby is quite good but a bit on the pricey side-  cheaper (though less comprehensive) alternatives line the street.

Every encounter with the staff from front-desk to doorman to restaurant servers have been friendly and attentive.

I'll certainly stay again.",4,2009,12,28
125,GREAT HIP HOTEL,"AMAZING STAFF we stayed for 7 nite upon arrival we were early checking in were about to sit in the lobby and wait when we were ushered into a small reception room with our infant son by the special events manager Greg fantastic guy really looked after us hard to find this kind of treatment in the best hotels..The room we had was a king deluxe great room all white very clean very attentive cleaning staff,The doorman also were great always on top of any request we had ,on one occasion thier were no cabs out front the doorman took of running up the street returning a couple minutes later with a cab great service,The food in the main restaurant very good,it also has a great vibe in the evenings As far as the location goes we were in the heart of the west end theatres right across the street as well as Starbucks,Covent Garden very close,Oxford St,Regent St.within walking distance.....great fish and chips called Rock and Plaice on Endell St. and lastly great workout facilities in the hotel as well as Gymbox attached to the hotel",5,2009,12,22
125,Amazing - everything just right!,"We had booked to go to Budapest for our anniversary, however thanks to the British weather resulting in all flights being cancelled we were left trying to find something in London at the last minute. 
As residents we know London quite well, and also due to the good old ""credit crunch"" we had a lot of choice of last minute London hotel deals - so why did we pick St Martins Lane Hotel?
We had visited the restaurant (Asia De Cuba) and also the bar (Light bar) in the past and enjoyed both. The website looked really good, and we  liked the idea of trying something  ""a bit different"". We definitely made the right choice! 
The location is perfect, the service was great - everybody we met was extremely professional, knowledgeable, but also very warm and friendly. As soon as we stepped out of our taxi the doorman took our bags and gave us a really warm welcome and the service continued in this manner right through until check out.
We loved our room - they really have thought of everything, and I can't understand previous negative reviews (I suspect some people are just never happy).
Like most of the contributors to Tripadvisor we have stayed in really nice 4 and 5 star hotels worldwide and I couldn't fault the rooms - great mix of style and function, really comfortable beds, and one of the best power showers ever!
We booked a deal which included ¬£100 credit for use in the restaurant. This was a really smart move as Asia De Cuba was amazing - great food and service - our waiter Mathew deserves special mention - a really nice guy who seemed genuinely keen that we had an amazing time. 
Good value too - nice bottle of Rioja (Marquis De Riscal Reserva) for only ¬£42 which for London is great value (it's about ¬£25 in the supermarket!). Also a great range of wines for around ¬£30.
The light bar has a buzzy atmosphere and is a great place to people watch - but be warned - it ain't cheap (¬£46 for three drinks - two glasses of Kir Royal and one Mojito), however these are London prices and any trendy bar ""worth being seen in"" won't be any cheaper. I maybe shouldn't say this but if you pop across the road the International is a  nice lounge bar that does great Mojito's for ¬£7.50 and also has a happy hour - but like I say you won't quite get the same top London bar vibe!
Overall a great experience, made extra special by the amazingly warm and friendly service which they managed to get just right. We had a great Anniversary, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2009,12,20
125,2nd time there... but disappointing,"It was the second time my partner and I stayed in St Martin's Lane last weekend.
We went there for a nice weekend 2 years and loved the experience.
The staff was at the time really helpful (sorting out theater tickets for us and amazing restaurants)

This time, the experience was a bit different, and I must admit disappointing 

On arrival we wanted to reserve a restaurant for the evening. We have been as usually guided to the concierge, but this time, we faced a man quite arrogant and not even explaining which restaurant was what. 
We are not Londoners, so our knowledge of the places to go or not is not like a local.
He finally made a reservation, we indicated we wanted some really high end good place.
The restaurant was nice, but not what we expected and very noisy and not really high end (felt a bit overdressed there)
So we gave our comments to this concierge when he asked us the day after. The only answer he could give us not really listening to our feedback was ""Well you know guys it is xmas"" ... Do we look stupid ? We might not be from London but are big city people anyway and we know how it looks like when it xmas, thanks ! 

The room was as usually comfortable, but looked a bit aged (not as slick as it was previously). The TV and Ipod dock gave up living on our last day. 

The staff from breakfast is really very kind, and doing everyhting to help. It is always really nice to have a smile and someone trying to please you from the morning.

On our departure day, we asked for our car to be brought from the parking. We had to wait for about 30 min, as the valet didnt know how to start it ! 

At the check out, I think it is when we have been the most disappointed ... 
Not even a question about our stay and if we enjoyed, ot if we had any comments ... 
When you pay a bill like this, I think it is the least you can expect !  

Unfortunalety, this will probably not be a choice (even if the location is absolutely perfect) for our future stays in London.",3,2009,12,15
125,Bijou Chic in the Heart of London,"Standard rooms have a tiny bedroom (larger rooms are available at a price) but the attention to design detail meant we hardly noticed the small dimensions. Luxurious comfort, modern chic design (by Phillipe Starke). Staff very pleasant. Asia de Cuba restaurant is superb, the food is wonderful. Have eaten there twice but this was the first time we stayed too. Location can't be beaten, 5 minute walk from Covent Garden, Leicester Square etc. Fantastic place to base yourself for a London weekend.",5,2009,12,14
125,Different hotel but worth the visit,"Stayed only for 1 night, but worth the stay, had to check in this hotel because of bad experience at the Mayfair, had deluxe king room, which was ok and what we really expected, well worth the visit, rooms are very well done, although would not want an extended stay in room we had, tried to check in at 2pm, but they have strict 3pm check in and would not even try to accomodate us. staff are all friendly and try to assist and be helpful, bar is for residents only, which is very nice indeed, with great service, and it is nice to see that they stick to the residents only policy.
well situated hotel for that side of london, would return, if wanting to stay in this area.
its different from most mainstream hotels and would say worth a stay, nothing special, but worth a go.",4,2009,12,12
125,Stylish hotel but without the service to match,"My wife and I wanted to treat ourselves to a weekend in London including a stay at a top hotel. The St. Martin's Lane Hotel did not disappoint initially, with stunning design throughout and a fantastic position (especially for theatres and shopping)

We had a few problems with the room which to be fair were sorted out quickly by giving us an upgrade, so everything was looking good and the room we ended up in was superb.

Our main gripe was with the service we received at the breakfast in the morning. We arrived a long time before service ended but still had to wait for 15 minutes before being seated. The waitress left us standing, did not offer coffee/tea or an estimate of how long we'd have to wait - this was made more frustrating by the fact that the delay appeared to have been caused by tables not being cleared, rather than a lack of tables.

When we eventually got our breakfast it did not contain the the items on the menu, just a mish-mash of what they had left! We also had to ask for a spoon to stir our coffee and a fresh jug of milk. I realise that these things seem trivial, but to me they are basics that you expect when you pay ¬£56 for breakfast for two people!

Overall I'd say that the hotel is a great place to stay, but only if you're in the mood to be part of the 'trendy scene'. Most people who stay in the hotel and the staff think they're too cool to talk to you.

My recommendation to anyone looking to book here or somewhere like it would be to consider the Soho Hotel instead.",3,2009,12,04
125,Friendly & relaxed,"Lovely hotel, great location.  Staff relaxed and friendly - immediately made you feel welcome and comfortable. Only slight hiccup was being unable to find our bags initially but was soon resolved.  Was there to celebrate my birthday and definitely felt like it had been a celebration.",4,2009,12,04
125,Amazing - just go there!!,"Look at their website. If it just looks too odd - don't go. If, like me, you think it looks amazing then re-mortgage the house, sell the family silver - whatever it takes - just visit!!
I think all the bad reviews on here are from people who just don't get it?
Took my Partner overnight for her birthday. The hotel is stunning. A wonderfully eclectic mix of styles. Gold teeth and gnome seats next to a giant chess set in the foyer - need I say more!! 
Staff are wonderful and made the day absolutely perfect. Booked the 'romatic package' and our room looked amazing on arrival with champagne and rose petals.
Didn't eat dinner at the hotel but had cocktails in Asia de Cuba at midnight when it was packed but still they found us a table for 5 in 3 minutes somehow. A fabulous vibe and really relaxed atmosphere for somewhere so busy.
Thank you to all the staff for making our day so special.",5,2009,12,01
125,Fabulous!,"Beautiful, hip and trendy hotel, lovely rooms (we had a studio room with champagne, rose petals, candles and amazing views) and the bar is fantastic. Asia de Cuba does wonderful food and the service is perfect, although they do seem a little keen to move you on once you've finished eating, even if you are still drinking your wine. Very pricey but worth it if you have the money to spend!",5,2009,11,28
125,Overpriced,"Crowdy hotel, nice people, good restaurant Asia de Cuba and nice lounge bar but small rooms very expensive for the quality",3,2009,11,26
125,I Love This Hotel,"I stayed at the St. Martins Lane Hotel for a month in May and and returned for 2 more months in the fall.  I was in London for work and my family joined me for a month.  We loved this hotel.  The staff is very friendly and very helpful.  Even though hotel is very trendy, we never felt out of place or unwelcome with our 2 1/2 year-old son.   Down pillows and down comforters on the very comfortable beds.  I was so impressed with the bathroom I took pictures for design ideas for our own house.  Best of all, the hotel is in the perfect location in London.",5,2009,11,14
125,"eh,  just""ok""","Stayed at st martins lane in november 2009.  My wife and I are well traveled,  so we feel we know a good or bad hotel when we see one.  Very disappointed overall. rooms are run down and dirty.  Staff was very nice and helpful.   GREAT location!   Walk over and sit for coffee at  Trafalgar Sq. (there is a starbucks in front of the hotel) and people watch. Overall would not stay here again",3,2009,11,09
125,"Noisy, Moldy and Leaky","Room 315:
-Thin Walls and doors
-Black soot eminating from airconditioner that covered bed, table
Hotel:
-Stayed here in 2005 and loved it! Now it looked worn down and dirty.
-Leak in 3rd floor hallway, wet carpets and moldy smell
-Noisy patrons, drunk and throwing hairdryers in room next door at 2 am
Service: nice, quick check in/out and baggage service
-VERY expensive
Location:
-Great, walking distance to tube stations, restaurants and shopping
Will I stay here again?: NO",2,2009,10,24
125,Englands Answer to a W,"Very pleasant hotel - great location - upbeat atmosphere and very helpful staff particularly the concierge.  Lots of activity in the lobby, restaurant and rum bar.  Would stay here again.",4,2009,10,24
125,Not worth it,If it is important for you to be seen at the hip place...stay here.  If you want a nice hotel in a great location look else where.   The location is good the staff hot.  The rooms average the internet charge outrages.    You can stay in a dozen hotels in the same area with nicer rooms and not the crazy rates this hotel charges.,3,2009,10,11
125,A Great Hip Spot in The West End,"I often stay at The Royalton Hotel when I am in NYC, I love their stylish approach to hotelier, The Royalton is part of The Morgans Group and Morgans operates several properties, one of them is in London's West End; St Martins Lane. I stayed there for a night ,as I was taking the EuroStar to Paris, liked the hotel almost considered delaying Paris for a day or two but just decided I would retun to St Martins Lane each time I find myself in London. Cool hip stylish all those  descriptives fit St Martins Lane. Rooms not that big but bathrooms are great and it is a trade off to be in such a pleasing environment. Love this place.",5,2009,10,09
125,"My home in London.  Cool urban vibe, ideal central location, hot doormen","St. Martins Lane is my home whenever I am in london.  The hotel has a cool, contemporary vibe and is a hot spot at night.  Central location w/ immediate walking access to all that London offers.  The rooms and suites are smaller than you will find at other hotels but it is an easy trade off for me.  Ask for a corner room because the floor to ceiling windows make London all that much closer.    The doormen are the hottest in London and they are helpful as well.",5,2009,10,09
125,Great place to base your stay,"We were upgraded to a king size bed by the  welcoming front desk  clerk. First time in London, so we wanted a place with a great location, and  this hotel did  not disappoint.  Our room was clean  and had a great bathroom/shower. Great bed and pillows (
 I don't  understand other's reviews about beds: never slept so well!). Gym next door . Be warned however of exhorbitant costs for features such as laundry, and worse of all, LOCAL phone calls.  Apart from that, no complaints.",5,2009,10,06
125,Disappointing compared to its sister The Sanderson,"The loaction is great and the hotel very stylish but a couple of things let it down;
 - we arrived early but our room and our room was not ready so we left a case and our number at reception for them to call when it was (i was feeling unwell so wanted to lie down asap!)  At around 11.45 we had the call which was great.  I returned to reception and was just handed the keys to our room.  No explanation to where the room was we just guessed 503 was on the 5th floor but i would have liked to be told about the gym or asked if we wanted a paper during our stay.
- the bed.  it was awful.  it was SO uncomfortable, the worst hotel bed i have ever had, you could feel the springs and they creaked when simply changing (sleeping!) position.
 - the cleaner.  the bins are really small in the room so ended up having to put an almost empty coffee cup on the floor next to the bin so it could be cleared away.  The cleaner must have knocked it over but not realised so left the room with a big stain on the floor.",3,2009,10,05
125,Something different with friendly staff,"We drove past the hotel twice as it doesn't have a sign outside but once you realise this weird looking building is the hotel you appreciate its individuality.  NCP parking at back of hotel a plus.  Very friendly staff and quick efficient check in.  We had  a garden room which was great as you have your own private terrace, alebit small.  The main thing about the room is the lighting - there are no celing lights but strategically placed lamps and downlighters which allow you to tailor the ambience to suit your mood (I recommend for couples!).  Lovely shower and great (but of course expensive) mini bar.  Room service was efficient (we were told to expect our food in '24' mins and that is when it turned up!)  We didn't use the bar or restaurant but judging by the funky people hanging around the lobby it is a cool place to be seen.  Expensive (our room was ¬£350) but then this is London so why not spend your money somewhere like this which is a bit different?",4,2009,10,04
125,The staff are such a HUGE credit to this hotel,"A cool hotel in a fantastic location in central London. Not for you if you're looking for something traditional, but if you want something different with innovative decor then this is the place for you.

The most outstanding aspect for me about this hotel was the staff. They were all just so cheerful, polite, friendly, helpful & efficient. I can't praise them enough. Their attitude to their guests was actually very heart warming. When you consider that they all work in a very busy hotel in the centre of one of the major cities of the world, with a huge guest turnover, but they still managed to treat us as though we were the only guests they had dealt with all week. Absolutely commendable!

I would say that this hotel is just on the cusp of needing a little redecoration here & there soon. Nothing outstanding that needs doing specifically, but just a slight feeling that a bit of refreshing wouldn't go amiss in the near future, But, with staff like they have, don't worry about this at all.

We will be staying here again on our next visit to London - that's for sure!",5,2009,09,26
125,"Fabulous hotel, don't stay anywhere else in London!","Stayed at the St Martin's at the beginning of August and was just blown away by the hotel. I have stayed in a few swanky hotels around the world and St Martins has got to be one of the best. I stayed in a Garden room, which was lovely, small but perfectly formed and you still have room to move about . Service was amazing, everyone was pleasant, polite and would do anything to help. The Light Bar is a great place for a drink after shopping and the concierge will help you with any query. Room service was very good and the rooms have the best mini bar that I've ever seen, had dinner at Fifteen (amazing, go if you get the chance!) so can't comment on the restaurant.  
This is a fabulous hotel, you are made to feel special from the minute your taxi pulls up outside the door, don't stay anywhere else in London!",5,2009,09,25
125,"Exceptional Service, Great Location","I couldn't have been happier with my decision to stay at this hotel.  The room was quite nice--contemporary and with the best shower I have ever had in any hotel in Europe.  Nice bedding, toiletries, linens, etc.  Having access to the gym next door was also a big plus.  Getting to and from the hotel was a snap and there was tons to do and see close by.  In particular, the concierge and hotel staff was excellent.  With their help, I was able to completely debunk the myth that the food in England is sub-par--we ate like kings!",5,2009,09,24
125,Great Spot,"This is a good hotel in a great spot. The rooms are small and getting a litlle dated as other reviews have suggested. But they are well maintained and very clean. The staff were really helpful and friendly in a genuine way rather than the usual stuffy British way. The Location is perfect, in between Leichester Sq and Covent Garden, so most attractions are walking distance and there are plent of great eateries and bars in nearby SOHO. The bar at the hotel is also a great place to meet friends before heading out. I would definately stay there again. (or maybe try the sister hotel Sandersons)",4,2009,09,23
125,Nifty in the West End,"There's something about this hotel that seems thrown together as quickly as possible. While there is some neat stuff going on in the lobby like a bunch of over sized chess pieces and over sized gold teeth it's all a bit too whimsical for me. I like humor in things don't get me wrong but it was just a tad forced. The staff at the front desk were all very friendly and accommodating as were the bell boys and the concierge. The concierge in fact gve us a couple very good restaurant recommendations (mint leaf for one)
The room was not large, not even roomy; it was cozy/crowded. The closet was in an entrance hallway while the bed desk and TV stand were all deposited in the main chamber to make good use of little space. The room was modern and there was some sexy mood lighting for the bed! The bathroom was very modern and much bigger than one would expect from the size of the rest of the room.
The sound from the hallways carried a bit too well into the room and even an interior door only helped marginally. I guess it's good to know that people are having a good time inn your hotel though.
one night we stopped into the bar and had a drink; it was definitely an off night for there were maybe 4 other guests hidden away while we were there. This at the time was perfect for I just wanted a low key night cap. I could see it being very cool on a night with more activity and that would be fun too.",3,2009,09,21
125,A total convert,"I am booking hotel right now for a trip I'm making in November--and I will be going back to St. Martins Lane for the third time in less than a year.  A collegeague based in London recommended SML this past February--we had one night of meetings and then some girlfriends of mine were flying in from the states for a fun weekend.  I am not usually a fan of mimimalist hotels--I am normally a Dorchester devotee--but I loved everything about SML.  The location is fantastic--tube, restaurant and pubs are right out the door.  We night-capped each evening at the International right down the street on the corner of Trafalgar Square.  I am an avid runner and the Gym Box is a full-use gym and available to guests.  Travelling as much as I do, it is a nice change-up to be able to work out in a full size gym as opposed to a hotel gym.  Our experience was so great, I returned to SML this past June while over for Wimbledon and more business.  Same great staff, another great experience.  Our room had a problem with the A/C this time, which I called down about during the day.  They sent someone up right away--and when I returned to the hotel late that night I was told the problem couldn't be fixed.  We we offered another room--upgraded--and aside form the hassle of having to move everything late-night, the staff were great and accomodating.  Ordered room service every night after matches and it was always quick and delicious.
So, I am going to book again for my trip in November.  Hopefully this will be as good as all the others!",5,2009,09,12
125,Surely the best London has to offer,"We arrived at the hotel just after first check in time and were told at reception there was a problem with our room as the previous guests had checked out late. She dissapeared into the office for a minute or two and came back and told us they had upgraded us the Loft Queen Deluxe.

This was a huge room with a beautiful bathroom and dressing area.  The bath looked amazing but didn't get chance to try it in the one night we were there but the shower was fantastic anyway.

The room was fresh and clean and the lighting effects were certainly a novelty in the day and great fun at night!

Didn't get opportunity to eat at the restaurant although spent a few hours in the intimate Lightbar.  Again more lighting to look at along with some very odd faces on the walls!  The drinks were amazing although reasonably pricey but this hotel is right in the centre of the West End so not really a suprise.

Room Service breakfast was prompt in the morning.  The food seemed fresh and was delicious.  Only odd thing was the water container only had enough in it for 3 cups of tea between two of us so one had to go without a second cup!!

Checkout was quick and easy and the billing accurate.

I would recommend this hotel at a moments notice.  Its not the cheapest place in the world but the best things never come cheap.",5,2009,09,10
125,One of the best in London,"This is probably my favourite hotel! The staff are gorgeous, the hotel is gorgeous and the food is even better. Make sure you eat at the Asia de Cuba restaurant when you visit. (the Asia de Cuba salad' is to die for) The only gripe I have is the rooms are very small and the tv's are too, but apart from that this hotel is very trendy and worth the money!",5,2009,09,05
125,Experience the peaceful design in the West End... if you can afford it!,"I keep a delightful impression of my stay at St Martins Lane Hotel around Easter 2007.

Brilliant location in the West End, very quiet in spite of the very lively neighbourhood, extremely helpful and friendly staff, lovely design without being ""too much"", chic and young, excellent service (including a large ""welcome"" fruit basket in the room), the best (Queen size) beds I've experienced in a hotel so far.
The room was a bit smaller than expected, but it was not tiny either.

Even though pretty expensive, it's definitely worth staying at this hotel at least once!",5,2009,09,03
125,Great location. Quiet. Comfortable. Genious interior design.,"A very nice hotel, a 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square - and - in spite of the noisy neibourghood -  very quiet. Minimalistic design does not make the hotel boring  - visa versa - it is very cosy and you feel at home. I stayed at a Standard Queen, but had a possibility to see other room types.  All of them are equally nice. My room was not large, but then again - I did not need a dancing pool of a room for my trip.  There is enough space for all my stuff. The bed is very comfortable and large enough. The staff is friendly. The service is excellent. 
The restaurant - Asia di Cuba - is one of the best and fashionable places in London. And the food is delicious!",5,2009,08,21
125,Eh... Glamour stops once you get on the elevator,"We decided to go to London for a weekend trip, so time and location were of supreme importance, and in this regard, I think it would be difficult to find any fault with the St. Martin. It's supremely in the center of pretty much everything one would want to see, especially under a time constraint - map it. 

We generally like the emblematic Morgans/ Stark style (barring some randomly jarring and uncomfortable eye-brow raisers), and this seemed like a really fun concept - a hotel with a facade that changes colour at the whim of its guests. 

First impressions were fantastic - the lobby is fabulously clubby without being tacky, the clientele is young/ young at heart/ dating someone young, and the staff were very helpful. With these behind us and elated with visions of understated, and quirky elegance to come we headed for the elevators.  This is where the first cracks in the armour began to show... literally... the elevators themselves looked beaten up - scratched up, small and fairly ordinary with some hair metal band blaring from the speakers... a complete contrast to the decor just behind their doors.  To those thinking ""get over yourself, it's an elevator"", I'll disagree - elevators are usually a pretty solid indicator of both how old the hotel is and how much attention to detail is paid by the management - what we saw was a bad omen. The hallways weren't much better aesthetically, but did serve a purpose: by the time we got to our room we expected so little that a metal cot would have received the loudest ""Hallelujah!!!"" from us. 

The reality wasn't as dire, but the rooms, save a few special touches (large windows + great bathroom/ shower + the actual light changer over the bed) were borderline ordinary to sub-par. To illustrate: the TV in our room was a tiny black box with poor reception - it wasn't even a flat screen! For a design focused hotel, this is a very strange and outdated transgression - Motel 6 has better equipment. The furniture was at one point, undoubtedly, flawless, but had lost its freshness and was scuffed, beaten up and was beginning to cross into that bad state to which all of my IKEA furniture descends after enduring a move. Everything felt like it had overstayed its welcome by about two years and needed to be replaced desperately - the style was there from a distance, but at closer look, it was Potemkin's village. 

One great place to which we'd definitely go back to is the Intercontinental bar that was across the street - it had a great bar tender who was turning out flawless negronis and took great delight in his craft. We went there both nights and were impressed each time.",3,2009,08,20
125,bit of a mixed bag...,"The Good:
Asia de Cuba was delicious and wonderful, and the staff were friendly and sweet. The hotel location was fabulous, easy walking distance to Soho, Trafalger Square, and even the South Bank. The lobby and rooms were stunningly beautiful, very chic and design-saavy.

The Bad:
The bed was unbearably horrible - you could feel the springs in the mattress poking through. We were unable to sleep at all. The air conditioning (if you can call it that) would not cool off to a reasonable temperature - even at maximum ""cold"" setting it was humid and tepid in the room. 

Overall: 
Overpriced for what it was. Chic does not have to mean uncomfortable.",3,2009,08,17
125,The rooms really do need a bit of attention,"Amongst other things, there were stains on the carpet, the desk had a sticky substance (I suspect a cola drink) on it, the aircon barely worked, only one of the showerheads worked, the side unit in the bathroom was not straight and would make a racket when it tipped each time something was put on it.

Despite this, the staff continue to be superb (this is our second visit) and the location is excellent.  We will be back, but hopefully housekeeping and maintenance would have walked all the rooms and sorted out the minor issues by then.",4,2009,08,16
125,"Luxury, Location & Lovely Staff.","This hotel was perfect for our family.   I contacted them before leaving the USA requesting if it was at all possible we needed King bed in our room and two doubles for our teenage girls in their room.   Reply was quick and said they would accomadate us if at all possible.   Upon arrival the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable and meet our needs.   We were upgraded to rooms I requested at no extra charge.  Since it was 8:00 am they stored luggage and supplied us with breakfast ideas and maps until our rooms were ready.   Our rooms were very comfortable and large compared to European standards.  Bed very, very comfortable.  Beautiful private courtyard connected to our room.   Very modern hotel with its bright colors and interesting furniture.  We do wish the  lighting in room was a bit brighter.   Daughters room seemed fine.  Hotel must be soundproof as you can not hear anything in hallways or from downstairs where there is a very popular restaurant and a bar.  Throughout  our entire stay the hotel staff went out of their way to help with directions, maps, ideas, tickets & we never opened a door for ourselves. 

Did I mention the location?   Charing Cross tube in next block.  Leicester Square 1 block in other direction.   This is where my 17 year old got her picture taken with members of the new Harry Potter movie that was being promoted for release.  Tafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus all within walking distance.   Great restaurants and bars all within easy walking distance.   Would be very careful in the China district as it did not seem quite as safe and food was not good.",5,2009,08,12
125,"good location, tiny room!","Stayed for two nights last weekend. Paid ¬£180.00 per night without breakfast.  The room was tiny with ikea style furnishing! Good shower but no bathtub. 

Good location as very central.

Not worth the price we paid imho.",1,2009,08,07
125,Worth upgrading,"We stayed just one night as we wanted to see a show and not have to get home afterwards.  We got a deal on the website and booked a ""loft suite"" which was far bigger than other rooms we have stayed in before at this hotel, although technically neither a loft (3rd floor) nor a suite (only one room).  It cost ¬£337, which is a lot, though, even with the discount.  The room was gorgeous, with a big comfy bed, big bathroom with separate bath and shower, and two walls of full length windows.  There are plenty of amenities, including bath robes, slippers, umbrellas to borrow, but everything is also for sale, including the cactus!  The shower, which didn't have great water pressure, was a disappointment.  We ate off the room service menu, which was OK, but again very expensive.  If you are a light sleeper, take eyeshades, as the combination of big windows, gaps around the curtains and a pure white room means it gets very light in the mornings.",4,2009,08,07
125,Terrible!,"When we entered our room a look of shock consumed my boyfriends face. After returning from a 3 week holiday in the US and staying at hotels like the Encore Wynn and SLS Beverly Hills, this hotel is a DISGRACE! The rooms are the size of a matchbox LITERALLY! It is an insult for the hotel to make people stay in them for 250 pounds a night! The rooms would be more appropriate in a student hostel.. We told the reception we were not happy with the room and were told they were full which was a lie.. No one cared enough to help us out. and we never heard anything else from them.. We couldn't even fit our luggage in the room!!! It is rated as a 4 star so not sure why trip advisor has it as a 5 star.. Rated 4 star but more like 3 star.

We spent our stay trying not to trip and attempting to move furniture to make space to walk around the room without jumping and hopping to get to the bathroom. RIDICULOUS!!
Upon our return back home i received a feedback email from the hotel. I wrote a stinking review but still have not heard back. If you do somehow decide to stay at this hotel make sure you get a suite.. But for the price rather stay somewhere else! We travel to london every year and have never experienced anything so bad. The location is amazing.. Pity about the hotel!",1,2009,08,05
125,Overrated,"I have always wanted to stay in this hotel, as it has such an air of sophistication about it and is very unique. This time, during my trip to London, I chose to stay in St. Martins Lane as a special treat. What a waste of money. The lobby is great and very original. Unfortunately, it stops right there. The rooms are extremely tiny. One would have thought for the money (I was paying over GBP 250 per night) the rooms would be decent-sized. But no, they are small and cramped. You literally have to squeeze past the bed and forget it if you have more luggage or have done extra shopping. There are some nice touches in the room, such as the adjustable colourful lighting, or the Korres toiletries. But these do not compensate for the disappointingly tiny rooms.
One great thing about this hotel is the location. It is minutes away from the West End, Oxford Street, Knightsbridge etc.  But there are other, better-value hotels in this same neighbourhood too.
I would say, skip staying at the hotel and go to their restaurant or bar if you wish to get a taste of the ambiance. Personally, I will not stay again.",3,2009,08,04
125,Excellent hotel with great staff...,"Just back from a weekend stay at the St. Martin's Lane hotel.  Had a great stay at this stylish hotel.

Staff were great, friendly and helpful.

We had a garden room.  Not a huge outside space, but nice to have a small terrace with plants, a table and chairs.  Room had a great layout with separate wc, large walk-in shower and sink.

Used the i-pod docking station and nice to have a decent amount of channels on the flat screen tv.  DVD player also in the room - with free to borrow discs available.

Great location with many attractions within walking distance of the hotel - theatres, Leicerster Square, Trafalgar Sq, Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford St, National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery.....

Leicester Square tube about a 3 minute walk away.",5,2009,08,03
125,Bring your earplugs,"Stayed here for my birthday weekend last year, combined with a trip to the ENO. 
Nice, clean rooms, pricey room service. It was all going so well until a private function at the hotel turned its music up. Our room was directly above the din. 
I presented at reception and was greeted by clueless mannequin staff who didn't really care that my sleep had been disturbed. The racket continued until 2am, then we were further disturbed by the workmen dismantling the function, talking, shouting and slamming van doors... all under our window. The staff finally moved us to the 6th floor after 4am but by then the weekend was ruined as the private function was evidently more important than our rest. 
I declined the management's offer to stay there again at half price, and complimentary champagne. I wouldn't go anywhere near the place again. 
In summary, they didn't give a stuff. Abysmal customer service.",2,2009,07,30
125,Fun hotel with great location and friendly staff,"Got a fantastic rate of 160 pounds a night for this hotel off of the hotel's website. From the moment we stepped out of our cab, the service was flawless. Concierge was helpful and knowledgeable. Lobby and rooms are very modern, but starting to show a little wear and tear. Our room was small, but totally adequate given the price and location. We found the bathroom to be well designed, clean, and contemporary. Housekeeping were magicians, we never saw them, but their presence was obvious with the daily cleaning and turndown service. Asia de Cuba is located inside the hotel and was good, but not as good as the New York or Miami locations. Drinks in the hotel lounge were great, but we did think it was tacky to charge for nuts and olives, which are usually complimentary at other hotel bars. This is a modern, funky hotel and part of the Morgans hotel chain, which owns Delano in Miami. This chain prides itself on having ""party"" hotels, which means loud music in the evenings and club type atmosphere on the weekends with lines of people out the door trying to get in, so if you are not there to party, stay somewhere else. Also, the hotel does not have a sign, just a glass facade. Location is near perfect, easy walk to Leicester square tube stop and walking distance to most theatres and great restaurants. Overall, great stay and would definitely go back.",4,2009,07,29
125,Hotel is in an ideal location for all the sights in London!,"This is an amazing hotel!  When you walk into the spacious lobby you get a good feeling.  The front desk reception staff are very nice and helpful.  I booked a standard room and was very happy.  The room was spotless and comfortable.  When the towels are big and plush, I know the hotel is doing everything right!  The location of the hotel is perfect.  A block or two to the underground (subway) and from there you can get everywhere in London.  You are also right in the west end of London and there are theatres all around the area.  ""Sister Act - The Musical, is excellent!    From Heathrow Airport take the Piccadilly underground line and get off  the Leicester (pronouced Less ter ) Square stop.  Hotel is a couple blocks away.  How convenient is that?   Will definitely return to the St. Martin's Lane Hotel. 

P.S. Alex, one of the hotel's concierge is excellent.  He was very professional and provides great information during my stay in London!",5,2009,07,27
125,excellent hotel in great location,"From the outside it was difficult to tell that this building was the hotel, but as you step inside it really has the wow factor if you like the modern minimalistic look. 
Reception was bright with funky furniture, the staff really pleasant and constantly asking (not in an annoying way) if they could assist us with anything.
Our room was small but we were not intending to spend long in it, upgrade if you intend to do much more than get showered, changed and sleep here. Everything is white except for a bit of silver and one pink plant - which is the only colour in the room. My husband woke up and said he feels he's woken up in an asylum!!!!  How he knows what it's like to wake up in an asylum i don't know. The bathroom is of a good size with nice fixtures and fittings, and good quality toiletries.
We didn't eat or drink in the hotel but i understand the food is good although it defiantly has 5* prices. 
Would i stay here again ....personally no but that is because it is not really our style rather than its a bad hotel.",4,2009,07,20
125,A stay at the Plasterboard palace.,"A converted, 1960's/70's ugly looking office block, hence a limited picture of the hotel.  I don't undertstand why it has a 5 star rating.  The bedroom was so called 'Trendy' but looked like it was kitted out by Ikea and awkwardly designed.  The reception and feel to the hotel felt seedy.  I would have much rather spent my money at an established hotel.  The plaster board walls needed a slap of paint .  The cocktails were dreadfully expensive, the highest prices I have paid in London.   The bed was small but comfortable.",3,2009,07,15
125,Far better than expected,"Booked a superior queen room for two nights through priceline, came out to less than $400 a night including fees and taxes. 

Location is fabulous. Centrally located with easy access to the tube, and despite being in the center of what I would imagine to be a fairly touristy area (theatre district), not at all noisy or unpleasantly crowded during my stay there.

First, rooms I had was superbly designed, perhaps not huge in square footage, but laid out in such a way that it felt spacious (the bathroom was, by any objective measure, huge) and airy and clean without being cold or antiseptic. An entire wall was floor to ceiling windows looking out on St Martins Lane. Wonderful.

The linens, the bedding all white (no way to hide stains so this to me indicates a hotel intent on demonstrating cleanliness) and extremely comfortable. Service was professional, helpful. Though a ""trendy"" Morgans hotel, there was no attitude at all. Very nice.

Buffet breakfast at 15 pounds not cheap but well worth it if you're a big eater as they have a great selection of pastries, fruits, meats, etc.

Room service food surprisingly exceptional. All in all really, really satisfied.

A couple of minuses, some glitch with the window blinds and one of the lamps didn't work. One day, an elevator out of order during that hour when a lot of guests need to be leaving to take in the city, go to business meetings or check out. So a little improvement needed in these maintenance areas, but all in all great value for the money. Would definitely return!",5,2009,07,13
125,Luxurious and comfortable accommodation in great location.,"Having just returned from a weekend break at SML with my husband, I must say that we enjoyed our time in this hotel for a number of reasons, but more experienced travellers may find their ""style over content"" a tad pretentious. Our room, a garden room, was immaculate when we checked in, although we were surprised to find that we had been provided for with numerous items for which we have no use, including cigarettes, clothing, and an indulgent selection of nibbles in the mini-bar, but no kettle. Given the layout and content of the room, we expected to find that tea and coffee making facilities were hiding in a minamalist unit somewhere, but no! You may smoke, you may drink champagne, you may wear their dressing gowns, but you may not make coffee in your room. The arrogance of this decision annoyed me intensely, and our first visit around the sights of London was to the local shops to purchase kettle and coffee. I think it is arrogant to assume guests will order room service at bedtime, at waking up, upon arrival and at any other times. For guests not able to purchase a kettle, thank heavens for the numerous coffee houses nearby. However, that aside, the hotel can not be faulted for the quality of its rooms. As mentioned by other reviewers, we found the bed, and the luxurious linen very comfortable, and appreciated the visit from housekeeping to refresh linens and towels twice daily. During our absence, the room was tidied and was a pleasure to return to. The small garden area was a true haven and amazingly peaceful, given the noise associated with nearby Trafalgar Square, and the location was perfect, with Covent Garden, Leciester Square, and the Embankment all a small distance away on foot. Additionally, all members of staff encountered by us during our stay were very courteous and polite, especially when explaining the additional ¬£300 they were adding to my bill in case of ""incidentals"". Overall, it was an interesting and comfortable experience, but I wouldnt return, because we like our cuppa in the morning too much.... in fact much more than we need an 'intimate kit ' or an ipod dock!!",4,2009,07,13
125,Excellent location and service but is it worth the money?,"St Martins Lane hotel is in a great location, just a couple of minutes from Trafalgar Square and close to the tube etc. We stayed here for one night as we had a couple of parties in London to attend and couldn't be bothered to get the train home late. 

We had a deluxe king room which we booked as part of a special offer from Travelzoo meaning that it was half the regular room rate. We felt that we had got a bargain considering the reputation of the hotel and I think we did, although I don't think I would stay here at full price (almost ¬£300 a night). The room was ok if a little small, we were on the fifth floor which meant it was nice and quiet too. The HD ready TV had a terrible signal and even though we did not go to watch TV it was pretty appalling for a hotel of this standard. Having said that though the rest of the room was well equipped and the bathroom was nice a spacious although lacking a bath but with an excellent shower. The Korres products were a nice luxury tough as we the candles in the bathroom. Be warned though everything in the hotel room is pretty much chargeable! I can understand why this has to be the case but I doubt anyone would just happen to take the throw from the bed, certainly not if they knew they would be billed ¬£210. Helpfully (?) though there is an extensive list of the items that you will be charged for should they accidentally go home with you...

We visited the Light Bar in the evening and this was perghaps the highlight, excellent cocktails and attentive service, worth a visit.

The staff also deserve a sopecial mention, they were nothing but helpful throughout our stay. I was however a little annoyed that when we arrived to check in at 3pm our room was not ready nad we were instructed to go and have a coffee and come back in a bit. I think room sreally ought to be ready at the time they state considering that at full price the hotel is about ¬£14 an hour!

All told an enjoyable stay, would I stay again? Maybe, if the price was right but I think it would have to be a better deal even than the one I got this time. You seem to get much better rates in the US hotels and better offers too.",3,2009,07,13
125,Uncomfortable Beds/Small Rooms,"It's a very trendy looking hotel and the staff is great, but don't expect a good night's sleep because the beds are awful and the rooms are tiny.  It's like staying at an Ibis hotel, but you're over paying for the experience.",1,2009,07,10
125,Feels a tad bit been there done that...,I have stayed in many different hotels in London at this price range and well I wasn't impressed. Things started off poorly when I arrived after a long overnight flight and was disappointed that my room wasn't ready when I was exhausted. OK not a deal breaker but really annoying when you want to be fresh for your evening out. Now given the latest allowed checkout would probably be 1;00 pm ish don't you think a room can be cleaned in an hour??? Obviously not. Asia de Cuba the restaurant was really quite good and I ate both a lunch and dinner there. Service there was really attentive and particularly my dinner service was exceptional. Food was flavorful and suggestions for both dishes and cocktails were always well thought out. Room service fare was quite dull and at this level hotel I think you should be able to order off the menu when what you are asking for is simply grilled cheese and tomato sandwich. Is it really so challenging? The hotel room itself was large (I had booked a loft king room) but how about a chair that was comfortable? The bathroom was well appointed and luxurious. I heard other guests commenting on their small rooms so I am glad I spent more for the space but it felt sterile and unwelcoming. Even the design aesthetic of a W is hip without being uncomfortable. The bartenders were very good throughout...they knew their trade...but somehow the whole vibe except for Asia de Cuba seemed of days gone by...like Studio 54 in the late 90's - when the bloom has gone off the rose.,3,2009,07,06
125,Great choice if you get it for the right price,"We stayed at the St Martins Lane for 2 nights in early June while in London for the Twenty20 World Cup. I decided that we deserved a treat and something a bit nice and ended up getting the hotel through Priceline for $160 per night which was half the price that the hotel was offering. 

Location is brilliant and the best I've ever had when staying in London. Two minutes walk to Leicester Square tube, and just around the corner from Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery. Lots of restaurants and pubs to choose from nearby.

The hotel itself is quite funky although a bit bizarre in places! The room was adequate in size - the bed was comfortable and there was a flat screen tv, dvd player and an ipod dock as well. The hotel offers a free dvd service - choose your dvd and they send it up with some complimentary popcorn! What really was the best was the bathroom - it was lovely - contemporary and roomy and the power shower is the best I've ever had. Top marks for that! 

Check-in and out was speedy and efficient. 

I'm not sure that I would pay the rack rate (around ¬£260 per room) but if you get a deal then this is a really good choice.",4,2009,06,29
125,"nice weekend getaway, probably best in the off season","I had a good time here, but maybe it's because I got stuck in London an extra day in the great snowstorm of '09?  St. Martins Lane was great for a quick London weekend getaway.  Very central location, which is nice...not nice is the outdated Schrager boutique hotel thing that's getting a bit old...but still a sexy place to stay for a weekend rendezvous.  The rooms could be bigger, but all you have to do is ask and they will upgrade you (well, in the off season at least...)  The bathrooms are fun, be prepared for no privacy.  The shower is nice, bath products were yummy.  The bed is crap, but the mood lighting and fluffy white sheets and pillows made up for it.  The ipod player didn't work well, bring your own.  View of Trafager Square was nice...again, I asked for a good room on a high floor with a view and I got it.  All you have to do is be nice and ask!",4,2009,06,16
125,Ooooh so trendy!,"I've stayed in this hotel a couple of times and I must agree with an earlier comment that this is London's best kept secret. I have friends who live in Central London and they have never seen or heard of it - the lack of any name or identification on the front obviously contributes to this. However, when they came to visit me, they were blown away by the hotel's (and mine by association!) coolness. 

This hotel is uber-trendy. Though the decor can seem a bit harsh at times (lots of angles, somewhat avant-garde furniture and the lighting/walls are saturated with white) it retains a welcoming and classy atmosphere. I've stayed in most of the room types and the basic rooms can be a bit small, but the best value/space ratio seems to be the garden rooms (basically a small 4x4 foot ""garden"" with a tree, table and chairs). However, this is still expensive for similar sized rooms in London. The higher up rooms, loft and suite (I think) are of delightful, but can be a rather on the very expensive side - but very chic if you want to make an impression! (ahem)

Staff were courteous, rooms were clean, food was excellent. My only gripes would be a) the price (all extras seemed to be a tad pricey) and b) the bouncers on the door of the bar can get a bit bolshie and wont let you in if you forget your room key. This happened me once and was a little embarrassing with me having to head back to the room to get the key before they'd let me in.

However, gripes aside, I must admit I love this hotel. It's classy, trendy, yet not obnoxious (bar bouncers excepted!) and will be staying there in the near future!",4,2009,06,09
125,St Martins Lane Best Kept Secret,"The St Martins Lane Hotel has to be one of the best kept secrets, as a born Londoner I think that I know London well but arriving by car it took 2 trips round the block to find St Martins and only then by the very discret number 45 etched in the glass at low level, there is no external signage and it looks very much like an office block, which I suspect it once was.  Inside the foyer can only be described as very modern qerky. Once upstairs the corridors were silent and the brave use of unpaterned light colour carpet in public areas offers a nice contrast from the usual. The room was all white without any pictures a full height window filling the external wall. A clear pricing policy on everything in the room made it clear for those prone to take items not nailed down the consequences allows a nice range of loose bits.
Overall a very nice experience, no noise given its very central position. Critism, we could not lift the lighting level in the bath room and being very English and always looking for this service there was no kettle or tea makingh facility just a small complementary bottle of water.",4,2009,06,08
125,Very nice hotel - Excellent location,"Just got back from a long weekend in London.  We wanted to stay someplace near the sites since we only had 2 1/2 days to sightsee.  This hotel is in an excellent location.  Just off Trafalgar Square and close to Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus and Convent Garden.  We were able to walk to other sites including Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace, but it is easily accessible to 2 Underground tube stops.  We used the tube a bit to travel to further sites and it was very easy to follow.  The hotel itself is very trendy looking and clean.  The bathroom was very nice.   Restaurant was good, but on the expensive side.  The hotel bar gets very crowded on weekend nights, but once we went up to our room, we didn't hear a thing.  The hotel has a small business center with free internet access for guests, which I liked very much.  Cost us just under $300/night.  Definitely recommend given its location.",5,2009,05,18
125,"Cool Hotel, Great Location","SML is a funky design hotel in the heart of Covent Garden.  It's location is excellent with 2 tube stations nearby and most things within walking distance.  
The overall design is very modern and of note are the lobby and the lifts as well as the lighting feature in the bedrooms.  We stayed in a Deluxe King Room which was bright, clean and spacious.  My one criticism is that the curtains barely block any light so bring an eyemask if you want to sleep in late!  The bathroom was marble and very large with seperate WC and Shower.  Great space for laying out your cosmetics too!  And very good lighting options from very bright to candle lit. 
The bar is average at best.  Not much atmosphere, uncomfortable chairs and closing at 10.30pm on a bank holiday Sunday night!??  But ok as a hotel bar goes.  The restaurant on the otherhand is fantastic.  Delicious food and incredibly friendly and attentive staff.  The door and reception staff were also very helpful.
Would I go there again?  Definitely.",5,2009,05,06
125,OVER RATED,"This hotel is part of a chain have stayed in 3 other of the hotels so one would hope that the same level of service and continuity would prevail...Sadly not ,felt i was imposing on the staff while staying there..
rooms of a poor standard ,over priced, and like some airlines at every opportunity seeking too extract money (be carefull of mini bar and toiletries prices)   overall totally overpriced ,and a London hotel that doesnt care.....",2,2009,04,29
125,"Stylish, modern, comfortable hotel right in the heart of London!","This hotel impresses from the moment you arrive outside. Greeted by the doorman who opened the door of the taxi and brought in our bags and was more than helpful directing us to the front desk. Staff here were chatty and very friendly too!

Rooms are very comfortable, bright, clean and spacious with lots of gadgets including iPod speakers and a mood light ;) (In fact pretty much the only thing I can fault the room on was the cheap toilet paper lol!)

The Hotel bar is pricey certainly but love the fabulous artwork on the walls :) very dramatic. The food in the restaurant (Asia de Cuba) is a real mix of styles but works so very well especially if you are a fish fan! Totally recommend it, yum!

All round a really wonderful stay and will definitely visit again. Location is just perfect right off Leicester Square!",4,2009,04,23
125,"Great design, and excellent location!","I stayed at St Martins for three nights the third week in March this year. I knew it would be expensive, it was. I knew I would cringe when I saw the bill, I did. But what a wonderful place, yes I do say it is worth the money. The location is a five min walk to the National Gallery and the Natonal Portrait gallery. If you love art this is a great place. About a 1/2 hour walk you can walk to the British Museum. Soho with its bars, great food and very late night people watching is a blast, and its just blocks away. I can tell it had it's hayday 5 or so years ago, but the design is beautiful, the rooms are very clean and sleek. It was a special place to stay.",5,2009,04,05
125,Great Hotel - Shame about the bed !,"We stayed at the St. Martin's Lane hotel on a Saturday night at the end of March... we wanted to stay somewhere funky and somewhere cool and St. Martin's Lane did deliver. The bar downstairs, the hotel music, the concierge on duty (Victor) and the general ambiance of the hotel was very very cool.

One thing that we must note for any people looking for a ""romantic getaway""  (and this can be viewed as good or bad) that wish to travel to St. Martin's Lane - the hotel beds are somewhat..... hmmmm.... noisy. The beds are made of metal... the metal joints rubbed against each other and rattled like a 9.5 Richter scale (and that is not boasting about bedroom skills honestly  ;)   )   One thing that you‚Äôll not find noted in any review is that the stairwell next to the lifts are seldom utilised by the staff and offer sanctuary for those ""romantics"" who wish for a little quietness from the bed and a little naughtiness ;)

All in all though, we would highly recommend this hotel !

TeamSSSM",4,2009,04,02
125,Overated,Not worth ¬£247 (inclusive of taxes) for a not terribly big room. I was automatically put into a room on the Smoking Floor (apparently this is what they do with group bookings although why we should have to put up with rooms that reek of smoke is beyond me. As I was going straight into a meeting on arrival and then changing to go to a film premiere I did not have time to mess around with changing rooms. The smell was so bad I had to light the scented candle that I keep for when I travel to less luxurious hotels and destinations (hadn't expected to have to use it here). I never found out how to turn the airconditioning down so the room was a bit cold. There was no door to the bathroom (just an innner door to the loo). I was also called by my first name automatically which may be very trendy but which I though overly familiar (the staff were generally nice but had obviously been trained to use first names). Room service breakfast was ridiculously expensive at ¬£25 (I found lots of places to go in Covent Garden like Patisserie Valerie in Bedford Street). Go to the top of the Portrait Gallery nearby for a great afternoon tea and stunning views.,3,2009,03,25
125,Ideal for scene-stealers and trend-setters - but beware of HEAVY prices in the Light Bar!,"I recently returned to stay at St. Martin's Lane, to meet up with some musician friends who were repeat guests at the hotel. I booked the room via Expedia and was thrilled when hotel staff offered to upgrade the Queen bed room I paid for to a larger King bed room and housekeeping put in an extra roll-out bed for my friend free of any extra charges. The staff at the front desk were all friendly and fast with our check-in and the room was well-equiped and very nice indeed. Dental care kits and shaving kits are free, as are the excellent Agua Spa products which are in the bathrooms. Unlike at the sister hotel, The Sanderson in Soho, there is no Agua Spa at St. Martin's Lane. Hotel guests can use the gym next door for free. One disappointment about the rooms is that there is no coffee machine or any kettle. Even Travel Lodge budget hotels have free tea and coffee in their rooms, so you'd expect it in a 5 star hotel!  We had to go to Starbucks across the road instead, as the drinks in the room's mini bar cost about the same as two bought together in Starbucks. Don't bother ordering anything on room service unless you have loads of money to spend and don't care about paying an extra ¬£3.75 ""tray charge"" PLUS a 15% ""gratuity charge"". A hot chocolate ordered to your room can cost almost ¬£10! A plate of doughnuts was ¬£28! The Light Bar downstairs is for serious scene-stealers and London trend-setters, packed with business people and fashion and media types. The drinks prices here are far from light! just as shocking as the room service prices, ¬£12 just for a gin and tonic was ridiculous and beware of the service charge PER DRINK even if you order at the bar! Not worth it unless you're loaded. The Bungalow 8 club downstairs is for members only or if you go in with somebody famous (who doesn't have to be a member, just known!) but I wasn't all that impressed. There are two main rooms, but it's small and more of a chic lounge than a nightclub. Hotel guests can only go in there up until 10pm, but it's empty in there until after midnight. It wasn't all that packed when we were in there, so I think they ought to relax the rules. Paparazzi were hanging around outside, but that's not unusual, as celebrities still go there and stay in the hotel. We had more fun partying in our room with cheaper drink bought in a local store than in the bar or Bungalow 8! If you're going to stay here, take my advice - it's for socialising and partying with friends! Don't expect to get any sleep at all until after 3am, as the music from downstairs can easily be heard if you're on a lower floor.
Location of the hotel is perfect. Walking distance from both Leicester Square and Covent Garden tube stations, lots of nice cafes and restaurants in the area, too.",4,2009,03,25
125,Cool place !!!,"2 night on business. Very stylish and cool place, excellent restaurant and bar. Helpful and interested staff right in the center of it all. Perfect place for a few cool days in London. Exceeds expectations compared with other Morgans Group hotels.",5,2009,03,25
125,The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In!,"OK.  There is so much to say about St. Martin's Lane.  First, the location is the BEST in London.  It was so nice, I never used the Tube.  Right down the street, literally, was Westminster, which is a must see.  The walk to the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral was approx. 20-25 mins.  The staff were fabulous! I arrived 2 hours before check in time and after an overnight flight from Chicago, and I the front desk immediatley checked me in, gave me the room early, and within 10 minutes, I was in my room.  The operator assisted me in making calls and provided me with the information I needed to dial out.  The concierge went above and beyond his duties to chat with me and help me plan an excursion.  All in all, the staff was sincere, poliete, and super helpful.  They are truly professionals!  The rooms were fantastic!  The style is funky-hip-modern, and I loved it.  The bed was comfortable, the linens were perfect, and the room was just nothing short of awesome!  The bathroom was the best and cleanest hotel bathroom I have ever seen!  The shower provided plenty of hot water, and it was well stocked and spacious!  The hotel bar was young, vibrant and hip.  I do have to admit I spent some quality time in there Saturday night!  The music was great, the drinks were flowing, and everyone was in great spirits!   I can't say enough about this place!  It was great, London is my favorite city by far, and I plan to return within the next two months!",5,2009,03,17
125,Incredible!!!! Go to this hotel!!!,"I strongly recommend this hotel to those who can afford it. It's in a great location, the atmosphere is unbeatable, the service (reception, guest services, room service, etc) is HIGH QUALITY. The design of the room is top of the line, and the bathroom.... SO NICE!!!
The only thing that I don't agree with this kind of hotels, is that when you pay $360 for one night, the Internet connection MUST be for free.
Overall rating: 10/10!!!!",5,2009,03,13
125,London Shines at St. Martins Lane Hotel,"St. Martins Lane Hotel must be very confident about its identify.  The Hotel name does not appear on its modern structure.  The confidence is well founded.  A contemporary hotel in the modern style with excellent services, a great location, the cleanest rooms I have seen, and a spacious bathroom.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  In the heart of Covent Garden and just up the Lane from Trafalgar Square, the relatively quiet street is centrally located close to the tube and wonderful restaurants.  Lighting is used to great effect creating different moods and the sense that the sun is shining 24 hours a day -- quite a trick in London.  Next trip to London will certainly bring us back to St. Martins Lane.",5,2009,03,08
125,Not worth your money,"I stayed here with my husband and 6 month old daughter for a weekend and we were really disappointed, for what is meant to be a 4/5 star hotel we really did not get value for our money. We had to ask 4 times for a travel cot to be brought to our room even although we had informed them in advance we would require one when we had booked our stay. Our room was so small we had to put the cot behind the door to fit it in, obviously causing a fire hazard. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we left our bags and were told they would phone us when it was ready, we were never called and just returned in the evening. Also our 'City View' was of building work. Finally we were awoken in the late evening by the hotel staff trying to get into our room, they couldnt give us an explanation for this, just an apology.
The hotel is nicely decorated and the staff were ok but neither were anything special. It's only saviour is the location which is fab, near to Covent Garden, the theatres and the underground amongst other things. 
Next time we visit London we'll be staying in a cheaper hotel and using the money saved to shop more!!",3,2009,03,04
125,A fantastic hotel with a superb restaurant,"Stayed here for my birthday with my boyfriend...he organised dinner at the gorgrous Asia de Cuba and the staff could not have been more accomodating. The room had an amazing view from the sixth floor looking over London and great facilities. The rooms are perfectly formed, not the largest but have great querks and luxuries to make the stay fantatsic for a one night surprise. The restaurant was by far the highlight and you can get ¬£100 off your food bill when staying the night. I could not recommend this place highly enough, to top it all, only a short walk to galleries or shopping...whatever takes your fancy on a sunday morning",5,2009,03,02
125,Had a good stay at this hip hotel at a superb location,"St Martins lane is defnitely a 'funky' hotel - the first impression is definitely a strong one with the 'psychedelic lighting' enveloping you as you enter the lobby and then step into an elevator. The rooms are modern, clean and decently equipped. Loved the decor and the mood lighting behind the beds. Only thing I totally disliked was the lack of a kettle and tea/coffee bags in the room. I might be acting picky but I havent stayed in a hotel around the world which didnt have a kettle and tea for a morning cup. Also, everything is chargeable and there isnt a bottle of water too which is on the house. Otherwise, I had a lovely stay at this nice hotel in the heart of London. Also, the Asia De Cuba restaurant serves absolutely wonderful food!",4,2009,02,18
125,"Great Location, but.....","The location of this hotel can't be beat but you must like very modern decor.  

Our room was ridiculously tiny - we could have paid more for a slightly bigger room, but even that was far from spacious.  I believe there may be larger rooms available.

The size of the room did not bother me as much as the flimsy towels- I even had one with an actual hole in it!  We booked this on Expedia and paid an average of 200 pounds per night.  Although I realize this was a good rate, I think proper towels would be expected.

The final thing that was a bit annoying was that this tiny room had a total of 8 cubby holes for your clothes (no drawers because the room wasn't big enough for a dresser.)  The management decides to use one of the cubbies to put soaps, shampoo etc that are available for sale!  Finally, they have a list of all the things you can purchase from the hotel such as the tiny clock that was in the room, a $30.00 laundry bag (plastic ones weren't provided) and last but not least the horrible towels!",3,2009,02,16
125,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location, just darn expensive !!","Stayed at this lovely hotel on Feb 7th & 8th - 6 of us in 3 rooms. ¬£195+vat per room, including full english and/or continental breakfast.

The Good (the bad)
- clean, tidy, warm room. lovely en-suite (but no bath, just shower)

- we were on 6th floor - nice open views (but the venetian blind between the glass panes couldn't be adjusted to look higher or lower)

-hi fi, tv, dvd, ipod dock, & room facilities were excellent. (wi-fi not free though)

- efficient room heater (but no numerals on the display, so quite tricky to work out where to set it)

-Asia de Cuba - pleasant restaurant for breakfast, - we ate out for dinner - and nice food,  (but service a bit slow)

-ajoining disco/bar funky and well staffed (but my God the drinks are pricey - SEVEN QUID for a single cointreau!!!)

-reception & door staff very helpful and friendly.

- thoughtful too. There was a free bottle of wine in my daughter's room for her 21st, that they had picked up on.

-wonderful location, barely 5 mins from Leics Square tube. (but could do with taking a hotel location map with you as several 'St Martin' streets nearby are a bit confusing at first)

- Bungalow 8 night club is below this hotel, with access via the lobby, and hotel guests can go in for free from 6 up till 10pm. (but no one else is in at that time !!)

-ability to use adjoining gymn facilities (but no pool).  We didn't as it happens.

overall - a lovely hotel in a great location, its just so darn expensive.  But we will be back!!",5,2009,02,14
125,Great Place for the Tragically Hip,"This place is a caricature of what a cool hotel should be.  From the golden molar chairs in the lobby to the highly touted ""mood lighting"" in the headboards and the continuous video loop of swimming goldfish in the elevators, one would be hard-pressed to find a place that  lives on its undeserved hipster reputation more than this place.  

The crowd ranges from people that wish-to-be-seen to 55 year old businessmen pulling their wheelie bags through the lobby thinking that their presence in hotel gives them some credibility with people 25 years their junior.  Seriously.  The rooms are the size of a postage stamp, and the furniture is Ikea quality.  If you want to mix it up amongst this crowd, you deserve this place.  

On a positive note, the location is great, and the doormen are very polite and friendly.",2,2009,01,27
125,"Cool, funky hotel","The hotel is really quite different from most hotels one has stayed in. The colours, the interiors, the staff, all come together to position it as a hip, funky place to stay! 

The lobby has some really unique and unconventional pieces of furniture, and along with the lemon green lighting, almost makes it seem like a lounge bar that one is entering rather than a hotel! The bar on the ground floor is very happening in the evenings and closes to become a huge fish bowl during the day. The restaurant, Asia de Cuba, features some excellent carribean cuisine. Book early (even in these recessionary times) if you do not want to wait!

The passage to the rooms are in deep blue and orange and the room numbers are not on the door but on the carpeting in front of the room. Inside the lemon green shades return in the form of the walls making it a complete visual experience. Good beds, excellent . 

The only crib I have is that they ought to have a kettle in the room as a hot cup of tea on a cold London morning would have made this a totally excellent stay!",4,2009,01,27
125,location,"I stayed at this property throughout 2008 an wanted to drop a few lines.
The location is all about this hotle. It is in West End and is close to everything.
Service is OK and the breakfast is fine. The real deal is the restaurant Asia De Cuba which should be experienced.
The rooms are very minimal and could be irritating.
I would return only if I can get a good rate.",3,2009,01,26
125,Walking distance to the Theater District,"Stayed here and at their sister property, the Sanderson in 2006, suites for both. Very modern, lots of glass and minimalist lines used. Floor to ceiling windows, welcome bouquets and evening munchies. Yada, yada.

Walking distance to the Theater District, which was very helpful. We had so much fun in London, I can't wait to go back!

Yes, I supposed it's all for the bragging rights. I've certainly stayed at much better hotels, but this is just for the London experience of it all.",4,2009,01,23
125,Style over substance,"Great location and very stylish but the rooms aren't that big, there's not much in them and bed was very soft and uncomfortable - my  back hasn't been the same since! There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, the mirror is miles from the plug and the shower flooded the bathroom. Also the rooms are quite small and the much vaunted 'floor to ceiling windows aren't at all impressive.

We paid ¬£37 for two very small and ordinary cocktails in the (admittedly very chic) bar and breafast was ¬£25 per person for a filled roll and a hot drink.",2,2009,01,22
125,Minimalist Comfort,"Location is the key here, 2 mins. walk to the nearest  tube which gets you everywhere in London you want to go. We took the Underground Piccadily line from Heathrow -the most economical and easiest way if you don't have much luggage. It will cost you 4 pounds and 45 minutes. Our friends took a cab, it costs 80 pounds and 80 mins.! 
I always prefer a minimalist approach and the hotel decor appeals to me. Simple and clean and no clutter.  My only complain- the aluminum steel chairs in the study desk is much too cold to sit on!
If and when you stay at this property-get the breakfast and internet package. Bring your IPOD, they have a music dock in the room. 
I've stayed at the Clift in San Francisco and the Royalton in NY, these Morgan Hotel properties tend to attract a young and hip clientele.",4,2009,01,21
125,Great Bathroom,"Our room was very expensive, but worth it for a special occasion.There are huge floor to ceiling windows and the room is decorated in a very modern and bright way with nice white furnishings. The bed was large and very comfortable with mood lighting above the bed.

The bathroom was by far the selling point. A huge bath (big enough for two!) with plenty of bubbles provided. Also has a big separate shower cubical, all very nicely designed and laid out.

The location is great too, right near leicester sq, covent garden and most west end theatres.

The breakfast looked delicious, unfortunately I just couldn't justify ¬£25 each for it. Which in hindsight may have been a mistake as early Sunday morning we struggled to find anywhere else to eat!! Oh and as you would expect drinks from the minibar are very expensive - ¬£4 for a 0.5l bottle of still water and ¬£5 for an even smaller bottle of OJ.

Overall a very nice stay.",5,2009,01,13
125,Not very service oriented,"This hotel has solid modern design (although I guess its not that modern anymore) with a decent location and its clean (although the wall to wall carpeting is not the best for cleanliness)

However, it seems that they are trying to make money from every single thing they can. Its an expensive hotel and I would assume that they would be happy with the customers paying that much money. For example, I went to a club nearby and the doorman suggested we take a hotel cab which cost us 18 pounds even though the regular cab would cost 5 (and I asked about the distance and was assured it was far and the price was OK). 

Overall, there is a snobbish feel to this hotel. Its interesting to see the design elements if you are into that. although you can go to the bar and have a drink or lunch before going to the theater.",3,2009,01,05
125,not that good,"Been there after new year's eve. Very good location as far as theaters are concerned and very central.
The room was stylish, though it was small. 
We asked them to make a reservation to a club, they sent us to an other club that is not worth talking about.
Breakfast costs 25 pounds, extremely expensive for this crisis' period.
We asked for a taxi, they suggested their own hotel car that cost 3 times the taxi price and they cheated us by telling that the place we wanted to go was 15 minutes away.( the place was 5 blocks away) 
It doesn't worth the money, enough with the hotels that appear to be 5 star and they are 3 star hotels. If you want to be a five star hotel, then respect your customers.",2,2009,01,05
125,Can't imagine a better place to stay in London...Simply Great!,"Spent Christmas week here with my wife and 16yo daughter and had an amazing time. They upgraded us to a deluxe room, just because they could not give us an early check-in. Staff was very pleasant and helpful (ask for Greg). They made some nice dining suggestions and got us great seats for Billy Elliot which by the way was great as well. The rooms were very clean, modern and the complimentary turndown service which also included a quick clean up was a nice touch. The restaurant in the hotel was excellent, a Cuban fusion with portions for two and some amazing deserts. But this hotel is all about the location. Its right on top of Trafalgar Square which is just a few minutes walk from everywhere (Piccadilly, Covent Gardens, Oxford, Leicester, Whitehall, etc). Can not recommend this place enough.",5,2008,12,29
125,"Trendy hotel, great location","This is a hotel very much in the minimalist / trendy category, with a popular bar and ""white cube"" rooms with floor to ceiling glass. My girlfriend and I booked one of the cheaper rooms but we still had a nice view out onto the street, a huge bathroom with a large tub, and a reasonable size bedroom (especially for London!). The location is excellent - very close to Trafalgar Square (for the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery) and surrounded by theatres and Covent Garden restaurants. Highly recommended - a designer hotel that really works (unlike some others - including New York's Hudson which is even the same hotel group).
.",5,2008,12,26
125,Has to be the best hotel in London,"Awesome hotel.  I stay here at least once a month for business (so in total around 15 or so stays over the last year).  Located immediately behind Leceister Square Station and about a minute from Trafalgar Square so perfect for tourists.  5 mins walking distance to Picaddilly Circ, Convent Garden/theatreland.  Buckingham Palace is about 10 mins walk.

It is designed in a very boutique small scale hotel way, but it doesnt behave like one where it counts.  There is a business centre, wireless internet, breakfasts downstairs are awesome (although pricey at about 24 pounds so get it included in room rate if able).  A lot of the rooms have great views of either some of the old surrounding theatre buildings or the gerkhin/london eye.  They have an affiliation with the gymbox next door which is a state of the art gym with classes included - or they  have a smaller gym within the hotel.  Very good room service menu with super fast service and well priced (compared to london prices generally).  Staff are always friendly and happy to assist wherever possible.  The showers are fantastic and beds comfortable.

The hotel is very well maintained (ie painting/carpet being steam cleaned) so unlike some other hotels isn't modern but trashed.  The rooms are well sized compared with typical london hotel room sizes.  The deluxe rooms are very comfortable for 2 travellers with loads of luggage and standard rooms are also quite good in size when compared to other mid city hotels.

I would recommend this hotel highly to any business travellers and definately to tourists as it is smack bang in the heart of everything that is going on in London.  Having tried a number of other hotels in the local area, prior to finding St Martins Lane, I would never stay anywhere else.",5,2008,12,19
125,Very enjoyable stay,"My friend and I were heading to London to see ""Wicked"" and my travel Agent pal, who owed me a favour, kindly booked us into St Martins Lane Hotel (Courtesy of his company) for the night.

On first entering the hotel you cannot help but notice the very unusual seats and chairs scattered around the reception area. Although most look like they are for visual effect rather than comfort they certainly fit the overall design of the hotel and provide a good talking point. 

The hotel staff were great from start to finish. Very pleasant check-in staff and porters. We were immediately given the key to our room and our bags followed close behind. 
We had a lovely twin room with pure white furnishings and coloured mood lights. The room was not exactly spacious but large enough for our short stay and the bathroom was a very good size. The room had a safe and mini-bar, flat screen tv and ipod speakers. We even had a choice of umbrellas hanging in the wardrobe. There was a hairdryer but, as with most hotels, this was pretty useless so I was glad I had brought my own.
The bathroom had lots of large bath towels and the ones we used early in the evening were replaced later that night while we were out.
The hotel does not have a bar that is open during the day. We wanted to order a cocktail at 4pm and had to sit in the restaurant to drink it.
When we came back from the theatre we headed into the ""Light Bar"" for a few drinks. This proved to be a very costly experience as 2 Gin and Tonics was approx ¬£28 !!! We didn't know London that well or we would have set off to another bar.
When we got back to our room someone had lit a scented candle in the bathroom - lovely touch, and turned down the beds. 
During the weekend the hotel will serve breakfast until noon which I thought was a great benefit to anyone wanting a relaxing morning.
We headed for breakfast at 10.30am as we wanted to squeeze in some shopping before going home. The breakfast was really good although I'm glad it was included in our stay as a cooked breakfast was approx ¬£27 per person.
Our breakfast waiter was superb. I didn't catch his name but what a lovely guy!
Check-out was effortless and the hotel staff took care of our bags while we wandered off to Covent Garden (5 mins walk). When we came back the hotel staff arranged for  a taxi to take us to the airport.
All-in-all we had a lovely time. I am very glad I was not paying the bill at the end of our stay as it was a very expensive hotel but as it was complimentary I was extremely happy!",4,2008,12,16
125,It's much better than we expected!,"After reading the reviews we were a little bit concerned but we loved it! Very nice location, very helpfull people, clean room, large room, overall: we would recommend this hotel for ""young"" couples! We also were in Miami in the Delano hotel and the Shore Club (Morgans group) but I hated those hotels, St Martins lane is 100 times better! It's no place to go if you have children I suppose. But if you like trendy hotels: just go!",4,2008,11,25
125,Good but ergonomically challenged,"I stayed at the St. Martin's for a personal holiday with my husband.  It was the second hotel we stayed in London, and one of many Morgans Hotels we have stayed in.  The location is superb - just close to so many amazing shops, restaurants, tourist destinations, tube stops - location is the best thing about the hotel.

Staff is polite and amenable but I wouldn't say their hospitality was superb.  

The biggest issue I had is with how the room was laid out.  It was impossible to manuever in the room, and everything got in the way of everything else.  For example, there is no plug in the bathroom for a hairdryer.  Fine, this is not necessarily unusual in other hotels i've been to in London, but the only other available plug was either in the entryway, which was close to nothing but the floor, or behind the tv, which was somewhat near the floor length mirror.  so, every day, i had to crawl on my hands and knees , manuever the tv out of the way to plug in a hair-dryer, sit on the floor and dry my hair.  I thought I gave that stuff up when i left college.

Another design issue is that, yes there is a work desk, but it requires being a size 2 to sit in it, because it's wedged so close to the window.  

There was no place to put luggage except under the bed, and my suitcase didn't fit, so it had to sit next to the bed.  There were 4 hangars, and 2 small shelves to fit two people's clothes.  The showerhead angled out and the shower door swung in, so, when you turned the shower on, you had to reach into the shower to close the door, and due to the angle of the showerhead, spray yourself with barely warm water as you shut the door.   There was also very, very, very limited private bathroom space, if you get my drift.  this is not a room for people who have never lived together or spent time traveling together.

that all said, the location made up for the poor design - i just expect more from morgan hotels.",3,2008,10,28
125,fun and lively,"Stayed in St martins lane for my 17th with a few girlfriends. The hotel is trendy and fun, it really feels like it never sleeps. We stayed at the weekend so the bar was full and funky music was being played in the lobby which I loved. Location is perfect, right in the heart of London. The only criticism I have is the ridulously small and old fashioned televisions they have the rooms. the black box doesn't quite go with the rest of the interior, it's lucky we didn't watch much tv. This hotel was great but I have to say I prefer there other hotel, the Sanderson. So if you're thinking of staying at St martins also check out the Sanderson!",4,2008,10,21
125,"Lovely Hotel, small rooms good value if can get a deal","I have stayed here a couple of times on business. The rooms are phenomenally small and some do have terrible 1980's portable TVs (somewhat contradictory to the rest of the room's appearance). However, the desk staff are alway wonderfully pleasant. Booking through my corporate travel agent the rates have been quite good (cheaper than the over-priced Hilton Trafalgar) and the location is excellent. Stay away from the mini bar - 3 pounds for M&Ms and don't expect to be able to make a cup of tea in your room as there are no facilities (my biggest annoyance). The rooms and very clean and beds are very comfortable",4,2008,09,27
125,Weak Service and a bit soulless,"I stayed here for a week together with some friends for a week around my 40th birthday.
My main observations are that despite me making the booking for all guests via Amex Centurian [Black card] I was treated worse than the others in that I was given an incredibly small [though well designed] room. I only found out about this at the end when I saw my Americans friend room which was Much Larger! and which I was paying for. 
Service was poor considering it is a high end place.",3,2008,09,17
125,A very special place,I have just returned from a night there and I don't know where to begin - everything was wonderful from the moment we checked in to the second we left everyone seemed to go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful towards us. It was my birthday and I got cocktails on the house which was very nice of them. The rooms aren't massive but very well designed and a great shower. I loved the mood lighting. Breakfast was gorgeous and worth staying there for that alone. Could have done with some comp water in the room.,5,2008,08,24
125,***** 5 Stars *****,"I have stayed at St Martins Lane a couple times, and I have to stayed at other London hotels; but the staff and service at St Martins Lane Hotel were second to none (particular mention is Daryl at the Front Desk). I was lucky enough to stay in a room with a one of the new TV‚Äôs (the previous ones were quite ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù.) It has a great location and is brilliant for the west end show we went to watch in the heart of Soho! Overall, 5 Stars, would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2008,08,14
125,Fun boutique hotel,"We had a great stay at St. Martin's Lane.  The hotel is very modern and minimal.  If you are familiar with Philadelphia restaurants, the hotel will remind you of Pod.  The rooms are white and have mood lighting like this restaurant.  

The location of the hotel is excellent.  It is near Leicester Square Tube station and Trafalgar Square (about 1 minute walk away from each) .  It is also close to a lot of London Theatres.

The front desk was effecient and the concierge was helpful.  Our room was available early in the morning which was helpful after we had an overnight flight.

The hotel has a lively weekend night scene.  There are two bars and a popular restaurant.  Despite the people, it was quiet in our room.

St. Martin's is also attached to a great gym called Gym Box.  Hotel customers are allowed to work out there for free.  The gym is modern and has new, state of the art machines.  There are also a variety of classes that one can take.

Overall, we had a very positive experience at St. Martin's Lane.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2008,06,23
125,Very Modern - Loved it,"I stayed at this hotel as a 2-night personal add-on to a business trip to London.   Unfortunately my flight was very delayed and I missed the first night.

The outside of the building is not that impressive, but inside feels/looks more like some MOMA than a hotel.  Check-in was quick, the concierge and desk staff were all very helpful answering my many questions.  There was free gym pass to the full service ""gym box"" for the stay, but I was too tired to go. 

The halls and elevators are barely lit with indirect, colored lighting.  The elevators have small TVs playing stylized loops (old movie extracts).  Rooms are not large, but all white, with modern accoutrements and indirect colored lighting if you want.  My room had no real view. Bathroom is a glass and limestone (I think!) combination with modern fixtures (Great water pressure!).  Flushing the toilet was interesting, you need to tap a metal fixture on the wall (not wave, press, touch, it only worked with a hard tap).  

I also ate dinner at the restaurant, which was packed at 11PM.  The portions were large and clearly tailored to non-single guests so they could share.  Still it was good.  The music was quite loud. 

While I really enjoyed this place for a visit, (and I think I would return) I am certain I would not want to work in the room on my laptop due to the small desk provided.",4,2008,06,22
125,Felt totally ripped off,"The website for this hotel made it look chic and amazing, and the rooms looked like something else.  We were very disappointed.  The rooms were tiny and absolutely average.  We stayed one night, had breakfast the next morning and a couple of drinks in the bar and the bill came to close to GBP500.00, which is way too much.  We normally stay at the Hilton Park Lane and we will definitely being going back there.",3,2008,06,21
125,Loved this place!,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday weekend and we both absolutely loved it.  It's a very 'cool' hotel inside, decor etc but the staff were great.  Reception was buzzing, the staff were very friendly, not snooty at all and very helpful about local places to eat.  The food in Asia de Cuba was stunning although shockingly expensive and the bar next door did great cocktails.  My only complaint would be with the size of the room we had.  We booked the cheapest/standard double room which consisted of a double bed and about a metre of space around it to walk, besides the bathroom and the entrance.  However, we loved it so much that we would definitely recommend it but if you like your space go for one of the larger more expensive rooms.",5,2008,06,09
125,Pretentious Staff who are not correctly trained,"The location and building are fine the staff are simply so self important and pretentious they are a joke.

Someone really needs to take them all down a peg or two. Its not as if the hotel is really top of the range, there are better ones in London.",1,2008,05,27
125,"Cool Hotel but is not worth the price, unless...","Ok, the hall is really cool, the cocktail bar and the restaurant are really stylish but the point is that my room was not worth the price. Everything was fine and the bathroom was huge but I wanted something more for that high price.

An example: the TV was really tiny and there wasn't a mirror in front of our desk (you know, make up things for women).

This hotel is all about style and design, but there is an unexplainable lack of things and comforts that are standard even in lower class hotels.",3,2008,05,23
125,Quite good with a great location,"Quite nice design hotel close to Trafalgar Square. 
Service, rooms, food and so on were great. 
The only problem was to actually find the hotel. For some reason there is no sign outside of the hotel so I had to call them to actually find the hotel.",4,2008,05,18
125,Colourful...,"This was the first time I stayed at the hotel, though I had dined at their Asia de Cuba restaurant about 8 years ago.

I remember at the time I was very impressed with the design of the lobby and the restaurant, showing the Philip Starck touch. Entering the hotel now I could see that very little had changed since. It is still very similar if not exactly the same as it was 8 years ago. 

Staff at the reception were EXTREMELY polite and very helpful all around. Going up to the room I must say that though artistic I found the lifts a bit on the claustrophobic side...

The room was bright as it basically has glass external walls and the views of the area were magnificent. I must say that it was a bit on the small side but as I was there for business I didn't really mind. I checked the whole colour changing light thing behind the bed and all the gimmicks in the room which momentarily amused me...I must also stress that the room was spotlessly clean, probably the most important factor for me.

On the down side I found the mini-bar VERY expensive (4-5 pounds for a chocolate bar) and the TV extremely small for a supposedly high tech hotel. 

Breakfast was satisfactory but I wasn't impressed. In addition seeing the Asia di Cuba restaurant in day light, somehow destroyed the image I had in my mind of the place...

All in all my general feeling was that the hotel, though it had no major problems, felt a bit neglected. It used to be an avant garde hotel and the stress now goes to ""used to be"". It does feel a bit dated and not so fresh anymore... Saying that I cannot stress enough the politeness and helpfulness of the staff.",4,2008,05,09
125,"Tool cool to serve, prices too hot","I had extremely high expections from our stay especially as we were treating my parents to a stay in the hotel as well as a trip to the theatre.

Initially service was excellent and attentive. The hotel is very minimalist and 'sophisticated' but most of the effort has gone into the public areas as the bedrooms were sterile and cramped - painting everything white isn't enough to be 'cool'. The interactive lighting enabling you to 'light your mood' is a joke. it feels like there is simply a different coloured light bulb behind the bedhead - hardly mood enhancing. But hey this is central London. Both of our rooms were so small you will be forgiven for not having cool Philippe Starck furniture.

Service in the bar / restaurant was appaulingly bad. We simply wanted to have coffees before venturing out but it took ages to get anyone's attention and then were charged something like ¬£5 a coffee. Rip off. And not even a smile.

Breakfast in the morning was the next rip off. It was included in our room rate but my mother did not want a full breakfast, but simply some scrambled eggs. Even though this was cheaper off the a la carte menu than a full breakfast, we were told we would have to pay - so about ¬£30 for eggs. The rest of the breakfast was over cooked, cold and just plainly not good enough.

The final straw was that apparently my father took the 'urban beats' CD from their room. This is my father who would prefer to listen to a brass band. This was charged to me after we left and i was notified by a letter of this. I did check with my dad just in case he picked this up by mistake, which I doubted he had as they had commented that they daren't touch anything in the room as everything was charged extra!

So this was clearly a mistake by the hotel so simply called them to sort it out. 5 calls later, even leaving messages for the manager, head of house keeping etc, no one could be bothered to call me back. Having spent over ¬£800 for one night and two rooms, coffee, breakfast etc, a call back would have been appreciated. But, hey, they already have my money so why do they care?

Next time I will stay in my tried and trusted hotels like the Covent Garden Hotel or One Aldwych. There they understand value and service.

SML - the abbreviations on their merchandise clearly stands for Small service, but should be replaced with XXL prices!

125,A London Favorite,"I used to stay at the St Martins Lane regularly when visiting London.  I recently did so again after a couple of year's absence.  It remains a London favorite for me.

The hotel has not changed much in the past couple of years.  It still has that funky Ian Schraeger vibe - techno coming from the lobby bar, colorful lighting and artistic video in the elevator, a staff dressed entirely in black.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  

Standard rooms are small, but comfortable.  Only downside is that the workspace is really inefficient (small desk that you need to move in order to sit), but wi-fi helps some.  

The bar is great, but overpriced.  The restaurant is Asia de Cuba, which is good but also expensive.  They serve breakfast, but I prefer to go to the Starbucks across the street.

The biggest change between my visits is the free membership to Gym Box, the gym right next door to the hotel.  It's a great gym - big, lots off cardio machines and plenty of workout space, and has the same vibe as the hotel.  Great way to start the day.

Location wise you can't beat St Martins Lane.  Close to the West End, easy access to the tube, good eating and pubs within a 5 minute walk.

I expect to be spending more time in London in the coming months, and will be back to St Martins Lane.",4,2008,05,01
125,Great location but pricey,"I arrived prior to check-in time and despite calling to request early check-in (which they said they may or may not be able to accommodate, understandably), my room wasn‚Äôt available.  I was able to upgrade for an additional fee, though.  My upgrade was from a superior to a garden room.  It was nice and spacious enough for me, though one odd thing about the setup was the way the desk was positioned in front of the window.  The chair was crammed between the window (floor-to-ceiling) and the desk, and you‚Äôd essentially have to climb into the windowsill to squeeze into the chair.  I also found it funny that while the room had unusual yet interesting things like an ‚Äúinteractive light installation,‚Äù whereby you could choose the lighting color of your room, some of the amenities that I‚Äôd consider standard were sub-par.  The TV was very dated and very tiny; it didn‚Äôt at all fit the modern look and feel of the room.  There was also merchandise for sale, and I‚Äôm not talking about regular mini-bar items.  There was everything from skin care and an ‚Äúintimacy kit,‚Äù to a t-shirt and hat, to an umbrella and adaptor.  Everything was outrageously priced and I found it to be really tacky.  

I became disappointed with my ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù after realizing that my room was right above the restaurant and night club.  There seemed to be some private event that went on well after 2 a.m. on the Monday night that I was there, and I had the pleasure of hearing it all.  If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet room, avoid 112.

Despite the above, there were things about my stay that I enjoyed, like the tremendously comfortable bed.  The bathroom was also nice ‚Äì clean and tastefully-designed.  The fitness center was basic but sufficient.  It may seem small but I never ran into another guest using it during the week of my stay.  If you‚Äôre looking for a more robust facility, the hotel offers passes to Gymbox right next door.  The staff was very attentive.  I had to call for an iron/ironing board, as well as a hair dryer (the one in my room was broken), and they were extremely fast.  Room service was, as well, though the food was just okay.  I‚Äôd recommend opting for it only if you‚Äôre truly too exhausted to leave your room, as it‚Äôs very expensive for what you get.

All in all, my stay was fine and the location couldn‚Äôt be beat.",3,2008,04,27
125,Let down by poor service,"With regards to the hotel itself, the decor is amazing. Very modern. (Rooms very cold though!).
However, the same cannot be said for the staff. On checking in, we were ignored by the reception staff even though they saw us waiting and seemed not to be busy with anything else. We were standing at the desk for quite a while before we were served. Reception staff were rather cold and unfriendly. The same applied to the restaurant. Whilst waiting to be seated we were ignored three times by the staff. Usually staff in other restaurants would say ""I'll be with you in a moment"" but we were not even acknowledged. They simply brushed past us as if we were in the way.  When we were seated, the waitress managed to take our order without smiling or any eye contact whatsoever. The service was also very slow.  My boyfriend and I both work in the customer service industry and know how customers should be treated, and this definitely wasn't it. 
Check out was much the same as check in; payment was asked for and that was it. Nobody asked how our stay was, or if we needed a taxi etc. 
I feel that the hotel is relying too much on the aesthetics of the place to attract custom, whilst overlooking the way that the staff treat their customers. Had it not have been for the way we were treated, we would have gone back.",2,2008,04,23
125,Memorable stay,"I stayed here for one night with my husband and two teenage children.  We were immediately struck by the decor, its very modern and artistic and we have never stayed anywhere that looked like this before.  As we went up to our room in the lift there were little tv's showing arty short films, and the lights change to purple when the lifts move.  We found this really entertaining, although I imagine you are supposed to be very serious about it all, it made us smile.

The room was very clean and modern, the beds were lovely, and the lighting was again very interesting and entertaining, as was the furniture.  The bathroom was very nice, but my daughter was really not into the idea of not having a door on the bathroom.  I wonder why they have done this?  Perhaps modern and arty people shun doors or something.  Anyway, we didnt really mind that much but I admit it sometimes can be a bit embarrassing for different reasons.  

We agree that it was odd that the tv was very old looking for the room, but no matter.

The restaurant was really different and we enjoyed our meal immensely.  The decor, music and staff all very good.

The breakfast in the morning was good.

The location of this hotel was great, we could easily wander over to Covent Garden and the shops nearby were brilliant - small, interesting, many independent.  Very interesting people walking about (bumped into Sienna Miller and Rhys Ifans(?) - great area for people watching.

We went to see Lord of the Rings in the evening - out of this world but question whether people would get lost if they didnt know the story before they went.

We would definitely come here again.",4,2008,04,02
125,"HIp, Hip, Hip","St. Martin's Lane is quite a place!

Everything about this hotel is highly stylized and epitomizes the ""boutique"" experience.  The design of everything is sleek , modern and with more than a few whimsical touches (including gnome statues and the fore-mentioned ""mood lighting"" control.

If you're staying at a place like this, then the following probably matters:  the crowd was stylish and boisterous making for quite a lobby, bar and restaurant (the fusion of Asia de Cuba so obvious in its name!)  scene.  

Like everything in London this place is VERY expensive and one would expect a few more little touches: a flat screen TV and an iPod doc for starters.

My room was always very clean and the bed was super comfortable.

The staff know they're ""trendsetters"" but they were always polite friendly and obliging.",4,2008,03,31
125,"Chic Hotel, Great Service and Location","Very trendy hotel in a perfect location.  Great service by all the staff.  One slight problem is I requested 2 beds and there was no room available, but still all in all a great place.  4 Stars well deserved.",5,2008,03,29
125,Of the moment (5 years ago),"We were let down every step of the way.

Bathroom taps squirted water round the bathroom.  
Air-con broken.  
Bed had seen better days - end up in middle of mattress.  
TV so dated.  
Breakfast absolutely dreadful and stone cold.  
Staff attitude was unapologetic - excuses instead of genuine concern.
This hotel was great 5 years ago.  It is now dated and the staff, although well trained, cannot deliver.",1,2008,03,26
125,great location hip hotel but expensive for what it is,"Husband booked this hotel with theatre package to see joseph, which is brilliant by the way if you haven't seen it go.

Paid ¬£350 for 1 night including theatre tickets

Hotel is very close to covent garden and the strand so easy to go sight seeing, a 10 minute cab ride from waterloo station which costs around ¬£7.00

The hotel is very modern all mdf and white walls with gold tooth design chairs, check staff very nice got upgraded to a garden room,

The garden room has a small patio garden with table and chairs if you want to sit outside.

very clean room average size nice large bathroom with luxury fittings, tv and dvd player and mini bar, hairdryer bathrobes, travel plug and even umbrellas.

There are no  tea and coffee facilites in the room so we ordered a pot of tea for 2 when we arrived ¬£17.00! daylight robbery for a cup of tea.

bit overpriced for what it is but very nice.",4,2008,03,18
125,Great Hotel Experience,"Just finished a 3 day stay at the St. Martins Lane Hotel.  Was a bit nervous given the mix of reviews, and a bit nervous on the first day when I arrived and found that my reservations had been mixed up.  However, after this minor glitch was resolved by the hotel (and I was upgraded), I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would/will stay at the hotel again.  

I am a frequent business and leisure traveler and found the hotel to have everything that I look for when I am traveling. The hotel and rooms themselves are well decorated (if you like minimalist decor, which I do), bright, and spacious for a London/European hotel in similar price range.  Bed/pillows were comfortable. Location was great for both a leisure (could walk everywhere) and business (just a few tube stops to eurostar and office) visit. I didn't try the in-hotel gym, but instead used the free access to Gymbox next door (this is what is shown on the hotel's website, not the in-house gym), which was just fantastic.  The staff were accomodating and friendy.  However, I would say that depending on one's perspective, the laid-backness of the front-desk staff (both dress and demeanor) might be off-putting (say to certain types of business or older travelers) or welcoming (say to singles, young couples, younger business traveler, etc.).  I had the impression that I was staying at a hip, high-end hostel designed for the young, international, frequent traveler that was being run by others of the same likeness.  On the costs: If you want internet and breakfast - book a room package with these services because it is considerably more expensive to pay for these individually.  Had breakfast delivered - always on time and food was fresh, plentiful, and tasty. There are no hidden charges on the bathroom products, as some have suggested, but there are ""extras"" spread throughout the rooms that cost extra (normal) - So, if you want to unwrap the baseball cap and wear it around town, it will cost you.  Suggest staying in at least a Deluxe Room (for both space and brightness).  If what attracts you to the St. Martin's is the brightness of the rooms/floor to ceiling windows, do not go with a Garden Room, or if you do, go with a Queen Garden (rather than King) which has both the garden and an outward facing window, although it is a bit smaller. Note that there are no outlets in the bathrooms (I was told this was required by UK law) or near the mirrors in the bedroom, so you will need to bring or ask for an extension cord.  

Would definitely return to the St. Martins.",4,2008,02,08
125,What a fabulous hotel!,"St Martins is a sleek ""Morgan Group"" hotel.  The interior is contemporary, but not missing any of the comforts that sometimes get sacrificed for fashion.  I loved the comfortable bed complete with  plump feather duvet.   The bathroom was limestone lined, luxurious but not sterile.  Fluffy bathrobes were part of the package.

I didn't dine at Asia De Cuba, but perhaps next time!
The staff were soooo friendly. The only negative was that  the wireless signal in my room (431) wasn't useable.",5,2008,02,07
125,"Very nice, but a little too hip and funky for me...","Great location and very comfortable, but be prepared for a stark, minimalist experience.

Staff were extremely courteous and helpful.  However, wifi is 15 pounds/day...",4,2008,02,06
125,St Martins Lane Hotel - stayed at better,"I have just come back from a stay at this Hotel.  A theatre package was booked by a friend for a group of 7.

It was centrally located for the Theatre District, only a 10 minute walk to the theatre.

The service I found to be very poor.  I arrived at around 1200hrs and told rooms not ready until 1400hrs (which we did know about).  I later came back to hotel at 1600hrs and my room had not even been prepared.  I was upgraded to a Garden Room at no extra cost (I'd already paid more money than the rest of the group as I was having a room on my own).

The room was very clean, not very big and had a weird layout.  The windows had blinds which you couldn't close.  Curtains very hard to close as the windows were floor to ceiling.  The TV was a small portable and only had a handful of channels.  The bed was comfortable.  2 bulbs in lights had blown and not replaced.  Complimentary toiletries.

The restaurant food was OK.....not much choice on the pre-dinner theatre package menu and the menus were set and given in boxes.  Chef would not accomadate any changes.....I did try and got what I hadn't ordered.  The service again was poor and we had to go back to the hotel later that evening to have our dessert as it came out too late and we had to leave for the theatre.

I had room service breakfast.  Not worth the money and I was overcharged for that too.  Nice little cafe around the corner for breakfast and was reasonably priced too.

Overall not a hotel I would have picked or will choose again.  I have had better stays at the nearby Strand Palace Hotel and Trafalagar Square Hotel.

*******The 1st floor at this hotel is a designated SMOKING FLOOR so some rooms stink of smoke.....but the staff will gladly come and 'spray' the smell away*********  I would recommend a higher floor.  Also the noise from the bar area can be heard on the 1st floor.",2,2008,02,04
125,You can't make it up,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel at ¬£450 per night. We arrived to be greeted by friendly reception staff who then checked us into a room, that judging by the shopping bags lying around and the un-made bed, was clearly occupied. On returning hastily to the reception I was asked, ‚Äúdid you actually see anyone in the room‚Äù no said I, ‚Äúits not occupied then‚Äù came the reply. To compensate for this potentially embarrassing faux pas they up graded us to a suite! A smoking suite! Which, when we found it (manager got a bit lost) was very nice, but it smelt like an old ashtray. We were given a bottle of champagne which was a nice gesture.

Dinner at Asia de Cuba that evening was very good and passed without incident. Breakfast the next morning was good, even though it took 30 minutes to arrive and bared no resemblance to what was ordered. We went out for the day and came back to relax in the room, late afternoon, before going to the theatre, to find it had not been serviced, so we had to leave the room again while this was done.
Breakfast was included in the rate which would usually set you back ¬£20.00. However, on the 2nd morning my partner ordered pancakes and we were charged an extra ¬£6 as they were not part of the full English our rate applied to. So ¬£26 for 2 pancakes it was. I had smoked salmon and scrambled eggs was also not part of the full English but this was allowed. I have no idea why and after enquiring still don‚Äôt. At ¬£450 a night service should be superb. These guys need to go to Asia or America to see how it‚Äôs done. Still, if you‚Äôve never had proper service and you liked Faulty Towers you‚Äôre going to love it.",2,2008,02,03
125,St Martins Lane - Outstanding,"I stayed at St. Martins Lane as a treat for the wife, and as we were going to a show 'next door' at the Coliseum. I have eaten at Asia de Cuba several times and always been blown away by the place. For the more 'trendy' the Light Bar is a fantastic place for early or late drinks. However I had never stayed at the hotel before, and having booked, I was a little concerned by so many negative reviews on this site. I even contacted the hotel after booking, just to express my concerns and also check if any refurbishments / alterations were taking place that could have disappointed people. I was astounded by the speed of a reply almost immediately from the Hotel Manager expressing her assurances we would have a pleasant stay, and that hotels are always frustrated when people pass negative comments without informing the hotel and giving them the chance to answer or rectify. 
Why did I worry? The experience from the moment I was politely greeted by the door staff and the delightful reception staff was truly outstanding. The hotel room was magnificent, large and light, and not at all noisy as other reviewers had commented. We requested a bath, which  we were fortunate to get, and what a bath it was. Superbly comfortable, and huge! Similarly in an enormous bathroom with all the usual ammenities, and touches one would expect in such a hotel. The towels, for those that are interested in such things, were luxurious, and can be ranked up there with the bed-linens, which my wife described as beautiful and 'expensive'.
In our room, we had lovely furnishings, massive bed, 
chaise-longues, georgeously trendy table, and an excellent mini bar / television cabinet, totally in keeping with the hotel's minimalistic style. I had already been informed that the room did not have a plasma screen TV, but that the rooms were all undergoing a major upgrade in this vein. The large old-style  widescreen was perfectly adequate, if not the latest model. How much time did we spend watching?......about 30 minutes, so not an issue. 
As one reviewer commented, the mini-bar is on the 'toppy' side, but has anyone ever experienced a cheap one? It is there for last minute convenience, and if you can't be bothered to nip to one of the all-night stores nearby, and you are spending this sort of amount on a room, is it really an issue? I think not.
Shabby carpets have also been mentioned.....what is wrong with people, the place was spotless and immaculate.
We dined early in Asia de Cuba, where the staff were brilliant and courteous, and had an outstanding meal. I appreciate good food, and am fortunate to have eaten in some of the impressive places....this ranks up there with the best of them.
Similarly we took breakfast in there, and had what could be described as one of the best breakfasts ever. Expensive to some people maybe, but think of where you are staying, and it really is a case of you get what you pay for..... ¬£10 for a greasy plate of egg and bacon at a cafe in Leicester Square, or a continental and massive full English, with unlimited tea / coffee juices and food, all for an extremely reasonable ¬£20 with truly efficient staff. I know which I would always opt for.
In conclusion, a fantastic experience and we can not wait to get back. 
Congratulations to Hilary Cross and her staff for maintaining such a tremendously high standard of service in an extremely busy hotel.",5,2008,01,23
125,A silver experience for us!,We were a bit nervous about staying here as there had been some negative reviews. Have to say that the staff on the desk were courteous and efficient and we were delighted with the garden room. Shame it was raining but still lovely to have a bit of outdoors in the centre of london. Room was very white and minimal but still a great experience. Room service breakfast was on time and the staff member discreet and efficient. A great celebration of our silver wedding anniversary!,4,2008,01,22
125,Triumph of style over substance,"This hotel is pretty awesome from the minute you walk in you know you are in something uber trendy, all sharp angles and colours and slick styling. However on the evidence of my stay I can only recommend this place if you are desperate to place fashion before anything else. If you have more money than sense and are too cool for school this is the place for you. 

To me it represents very poor value for money. I have also stayed at the Sanderson which you may know is  part of the same group, The Sanderson is way way cooler, their rooms are amazing. Here the rooms are boxes. literally 12 feet across in the bedroom. the bathroom is not too bad a size though. The room is really no better than a box and everything is for sale at a silly price. I'm sure they must have bigger rooms as well, at least you would certainly hope so depends on how much you are prepared to pay I guess

We didnt even contemplate the restaurant, check out the Asia de Cuba restaurant on the website and check out the prices, its unreal.

The Bar is called the light bar I think, clearly a play on words and should be called the dark bar. you have to hold your drinks menu up to the candles to see it. its just too too dark. The staff are gorgeous and very good but the prices are a joke. (We spent ¬£60 plus in the bar having just 3 drinks each)  Bank on a minimum of ¬£10 each for anything other than a beer (¬£5.00) or a  glass of wine (which is ¬£7 and up) cocktails start at ¬£13. The music is as loud as a night club, you cant hear anything over it. 

You might like to take a torch for the lifts as well, they are as dark as night inside and the buttons arent lit

the staff are all very good looking and extremely nice and welcoming but for some reason the front desk women wear a matronly grey outfit, which I guess must be trendy but it just looks frumpy to me.

As for the location its not quite ideal as although quite central and very near covent garden, its quite a reasonable walk to Soho, which is the best bit of central London for a night out drinks and dinner. Covent garden is hopeless unless you are going to a show.  There are few cool bars, just a load of pubs full of tourists and pre and post theatre goers. We had to walk for ages to find a bar we liked the look of and wasnt heaving. We eventually settled on Christophers on Bow St

Covent Garden is a nightmare unless you like falling over the usual throng of french and italian school kids. (did you know the term for a large group of continental school children is a cacophony), japanese and american tourists moving round at snails pace keeping the pickpockets in beer money. 

My advice to you is that if you are contemplating a stay in London and want to stay in a morgans group hotel because you are the trendy type, stay at the Sanderson, the location is better, the hotel is cooler and although hideously expensive (coffee and croissant for two is about ¬£27.00) its a better experience.  I dont work for th Sanderson by the way. I just think St Martins Lane is very poor value and there are literally dozens of much better hotels in London which wont charge you as much.  BUt as I said before if you have wads of cash and value style over substance, this is a place for you. 

Our night out in London for two including dinner, (nowhere flash) drinks, taxis and train fare from 50 miles away was nearly ¬£600. 

Be warned a night out in London is ruinous",2,2008,01,20
125,Sticker shock,"I stayed at St. Martin's Lane during a business trip and was worried as I'd read the reviews here before I left. I figured that since the company was paying, I wouldn't feel like I was being taken to the cleaners.

No so.

St. Martin's Lane is the perfect example of a hotel that could be outstanding but which misses through several simple faults.

All the staff were more than helpful, especially the doormen. Check-in was speedy. They give you your room key in this ridiculous little zip-lock baggie, along with guest services cards (2) that you need to access the restaurant or bar, which are normally for members only. If you stay here you'll see why this little baggie is so annoying. A normal key ring, or a key ring attached to the baggie in some way would be preferable to fishing out the stupid little key each time.

My room was a fine size with a double bed, a small desk and a spacious bathroom with a great shower head and a toilet that flushed properly (not standard in London). The bed was extremely comfortable. For this, I cannot fault St. Martin's Lane.

What you will find off-putting is that most of the things in the room are for sale, charged to your credit card if you use them. It's not only the mini-bar but there are also special candles, bath products, a laundry bag, etc.--all extortionately over-priced. It was to the point where one would be afraid to dirty the bathrobe (hung in the closet next to the other chargeable goods) lest you find its laundering on your next Visa statement.

Another issue I had is with the pay-for wireless. I've stayed at dozens of hotels across Europe and the US and almost all of them had free internet access. St. Martin's Lane will make you pay 15 pounds per day for the privilege of using their WiFi signal. This is ridiculous. At over $500 a night, WiFi should be free. I'm sorry Mr. Schrager.

There are many luxuries that I find included in cheaper boutique hotels which are overlooked at St. Martin's Lane. At Hotel 373 in New York I was pleased to find a flat screen tv, an iPod dock and fabulous Aveda products. At St. Martin's Lane you'll find none of that. One reviewer here complained about how much he'd been charged for a box of Pringles from the mini-bar. Can you imagine if the mini-bar were stocked with Pringles, soda and other cheap snacks for free (as at some smarter boutique hotels) how people would rave about the service here? 

A little more thought into these thoughtless little add-ons and some meaningful upgrades to media access in the rooms would take St. Martin's Lane to a new level.",4,2008,01,18
125,"Fun hotel, great location, but not for everyone","Lets be clear art the outset. St. Martin‚Äôs Lane is a high concept, modern hotel with urban flair that will not appeal to everyone. If you don‚Äôt like modern design, small rooms, or high-concept urban experiences then you will probably not like St. Martin‚Äôs Lane. Or at least, you won‚Äôt be very forgiving of its particulars. There are plenty of equally expensive major label hotels in London for people who enjoy that kind of experience. If you‚Äôre a budget traveller then this place should not be on your list. But if you‚Äôre looking for something hip, off-beat, and a little unusual then St. Martin‚Äôs Lane is worth a visit.

I have stayed here twice and found the staff to be professional, the rooms comfortable, and had all of my needs well served. There is also a decent gym. Not large but it does have tread mills, elliptical, circuit machines and weights. Its clean and well kept with water and towels for quests.

Of course, another appeal of this property is the location. From St. Martin‚Äôs central London location you are in walking distance to Piccadilly Circus, Parliament, The London Eye, and Victoria Embankment on The Thames. If you don‚Äôt mind longer walks then Hyde Park and the West End are within reach. You are also close to a terrific and equally designer Indian restaurant called Mint Leaf just off Trafalgar Square on Suffolk street. I know there is an abundance of great Indian cuisine in London but Mint Leaf is special and worth the trip.",4,2008,01,13
125,OK (if you like being ripped off),"Stayed at SML for over a week last month and besides the location and grand lobby, nothing too impressive about the hotel and the rooms.

Rooms are small and lack some basic things you'd expect - tiny, standard TV house in a cabinet, no proper wardrobe, etc

The most annoying thing is that the hotel is quite clearly out to take as much from the 'guests' as it can.  From the extortionate prices for basic items in the rooms to breakfast and in room snacks - all of which is pretty uninspiring.  A breakfast with some coffee and fruit and a plate of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon came in at a whopping USD 98.

The cheery on the cake was a letter I received a month after staying noting that a small box of Pringles had been consumed and not noted by the housekeeping.  The letter was sent to me on the other side of the World and claimed, for my convenience, that USD 10 would be taken from my credit card to settle the bill.

My stay at the hotel came to around USD 4,000 and they chased me for a small box of Pringles!  Priceless!

That's probably the most I've evr paid for a packet and that USD 10 is probably the last that St Martins will ever get from me!",2,2008,01,05
125,"Trendy hotel, albeit a bit snobby","I checked into the St Martins Lane hotel from 5-9th December. Having just gotten off a long haul flight from New York, I was eager to have a nap before heading to work in the afternoon. I kindly requested the first available room and was able to check-in within 2 hours of arrival (not too bad considering they were at full occupancy). However, one of the phones and the in-room safe were broken. Given that I was extremely tired, I let this slide and did not report it straight away.

The atmosphere there is very young, hip and trendy. Being in my mid-twenties this is exactly what I was looking for and was pleased with the result. However, I very much had a problem with the attitude of the staff (especially in the Light Bar). Every night I went for a pre-dinner drink with my friend and waited for at least 20 minutes before receiving my drink. Sometimes we would wait for almost 20 minutes before a waitress even approached to take our order. I'm from New York and used to this sort of attitude, but at 14pounds ($28) per drink, I would expect more.

The included breakfast is very sparse and doesn't include anything hot. Another drawback is that everything in the room is for sale (even the cactus is sold separately from its holding pot!). I found this to be quite tacky.

Overall, I would stay here again for the atmosphere, location and swanky factor. However, I would not patronize the Light Bar.",2,2008,01,02
125,"Prefessional staff, comfy bed and totally awesome decor","Stayed at St. Martins with my two college aged sons. What a fantastic hotel. It was our favorite on our trip. We hardly wanted to leave the comfy beds. The staff was so nice and helpful. We loved every minute.

After a brief jaunt to Paris, we returned to London and stayed at the City Grange where the management was horrific and items were stolen from our room. We deeply regretted not staing at St. Martins Lane in the center of everything. STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!",5,2007,12,30
125,Not worth the money. Not a 5*,"Spent Saturday night at St Martins Lane and was utterly disappointed. Having seen the photos on the website and having also stayed at the Sanderson (which was much better) was expecting a lot more. 

The staff were really friendly on check in which was one positive but the corridors on the 6th floor looked shabby and just like you'd expect to see in a budget hotel. Our room was absolutely tiny. One double bed (not even a king) and I'd also booked a twin which was frustrating. One tiny closet and you had to walk right round the bed to the bathroom. Also no bedside tables of any sort to put a drink on. The TV was hidden in a cabinet which also housed the mini bar and was absolutely tiny too! ¬£3.75 for a can of Fanta which you'd expect but none the less is a complete rip off. The room just wasnt what I'd expect in a 5* hotel. No sense of luxury about it at all. Walls were paper thin also and we had some guys banging on the door at 5am which didnt help having got the wrong room!!

Breakfast was supposed to be included in our room rate but for anything hot it was an extra ¬£22! When our eggs benedict arrived they were pretty cold. 

Having paid ¬£225 for the room and with the standard rate at over ¬£350 I just expected more! The only positive is that it's in a good location and the shower is v powerful. If you're looking for 5* luxury don't stay here!!!!",2,2007,11,05
125,"Very  nice, but!","Now location wise this is great. Right in the middle of the theatre area.
The hotel is very modern. Great room on forth floor which was light and roomy. What ever floor you get go by elevator!! The walls have TV screens that show weird 'movies' that keep you entertained.
As with all 5* London hotels, very expensive. A glass of beer in the bar at ¬£8.00 and wine at ¬£10.00 (wow). Breakfast at ¬£17.50 for some toast and a cup of tea. Or ¬£20.00 if you want an egg with that! 
WHY dont hotels have tea making facilities in the rooms anymore?? If you want acup of tea you need to ring down for it at ¬£5.00 a cup!!!!
Staff were freindly but not exactly helpfull and seem to engage with the  'beautiful people' in the hotel.

So if you want style at a price? You have found it here.",4,2007,10,25
125,Great Location,"staid there for 2 nights. Got anspecial deal on a studio!
 Spacious room. Incredible view.
Very good location. 
Staff was nice but not more.
would definitely recommend the hotel bar ""light bar""",4,2007,10,08
125,Excellent stay,"The excellent service started from the moment I walked through the doors. The person at the front desk first complimented me on the history I had staying at Morgans Group Hotels (it's true). Then, she was apologetic that my original room was not available (I checked in very late after flight delays) and, without prompting, offered to upgrade me to a ""Superior"" room - room 203 to be exact. I was nervous that being on the 2nd floor and overlooking the street would be noisy, but instead it was peaceful and relaxing.

I don't know how much more a superior room costs over the deluxe, but it seemed like I was getting something quite nice. The room was LARGE, and not just for boutique hotel standards. The bathroom - with an oversized tub, shelves, walk in closet, separate shower and full vanity sink - was the size of some bedrooms! And the bedroom was generous with a queen bed, desk and TV/mini bar. The bed had the standard St. Martin's Lane color dial lighting over it, which I'm glad they haven't changed over the years.

I ordered room service which was prompt and tasty, but ended up  being very expensive for what I got. 

The checkout was quick and they even printed out google maps for me to get to my work location.

St. Martin's lane was one of the first design hotels and still sets the standard for what they should be.",5,2007,10,03
125,Very cool,"A really trandy design hotel in bootique style. Yes ... a little to expensive but you will surely enjoy your stay. The hall and room are in avantgarde sophisticated style. The location is perfect, in the heart of west end at walking distance from major theaters and clubs.",5,2007,09,23
125,Not worth the money,"This is an expensive, 5 Star hotel in the heart of London.

The foyer and bar on the ground floor give the impression of a quality hotel but the quality ends there. 

Staff are dressed in grey jerseys and trousers which makes them look like nightclub door staff. Not helped by the fact that they tend to congregate outside the hotel entrance.

On checking out I asked the concierge if I could have a taxi and was advised that it was difficult to get a taxi in the area, perhaps if I walked up the street I would have a better chance! Not exactly 5 star service.

The bedrooms are tiny with furniture whch looks, and feels as if it had been bought at MFI. It's white and cheap-looking. The bathroom door has a srong magnet which guarantees that it slams close with a resounding crash.

If you can squeeze yourself and luggage into the bedrooms you'll be defeated by the odd cabintet housing the TV which blocks a complete corner of the room - like a single wardrobe.

The hotel website omits pictures of the bedrooms, I can see why. 

All in all, a nice hotel if you're passing and fancy a drink in a trendy bar. If you want accommodation, find somewhere else, ther are plenty of cheaper, and better, alternatives.
",2,2007,09,04
125,A posh hotel with a posh price,"The price is ghastly, but it is a chick designer hotel. 
I have been lucky enough to stay here over 5 times, mostly staying in suites and in the upper penthouse room with the private lift.

Gorgeous design by Patrick Stark, lots of eggs lying on the floor and posh chairs which seemed like they were designed for a king to sit on. There is a cool purple pool table downstairs, and the lift, oh my god I have never seen anything like that before, its brilliant.

I haven't eating in the restaurant and normally order room service, very ridiculous prices it was like ¬£18 for a burger and chips! But the meat is amazing. Order the hot cookies they are amazing with ice cream.

The location is superb, 2 seconds from Oxford street.
The outside decor lets this place down as you can see that it was built about 15 years ago, in need of some TLC. No pool either and no nice view (unless you get the balcony suite and even then the view isn't amazing)

Worth the visit if you have the dosh.
",4,2007,08,21
125,Great Location and Fun Design,"I recently stayed here for 4 nights on business. 

First impressions were great, exactly what I expected having seen the website and having stayed at the Group‚Äôs other hotels, Delano and Royalton. 

My room was a deluxe room with full bathroom on 5th floor. Great room and nice view of Nelson‚Äôs Column. . 

The design of the room was fantastic. The bed was very comfortable and loads of wardrobe space. 

The TV is stupidly small ‚Äì this is the only negative about the room ‚Äì when you are paying ¬£300+ per night one at least expects to be able to see the TV properly. 

My bathroom was fabulous ‚Äì big oval shaped standalone bath and full walk in shower. The bath products are also very nice ‚Äì same as the Group‚Äôs other hotels. 

The hotel Gym is a bit grotty ‚Äì the floor was dirty, machines tired and old but they do have use of the excellent facilities at Gymbox next door. I suspect most guests use Gymbox.

The Light Bar is fantastic. We had some very expensive but exquisitely made cocktails before dinner. The door is guarded impressively by the staff ‚Äìif you are not guest of the hotel or on the list, expect to be turned away. 

The hotel‚Äôs location is perfect for Covent Garden, Theatreland and museums. 

The staff were very helpful indeed and made me feel very welcome. 

Crucial question ‚Äì was it worth the money? Yes ‚Äì for the great design and location. My top tip is do not have anything from the mini bar. It is ludicrous to pay those prices when you are surrounded by bars and convenience stores. (¬£5 for a snack size pack of Pringles and ¬£3 for a packet of Wrigley‚Äôs chewing gum is a joke)

Overall, stay at this hotel if you like whacky design and minimalism. If you like old world charm ‚Äì go to The Savoy instead.
",4,2007,08,20
125,Great but expensive,"Dont book with Expedia, we booked a twin and got a double. Very nice boutique hotel so expected the price. Nice hotel helpful staff but a bit too expensive.
",4,2007,08,17
125,Excellent hotel !!!,"Excellent location, the rooms are very clean and the service is excellent !
I love this hotel and the location allows to move easily in London and to be close to the attractive places.

",5,2007,08,12
125,Best Location in London if you are a theatre buff,"Just got back from a stay at this hotel and I have to say I loved it. I usually try to stay at Claridges or The Dorchester but since this was a last minute trip I decided to Priceline a hotel. We really were lucky getting this little gem of a hotel. It is very trendy, and not really a five star, that being said, the staff was fabulous and the rooms were great. Absolutely loved the location and would stay there again for that alone.
",5,2007,08,04
125,Not worth $592 a night,"Only fools pay rack rates for London hotels. So you can add me to this category of foolish people. Although I tried to get this hotel on Priceline, there were no offers available on the day I booked it. So, inclusive of taxes, I ended up paying $592 for a single night in a no frills room. Which is a little bit pricy for a four star hotel.

The hotel is chic. It is, of course,  located on St Martin's Lane, beside many of the major theatres. The bar is dark, yet sub-lit with different colours to give it an air of excitement. There was a bouncer type figure outside the bar the night I was there, and this does not send out the most welcoming of signals to hotel guests wishing to patronise the place. The Asia de Cuba restaurant, on the other hand, is very swish, great menu and the breakast they served me on Tuesday, July 17th was really high quality. 

The bedroom was small, yet beautifully designed, with a picture window opening out onto the London skyline. My bed was exceptionally comfortable and conducive to deep sleep. One thing I found strange was that the cabinet housed a tiny Sony Trinitron television which really did not fit within the context of  the ultra modern decor of the bedroom. When you pay  $592 a night, you expect to have a flatscreen televisions of more sizeable dimensions in your room. So come on St Martin's hotel, modernise the televisions you are making available to your patrons. 

Also, a strange day glo light barely illuminated the writing desk, whereas the main light over the desk was kaput. Okay, I know I could have phoned room service. But, when you discover a problem at 11 p.m., you're reticent about having it sorted out. And,  for $592, you kind of expect them to have checked everything is in working order before they assign you the room.

The bathroom is artfully concealed behind the main bedroom and it meets the high design standards of the bedroom. The sunk nature of the shower means you can use it without fear of drenching the rest of the room. And the selection of toiletries was just right.

Other benefit of the hotel was that - given its proximity to all the major theatres - I could stroll, at ten minutes before curtain rise, up to the production of Somerset Maugham's The Letter, an exciting production which recreates the aura of a plantation near Singapore with effortless ease. Yes the hotel is pricy. But it certainly meets the three requirements of location, location, location.

Next time I'm in London, I think I'll visit over the weekend, enabling me to spend at least two nights in a good five star for the exact same price I have just paid for a single night in four star.
",3,2007,07,19
125,Fantastic hotel,"Normally when I go to London, I like to book The Metropolitan.  However, as this was a last minute booking, and my first choice was booked, I decided to give somewhere else a try.

I chose St Martins Lane Hotel as it seemed to be a good mixture of comfort, style, great food, and excellent location. I wasn't disapointed.

The rooms were very comfortable, stylish, and functional, with nice bathrooms (and a great shower!).  The staff were VERY polite, and, more importantly, were very friendly. This was surprising as sometimes with hotels like this you hear of people moaning that the staff look down their noses at you - I didn't find this at all, they were great.

Asia de Cuba is as good as people say it is, and definitely one of the best meals I've had in London - not just for taste, but for the environment, the staff, the service and the menu choice ...
 
The Light Bar is not at all pretentious, with a great variety of drinks, and a right old mixture of clientele.

The location was very good too.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, for business and pleasure.",5,2007,07,17
125,Hip Hotel in Perfect Location,"Booked via priceline - asked for 5-star, but while I wouldn't say the SML is at that lofty level, it was still great value for our (very discounted) money. As other reviews will confirm, it is a boutique-style hotel in a modern/minimal-chic style. If you are coming to London and want genteel elegance, then this might not be your nice hot cuppa. But for myself and my teenage daughter, it was ideal. The location couldn't have been more perfect, the staff were friendly and professional and our room was beautiful (though we were fortunate to be upgraded on check-in, so 'standard' rooms might not be as large as ours was). Two gripes: no tea- or coffee-making facilities in the room, and one of our neighbours' doors was very squeeky and I kept waking us up in the night. However, these are minor complaints and overall I'd give the SMH a mighty thumbs up and would definitely return.
",5,2007,07,15
125,"Comfortable, clean and quiet","My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 night whilst in London to watch Mary Poppins. 
I booked the hotel via Priceline and only paid ¬£137 including tax. 
Check in was prompt and the staff were friendly and polite.
We had a standard room which although not big included everything necessary for our stay. 
The room was clean and well maintained, the shower room (no bath) was modern and a good size.
We did not eat in the restaurant as we ate out before the show and we left early so did not have time to sample breakfast. 
On our return after the show we found that housekeeping had been in and turned down the bed, fluffed the pillows etc which was a pleasant surprise. 
The room was quiet and air conditioned which was a bonus as it was quite warm that evening, no complaints about the bed - it was very comfortable. 
Check out was easy as we had prepaid via Priceline and again could not fault the staff - they even remembered which show we were seeing and asked how it was! 

The only slightly odd thing about this hotel (as someone else mentioned) is that all items in the room are available to buy - not sure who would want to buy some of the items (bedroom bin etc) but each to there own! 

Overall a good stay - not sure I would pay the full price though.
",4,2007,07,14
125,Comfortable as well as hip,"Despite the super hip vibe (glass building, all white lobby & rooms, bouncers at night), the SML is a very comfortable hotel with lovely service.

The rooms are good sized (i had room 302) with floor to ceiling windows. only thing that is a bit daunting is the need to pull the curtains and keep pulling as the interior is very exposed at night. good sized bath w/shower only. free wifi.

i tried room service and they deliver from their downstairs restaurant ""Asia de Cuba"" - food was good and came in 1/2 the time they predicted (25 min was only 15 tops).

the locaion is great  - just up the street from Charing Cross station, on the edge of Covent Garden and about 50 yards from Trafalgar Square for any sightseeing. 

only drawback was waiting in line (and waiting) to check out. it took about 15 minutes which was sort of silly since they could have put the bill under the door. the concierge also sat off doing a whole lot of nothing while everyone was waiting (and actually refusing to help one guy who just wanted change) - odd.
",5,2007,06,27
125,Couldn't even sleep,"So expensive for a room we couldn't even sleep in! It was so loud from the bar, we couldn't even talk to one another.  This was a terrible experience, and the hotel did not do anything when we voiced our concerns.

125,Excellent location,"This hotel has absolutely fantastic location in Covent Garden, minutes from Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square, Picaddilly...
It is a very modern hotel with popular restoran and nice bar, and funky lobby. Everything is bright and airy.
I had a deluxe room with fantastic view to the Colosseum theatre, but there was no bathtube in bathroom, which was a huge dissapointment. They also dont have  shower cap in the bathroom and if you want to have a sewing kit, they will charge you, which is really strange in a 5 star property. 
If you like modern design places and you want to live right in city center, then it is definately a good choice.

125,Cool stylish design hotel,"Cool design hotel, perfect place to stay if you enjoy that sort of modern, funky decor, unusual lobby. Great location short walk to Covent Garden & Leicester Square, tube stop just around the corner. Would recomend for young people wanting to party, shop, see London, not really for business travellers.
The rooms are small but well designed with ultra modern bathrooms, the lighting in the room looks great for creating an atmosphere, cam dim or change colour of lights but is usless if you need to read anything, it was too dark for me.
Had breakfast at Asia de Cube restaurant, was one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had wide choice of the normal cereales & breads but also delicious fresh fruit and juices, great omlettes.

125,Very nice but showing its age,"Stayed one night mid-week in a superior room.

A1 location 2 mins from Charing Cross station, Piccadilly, Covent Garden.

Building is a faceless modern block. Interior is 'minimal chic' which
is fine but looking a bit dated now, scruffy in places. Better than standard chintz on offer in most West End places though.

My wife checked us in so I don't know what that was like, no problems
were reported though. Room was nice, not too small, some nice design touches in the lighting, bathroom and furniture. I disliked the dayglo-yellow panel detailing, looked like someone had been let loose
with a highlighter pen. Bathroom and shower were really nice, bed was comfy, no noise problems.

Didn't try the bar or the restaurant as we were in town for the theatre. In all, very pleasant.",4,2007,05,10
125,Very funky,"We booked through lastminute.com and were very pleased with the room we had. It even had a treadmill in it  - I did upgrade to a deluxe one. The staff were wonderful, very helpful. The bar was really cool and the DJ was excellent. we then went to the restaurant to eat at about 11pm and the food was amazing. Breakfast is ¬£22.00 per head but there are lots of places to eat nearby. Its not cheap but definetly an experience.
I would go back again.
",4,2007,04,27
125,First time in boutique hotel,"Booked a de luxe room only through lastminute.com for ¬£219. Alighting from our taxi we were greeted by the doorman and checked in by bright American staff. The one thing I don't like though is muzak which pervades the whole ground floor. No doubt this was carefully chosen/composed to match the ""funky"" ambience. The lift was an experience with small screens on the walls showing strange graphics and sounds from doodles to Cary Grant. Our room (411) appeared to be the same as shown on candid photos as we overlooked the side of the Coliseum theatre. The box containing the TV, etc. was IKEAish but seemed sturdy enough. Excellent bathroom with umpteen little lights. TV had the Bloomberg channel which is  a plus as far as I'm concerned.

The hotel is superbly situated - handy for Covent Garden, theatreland and only 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square. Returning to the hotel after seeing a show we had a nightcap in a cool bar with rather impressive doorman to welcome you - do they get trouble I wonder? Service quick and friendly but smoky atmosphere - of course that will all change in July.

The maid had been in our room and turned the lights on. A novelty was being able to change the colour of the lighting above the bed from white through yellow, green and lilac. The bed was comfortable with wonderfully soft pillows

Next morning we had a superb breakfast - full English for ¬£22 which was slightly cheaper than the Hyatt Churchill in Marylebone and every bit as good. Fresh fruit comprised strawberries mangoes, blueberries, blackberries,etc. The poached eggs I had with bacon, sausage,etc. were perfectly cooked. Our waiter was a charming Angolan.

Overall a good experience but at a price. Would stay again for a single night but no longer because of the infernal music

125,Poor value for rmoney,"Everything at this hotel comes at a high price and it offers poor value for money.  I was on a company paid event and was glad it was not my own money!
I'll admit that it is modern and stylish and from my experience service is very good and attentive.
But entry level rooms at ¬£250+ are very small and only adequately furnished and equipped.
Everything has a price tag - the things you expect to pay for in the mini-bar (¬£5 for the smallest pack of Pringles!) plus there is a price list for things you may want to take from your room (¬£50 for the hair dryer!).  There is an ¬£11 'delivery charge' if you want to borrow a DVD to watch. We were even presented with a bill for breakfast which was included in the room rate - I still don't know if that was a mistake or they were just trying to reiterate that breakfast for 2 was a whopping ¬£34.50.
Don't get me wrong, we had a great stay but I felt that if I stood still for too long I'd have a price label stuck to me!

125,Ultra Modern + Great Fun,"Didn't know what to expect after reading some of the reviews. 
Had wanted to visit this hotel or it's sister hotel (Sanderson) for some time, then found the perfect excuse, mates birthday! 
Had trouble booking on line, so phone direct and they honoured the same rate. Check in was a breeze (Need a porter though?) Room was spectacular (Paid the extra for a deluxe, well worth it).
Everything was a surprise from traditional hotels we normally stay in (Thistle, Hilton). Everything was spotlessly clean and well presented, bathroom fantastic with a great shower.
Went out for the evening and returned to find the bar was a cool mini-club, great atmosphere and great service. Stayed till about 2am (closes at 3). Still made breakfast the next morning and glad we did, the breakfast is to die for, really!
Overall, I would say it is expensive, but you do get what you pay for. Staff are good, though sometimes slow. Location is excellent, a fairly quiet street, but very close to the action.

125,Funky and chic,"Stayed here with the girls on my hen weekend.  Great interiors and cool late night bar.

Got upgraded at check-in to rooms with little gardens.  Very chic.
Don't know that  the difference in price is worth it though!  Lovely bathrooms with robes and long sinks.

Typical London city hotel.  All staff quite distant, sad looking door-man and huge queue for check-out on Sunday!

Central location is a hit but we did not do much walking.

Would certainly return if I got a good deal.

125,"great fun, nice touches!","Great designer/boutique hotel. Good service, only one complaint, rooms are too small. Did like the key they give you  for your room. The light bar was pretty fab too.
",5,2007,01,31
125,Odd Approach to Service for the Price!,"Booked in with a small, sophisticated hen night celebration for one night.  The room was obviously very clean & stylishly laid out but was very expensive for what was provided.  The little price list for sewing kits & first aid kits in the wardrobe did seem a little excessive, considering there's at least one chemist on The Strand.  The Reception staff were exceptionally helpful & check-in was processed without fuss.  However, the room was absolutely freezing when I arrived & it took me a good hour of trying to find the thermostat when I couldn't bear it any more & had to phone reception.  Possibly some more guest information might be a good idea ... frankly, it took a while to work out how to flush the toilet!  The worst aspect of the whole stay was the service provided by the Light Bar - the six of us trotted downstairs for cocktail hour with our 1"" round flashing 'Hen Night' buttons pinned to our dresses - hardly fake breasts & tiaras with veils!  We were told, in no uncertain terms, that we have to remove the buttons after we'd been in the place for an hour & had ordered two rounds of drinks which amounted to about ¬£200.  I'd have thought that we could have danced on the tables for that sort of spend between the six of us.  Apparently not.  The whole place is far too sure of its own 'specialness' for its own good - far too shiny by half!
",2,2007,01,20
125,Not bad ... but,"Stayed one night, having spent an evening out in London.  The staff are over attentive, I don't mind but can get grating.  Check in was fine, rooms are small(ish) but not that bad - it is London

The bathrooms are really nice, power shower - modern and clean. I would like a radio or something in the bathroom though.  I wish more hotels would do this.

The rooms feel really secure, you can close an internal door and so you are safe form staff walking in.  Loved the mood light effects.  The plastic chair in the room is a pain and ended up sitting in bed with my laptop.  The wifi was free, however you had to call the front desk to get username and password, do they not know they can do this automatically like other hotels.

I wanted to sleep in and woke up at 12pm - I had no phone calls or knocks on the door with people trying to get in! this is a pet hate of mine in hotels.  I was either very lucky or this hotel has worked out how annoying this can be.

The hotel bar is OK - but not amazing.  Considering that this is a partner hotel of the Hudsen in NYC its lacking.  Drink prices require a second mortgage and you cannot charge it to your room which is very annoying.

The major moan about this hotel was the TV in the room! It was broken and small, however when we came back at 2am in the morning someone had replaced with a new one (same small TV!) 

what are they thinking about.  Its like the smallest TV ever.  One of the reasons you stay in a nice hotel is to chill watching sports while the girlfriend spends a few hours in the bathroom!  They really need to rip out the whole TV bit and start again.  A nice 42inch plasma should be installed in a place like this.
",4,2007,01,19
125,Fun Experience,"This place is definately worth it if you get a great rate.  We were checked in early (by a really obnovious guy - the only negative to our experience) and upgraded to a deluxe - which was a perfect size - wouldn't really want it any smaller.  The rooms are all white which i love - expect at night you can change the lighting to blue, pink, orange etc above the bed.  The table also lit up which was one of my favorite touches.  Also nice were the floor to ceiling windows.  This hotel has been around since 1999 but everything looked almost brand new and perfectly clean- there must have been recent refurbishments.  The king bed was very comfortable but you won't like the rooms if you're looking for big cushy chairs and lots of seating.  The bathrooms were also amazing.  I prefer the Sanderson - the lobby at St Martins doesn't compare.  But the value is slightly better.  Don't stay here if you're going to complain about comfort or design.  I don't get how people book to stay here and then are surprised by that.
",5,2007,01,17
125,Glamour at St Martin's Lane,"I paid above what I could afford to treat my boyfriend for his 27th birthday but it was worth every penny. We ate in Asia De Cuba. The food was amazing, the clientele - good looking and glam. I dressed up to the nines in a lovely dress and felt like a supermodel!  The staff were all very friendly. The hotel was space age and glam.  The room was small (it was the cheapest) but it was still very glam (except the rotten old TV).  My boyfriend is a very glam person and he loved it. Romantic evening and we stayed late into the next day which was okay.  But - I got what I'd paid for. It was all pretty pricey.
",4,2007,01,17
125,Posh. Ideal Location. Just Don't Make a Phone Call.,"As long as you don't pick up the phone in your room, you'll have a fabulous time at this modern, highly stylized hotel located in Covent Garden. From St. Martins Lane you can easily walk to Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square and Soho and enjoy the hundreds of restaurants and shops along the way. Multiple tube stops and buses surround you so you'll have no problem getting to wherever you want to go in this magnificent city. 

As for decor, somehow St. Martins Lane is able to marry the austerity of a museum with the warmth of a living room. Candles illuminate the lobby, restaurant and bar and the framed pictures on the wall in the restaurant add to the feeling of home living.

Here are four things I think you should know:

[1] The phone charges are outrageous. I ended up with a $230 dollar phone bill after my one week stay. After spending an exorbitant amount on the room alone, I was irate, but the front desk wouldn't budge on the charges.

[2] My room, decked out in white from the drapes, to the bedding to the furniture, was tiny. But then again you are in London, so I doubt you'll be staying in-doors for very long. Thankfully, the beds are blissfully comfortable and include a snuggable crisp white down comforter.

[3]  The TV was tiny (a reflection, I suppose of the size of the room) but the wireless internet service was a plus and I didn't end up watching all that much television anyhow.

[4] The Light Bar and Asia de Cuba restaurant were fantastic. Very chic. Very cosmo. Very expensive. Just to give you an idea of the vibe; at the bar/club (people were in fact dancing) a group of business men from Sweden invited me and my boyfriend to party with them and take part in their outrageously priced champagne. 

Overall, I was happy with my stay, but since there are too many other hotels out there, I doubt I'll stay again.
",4,2007,01,17
125,Light and Odd,"On arrival, which was dead on booking time, we were told that our room was not ready could we wait. 20 minutes later I went back to the desk and was told the same thing, left it another 10 minutes, still not ready SO I made a bit of a fuss and they suggested that we have a drink in the Bar at Asia whatever it is called on them.  2 hours and rather to many cocktails passed, we by this time were very very relaxed anyway and the manager come bustling over and apologised profusely and took us to our room.

A nice touch was a bottle of champagne in the room as a sorry, given that we had already drunk the equivalent of one nights stay having also drunk the champagne we were ready to go to dinner.  

The Room

We had a corner suite which was very very nice with one of the nicest bathrooms of any Hotel we have ever used in the UK.

The Bar 

Well there is a bar at Asia de Cuba but the ""highlight"" is the Ligt Bar, remember to book, its trendy and there were apparently celebs in but didnt recognise any, and to be honest its pretty poor but it was good fun for one night

Staff

Designer ineptitude, they are all about 12 and more interested in their Armani tunics than anything else but OK

Overall

Very trendy, good fun, service as expected, food as expected no moans really.  Would we return, we are shortly

125,Too hip- needs more comfot,"I stayed here in mid-August 2006.

I probably will never go back unless I get a lower rate.  The hotel tries to be hip but basically ends up giving you low value for money.  Small chair in the room was plastic.  The TV was miniscule (although I heard they have upgraded).

The two bright spots for this hotel are:

1.  The Light Bar

2.  Asia de Cuba,

but you can visit either of these without spending the night... 

Oh, and I should add - my bathroom was quite large with a proper tub and separate shower.  I give it high marks.  Too bad the rest of the room was so form-over-function...
",3,2007,01,03
125,Showing its age,"This was my third or fourth stay at St. Martin's Lane and probably my 10th at a Morgan's hotel.  This will probably be my last stay at this specific hotel.  There was nothing horrible about the hotel but it was just not a good value for the money.  To be fair, the currently weak US dollar is part of a problem here.  The hotel's location is excellent.  Very close to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and The Strand.  The Philippe Starck design is playful and funny.  I love the LCD displays in the elevators that play an ever-changing variety of video art.  The limestone clad bathrooms are very efficient and well-designed for their footprint.  The rooms are small but that is fairly common in London where hotels are generally not a good value for the money.  The bed was very firm which I thought I'd appreciate but it ended up putting a knot in my back each morning. I had never had a problem with the beds at this hotel before.  The color wash wall was cool but some of ours were burned out so we did not have a full spctrum of color.  The lobby and some of the public areas of the hotel were a bit ropey: dirty carpets and broken tiles in the lobby.  As I have experienced at other Morgans hotels the staff can be alternately helpful or surly.  We used the concierge once he acted like we were putting him out to inquire about the weather forecast. The lack of a bathtub is a big issue, especially after a long flight from the west coast of the US.  If you love design this hotel is creative and interesting but it needs to be freshened.",3,2006,12,03
125,"Location, Location, Location","Outstanding location is probably it's best asset. Staff are excellent, friendly and welcoming (notwithstanding queues on checking out). Rooms very nice and although on small side, feel remarkably spaceous with lots of natural light.

Make sure you have a credit card though as debit cards are not accepted for purposes of bill payment or credit checking - most surprising for a supposedly ***** hotel.

Minibar prices outrageous (¬£3.50 for a bounty bar!)

Relatively lacking in public space amenities until bar opens but perhaps that's not important given that the West End is on doorstep.

Perfect for a weekend break to see a show in London.

125,Not fabulous anymore ,"me and a friend came to London to see 2 shows of  the MADONNA ""CONFESSIONS"" CONCERT at wembley arena, and decided to make this trip fabulous all the way... so we booked a twin roon at the St Martins Lane Hotel. 
while Madonna was indeed fabulous, the hotel was not quite so...

the room was indeed all white with great beds, but the good part ends here: the room was very small, and you had only the choice of sitting on the beds. the bathroom was ok but ok is NOT fabulous, right?
the lights control didnt work so we had to live with A FIXED PINK light.
the t.v set was the smallest i have ever seen and the view from the window featured an ugly buikding... REAL ugly.

but the most dissapointing thing was the lobby and the bar: although designed nicely, it didnt have any BUZZ nor LIVELYHOOD. it felt like a DEAD hotel, one that passed its good times. the bar was full but borring and conpletly didnt jestufy the prices they charge for drinks. service was clumzy and stressfull. 

if you have 220 pounds and up-a- night to spare and you are looking for a boutique hotel with action - go to BAGLIONI hotel or the sister sanderson. St Martins Lane Hotel just doesnt deliver anymore.
",3,2006,11,04
125,low value for money,"For 268pounds/1person, all would expect a far bigger room with at least bath tube together (not to mention also a proper swimming pool downstairs which is missing); slow service in restaurant, I had to wait 25 minutes for a simple sandwich, they did NOT even apologise!!
More, the ad photos with the reflecting colors on the windows are untrue, as the bulbs over the bed(s) are weak to give this intense lighting result seen from out.
Estimated worth for all they offer: 120pounds maximum

125,I went to London for fun and found it here!!!!!,"I'm from Mexico City and stayed for 15 nights at St. Martins Lane Hotel.   I really had a good time there.  The Light Bar is amazing during weekends.  The staff, well, most of all, are very friendly, but definitely the very best part of the staff is the concierge, Josh Brown, who is very friendly and helpful and make your stay a better one.  The food at Asia de Cuba is not the great thing, you should better go outside and try other places.  The rooms are small but really, really comfortable, you have everything for an extraordinary stay. The TV is the worst thing of all, is the smallest TV I have ever seen.  They should change them as they are very small and old.  The prices are high but the location worth every pound!!!!!! You are so close to everything, you just have to walk.  Definitely the location is what makes this hotel a really good one.  If you are planning going to London, long or short stays, you should stay at st. Matins Lane.

125,Regrettably not a 5* as anticipated,"There are some positives about this hotel as it is very pretty, though small, and the staff was terrific but the buck stopped there.  As Priceline guests we received a room that was 220 square feet (not even shown on St Martins Lane website in room descriptions) and our 5* ""luxury"" room had no bath, shower stall only.  The previous poster below rated this correctly as a ""boutique"", it is not a 5* hotel.   I have never heard of a luxury hotel that offers no bath tub, a 220 square foot room and has an 8 by 10 inch tevision.  The main positive was that the staff was definitely helpful and personable with us, sorry some previous posters had different experinces.  I will not bid on a 5* accomodation in London as long as this remains a Priceline ""luxury"" hotel.  Did not have a chance to try the popular Asia de Cuba restaurant though I understand it gets high remarks.  Hope this is helpful.
",2,2006,09,20
125,Trendier than thou!,"Unfortunately a case of form over functionality and certainly an example of trendiness over friendliness! In terms of atmosphere, it is exactly what you would expect for a boutique hotel and design of the hotel and rooms is great  but that is where it ends. At every encounter the staff prove extremely unhelpful and while they all look extremely young and fashionable that appears to be their only function. If you don't look like a supermodel, you will constantly be asked to present your key in order to use the bar of the hotel or get access to the restaurant. Most disappointing of all was the fact that you will be asked to present a credit card for security when ordering at the bar as they will not accept your room card as a guest of the hotel! When I queried this I was told by management this is because people can 'forge' the room cards! So it seems the hotel is patronised by trendy dishonest people. In addittion to this, business facilities proved very poor and we had to hold a meeting at the back of the restaurant as there were only 3 small meeting rooms. Very disappointing!
",2,2006,09,16
125,Loved it!,"We found great rates for this hotel via Travelzoo and booked two awesome rooms for about half the regular price. The hotel is very swanky (think the Mondrion Hotel) and I feel like it was in the middle of everything...located a short walk from Trafalgar Square, the theater district, great shopping and great nightlife! A great concierge helped us find the best restaurants in London, and helped us secure very hard to find theater tix!! Great, friendly staff and rooms were nice & clean, though not the most spacious. The bar here is also fun, though drinks can be quite pricey.
",5,2006,09,05
125,Small but funky rooms,"Disappointed with the smaller than expected  standard rooms (and we booked a twin and double but got two doubles) but great views and fantastic service.  When will hotels like this realise that no-one
unless blind drunk will pay 3.50 for a standard kit-kat.. so on-one buys anything.. my kids were disappointed not to be allowed to raid the mini bar!

Also beds in Std rooms are just queen-sized - not an inch more and not great beds either

On the positive side...Reception - Stu - was first class; friendly and relaxed. The door guy was very helpful when we changed our plans  but the Bar door-girl unfriendly and patronising - but then again she did have a nice trendy clipboard to make herself feel important!

Overall a fun place, but worth the ¬£200 a room a night?  not so sure... if you want a different experience then OMM in Barcelona is the best or for a few more quid The Sanderson although service is as patronising as it can possibly get there!

125,Supremely Well Located Hip Design Hotel,"Morgan‚Äôs Group - St. Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel

I managed to get a great deal for my two night Friday and Saturday stay of ¬£130/night excluding VAT (17.5%) via travelzoo.  

As a Londoner I occasionally like to have a holiday in my own city, and this rate gave us that opportunity to sample a great hotel, right in the centre of town a stone‚Äôs throw from Soho.  This rate included complimentary WiFi access and an upgrade to a Superior Room.  This is part of the same group as Sanderson in London and Mondrian in LA. 

I parked the car in the NCP Car Park at the back of the hotel; this has a special rate if you arrive after 6pm and depart before 9am in the morning of ¬£15, much more reasonable than the ¬£40 charged per day otherwise.  

This is a small car park, quite tight, and does close at 11.30pm, opening at 6.30am. Leave your car at home if you can. You need to lug your bags up the ramp and outside the hotel, which is annoying.

At check in, the helpful and cheery team welcome me and my partner (both guys) to the hotel, and I made reservation for the Asia de Cuba restaurant, which I had heard was not to be missed.

The bell boy took our bags up to our room, while we had a drink at the funky Light Bar.  There is a bit of clipboard-ism going at the door here, as it is only open to hotel guests and others on the guest list.  Some amazing girls here on Saturday evening, though. Perfect for modelisers! 

We were given room 302, a corner room with full floor to ceiling windows and felt very spacious. I would go with the corner room if you can. The higher the floor you get the better; third floor was above most rooflines, but I would not have liked to be on the side of the hotel lower down. You can be overlooked if you leave the curtains open.  We did! ;)

302 looked over St Martin‚Äôs Lane to the Noel Coward Theatre, where Avenue Q was showing.  This Superior Room has a shower; I asked at the desk and they told me with superior rooms there is a choice between corner rooms with a shower, or regular non-corner rooms which have a tub.  

The bathroom was covered in beige marble, and spotlessly clean. Probably worth the marginal extra over the Standard rooms which have been reported to be small; although our upgrade was free.

Toilet was separated from rest of bathroom by glass door, but with no door on the bathroom itself discretion was needed, as well as copious amounts of cologne!  Hanging space was limited to one small wardrobe with curtain not a door; try not to bring too much with you. The was a sizeable safe big enough for a smaller laptop.

Carpet was grey and a little past its best, but certainly not tatty.  Otherwise the room felt fresh, clean and bright; much bigger than I had expected or had experienced before in London. 

Several people have complained the TVs are small ‚Äì they are not huge, but are widescreen SONY types, probably about five years old and perfectly adequate.  A DVD player was provided.  Air conditioning was excellent (it was 33C outside and icy indoors) which makes a change from the usual poor excuse for a/c you get in London.  

Lighting is good, though the fun ‚Äúlight your mood‚Äù feature of the room was not as bright as you might imagine; a gimmick. The work desk and chair were sizeable if you needed to get something business related done.

Beds were poor quality, with springs ‚Äúpinging‚Äù during ‚Äúexercise‚Äù.  I mentioned this on check out and they said they were undergoing a mattress replacement program and this should be fixed soon; proper pillowtop mattresses will feature. Sheets were great quality Egyptian cotton, fluffy pillows which made up for the less than great mattress.

WiFi signal was strong and easy to connect (you get a code from the desk).  MiniBar was overpriced, so bring a small flask of vodka and Cranberry Juice and put it in the fridge for your evening drinks while you shower.  Amazingly they even charged ¬£4 for the sewing kit which was a rip-off.  

Bathroom supplies were average quality, and came in very small bottles; enough for one shower each and that was it.  There was a nice body scrub, but all were unscented and did not feel luxurious.  Bring your own Jo Malone.

No Tea and Coffee facilities in the room.  Crazy breakfast in bed prices of ¬£54 for two people meant we enjoyed  a full English at the caf√© round the corner for about ¬£15 total.

We went off to the OXO tower restaurant for supper, and the doorman tried to put us in the hotel Mercedes, but thanks to reviews here I avoided that and we hailed a cab a few minutes later.

The highlight of our stay was Jada, the Italian waitress in the Asia de Cuba restaurant.  My partner and I sat down to eat at around 11pm on Saturday having seen Avenue Q, a little tired but Jada pepped us up, chatting merrily with us and suggesting some excellent choices from the menu.  

This is the sort of restaurant you can still taste the flavours hours after and worth every penny.  We had a great cocktail to share, a huge glass and two straws which was great fun!

Jada‚Äôs cheery and engaging attitude was second to none, and she really made the evening for us, which can not have been easy for her at the end of what must have been a long and busy night.

One last point, yesterday I received a survey, which I duly filled in mentioning both the many good points and the few areas for improvement.  Hilary, the GM, emailed me by return with a personalised response.  Very impressive and a good indication of the dedication and excellence this hotel aspires to.

SUMMARY:  supremely well located funky cool design hotel with great staff and rooms, awesome Asia de Cuba restaurant and exclusive Light Bar.  Ideal for a weekend theatre/clubbing break.

125,What are you complaining about?,"I read a number of reviews from TripAdvisor after my girlfriend had made the booking for us and I was starting to get concerned.

WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? The hotel is fantastic. It is a great place to stay. The entire team that works there is nothing but warm and friendly.

We were in a standard room and yes, it might not be the biggest place to stay, but the hotel is right in the heart of Leicester Square and Covent Garden. We did not book to be in this location just to sit in our room!

The restaurant and the bar were amazing. They are the place to be seen in and have a really cool crowd with a great atmosphere. All the action happens in the lobby area and this is the place to hang out.

The hotel appears to be offering something different. If you have a traditional view of hotels or you want to play it safe‚Ä¶. go somewhere else and be boring!

If, like us, you want to have some fun, be different and have a truly unique experience - check in and check it out!

125,Perfect end to my trip!,"when i arrived, i was a little disapponted. id only seen the hotel in photos, so in person i felt the decor was a bit cheesy and unimpressive. it almost felt like a bank that was trying to be cool. but after that, it only got better and better. i was starving at check in, so i went to the asia de cuba restaurant next to the lobby, and i was praying it wasnt going to -- like most of the food in london, but it was one of the best meals of my trip. then i took the blue elevator up to my room, and i liked it very much. it was nicely designed, all white, with a small hallway from the door to the beds, so the noise outside was at a minimum. the bathroom was huge, with a seperate stall toilet, and had plush towels, robes, and really nice grapefruit soap that i kept ordering and taking. the shower had great water pressure, and i liked the mood lighting that you could customize. there was a lot of cabinet space, and plenty of room for two people to unpack two bags and move around comfortably.
the service was amazing! dont listen to the other reviews...everyone there who dealt with us was really nice and personable, at one point we even showed them stuff we bought after shopping for gifts. they made reservations for us at all the coolest and tastiest restaurants, and knew where to go to shop. 
the breakfast buffet was delicious, with all kinds of breads, fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, juices and eggs and sausages made to order.
bottom line is, money works. it is a bit pricey, but they really get it and they know all about the fun cool places you want to see like a londoner.

125,Loved it!,"My little sister and I went to London on vacation.  We booked 4 nights at the St. Martin's Lane Hotel.  I wanted to treat ourselves to a cool, trendy hotel in the middle of everything.  After reading some of the reviews on here, I was a little worried that I might have spent a lot of money on something that would dissappoint, but I was not dissappointed at all.  Yes, most of the staff is young and extremely good looking, but they were more than willing to help you with anything.  The front desk, bellmen, and concierge were extremely helpful and pleasant.  The concierge made great recommendations for restaruants and got us reservations at trendy places with little notice.  Yes, the rooms are small, but unless you are paying over 500 pounds in London, they all are.  We only stayed in a standard room, but I loved how impeccably white it was and the floor to ceiling windows make it beautiful.  The bathroom was wonderful!  Yes, everything had a price on it, but no one is forcing you to eat out of the mini-bar or room service, or to take their overpriced gadgets home with you.  The area around the hotel is ideal.  We didn't even need to take the tube.  It is in walking distance of all the West End attractions, many pubs, and great restaurants.  My only complaint was regarding the Light Bar.  After seeing pics on the website, I was very interested in going there for a drink and the posh atmosphere.  Unfortunately, they never mentioned that it is more a club (only open at night) than a hotel bar.  My little sister is only 20, so we were not allowed in.  I was miffed.  I thought that we had paid way too much for the hotel for us not to be able to go and sit in the only hotel bar.

125,"Very Modern, Great Location","We had a nice suite at the St. Martin's Lane Hotel,  the room and the whole place is ultra-modern.  Our room had lots of natural light, and all fixtures, lighting, etc. was in good working order.  Based on some of the TripAdvisor reviews, we were sure to lock everything possible up each night in the safe, and we had no problems.  Workout room was pretty dismal, not much in there, some weights, one recumbent bike, and two treadmills - one of which was out of order.  Also, they have a business office with internet connection - but 3 pounds per 15 min. to use - so I went to the internet cafe on Old Street (5 minute walk) and got 1 hour for 1 pound and that was a great cost savings.
The staff are mostly young, well-meaning people, but are indifferent.  The bar downstairs opens after 5:30 p.m. and there is always a bouncer with an attitude asking if you are a guest of the hotel or have a reservation.  It is a little too much attitude.  The location of the hotel is great.  There is a Starbucks, plus other coffee shops, newsstands, restaurants, etc right out your door.  The street is relatively quiet with traffic at night, so not a huge amount of noise, but you have to work a little to get a cab, or just walk down the street to Trafalgar Square.  Regarding transportation, the hotel has some deal with some local Mercedes Benz drivers who cost lots of bucks, you need to avoid that, and be sure to ask the doorman for a ""black taxi"" so they don't try to convince you to take their transportation.

125,Fake Corner Suite Size,"The corner suite was large and comfortable but it is fasely advertised as 158sqm / 1,700sq ft on the floor plan as advertised on the hotel website. Beware as the room size is actually around 700 sq ft. 

We already make a complain to the hotel manager and although it seems that action would be done to update the website, nothing has been done after a month.

125,Keep your doors locked!,"I recently stayed at the St Martin's Lane Hotel with my Boyfriend for his 30th birthday and it was a great experience until someone tried to force their way into my room at 3am claiming to be ""security"".  We called down to security and it took them 10 minutes to reach our room and they did nothing to calm our nerves or serach for the ""security"" member.

That was bad enough i thought until we reported the incident in the morning to the on duty manager and they told us ""these things just happen"" and that it was ""difficult to keep track of people coming into the hotel"".  At the prices for the rooms you'd have thought that they would make it their business to know who was coming and going from the hotel! What's more they offered no apology and didn't try to deny this kind of thing happened.  No apology, no conisderation, no refund and most importantly no customer care i wouldn't stay here again if they paid me!

125,A disappointing experience...,"We stayed for a night at St Martins lane. We paid 215pounds and that was meant to be a bargain (because we booked 5 rooms so we got a better deal, but apparently if you book it from --- or anywhere else you can get it even cheaper). The rooms were like cubicles, there is not enough space for 2 people to walk around the room. There is a narrow desk and a chair but in order to sit down you have to pull the desk forward, block the only way to the bathroom (you can of course jump over the bed). 

Everything in the room has a price tag. You start from 4 pounds for a small bottle of water and it goes up to 250 pounds for a through cover. The room doesn't even contain a kettle to make a cup of coffee or tea. You need to order everything from room service (and of course it doesn't come for free!!). We asked for an ironing board and the brought us the dirtier one available. In the bathroom you can only get a shampoo, a scrub and a body conditioner (no body wash, you have to stick with the scrub). Even though the room was very white and plain, the carpet looked rather dirty. The TV is hiding inside a cabinet but it is nothing exciting to see anyway. It is probably the oldest 13inch TV you will ever see. 

The restaurant downstairs was nice. However, too expensive for the whole atmosphere and the food. The most disappointing thing was that we paid 1800 pounds (without the 10% service charge) and they told us to go because they had to prepare the table for someone else to come. So overall, I wouldn't stay there again and I wouldn't suggest it to anyone.

125,Too hip for good service,"I have stayed at the St. Martin‚Äôs lane for 2 nights. Overall it is a very hip and extremely modern hotel. The rooms are fine (very fancy) and style clearly comes before practicality. 

The beds are fine and the bathrooms are nice and open and have floor heating which is nice. Overall the setup was not to my taste however.

The corridors are actually really depressing and the staff is as cold as the whole hotel atmosphere. It has a very hip bar which is actually known throughout London but I think it is overrated like the whole hotel. For that amount of money I rather stay somewhere else. 

Having said this, if you love ultra cool hotels this is probably the one.

125,Style *and* substance,"Just got back from an overnight stay. Was apprehensive having read some of the rather negative reviews and being a little wary of overly styled hotels which generally aren't comfortable. This, however, is a very comfortable and relaxing hotel despite its seemingly uncompromising design. 

I had booked a studio and was upgraded to a deluxe studio - two walls of floor to ceiling windows made a spacious room feel even more so, and with excellent curtains and blinds giving privacy and a good night's sleep too. Huge bathroom with a decent bathtub and separate shower and WC. Great attention to detail means minimalist appearance without sacrificing any convenience or comfort.

Negatives: the bed's not great, although it is more comfortable than you'd think from first impressions (seemed a bit bouncy for my taste). And the TV was pretty shabby, and the cabinet it's housed in isn't a great bit of work either. The price lists for everything in the room and several notices along the lines 'you touch it, you've bought it' are instrusive to say the least and don't belong in a ¬£350/night hotel room. 

Pluses: looks great, lovely contemporary building in perfect location and it's comfortable too; great bathrooms; In room dining was very good, too.

The really major plus, as others have commented, and the best feature: the staff, who are not only great looking (!) but very friendly, helpful and efficient - anticipated our every need without ever being obstrusive. Every single member of staff we encountered was wonderful. 

In summation, it's no Four Seasons (my preferred option and still the benchmark for hotels IMHO) but it's something a little different, done pretty well, and with some of the best staff I've had the pleasure to meet. Treat yourself and give it a try.

125,Such friendly staff,"The hotel and restaurant staff made this weekend break so special for us.  We booked a superior room and was upgraded to a deluxe room, the room was very clean/white and a lovely bathroom with a really good shower.  And after reading a previous review I am pleased to report that there are toilet doors.  The food in the restaurant was good, the service was fantastic.  It was a pleasure to stay somewhere where the staff are so friendly, not at all stuffy.",4,2006,02,13
125,Expensive but trendy,"Just spent one night there. I'm 46 and felt very old there. Excellent location. Great wackey decor, clean & generally good service. Downside: no indication on room stat as to what temperature you are trying to set; room very small; poor bed (cheap metal frame had me rolling to the centre); couldn't get the fact that a cooked breakfast was included in our room rate (raised on at least 4 occasions - frustrating); ¬£10 a drink in the bar (shorts). Sum up: had better value for money e.g Hilton Executive accomodation on Park Lane; Suite at Thistle Tower Bridge.

125,Loving St Martins Lane,"I just checked out of St Martins Lane having spent the weekend there and absolutely loved it. I have never stayed before, but would go back again.
My wife and I ate dinner in Asia de Cuba and found the Bento boxes to be great value for money and ideal for a pre-theatre meal.
The Receptionists were simply yummy and I felt as if they really wanted us to enjoy our stay.
If you go you must check out the Light Bar. Apparently there is high demand to be on the guest list, but by being in a room we walked straight in - how cool is that!
",5,2006,01,16
125,If only every Hotel in the world was like St Martins Lane,"After a hectic Christmas/New year, my wife and I needed 24 hours away from our kids to have some fun ourselves

I spend approx 50 nights a year staying in Hotels all over Asia, USA and Continental Europe for work so to be honest staying in a Hotel in the city where I live is pretty rare.

I use TripAdvisor from time to time, if I am going to a city I haven't been to before or if my company is not in a Hotel Programme there. We chose St Martins Lane because of the positive TripAdvisor comments but also because we have been told by friends that it is an ""Experience"".

We arrived at the Hotel on a Saturday afternoon, to be greeted by a doorman, who immediately introduced himself and relieved us of our bag. The receptionist and Concierge (the receptionist introduced us to him)were as warm and friendly as the doorman. Once they had learnt our first name they used it all the time, which we loved as it gave us a feeling that we were being treated as guests in somebody elses home. 

I didn't tell my wife what type of room we had booked, however we were both blown away by the Garden Room we entered. Whilst the Garden wasn't huge it was still a Garden which you could sit outside in (it was unfortunately raining so we didn't get a chance to use it).  

The room was modern with crisp, clean (very) decor and had everything we needed for twenty hours.

We had dinner in Asia de Cuba which was fantastic. The atmosphere was vibrant, coupled with the  friendly, ""down to earth"" attentive staff who seemed to have so much fun, made for a memorable night.

We had a couple of cocktails in the Light Bar which were fantastic and of course helped us sleep well in a very comfortable bed. 

Breakfast the next morning was delivered within 20 minutes of us ordering it (even after the Room Service ""Breafast Hours"")and our request for a later checkout was met by a ""No Problem"" from the Front Desk. 

We loved our room (and the garden that was delicately lit up at Night and of course private), loved the decor and colours in our room after turndown - Light your Mood (simple, I know but clever)and loved our dinner but most of all loved the friendliness of all the staff we came in contact with.

All in all we had a great experience and will be back next time we want to have a memorable night with some fun in our home town.

PS: There have been previous comments about the carpet and ""stuffy"" corridors. The floor we stayed on was cool with new carpet (loved the room numbers on the floor)
",5,2006,01,14
125,A must try experience - fantastic!!,"I was taken here for a 1 night stay as a birthday suprise - I have never experienced a hotel like it, it was absolutely brilliant and totally unique.

From the moment we arrived the quirkiness kept me entertained from start to finish.  For starters the hotel does not have a name on it and there are no signs anywhere for the reception, lifts etc - some people may find this a bit frustrating but to be honest it just added to the whole experience.  Even finding your hotel room number was a mystery as the numbers are woven into the carpet outside the door.  I note that in some of the older reviews there are a number of comments made about stained worn carpet - this must have been replaced or cleaned since as I did not notice any problems at all.  Staff were very polite and accommodating at all times.

The rooms are exclusive and innovatively designed (but then you wouldn't expect anything less of Mr Starke).  The mood lighting is a beautiful idea.  The bathroom was spacious and once again was designed superbly.  On the contrary to what some other people have said, there were toiletries supplied free of charge.

My only gripe along with some others was that everything in the room did appear to have a price tag and the contents of the mini bar were way way over priced - but the simple solution to that is if you don't like the price don't eat or drink it!!

The light bar was a very friendly and fun environment with a great atmosphere - I was more than happy to drink the night away here.

If you hadn't already guessed I throughly my stay at St Martins Lane. I do acknowledge that this will not be an experience enjoyed by all as the decor and eccentricity will not be to everyones taste.  For me I loved every minute and would go back tomorrow.

125,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Comfortable Room, Happening Lobby","I'll admit.  I was tad bit apprehensive to book after reading some current reviews on this site.  Regardless, I opted to stay at the St Martins Lane based on previous positive experiences (1999-2001).  Yes, they could do with updating room electronics (e.g. TV, stereo) and sprucing up hall carpets.  Regardless, my most recent stay (11/16-21/05) was rather positive.  First of all, the location cannot be beat.  Secondly, all staff (from doorman to front desk to cleaning staff) were service oriented and friendly.  I was always greeted with a ""good morning"" or ""hello.""  Thirdly, the room (standard double on 5th floor) was in as good condition as in 2001, the bed comfortable, bathroom spacious and surroundings quiet (I can't speak for rooms on lower levels...closer to lobby).  Finally, I enjoyed the lively, ""happening,"" scene in the lobby.  It's a great/convenient place to meet friends and have a drink before any night out.  For me, for now, the St Martins Lane continues to be the hotel I prefer to stay at when in London.

125,Great service but modern to the extreme!,"This ultra modern hotel has quirky features such as  strange garden gnomes and tooth-shaped (?) stools in the foyer, and weird videos in the lift (which one of our party commented were reminiscent of the video in ""The Ring"").  Great if you like that sort of thing!  

The location is of course ideal being a stones throw from Leicester Square.

The hotel is very clean and fresh throughout, rooms included, and the decor all modern - with some nice little features such as mood-lighting behind the beds.  The corridors are somewhat like a holiday inn type property though!

We felt some aspects lack thought - the room lighting, although adjustable, was generally dim so awful for getting ready to go out.  There was no bathroom door on our room (which we were informed was generally the case throughout the hotel, although our friends had a door on their twin room).  This takes the meaning of ""open plan"" to the extreme!  The mirror is too far from the socket so you can't look when you're doing your hair.  The mini bar prices are astronomical (eg, ¬£5 for a small bag of jelly beans or nuts) and there's plenty of stuff in the room you can run up a bill on which is not included in the price.  In fact, everything in the room (including the rather odd terracotta pot and plastic plant on the wall) can be purchased for a price! 

The room we had was very small, our friends' room was slightly bigger.  Both had a desk/chair, TV station with mini bar underneath, hanging space in the corridor etc.  We felt that for a 5* hotel and for the money we paid, we would have liked more space.  

The staff are very friendly and can't do enough to help, and there is an excellent range for breakfast with great service - ours was included in the price of room (although we signed for an additional optional service charge).

125,Fabulous! Loved The St Martins Lane,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in September whilst on a business trip to London.

On arrival we were impressed with the overall look of the hotel and found the check in service to be of an excellent standard and very smooth. The hotel lobby was very modern and hip and had a great vibe even during the day.

We booked a suite ""Room 101"" and found it to be of an excellent size compared to the last Schrager hotel suite we stayed in (The Royalton, New York). It was a corner suite with floor to ceiling windows, a sitting area, desk, two tv's one being a 50""  that was on wheels so we were able to manouvere it to where we chose. The bathroom was one of the best I have ever seen in a hotel room. A huge stand alone oval bath dominated the room and all the fittings were Phillipe Stark. The lighting of the room had been carefully planned with dimmers on most switches and the lighting above the bed changed colour to suit you mood - fabulous!!

The hotel breakfast was good with a wide variety of choice. The hotel bar was great, quite busy with a good atmosphere and a fantastic choice of cocktails.

The staff were great and the hotel concierge was really knowledgeable and helpful.

We missed the opportunity to eat at the hotels restaurant ""Asia de cuba"" but we believe that is also an excellent place to eat one of the finest in London.

Overall we really enjoyed our experience at this hotel and would not hesistate to recommend it to our friends.

125,Fantastic... after a shaky start,"We booked the hotel without reading the reviews on here first as it was always somewhere we had wanted to stay for an extravagant weekend break.  Felt exhilerated after we finally had done it but then started to read reviews posted by other people and were then scared!

From the moment you arrive the lobby gives you a sense of style and oppulence that you would expect from an expensive first class hotel.  However, checking in was a different story.  The staff were very polite and we were shown to the bar area where we were plied with free drinks as the room was not ready.  It turned out however that the room we had booked was no longer available and after an hour and twenty minute wait, we were finally given the keys to our 'upgraded' room which was a nice touch and you'd expect nothing less considering how long we had to wait.

The lifts are cool and the room was amazing.  Brilliant view and large and the bathroom was fantastic too.

The only other downside to the hotel was the fact that the corridors were boiling!

Would definately stay there again and have put the check-in incident down to a hiccup!
",4,2005,10,07
125,"Tired and run-down, but definitely hip","I should start off by saying that this hotel isn't half as bad as I had feared.  I stayed at the hotel because a client wanted to.  The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is great.  Surprisingly, I found the staff to be very attentive, friendly and accomodating.  My room (I got upgraded to a Superior, I think) wasn't too small (especially by Schrager standards).  The room was quiet, with pretty thick walls, which was something I feared.

HOWEVER, the hotel is worn down and definitely not very well taken care of.  The furnishings in the room, though very modern, seemed like they hadn't been updated in years and years.  The TV is a old 13"" and hidden in this cabinet that was straight off the discount rack at IKEA.  The sheets and towels and bathroom were pretty nice.  The desk is really too small to work at and the desk chair was this junky plastic thing that belongs poolside at a 70's era road motel.  Don't expect to effectively/comfortably do any work here.  The halls seem grimy, but that might just be because they're so dark.  The gym is pretty much a joke - there are 2 treadmills and some weights, but I'm not sure anyone has ever done maintenance on any of it.  The treadmills (both) squeak and clank, the bikes pedals are bent and the cables on the weight set need oil and maybe replacement.  Its a servicable gym, but obviously really only there so the hotel can say they have one, rather than for their guests to really get a good workout.  

The bar and restaurant are both nice and hopping, so if that's what you're looking for, this may be the right place for you.  For me, though, given all the options in London, I won't be staying here again.  For example, my experience at the Metropolitan (at Hyde Park Corner), another hip and modern hotel, was much better.

125,Not Ian Schrager's Best,"Perhaps I'm a bit jaded having stayed at the Royalton in NYC, but I was expecting a similar experience at St. Martin's Lane.  The Royalton is everything it is portrayed as in it's pictures posted online, whereas, the pictures of St. Martin's Lane tend to overstate reality.  The positives: Excellent bellmen, as stated by others; the female concierge (the male one will be mentioned in the negatives section), the room, and staff in the Light Bar.  The negatives: everything else about the 3rd floor, carpet needs serious replacement in the hallway, and no air conditioning, not that I'm expecting AC in London, but at least fresh air, it was stifling; the male concierge was less than helpful.  I had purchased some tickets online and was awaiting their arrival at the hotel.  Instead of offering to contact the agency to confirm delivery, he wished me ""good luck"" in contacting the agency myself!  If you see a guy at the concierge desk, just keep walking lol.  To be honest, for my next visit to London I will try somewhere else.

I had a wonderful view of Trafalgar sqaure.  Breakfast was delicious... but yes, very expensive. Especially when traveling with the Dollar.

                i just don't understand why a hotel would have elevators with more thought to their interior design than the thought that went into their guest rooms.

The concierge was always helpful and helping us find a place for breakfast, dinner, etc.  We also had dinner at the hotel restaurant, which was extremely good and worth the price.   I was worried after reading the reviews that they wouldn‚Äôt have any toiletries, because a lot reviews noted that EVERYTHING was for sale ‚Ä¶ not true.

125,Not worth the money...,"We stayed at St Martin""s Lane hotel for 4 nights during May 2005. The location of the hotel is good, very close to the most lively places of London. We decided to try the hotel for the name of Philippe Starck as we are fond of him. The experience was not what we hoped for. The rooms are small and inconvenient. We could not find enough room to open our two luggages at the same time. You have to walk around the room several times in order to get prepared to go out. WC and the shower are located on teo opposite sides of the room ! Traveller convenience and comfort is totally ignored. The service quality is average.. Our door lock was broken and we managed to enter into the room only by the help of the staff with the master key. We requested them to fix the door lock next day, but found that nothing has been done the next night when we returned to our room. The same process was repeated again and as we showed our unhappiness, they sent someone to fix the door which lasted around an hour and kept us awake...The restaurant and club at the reception makes the entrance of the hotel very noisy and crowded. You can hardly talk to the guys at the reception during evening hours...

125,"Great location, ok hotel","I had no problem with the staff, as many other reviewers did.  I though the room was more than adequate, with a large bed, decent bathroom (I don't really need a bathtub), and a good desk to work on. 

The internet rates are ridiculously priced, as is everything in the bar.  It is more than a little humorous to see the 'bouncers' posted outside of their generally empty bar.   Other than that, I got what I thought was a reasonable rate for a hotel in that location ($290), near a tube stop, and with plenty to do in walking distance.  I'd stay again if the price was right... I guess I just don't need the goofy, stylized stuff that seems to be their stock in trade in my hotels.

125,Definitely overrated...,"My boyfriend and I stayed at St Martins Lane for his birthday and I have to say that it was very disappointing. 

When we arrived for our check-in, the staff were very cold and our room was in no way ready for us. When we were finally taken to our room after about forty minutes in reception, we opened the door to find a cleaning lady still tidying up which came across as very unprofessional. With such a late check-in time, you would expect the hotel had enough time to get our room ready for us.

But the worst part of our stay was the extortionate prices. You are expected to pay ¬£4.50, yes ¬£4.50 for a standard sized Kit Kat bar! And literally everything in our room had a price label marked on it. It made us feel very uncomfortable and definitely made the stay alot less enjoyable. I expected a hotel with it's so called good reputation to have a lot more class.

125,Overrated,"St. Martin's Lane provided service and facilities that were far from the 5-star standard.   We had a long wait to check in, and when we were finally given a room, it had a shower but no bathtub; when I asked to switch, I was told that very few rooms in the hotel have bathtubs(?), and that nothing else was available.  Then, we were handed a room key and directed to the elevator- no bellman was available to help us with our things.  The corridor had stained carpet and a musty smell.  When we reached our room, it was so small that I could barely turn around.  Also, this hotel has a peculiar practice of filling its hotel rooms with things to buy- for example, there was a city guide of London in shrinkwrap on a shelf in the room.  If you open it, you have purchased it and owe 20 or 30 pounds.  The same was true of the shampoo in the bathroom.  Instead of a small (free) sample-size, they have full sized shampoo, and if you open it, you have bought it (it will be added to your bill).  In all, this hotel provides an atmosphere that is uncomfortable and ungracious.  The only thing to recommend it is its location.

I will not stay there again.

125,It ws very Cool....,"I went here for my birthday a while ago... and was in absolute awe of the place. It was a birthday surprise, and I didn't even realise I was in a hotel until we were in the corridor for our room... the reception is surreal!!
We had a suite, and if you want something different this is definatley the place to go! The bathrooms are huge, and the lighting systems are an activity in themselves, we spent ages playing to change the whole colour of the room (everything is white, except for a tube of lighting tucked above the bed which can be adjusted to go through the whole light spectrum!)
The only thing I would say is that the staff are for too quick to come into your room, even with the do not disturb sign on the door... you have been warned!

Staying there is a great experience!

125,Nice hotel but a bit odd!,"We booked the St.Martins Lane through Last Minute dot com and got a standard queen room with english breakfast. On arrival you are greeted by doormen that look more like models, the reception is all very very modern, Salvador Dali type furniture that looks extremely uncomfortable! The reception staff were most helpful and friendly. 

The lifts are odd, you feel like you are on acid, they are quite dark with small plasma screens with arty clips showing on them. This isn't a negative thing, just a bit strange! At first we thought it strange that the rooms didn't have the door numbers on but then realised they were in the carpet on the floor! 

Our room was lovely, all white decor and accesories, even had a treadmill in the room leading to the bathroom. Bathroom was also nice - clean and smart, only thing was that we only had a shower and not a bath. We were situated at the back of the hotel had a pleasent view just overlooking other buildings, it was nice and light. I wouldn't say the room was 5 star and yes everything in the room does have a price list! The mood enhancing light is a nice touch though :o)

We didn't eat in Asia de Cuba but did spend the later part of the evening in The Light Bar which was pretty good for a hotel bar. Extremely expensive though and after paying ¬£12.50 per cocktail was surprised to find that we got charged ¬£3.50 service charge for the waitress to bring it to the table from the bar! The hotel is strict on residents only in the bar past 11pm so it emptied out a bit for a while.

Breakfast in the morning was excellent, lovely continential selection and huge english breakfast, staff were attentive and on the ball. Not so keen on the resturant itself, thought it odd looking, I suppose it's meant to be really arty!

All in all a good stay, don't think I'd stay again only because there's so many other London hotels I want to try but would recommend it.

125,good professional staff,"We stayed here for two nights this month (March). This is not the sort of hotel we would normally choose -we usually stay at the much more traditional Claridges or The Capital, but we fancied a change and on the whole we were impressed.
We stayed in one of their larger rooms which seemed even larger because of the minimalist decor - everything was white or cream or   perspex. The bed was very comfortable and my wife and I both slept very well which is quite unusual for us in hotels. Everything was very clean and the bathroom was spacious and well equiped. I agree with a previous reviewer about everything in the room seeming tobe  for sale including the ,usually free, sewing kit ¬£3 !!!!!!
The staff were uniformly cheerful, friendly and professional, possibly the best we have come across, although as we had no problems we never really put them to the test.
We dined once in the Asia de Cuba restaurant which is large and on the Tuesday night that we ate there very busy. We enjoyed our meal and again service was excellent.
By contrast the cooked english breakfast was very poor and had clearly been cooked long before I ordered it (it arrived about a minute after I placed the order.)",4,2005,03,24
125,"Over priced, stylish but no substance","We stayed at the St Martins for the second time in September 2004.

Well what a difference two years make.  The rooms and corridors are now tatty, the staff treat you as if you are lucky to be there, we waited 20 minutes to check in - not because of a queue but because their IT system was down, then we couldn't get into the room and had to go back to reception and guess what, there was no one available to let us into our room and would we mind waiting. 

I have been involved in the hotel trade and it seems to me that this hotel has put too much emphasis on style (now rapidly fading) and not enough emphasis on what makes a hotel great - friendly, efficient, seemless service
",1,2005,03,20
125,Preferred it to The Sanderson,"We preferred St Martins Lane to its sister, The Sanderson. 

The bathroom was much more comfortable and spacious, the staff friendlier and more helpful, and the breakfast (and surroundings) infinitely better.

We stayed for New Years Eve, and had the unexpected bonus of a room with a view of the London Eye ‚Äì so we could watch the fireworks over a bottle of champagne.

The only minor quibble was that mentioned elsewhere ‚Äì the corridors are stuffy and the stained carpet not great. But as most guests probably spend 0.01% of their stay in the corridors, it's hardly worth crying about!
",4,2005,01,04
125,Good location....,"Our taxi driver had a problem finding this hotel and had to ask 2 other drivers before finally finding it!  Can see why when we got there as no name outside just a mainly glass building with a revolving door.  Apart from that the hotel was very nice.  The staff were very courteous and helpful and not at all stuck-up as in some hotels we've stayed in.  Walking along the corridors to find our room was a weird experience as no natural light so it felt a bit like an indoor maze but the room was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows.  Only other complaint was that it seemed as if everything was for sale in the room with price lists next to many objects but the beds were very comfortable and the mood lighting entertained my daughter for ages!  Overall the location is excellent for covent garden and leicester square and whilst not my favourite hotel it was an experience that i would repeat.

125,"Funky, functional, great location, breakfast service leaves a little to desire","A very nice place.  Clean hotel.  Easy check-in. Wireless internet. Great location for all of london.  I've been several times and this was one of the better locations.  You must love yellow and white.

It is hard to find.  One way streets make it difficult to get there on your first try.

Breakfast service is a little slow.  I was there for several days and most, not all, days I had to ask for things ... like coffee ... a couple of times to have it arrive.
",4,2004,11,05
125,all mouth and no trousers,"Disappointed

I wandered the corridors for some time looking for my room number...ahh, they're on the (multi-stained) carpet, of course!?!

lower level rooms are subjected to considerable noise from the Light Bar 'til 3am (had to seek out a member of staff to be seated, waited 10 minutes to order a drink and left thirsty) 

okay, so it's in the perfect location, it's strikingly beautiful, the staff are terribly friendly and obliging, and you really should eat at Asia de Cuba...food and service both faultless (try the prawns in pesto appetizer...Dear God!!), but I work in IT and I reckon I could knock up a design for a walk-in shower that doesn't flood the bathroom and a tap you can turn off with wet hands (and I thought clever design was about functionality?!)

...and I never did work how to get the plug into the hole in the basin?!!

it's all just a bit cryptic.  The Thistle around the corner may not have a virtual aquarium, but they do have much better facilities for half the price and will see my money next time

No offence Mr Starck...you still make a smashing ashtray ;) 

(I did leave the above feedback[in spite of there being no mechanism in place for collecting feedback?!] but have had no response).",2,2004,10,18
125,loved it,"i have to say i loved every minute of it :)
while in the uk stayed at sanderson, and decided to have a stroll to st martins to see what it was like, prepared for the worst after all the bad reviews....
and suprise suprise - it is an awesome hotel.
even did the room check. spotlessly clean rooms, good size.
so took the plunge and booked in to stay.
everything was perfect, upgraded room to a double double, friendly staff everywhere from housekeeping to reception, the light bar was packed with a dj playing and the crowd dancing.
fantastic restaurant & breakfast.
in fact the sanderson was great, everything i thought it would be - but it was st martins that suprised me. 
next time in london this is where i'll be staying again, ignore the bad reviews and try it - best time i'd had in london for a long time :)
",5,2004,10,11
125,Good but the small details need work,"While this hotel is stunning on arrival, a lot of the small things are lacking. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast excellent (though extremely expensive), and the video art in the lift is novel.  But the carpet in the hall was heavily stained and room itself was very small, as was the TV in the room, which was in an old style cabinet (with an even older video) which appeared dumped in the corner of the room and not in keeping with the room as a whole. To boot, the door of the cabinet would not stay open and kept closing - which is not good if you are watching TV. As well there was only a small amount of channels .  I found the aircon very noisey at night too.  But the most annoying thing was samples of all the products in the room that were for sale, including hotel souvenirs like baseball hats.  When being charged this amount fora room you dont expect it the room itself to be used as a shop window
",3,2004,08,20
125,A Haven in the Heart of the City,"Friends recommended this hotel for a six night stay in London at the beginning of June 2004.  Frankly, after reading the reviews here I was a little gun-shy, but we loved it!

The location is fabulous, right in the heart of the theater district and steps away from Trafalgar Square.  We had a standard double room, which was gorgeous in that minimalist, Schrager, or W-Hotel manner.

When I travel on business I tend to have no choice but to stay in traditional, mainstream hotel chains and have developed an abhorence for the whole, floral polyester bedspread, bad art and TV in a hideous armoire aesthetic.  

Our Room at St. Martin's Lane had two double beds with lush white cotton duvets and pillows.  The room had huge windows, a white cabinet with mini-bar, tv, cd, & dvd player.  Close the cabinet door when you're playing CD's and watch a trippy light show in the cabinet window.  And of course the lighting wheel next to the bed lets you change the mood of your room whenever you feel like it.

The bathroom was very large, and very attractive.  We slept like lambs every night after long, tiring days of shopping and sight-seeing, and really felt like we were returning to our own personal haven when we got back to the hotel each night.

We had drinks, then dinner with friends the first night of our visit, and both were exceptional.  The drinks were expensive in the bar, but absolutely delicious.  I had the best Mai Tai I've ever had and my friends raved about the Mojitos.  The bar was packed with a very hip, attractive crowd which made for good people watching.

The restaurant was also packed, and the food and service were top-notch.  Everyone's favorite dish was the calimari salad, which had the most tender, thinly sliced, lightly fried calimari you can imagine.

A word on the overall service at the hotel:  After reading reviews that mentioned the 'attitude' of the hotel staff, I went in with kind of low expections.  Everyone we encountered, including the front desk staff, porters, concierges, room service staff were polite and efficient.  We ordered room service breakfast most days and never waited more than 20 minutes for delivery.  Requests for a bucket of ice or a pot of coffee consistently came in less than ten minutes.

The only two negative things I can say is that I agree with other reviewers that the hallways and elevators are oddly sauna-like, and an armchair would be a nice addition to the standard-double room.

If you're perfectly happy in the traditional hotel environment, don't waste your money here because it ain't cheap, and the appeal of the place will be lost on you.

But if you're someone to whom design, aesthetics, great service and great food are important, do it!",5,2004,06,17
125,Way too hip for me....,"My wife and I travelled to London in late March 2004. We're in our early 40's and live in a rather progressive area, but we were just not hip enough to appreciate this hotel.  We has six nights booked and bailed out after two nights.  

The hipness starts when you try and find it; no signs, no numbers on the building. We walked from the Leicster Square tube stop and passed it three times. The only way we could identify it was to walk in, step up to the desk and read a card with 10pt text... OK if a taxi drops you off, but a pain if you are dragging bags ftom the Tube after an all night flight.  

The lobby is bathed in yellow light from the front windows. There are only various benches to sit on, along with a row of foot tall stools (at least I assumed they were stools) shaped like molars.  

The hallways leading to the rooms (at least on floor 2) were stiffling, stuffy and the carpets looked like they had seen multiple floodings.  

The room was tiny and as far as I could tell furnished with another foot high stool, a clear plasic chair and a tiny table. The mattress was terrible. The ""big money"" mood lighting is a series of colored lights in a ceiling alcove. Woo-Hoo... Ikea chic. Carpets showed the stains of dozens of room service meals, spilled while guests ate sitting on the edge of the bed... 

The bathroom was acceptable (walk in shower, no tub) until we flushed the tiolet. When you touch the electronic controls, you unleash what can only be called an explosive *pop* guaranteed to wake up your parter in the middle of the night.  

We used the resturant for breakfasts which were expensive but acceptable.  

We cancelled out of the remainder of our stay and moved to a Sheraton across town.. not exciting, but no surprises either.  

Trip Advisor really helped me with other hotels on this trip and I want to help others, that is the primary reason for this review. This hotel was on my Corporate approved list and I didn't use this site to check it out.",1,2004,04,10
125,Interesting but too expensive,"Liked the style and feel of it all, but the first room was nice except for the view of building works. Second room exactly the same, finally the third room - very nice and stylish. lovely bathroom, garden / patio area - no view though. Light bar nice to visit but no more than a couple of drinks at the price.",3,2004,03,21
125,Not what we expected,"This hotel is extemely over-rated and not at all what we expected. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and the service is always second to none. Unfortunately, that was not to be at this hotel. Some staff were abrasive bordering on rude, the room sevice was late and cold, the wait at the bar was unacceptable for guests and the rooms are too small with dirty carpet. The only saving grace was the restauarant. The food was lovely and good value for money in relation to the rest of the experience. However, I doubt the restaurant will be able to save the hotel from this increasingly bad reputation.",2,2003,12,06
125,misleading,"I thought it was very interesting, but not a good place for the business traveler. They advertise a ""state of the art"" gym, but it is not one you would ever pay to attend. The Waldorf Meridien gym is much nicer. The room was also noisy at night. One night I heard water in the wall. The next night was strange mechanical sounds. I don't think I'll stay there again.",3,2003,10,12
125,Far too expensive,"We paid ¬£195 per night bed and breakfast through lastminute.com. Lets get things into perspective the hotel is vastly over priced.First good points. The location of the hotel is great, shot walk to Covent Garden, theatre land and Trafalgar Square. We ate in the Asia de Cuba restaurant on the evening and had a very nice meal. All meals are put in the centre of the table so that everyone could share and there was a great atmosphere. There were 9 of us and the waiter advised that we order 5 starters and 5 main courses to share, there was plenty of food and we really enjoyed it, the cost of the meal wasnt too bad either just over ¬£50 per head.Bad points The room was quite nice, but very, very small we got a standard double room which only comes with a shower, no bath very disappointing. Another guest from our party had to change rooms because of faulty air conditioning she was moved from a room with a bath to a standard double room as compensation for the move she was given a bottle of champagne. When she asked if she could have 9 glasses to share the champagne with the rest of our party she was charged ¬£5 for the hire of the glasses. There was no lounge area in the hotel. After our meal we would have liked to have sat and had a coffee and a few more drinks however, other than staying at your dinner table the only other communal area of the hotel was the lobby or light bar The lobby has no where for a group of people and the light bar is a trendy bar with extremely loud music not suitable for the older members of our group, it is also extremely expensive.Advice The rooms are very small and nothing special, so stay at one of Londons many other grand hotels and got to St Martins Lane for a meal by not going up to a room you are missing nothing.",2,2003,09,15
125,The Hip Factor is gone,"Which means of course that there is now no reason to stay here whatsoever. The prices are outrageous, the rooms are ratty with nasty carpet and uncomfortable beds, and the advertised ""mood lighting"" is nothing more than a light above the bed that changes color. The decor is more or less cloned from the Mondrian, which is also pretty tired from what I understand. For some reason, they do not air condition the elevators or the hallways, which were stuffy and smelled bad. The hallway actually smelled like vomit and the carpet was badly stained. To give you an idea of what you will pay for this scintillating experience, a water from the mini bar is L4.00 ($7.00,) a drink in the bar is at least L7.50 ($12.00)and the average price of the entrees in the restaurant Asia De Cuba (the Tuscan Steak is closed and under construction) is about L25.00, or about $40.00. We ate at a pub around the corner for L15.00. There was nothing going on here - it was deserted the entire time - except for a few tarted up 40 something women and creepy businessmen in the bar. Certainly no beautiful people. Oh, and breakfast, if you should be unlucky enough to have to pay for it (it was included in our $400.00 per night rate for a queen bed room with shower only) was L20.00, which equates to over $30.00!! I think maybe a couple of years ago they may have had something here, but it has severely declined since.",2,2003,09,03
125,"Overrated, not recommended","Let's be clear about this: this is a 60s office block that has been converted into a supposedly hip hotel. This means minimal comfort, small rooms and very young, and consequently inexperienced, staff.

If you take this on board from the start, that's fine. But be prepared for levels of service and comfort not normally associated with a five star hotel.

The location is the saving grace. Otherwise, I would not recommend it, partiularly at the sort of prices they charge here. If you want to pay this kind of money, go to the Connaught, the Ritz, Claridges, or any of the many excellent hotels in London who know how to run a five star operation.",2,2003,07,24
125,Great location!,"Location, location, location! Describes this hotel perfectly. I've stayed several times and I'm more impressed with each visit. If public transportation is something you like to avoid in London, this is the hotel to choose. You can literally walk to all the best shopping and theater in the city in short time. The staff is amazingly friendly, expecially for a ""trendy hotel"" and the rooms are more than comfortable. They can be a little on the small side but considering there is so much to do right outside the front door, you'll not spend much time in them anyway.",5,2003,02,23
125,Absolutely Fabulous,"Great Hotel. It's expensive, but worth it. It's near all the West End theatres, Covent Garden shopping, so you want have to deal with the Tube and the horrible London traffic all the time. (I once made the mistake of staying in a hotel in Notting Hill and practically spent my whole vacation on the Tube or in taxis) It's better to pay more and be in the center of everything, especially if you haven't been to London before and aren't that familiar with the Tube. The rooms are almost all white, but you can adjust the color of the light. It has floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view. The Philippe Starke bathrooms are amazing.  The staff is very helpful and you may see some famous people in the lobby.

125,BE WARY WHEN BOOKING,"When booking this Hotel be very, very careful. 
The beds are all French-style , so if they offer you deluxe rooms , king-size beds know that the bed is always French , you spend money like me without receiving anything of what you pay extra , at most they offer you a drink or 15% discount (which I did not accept on principle ) 
The hotel , the room , the facility is absolutely not worth the money they ask for .

Restaurante correcto. Desayuno muy bien, tienen una f√≥rmula de buffet b√°sico complementando con elecci√≥n a carta (camarero se pasa un poco de gracioso). Cena, fuimos un dia para provar, precio muy alto, tiempo de espera, resultado... quiz√°s no es la mejor opci√≥n cenar en el hotel.

125,Grossartiges Hotel im Herzen Londons,"Wir haben uns f√ºr das Hotel wegen der tollen Lage entschieden. Man ist im Herzen Londons und kann quasi alle wichtigen Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten zu Fuss erreichen - Buckingham Palace 20min, Houses of Parliaments & Westminster Abbey 15min, Downing Street 10min. Auch viele Ubahnstationen sind gleich ums Eck - Leicster Square zB nur 3min zu Fuss entfernt - somit hat man eine Bahn direkt vor der Haust√ºr, mit der man nonstop in gut 50min zum Flughafen Heathrow fahren kann. Und abends kann man alle West End Theater und viele tolle Lokale (Salisbury!!!)  in wenigen Minuten erreichen - zwei Theater sind sogar vis a vis auf der anderen Strassenseite. Also wirklich grossartig! Zum Hotel selbst: Empfang sehr freundlich. Nachdem unser Zimmer noch nicht fertig war, bekamen wir zwei gratis Cocktails w√§hrend wir warteten. Zimmer supergross und modern  - Licht konnte in verschiedenen Farben eingestellt werden. Nette Spielerei! Grosses bequemes Kingsize Bett, sch√∂nes Badezimmer mit viel Ablagem√∂glichkeiten. T√§glich gab es zwei Flaschen Wasser gratis bzw vier Kapseln Kaffee. K√ºhlschrank gut gef√ºllt. Auch gab es ein eigenes Fach im Schrank mit Snacks und Toilettartikel wie Parfums, die man kaufen konnte. Fr√ºhst√ºck hatten wir jeden Morgen in einem anderen Lokal in der N√§he -  da gibt es wirklich eine Riesenauswahl mit English Breakfast f√ºr 9.5 Pfund. Da spart man sich einiges gegen√ºber dem Hotel-Fr√ºhst√ºck. Von der Baustelle direkt vor dem Hotel (Rohre werden verlegt) haben wir absolut nichts geh√∂rt - Fenster haben sehr gut gedichtet. Zum Schluss ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: der Parfum-Duft im Hotel ist eine Spur zu stark,  alles wirkt durch das viele Weiss sehr k√ºhl, die Toiletten-Sp√ºlung ist sehr laut - da schreckt man sich richtig bzw h√∂rt auch die Sp√ºlung der Nachbarn durch die W√§nde durch. Die Kissen sind sehr gross und hart - h√§tte nachfragen k√∂nnen, ob es Alternativen g√§be, hab ich aber nicht gemacht. Und - schade, dass man die Jalousie im Zimmer nicht verstellen konnte - hatten sch√∂nen Blick auf das Coliseum, konnten ihn aber nur teilweise geniessen, weil die Lamellen der Jalousie nicht verstellbar waren.  Alles in allem k√∂nnen wir das Hotel allerdings sehr empfehlen!  Wir kommen sehr sehr gerne wieder!",5,2022,10,12
125,"Perfect stay, perfect pancakes!","Wir waren ganz begeistert von unserem Aufenthalt im St. Martins Lane Hotel! Die Lage ist kaum zu √ºberbieten. Besonders sch√∂n als Theaterfan, da man von den Schauspielh√§usern praktisch umringt ist. Die U-Bahn Station Leicester Square ist gleich um die Ecke. Aber auch wenn man vom Hotel aus einfach lustwandelt, kann man viele sch√∂ne Ecken Londons fu√ül√§ufig erkunden. 
An der Rezeption wurden wir sehr herzlich empfangen und konnten zu unserer √úberraschung bereits einige Stunden fr√ºher einchecken. F√ºr einen stressfreien Start in unseren Kurzurlaub war das nat√ºrlich ideal! Das Ambiente ist sehr stylish und modern, das Zimmer schlicht, aber sehr komfortabel eingerichtet. Die Betten waren super bequem, das Badezimmer sehr ger√§umig und alles war makellos sauber. Trotz seiner zentralen Lage und belebten Umgebung, war es in unserer Unterkunft immer sch√∂n ruhig. Kamen wir nach einem langen Sightseeing-Tag zur√ºck, konnten wir im St Martins wieder sch√∂n entspannen und abends auch mal auf der kleinen Terasse einen (fabelhaften!) Cocktail genie√üen.

Unser pers√∂nliches Highlight war das Fr√ºhst√ºck. Schon nach dem ersten Tag hatten wir unseren Favoriten: Pancakes mit Salted Caramel ^^ Und sind auch nicht mehr davon abgewichen. Zudem konnte man sich auch an dem Buffet bedienen und k√∂stliche Sides ordern. Das K√ºchenpersonal war schnell, freundlich und gro√üartig. Besonders die charmante Monika hat uns mit ihrer liebenswerten und humorvollen Art den Start in den Tag vers√º√üt (an dieser Stelle nochmal Vielen Dank und Liebe Gr√º√üe!!).

consigliatissimo",4,2019,11,15
125,Perfetto ,"Nel cuore di Covent Garden e quindi nel cuore di Londra. E nel cuore ti rimane. L‚Äôhotel √® nuovo, molto cool. Da fuori a malapena noti l‚Äôingresso che con quella strana luce che emana sembra uno stargate. Reception molto friendly, camera impeccabile, ci avrei abitato un mese. Fate uno sforzo se potete e sceglietelo, non ve ne pentirete. Per me sar√† sempre il target di Londra ",5,2019,09,07
125,Promosso,"Bell'hotel, buona colazione, ottimo... caff√©. Al check out avevo dimenticato un bagaglio e devo ringraziare la cortesia di Gianluca se sono riuscito a ottenerlo in tempo all'aeroporto prima di partire.",4,2019,06,07
125,Fast perfekt!,"Wir waren im Mai 2019 f√ºr einige Tage im Hotel St.Martins Lane und buchten ein Deluxe-Zimmer. Da das Hotel sehr nahe zur U-Bahn Station Leicester Square liegt fuhren wir vom Flughafen Heathrow ca. 40 Minuten ohne Umsteigen zum Hotel. Von au√üen ist das Hotel eher unauff√§lig und prompt liefen wir beim ersten mal daran vorbei. Innen ist es aber sehr stylisch, sehr geschmackvoll, sehr gro√üz√ºgig und das junge Personal ausgesprochen nett und hilfsbereit.
Wir bekamen ein Zimmer im obersten Stock und hatten somit eine sehr sch√∂ne Aussicht. Die Zimmer sind modern und funktionell eingerichtet und sind f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse sensationell gro√ü. Die Lage des Hotels ist ideal, denn zur U-Bahnstation sind es zu Fu√ü nur wenige Minuten. Ebenfalls kann man viele Musicaltheater und Restaurants fu√ül√§ufig erreichen. Wir w√ºrden dieses Hotel jederzeit wieder buchen.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist im Zimmerpreis nicht inbegriffen. Wenn man es am Vortag bucht kostet es ¬£ 20, sonst ¬£ 30 pro Person. Ehrlich gesagt sind bereits die 20 Pfund ziemlich √ºberteuert, denn das Buffet ist eher klein und √ºberschaubar, obwohl eine Fr√ºhst√ºcksspezialit√§t a la card inkludiert ist. Die Qualit√§t ist gut - allerdings f√ºr das Gebotene einfach zu teuer. 
Wir orientierten und an den Bewertungen auf Tripadvisor und gingen dann in eines der vielen Cafes in derselben Stra√üe und hatten herrliches und ausgiebiges Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr unter ¬£ 10 pro Person. Dennoch: das Hotel eist eine eindeutige Empfehlung!",4,2019,05,06

Das ganze Hotel und die Zimmer sind super gr√ºndlich, sauber und toll eingerichtet. sehr grossz√ºgige mini-bar. Auch die Angestellten sind absolut freundlich - vorallem die Herren, die aussen am Hotel super aufmerksam sind. Sie besorgen dir das Taxi, sie √∂ffnen die T√ºr... Als w√ºssten sie schon, was man gleich braucht. Auch das Hotelrestaurant und die Bar sind wundersch√∂n und fein.

125,Gutes Hotel in guter Lage ,"Ich war 3 Tage im St Martins Lane Hotel und war positiv √ºberrascht, von au√üen war ich eher abgeschreckt vom Geb√§ude, da es sich leider nicht so sch√∂n in den Stra√üenzug mit den f√ºr London typischen alten Geb√§ude einpasst.
In der Lobby bot sich nat√ºrlich ein ganz anders Bild, freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Der check in verlief reibungslos und ohne Probleme. Das Zimmer war absolut ausreichend f√ºr eine Person und zur Seitenstra√üe und daher auch Nachts nicht so laut. Das Zimmer war sauber und es gab nichts zu beanstanden. Das Essen im Restaurant war auch sehr lecker und auch der Burger in der ‚Äûhidden Bar‚Äú .
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war √ºberschaubar aber alles da was man f√ºr einen guten Start in den Tag ben√∂tigt. Warme Speisen werden a la carte zubereitet und Kaffee wird am Tisch abgefragt. Auch im Restaurant und an der Bar war das Personal sehr freundlich und bei allen fragen hilfsbereit. Das Hotel liegt keine 2 min Fu√üweg vom Trafalgar Square entfernt. Wer gerne l√§uft kommt auch schnell zum Buckingham Palace zur Oxford und Regent Street.
Kann das Hotel nur weiterempfehlen.

125,Espectacular ubicaci√≥n,"Hotel ubicado en pleno centro de Londres, a 2 minutos de Trafalgar Square, por lo que es perfecto para alguien que est√° en la ciudad por motivos de trabajo o para hacer turismo, ya que tienes a tiro de piedra todas las atracciones tur√≠sticas.
Habitaciones grandes y espaciosas con muy buenas vistas, al contrario de lo que esperas en Londres, donde muchas habitaciones suelen ser peque√±as. Otra cosa que se debe tener en cuenta, es que para cargar un tel√©fono M√≥vil o un iPad el hotel dispone de conectores USB en vez de tomas de corriente, por lo que en mi caso particular no fue necesario utilizar el adaptador de la toma de corriente.
El edificio en s√≠ es un edificio moderno y llamativo. Muy recomendable probar alguna vez para cenar el restaurante que hay en el hotel.",5,2017,11,07

125,Starting point perfetto,"L'albergo √® situato in una posizione magnifica per partire all'esplorazione del centro di Londra.
A due passi da Trafalgar Square, da covent Garden e da Piccadilly, st Martin lane stessa √® una bella via piena di ristoranti e negozi.
Essendo in centro Londra i prezzi non sono ovviamente a buon mercato, ma l'hotel √® moderno, recentemente ristrutturato, con bei bagni e belle docce. Arredamento forse fin troppo minimalista, ma molto funzionale anche nel riscaldamento, nelle prese con possibilit√† di ricaricare telefoni e tablet europei, e con wi fi potente e gratuito.
Ottima qualit√† del sonno!
Buona colazione e possibilit√† di mangiare sia di sera che a mezzogiorno (anche se personalmente consiglio di uscire vista l'offerta enorme per tutti i gusti nel raggio di cento metri al massimo).
Personale efficiente e gentile (presenti anche diversi italiani sia alla reception che in sala).
Un ringraziamento particolare a Roberto per la sua gentilezza e disponibilit√†.

125,Fantastisches Hotel in traumhafter Lage,"Wir waren 4 √úbernachtungen von Mittwoch bis Sonntag morgen in London im St. Martins Lane Hotel und haben das keine Sekunde bereut- das beste Hotel, das wir in London (6. Aufenthalt) je hatten :-)
Eine so zuvorkommende, relaxte, warmherzige Crew, so dass man sich vom ersten Moment einfach wie zuhause f√ºhlte - auch als Jeans-und Turnschuhtourist. Ein spitzenklasse Club mit leckeren Drinks am Abend, ein traumhaftes Fr√ºhst√ºck, klasse topmodern ausgestattete Zimmer (mit megabequemen Betten, was mir auch sehr wichtig ist), die einen echten Standard in London setzen. Die Lage ist zudem hervorragend, da man als Fu√üg√§nger mitten im Herzen aller Attraktionen ist und es einfach genie√üen kann - wir freuen uns schon auf eine Wiederholung! Seeeehr empfehlenswert!!",5,2017,10,02
125,Grossartiges Stadthotel,"Das Hotel liegt an sehr zentraler Lage. Alle wichtigen U-Bahn-Stadionen sind mit wenigen Minuten zu Fuss erreichbar. Die Zimmer sind f√ºr London-Verh√§ltnisse grossz√ºgig und sehr modern eingerichtet. Highlight f√ºr mich war, dass die Farbe des Hotelzimmer selbstst√§ndig festgelegt und ge√§ndert werden konnte. F√ºr einen Londontrip 100% zu empfehlen.",5,2017,09,04
125,La mejor ubicaci√≥n,"Los hoteles en Londres suelen ser peque√±os y este sin ser grande es lo suficientemente c√≥modo. La habitaci√≥n doble com√∫n es perfecta para dos personas con dos valijas grandes. La cama perfecta para descansar y con espacio debajo para dejar las valijas, un corredor con vestidor y un ba√±o grande.
La ubicaci√≥n es buen√≠sima, con un tube a un par de cuadras y la calle Strand a 3 cuadras, por donde pasan double decker hacia todos los destinos.
El personal muy amable, en especial los muy serviciales chicos vascos que trabajaban en la ma√±ana.
El desayuno en el restaurante Asia de Cuba sin desperdicio, sin dudas el mejor desayuno que he probado en un hotel.",5,2017,08,22
125,Buen hotel pero nada destacable,"Nos hospedamos en el hotel siguiendo las recomendaciones de Tripadvisor. A pesar de que el precio es bastante elevado, nos pareci√≥ que si la calidad era excelente, merec√≠a la pena pagarlo. Sinceramente, el hotel no es nada del otro mundo. Las habitaciones son correctas, la cama c√≥moda y el ba√±o moderno pero nada que justifique su elevad√≠simo precio y sus excelentes cr√≠ticas. El hotel est√° dise√±ado por Philippe Starck por lo que, al que le gusten sus dise√±os, podr√° apreciarlo m√°s. Su estilo me recuerda mucho al Hotel ME Reina Victoria de Madrid. En mi opini√≥n, no merece la pena pagar un sobreprecio por ello. En pr√≥ximas ocasiones, elegiremos otros alojamientos.",3,2017,06,20

Wir moegen die Hotelflure zwar nicht, denn sie erinnern uns immer an das Hotel im Film Shining, aber zugegeben die Zimmer sind angenehm und spannend designt, very modern. Ian Schrager sei Dank denken wir also vor allem eher ans Studio 54 in NYC anstatt an gentlemen s club mit brokattapete. schoen und zweckmaessiges Design also. Die Lage des Hotels im theatre district perfekt fuer das Royal Opera House, drei Minuten von der National Gallery, alle grossen Eventtheater nur einen Katzensprung entfernt. Die Umgebung des Hotels phantastisch und kosmopolitisch , sehr weltstaedtisch und berauschend und man faellt in die Mitte , wenn man aus der Hoteltuer komt. Personal hipp und jung, kritiklos. Bellservice fuer Koffer phantastisch, wir mussten uns um nichts kuemmern. Zur angegebenen Zeit waren unsere Koffer schon im Taxi.

Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet und man findet alles was man braucht.

125,Ottimo hotel,"Sono stato due volte in questo hotel in occasione di viaggi di lavoro. Si tratta di un ""boutique hotel"" in zona S.Martins/Trafalgar square. Stanze molto curate in termini di design, illuminotecnica e funzionalit√†. Il bagno √® splendido (cosa non tanto usuale in alcuni hotel di Londra), frigobar meraviglioso e prese usb disseminate per la stanza per ricaricare comodamente i device elettronici superando il problema della'adattatore. Servizio in camera molto affidabile, puntuale e di ottima qualit√†. Assaggiato un club sandwich tra i miglior che abbia mai provato. Wi-Fi preciso e potente. Il ristorante dell'hotel ha un'ottima immagine, ottimo servizio e una carta dei cibi moderna e accattivante. Il livello dei prezzi di ristorante ed hotel √® elevato, data la categoria dello stesso, l'effetto del tasso di cambio e la zona dove √® ubicato. Lo consiglio assolutamente.",4,2016,05,02

Perfecto poder disponer de un secador de verdad, y el detalle de una peque√±a botella de agua cada noche en la mesilla.

El desayuno suficiente, pero no se entiende que pagando el desayuno con la habitaci√≥n, sea la opci√≥n mas cara que los desayunos a la carta, ni que huevos y bacon sean considerados extras por los que hay que pagar 3.5 Libras.

Genial poder disponer de acceso al Gimnasio aleda√±o y el detalle de poder lavanderia para la ropa del gym.

125,"Lage ist super zentral, der Service eher m√§√üig...","Wir waren hier vergangene Woche, erst gesch√§ftlich dann privat. Die Lage des Hotels ist wirklich Spitze, wenige Gehminuten von Trafalgar Square und Big Ben etc. entfernt. Es ist ziemlich modern und sicher nicht jedermanns Geschmack. An der Rezeption muss man schon einige Zeit warten, aber das hielt sich bei uns in Grenzen, da wir recht fr√ºh angekommen sind, konnten wir unser Gep√§ck abgeben, aber noch nicht einchecken, was ok war. Freundlich ist allerdings etwas anders.
Zum Zimmer, ein normales Standard Double, ziemlich weiss und modern, interessantes Lichtkonzept, der Schlafraum l√§√üt sich beidseitig mit gro√üen T√ºren abtrennen (Flur und Bad). Die Klimaanlage ist allerdings wie so oft in Hotels zu kalt eingestellt, im Februar kaum 18 Grad. Man musste etwas l√§nger suchen, die Steuerung davon befand sich hinter einer diesen gro√üen T√ºren. Bad, nun ja. Nichts besonderes und viel zu kalt, die T√ºren von Toilette und Dusche schlie√üen nicht richtig und das Wasser lief heraus. Aber es war immer sehr sauber und das ist ja fast das Wichtigste. 
Gefr√ºhst√ºckt haben wir dort nicht, ca. 26 Pfund ist doch etwas happig. Abendessen sollte man reservieren, denn auch als Hotelgast bekommt man nicht immer einen Platz, schon gar nicht an einem Samstagabend. Etwas st√∂rend fanden wir die Damen am Restaurantempfang. Stehen zu dritt um den kleinen ""Tresen"" und quasseln was das Zeug h√§lt. Keiner schenkte uns Aufmerksamkeit, erst nach einigen Minuten wurden wir dann bemerkt, wurden gleich daraufhin gewiesen, dass bis 23 Uhr alles ausgebucht ist. Gn√§digerweise bekamen wir dann noch einen Tisch fast am Eingang. 
Auch da, man bestellt einen Cocktail und das Abendessen, bekommt den Cocktail und 3 Minuten sp√§ter die Vorspeise. Ein No go. Man sollte zumindest nachfragen, wann man mit der Vorspeise kommen kann. Das Essen war recht gut, eine Interessante Kombination, aber preislich auch im oberen Bereich angesetzt. Nun ja man kann sagen, das ist London, Gro√üstadt, da ist das eben so. Beurteilt man aber Preis Leistung, passt es nicht zusammen. 
Im Gro√üen und Ganzen kann man das Hotel empfehlen, von der Ausstattung und Ambiente ist es Geschmacksache.",3,2016,02,16

125,Sempre eccellente,"E‚Äô corretto recensire un albergo due volte? A distanza di un paio d‚Äôanni crediamo di s√¨. 
Il St Martin‚Äôs, malgrado il tempo passato, si conferma un albergo di altissima qualit√†. Camere ampie, belle e luminose rese ancora migliori del design, massima pulizia in stanza e nei servizi che, tra l‚Äôaltro, dispongono di uno spazioso box doccia, asciugamani di qualsiasi misura e accappatoi sempre immacolati e morbidissimi (in molti hotel anche di qualit√† sembrano invece carta di vetro) ne fanno una albergo di categoria superiore; di quelli - e sono davvero pochi - nei quali si torna volentieri in camera sapendo che tutto sar√† perfettamente pulito e a posto.
Il St Martin‚Äôs √© caro? S√¨, lo √©, ma il prezzo √© corrisposto dal servizio reso. Si tratta quindi certamente di soldi spesi bene.

Non si dimentichi, inoltre, che l‚Äôalbergo √© in posizione molto centrale e vicino a ‚Äútutto‚Äù. A piedi, in poco tempo, si arriva a Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, Abbazia di Westminster, Covent Garden, Buckingham Palace. Malgrado la sua centralit√† √© ubicato in una strada che, sia di giorno che la notte, √© assai tranquilla.

125,DECEPCIONANTE - DETALLES DE DISE√ëO NO COMPENSAN FALTAS IMPORTANTES,"Elegimos este hotel para alojarnos en Londres durante unas visitas a la opera.  En este respecto, est√° muy bien ubicado.  Pero (sobre todo teniendo en cuenta el elevado coste) nos defraud√≥ en muchos otros aspectos.

La habitaci√≥n era peque√±a. No hab√≠a donde poner las maletas. Curiosamente hab√≠a una mesa plegable para equipajes, pero no hab√≠a ning√∫n sitio donde colocarlo sin cerrar el paso por la habitaci√≥n.  Tampoco cab√≠an en el armario (que en realidad es un nicho con una cortina delante).  En realidad, no cab√≠a pr√°cticamente nada en el armario.

No hab√≠a mesillas de noche para colocar lo t√≠pico - alg√∫n libro, vaso de agua, tel√©fono.  Eso s√≠, detr√°s de la cama hab√≠a una repisa pero debido a la cabecera de la cama resultaba inaccesible.

Ahora s√≠, hab√≠a muchos toques de dise√±ador original, pero no compensaba para nada los fallos. Hab√≠a un pack de vibrador y condones del minibar, pero el mal aislamiento ac√∫stico que hab√≠a entre habitaciones no era muy indicado para su disfrute...

El desayuno, fatal.  A pesar de la cantidad de empleados andando por el comedor no nos hac√≠an ni caso.  Nos parec√≠a que habr√° una ausencia total de coordinaci√≥n.  Los d√≠as siguientes fuimos a desayunar en Starbucks enfrente (algo que normalmente odiar√≠a hacer, me niego a ser cliente de una empresa que no paga impuestos en ninguna parte).

Una de las noches √≠bamos a cenar en el restaurante (Cuba en Asia), pero nos pareci√≥ tan sumamente oscuro que nos marchamos a otro sitio.",2,2015,07,14

125,Wochenend Trip ins Westend,"Die Morgans Hotelgruppe bietet jedes Mal eine besondere Erfahrung. Obwohl sich die Hotels innerhalb der Gruppe aus meiner Sicht nun zu sehr einander angleichen, stechen diese immer noch aus der Hotelmasse Wohlwollend ab. Nach der j√ºngsten Renovierung zeigt sich das Hotel gut verbessert. Die Lobby, das Restaurant und der Barbereich wirken frisch. Es gibt nun sogar eine traditionell englische Kaminecke. W√ºrde mich interessieren wie lange die Diskussionen hier im Hotel gedauert hatten, um dies zu realisieren. Wir hatten ein Standard Zimmer das f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse extrem gro√ü war. Sauberkeit, design Orientierung (wei√ü dominiert) eine vorz√ºgliche Minibar und ein komfortables Bett sind bei dieser Hotelgruppe ohnehin Standard. Einzig h√§tte ich mir ein King anstatt eines Queen size Bettes gew√ºnscht. Die Lage ist unschlagbar: Mitten drin aber doch in einer ruhigen Seitenstra√üe; in den Zimmern ist kein Stra√üenl√§rm zu h√∂ren. Die bodentiefen Fenster bringen viel Licht in den Raum. Aber, bei Nacht muss man den Vorhang zuziehen, damit man nicht unfreiwillig den Passanten auf der Stra√üe ungewollte Einblicke gibt.Ein sehr gro√üer Fitnessclub gleich an der n√§chsten T√ºr ist kostenlos mit benutzbar.

In stanza era presente anche l'impianto audio bluetooth e tutti i dispositivi elettronici possono essere caricati con porta USB.

125,Zentrales Design-Hotel mit M√§ngeln,"Der absolut zentralen Lage und einigen netten Design-Gimmicks wie der variabel-steuerbaren LED-Beleuchtung √ºber dem Bett stehen ein nur bedingt gerechtfertigter hohe Preis, ein etwas laxer Umgang mit Kreditkarten und teilweisen Fehlplanungen gegen√ºber: So ist der Wasserhahn im Bad beispielsweise so knapp montiert, dass man bei Benutzung unweigerlich seine Handr√ºcken am Becken reiben muss, der gro√üz√ºgig-bemessenen Dusche fehlt leider das n√∂tige Gef√§lle um das Bad vor √úberflutungen zu sch√ºtzen, die Schwingt√ºr des Bades zum Gang l√§sst sich nicht vollst√§ndig schlie√üen ... 
Das betont jugendlich-attraktive Rezeptionspersonal ist freundlich, wenn auch sehr auf seine Coolness bedacht - sucht man exzeptionellen Service ist man in dem unweit entfernten Corinthia sicherlich besser bedient. Das Continental Fr√ºhst√ºcks B√ºffet ist √ºberschaubar, die Preise f√ºr etwaige √Ä la Carte Bestellungen wie English Breakfast, Lachs oder Waffeln sind gehoben. Positiv ist der kostenlose Zutritt zur benachbarten Gym-Box. Eine beeindruckende Aussicht sucht man (mit Ausnahme der Penthouse Suite) hier auch eher vergebens, sehr st√∂rend fand ich zudem die √§u√üerst hellh√∂rigen Zimmer: ich d√ºrfte einen Fluch mit angrenzenden Putzkammern haben.
Alles in allem lebt das Hotel in erster Linie von seiner zentralen Lage, der Substanz an sich sieht man sein Alter teilweise schon sehr deutlich an - die Klimaanlage br√§uchte zudem dringend ein Service in puncto Hausstaubmilbe und Feinjustierung: die Aufz√ºge waren deutlich √ºberheizt w√§hrend in den sehr dunklen, niedrigen Hotelfluren Eisesk√§lte herrschte.",3,2014,10,07

Zimmer Double double gebucht und ein Zimmer mit King-size Bett bekommen. Runter an die Rezeption und um 10.00 hatten wir unser gew√ºnschtes Zimmer. V√∂llig unkompliziert und schnell. Zimmer war sauber, Lichteffekte ein WOW und das Bad liess keine W√ºnsche offen.
Wer grossen wert auf Etikette legt wird wohl etwas entt√§uscht sein. Das doch sehr junge Team ist eher l√§ssig locker drauf, ohne jedoch die zu erwartende Freundlichkeit und Kompetenz zu vermissen. Den Stadtbus haben wir ebenfalls im Hotel gebucht und war etwa gleich teuer als wenn man ihn im Internet gebucht h√§tte. Auch da, schneller unkomplizierter Service.
Lage war f√ºr uns perfekt. 2 Min n√§chste Tube Station (Leicester Square), 2 Min bis Trafalgar Square, 5 Min Covent garden, 10 Min bis Picadilly Circus.
Amerikanisches Fr√ºhst√ºck (Steak, Pancakes etc.) nahmen wir nicht in Anspruch, das es f√ºr uns genug anderes hatte inkl. Toast, Fleisch frisches Obst (Erdbeeren, Ananas.....). Ein Highlight war sicher das Gym-Box das man als Gast in Anspruch nehmen darf. Beim n√§chsten Besuch in London werden wir bestimmt wieder das St.Martins Lane buchen!",5,2014,07,29
125,Camere stupende servizio eccellente:Perfetto !,"Splendide stanze  arredate con grande gusto ampie con bagno minimalista ma assolutamente funzionale ;servizio impeccabile 
Posizione poi eccellente 
Hotel fra i migliori in assoluto e non solo per Londra 
Imperdibile!",5,2014,07,28
125,Splendido e funzionale,"La struttura interna, con design volutamente minimalista, √© notevole.  
Le camere e la parte dei servizi, parecchio ampi per gli standard londinesi, sono molto funzionali. Grazie alle grandi finestre sono anche assai luminose. La pulizia √© impeccabile. Il mattino le camere vengono rassettate in modo perfetto. La sera vengono poi ""preparate"" per la notte con cambio di tutti gli asciugamani eventualmente usati durante la giornata. Da un punto di vista logistico vale la pena di rimarcare che il St Martins √© in pieno centro. Dista infatti 5 minuti a piedi da Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus e Covent Garden. Ancora qualche minuto e si arriva a Westminster e al Big Ben, da una parte, e Buckingham Palace dall'altra. La zona √© comunque assai tranquilla. La fermata del metro di Leicester Square, anche con collegamento diretto da e per Heathrow, dista non pi√π di 200-300 metri. 
In sostanza albergo davvero di molto superiore alla media e con servizi eccellenti.  In considerazione che, di solito, tutte le cose belle vengono fatte pagare, occorre dire che non √© propriamente a buon mercato, ma si tratta senza dubbio di soldi spesi bene.",5,2014,06,24
125,Philippe Starck non sbaglia!,"Hotel meraviglioso, situato a Covent Garden. Design impeccabile, camere stupende, spaziose rispetto alla media a Londra, interamente a vetrate.
Adatto a tutti i tipi di clientela, sempre vivo e frizzante. La sera sono aperti all'esterno il cocktail bar, cui merita fermarsi per un drink e i ristorante. 
Il personale √® molto gentile e sempre pronto a rispondere ad ogni esigenza.

125,"Ottima location, belle stanze. Servizio cos√¨ cos√¨","Sono stato diverse volte al St Martins Lane, dovendo andare per lavoro a Covent Garden.
La location √® semplicemente fantastica, in una delle zone pi√π belle di Londra.
Lo stile √® molto moderno, se vi piace il genere non rimarrete delusi. Le camere hanno tutte (credo) una bella doccia e vasca, oltre a prodotti per il bagno fantastici malin+goetz. Per essere in centro a Londra, sono discretamente spaziose e ovviamente pulitissime.
Non mi piace molto il servizio, poco coerente tra lo staff: alcune persone fin troppo servizievoli, tanto da risultare quasi fastidiose (ad esempio il cameriere della colazione), altre un po' arroganti, altre invece molto cordiali e simpatiche. Penso sia importante per un hotel di livello fornire un'esperienza coerente tra lo staff.",4,2014,05,17
125,Top location,"Seconda volta in questo hotel della catena Morgans della quale sono un assiduo frequentatore e devo riconoscere che l'hotel √® stato notevolmente implementato rispetto alla volta precedente ! La posizione √® il top per muoversi nella Londra che conta , ambiente cool e informale , dettagli di design notevole ma funzionale , insomma il top per un viaggio di affari o turismo ! Consigliato alla grande come del resto i suoi fratelli in giro per il mondo ! Check'em out !",5,2014,05,02
125,Posizione privilegiata,Questo hotel si trova in una posizione privilegiata per visitare la citt√† o per girarla se gi√† la conoscete. E' un hotel sicuramente trendy arredato dal design Philippe Stark. Il personale gentile ed efficiente le stanze minimali e pulite. Si puo' approfittare per assaggiare la cucina fusion del ristorante Asia de Cuba dalla bellissima atmosfera,4,2014,03,04
125,Ottima posizione e camere dall'architettura accattivante,"Sono stato al St Martins per un viaggio di affari: una sola notte e poi sono ripartito.

Ho trovato interessante il design nella reception.
La camera eccellente, direin interessante l'arrendamento e l'architettura interena.

La posizione √® eccellente (50 m da Trafalgar Square, in pratica  si √® nel puro centro della London da vivere, e a 10 min da westmister/embankement)

Servono una buona colazione (magari non proprio cheap).

Fortemente raccomandato.",4,2014,02,24
125,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Wir waren vor Weihnachten 2013 drei N√§chte im St Martin's Lane und sehr, sehr zufrieden. Die Lage neben Trafalgar Square und Leicester Square ist f√ºr Touristen super. Der Empfangsbereich hat Flair und ist - herrlich in London - modern und originell. Das Zimmer war klein, aber gut konzipiert. Ein vern√ºnftig ausschauendes Restaurant (in dem wir nicht gegessen haben) und eine Bar, die einem am WE bis 3am Drinks serviert, runden das Angebot ab. 

Wer schwere Teppiche, Pubs und das viktorianische Zeitalter toll findet, sollte nicht kommen. Der Rest wird sich vermutlich ganz wohl f√ºhlen.",5,2013,12,21
125,Ambiente Cool,"Molto bello. Forse √® un po' invecchiato. Arredamento originale. Camere comode e pulire. Letto strepitoso!
√à sicuramente un hotel Cool da visitare. 
Posizione decisamente molto buona.
Servizio ottimo e personale stupendo.
Da visitare quando si viene a Londra.

125,Mejor trato imposible,"La semana pasada estuve con mi marido en Londres y nos alojamos en este hotel.
En principio lo eleg√≠ por su bonita decoraci√≥n , su ubicaci√≥n ,y porque hab√≠a le√≠do que sus habitaciones eran c√≥modas ( buena cama y buena ducha) . Expectativas cumplidas.
Pero lo mejor fue ,el trato que recibimos por parte de dos personas que trabajan en este hotel.
Al enterarse de que √©ramos espa√±oles ,enseguida nos vinieron a saludar,y a prestarse para cualquier cosa que nos pudiera hacer falta. Luis no dudo un segundo en ayudarnos cuando le pedimos por favor que nos hiciera de int√©rprete con la recepci√≥n,pues al llegar a la habitaci√≥n vimos que no se pod√≠an mover las persianas a nuestro gusto. 
David por las ma√±anas era un cielo, pendiente de lo que pudi√©ramos necesitar, y de s√≠ todo estaba a nuestro gusto. Pero en general todos los camareros , fueron s√∫per amables, y esforz√°ndose por entenderse con nosotros.
El hotel nos ha encantado ,es c√≥modo, calentito, la cama genial ,s√∫per c√≥moda,la habitaci√≥n con vistas al coliseum, muy bonitas las luces de colores, y un punto a su favor es que la tele tuviera canal en espa√±ol.
No nos gust√≥ que se tuviera que pagar por el uso del wifi.
La noche del s√°bado cenamos en el hotel. Genial el restaurante Asia de Cuba, somos bastante exigentes ,nos gusta comer bien y hemos comido en los mejores restaurantes del mundo,y puedo decir que este restaurante es fant√°stico , estaba todo delicioso, y hab√≠a un ambiente espectacular,lleno a reventar ,y la gente en general a nuestro alrededor con muy buen humor y gente muy guapa.
Pero lo realmente genial ,fueron Luis y Aga. Como s√≠ nos conocieran de toda la la vida y estuvieran aconsejando a alguien de su familia. Luis nos coloc√≥ en una mesa fant√°stica y nos aconsejo divinamente cositas de la carta que estaban bueniiiisimas!!!!!,,,
Aga ,aunque no nos entend√≠amos por el idioma,se aprendi√≥ hasta unas palabras en espa√±ol para decirnos. Muy muy cari√±osa. Esa chica vale un mont√≥n.
Total, que yo nunca escribo despu√©s de estar en un hotel para contar cosas de el , pero que este hotel se lo merece a tope.
No dud√©is ni un segundo en elegirlo .Esta genial situado ,al lado de trafalgar square, y en coven graden ,que tiene un ambiente genial.
Un 10 rotundo
Gracias Luis ,Gracias David , Gracias Aga , por hacer nuestra estancia tan agradable
Volveremos!!!!,!!",5,2013,11,26

No estoy muy segura que pagase el precio de este hotel para una visita a la ciudad",3,2013,07,31
125,Design e modaiolo,"Hotel di design, minimale, total white con giochi di luce; ideale per chi ama il genere. Curato, pulito, bello il bar interno. Camere comfortevoli, cuscini e piumino divinamente comodi. Prezzi caruccio, ma nella media degli hotel firmati e di design. Buona la posizione. Personalmente Londra mi evoca altri stili ma qui si entra nel gusto personale ed esula dall'obiettivit√† della recensione!",4,2013,07,10
125,"Centrale e organizzato, ma troppo kitsch","Ho alloggiato qui una notte per lavoro. Il posto √® veramente centrale e questo √® sicuramente il suo pregio maggiore.
Ammetto che la scelta di arredarlo in modo dotalmente kitsch mi ha un po' spiazzato, specialmente per un 5 stelle. Se per√≤ la hall ancora ha un suo senso, la stanza √® arredata in modo minimalista, con solo alcuni stravolgimenti secondo me un po' sensa senzo.
Il personale √® carino, ma non molto organizzato, mi hanno fatto aspettare 30 minuti per fare il check-in perch√© chi aveva prenotato a mio nome aveva sbagliato una lettera del cognome. Possibile che la receptionist (che fa un lavoro solo nella sua vita) non si sia ingegnata a cercare altre persone con un cognome simile che dovessero fare il check-in in quel giorno? Voglio dire, cambiava solo una lettera (e non era la prima, quindi...).
La stanza √® molto pulita, con vari confort e anche una luce multicolore da usare secondo il proprio umore. E' forse solo un po' piccola e la Wi-Fi e √® pagamento (10¬£ al giorno, non poco, per√≤ almeno funziona molto bene, anche se con al massimo 3 dispositivi diversi).
Non ho provato la colazione, ma nel buffet di lavoro che ci hanno servito il cibo era buono.",3,2013,06,29

Il St. Martins √® situato nel West End di Londra a 2 min. a piedi dalla meravigliosa National Gallery (totalmente gratuita) in Trafalgar Square e a 5 min. a piedi da Covent Garden e con numerose stazioni della metro nelle vicinanze (Leicester square, Covent garden, Trafalgar, ecc.). Dall'Hotel a piedi √® possibile raggiungere quasi tutte le attrazioni pi√π rinomate, da quelle  storico-culturali (Westminster, White Hall, House of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, ecc.) a quelle pi√π venali dello shopping in Regent Street, Oxford street, New Oxford street e Bond street, ecc. 
Ci ritorneremo sicuramente!",5,2013,04,08
125,Il mio hotel preferito a Londra,"√à il mio hotel preferito a Londra, quando posso permettermelo, perch√© a volte i prezzi sono davvero stellari e opto malvolentieri per un hotel pi√π economico.

Inconfondibile stile Morgans Group, che dopo anni non mi ha stancato, sono aficionado anche del loro Shore Club a Miami Beach, nonostante le camere mediamente piccole l' atmosfera molto particolare lo fa amare.

Fondamentale √® anche la posizione, comodissima per tutti i teatri, all' uscita dei quali gli altri pazientano a lungo per un taxi, mentre io mi faccio solo una breve passeggiata. Altrettanto importante la vicinanza alla Piccadilly Line, per Heathrow ci vuole quasi un' ora, ma a pochi soldi, senza stress da traffico, senza paura di perdere l' aereo, senza cambi. Se non si ha una valigia pesante il costoso taxi √® superfluo, tanto quanto l' altrettanto costoso Heathrow Express, ovviamente evitando le rush hours in cui non trovereste posto a sedere.

Le camere pi√π piccole sono appunto un po' piccole, spendendo naturalmente il problema si risolve, sono comunque tutte molto belle, con i letti fantastici, √® difficile trovarne di cos√¨ comodi.

Al ristorante Asia de Cuba non vado da anni, √® piuttosto caro, ma √® anche una bella esperienza in tutti i sensi, che va fatta almeno una volta. Per la colazione opto per una vicina pasticceria francese, che mi permette di non infliggermi il classico breakfast inglese. Al St Martins Lane si sente pi√π che in altri posti quanto Londra sia cosmopolita e quindi vive le croissant.",5,2013,04,07
125,"Gutes Hotel aber ""Function follows Form""","Tolles Hotel in guter Lage.

Das einzige was mich verwirrt hat waren die Zimmer, da hat man das Gef√ºhl Design ist wichtiger als Funktionalit√§t.
Das Hotelzimmer hatte keine T√ºr zwischen dem Bad und dem Gang. Der Wasserhahn hat einen so komischen winkel dass man kaum an das Wasser kommt.
Der Schreibtisch ist total d√ºnn und ist beleuchtet, dazu sieht man aber h√§ssliche Kabel am Boden.
Die T√ºr zum Bad hat ein equivalent auf der anderen Seite im Zimmer, damit es symmetrisch ist, hat aber keine Funktion.

La camera dove ho soggiornato era la 505 (cercate questa camera se decidete un soggiorno ) : uno studio nell'angolo della strada principale (che da il nome alla hotel ) e con vista dal quinto piano su trafalgar square con 5 vetrate . Uno spettacolo che varr√† il prezzo elevato , e che vi far√† dimenticare le consuete mancanze di hotel di questo livello (wifi a pagamento , colazione non inclusa , prodotti di bellezza a pagamento ). La posizione √© il secondo punto di forza : dietro convent garden , a 100 metri da trafalgar , a 2 min dalla metro , a 5 min da picadilly e soho . Insomma , in mezzo al centro di Londra .

L'hotel e moderno e piacevole ma per un 5 stelle mi pare che abbia alcune carenze.
La nostra camera che aveva una vista meravigliosa presentava varie macchie sulla moquette come erano macchiate anche la piastrelle del bagno
Il benvenuto per gli ospiti era inesistente
Una nota molto negativa e' presentata dalla colazione veramente molto scarsa e presentata con poco garbo
Gli yogurt erano confezionati il pane mancava e nessuno si preoccupava di aggiungere come le marmellate
Le uova al bacon ordinate alla carta erano pessime
Al buffet non erano presenti le bottiglie di acqua se le volevi le dovevi pagare a parte in una colazione che ti costa 30 euro penso che sia eccessivo....

125,Hotel dove ti senti coccolato,"Sono stato la prima volta per caso con la mia compagna: esperienza fantastica! dal momento dell'arrivo, alla cena in un ambiente accogliente ma contemporaneamente minimalista, alla camera.

Tornato con tutta la famiglia: i bambini coccolati come non mai, accompagnati dal servizio d'ordine in tour per gli ambienti riservati. Camere comunicanti fantastiche!!

Ottima cantina di vini, completezza del menu anche a colozione.
Discoteca e bar con accesso solo da persone super selezionate.

Assolutamente da consigliare per qualsiasi tipologia di viaggio: di lavoro, di coppia, in famiglia, da solo. Il personale √® in grado di comportarsi in maniera molto professionale in qualsiasi situazione.

Arrivato con mi hanno proposto un 'upgrade' ad una stanza.
Mi hanno indicato il prezzo di 'differenza' ommettendo di dire che si trattava di un incremento al giorno tasse escluse.

Il resto √® semplicemente magnifico.
Ristorante di livello e molto ben frequentato. Fuori trovi tutto a 5metri. Da Starbuks a Prete a Manger.... insomma.... bella esperienza.

125,Not too bad,"Das St. Martins Lane Hotel ist ein typisches Designhotel wie sie es inzwischen in jeder Metropole gibt, was zu Lasten des Charakters geht.

Die Lage ist f√ºr Musicalinteressierte ideal, was mir als Opernfreund keinen Vorteil brachte. Daf√ºr befindet sich der Trafalgar Square mit National Gallery und National Portrait Gallery ebenfalls nur einen Steinwurf weit entfernt, so dass auch der kulturbegeisterte Londonbesucher einen wichtigen Teil des unglaublich gro√üen Angebotes der Stadt vor der Hotelt√ºre hat. 

Das Penthouse Apartment ist im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Zimmern des Hauses sehr ger√§umig, bietet einen sehr sch√∂nen Ausblick und ist ansprechend zeitgen√∂ssisch eingerichtet. Einzig die Ger√§uschisolierung k√∂nnte besser sein. Mit ein wenig Verhandlungsgschick lassen sich je nach Dauer des Aufenthaltes deutlich g√ºnstigere Raten verhandeln.

Das Personal ist so jung und hip wie das Design, was auch bedeutet, dass es hier und da an Kompetenz, Aufmerksamkeit und Freundlichkeit mangelt. Die

Das Restaurant ist f√ºr britische Verh√§ltnisse ordentlich, jedoch verpasst man nichts, wenn man es nicht aufsucht.

ich w√ºrde wieder kommen, auch wenn es f√ºr mich eher ein gutes 4 Sterne Hotel ist im Vergleich mit Deutschland. Vielleicht bin ich aber auch etwas ungerecht, weil ich mit  f√ºnf Sternen eher Hotels wie z.B. das  Sofitel, Ritz in Verbindung bringe.
London ist halt teuer, aber wunder sch√∂n und das Hotel war eine gute Wahl.Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber. Adapter im Zimmer vorhanden.",5,2012,05,06
125,Migliore in assoluto!,"Questo e uno dei miei hotel preferiti.La posizione e ottima-in mezzo a Covent Garden e giusto dietro il Traffalgar Sq.,poi al Piccadilly Cc a piedi si arriva in 5 minuti.

125,Il meglio in centro a londra,"Ottima la posizione: da li' si arriva dovunque a piedi o in autobus. L'hotel di Philippe Stark e' come tutte le sue creazione molto minimalista, ma ha proprio tutto, nei bagni ci sono addirittura spazzolino, rasoio etc. Le camere sono piccole ma veramente carine. I letti comodissimi. Ho fatto solo colazione ed era fantaastica. Il ristorante "" asia de cuba"" mi ha ricordato quello omonimo di N.Y. Per chi va come me  spesso a Londra   per lavoro e' proprio Il posto ideale per....coccolarsi.",5,2012,03,30
125,Ottima soluzione per un viaggio di lavoro,"personale cortese e a disposizione in ogni momento. Hotel minimale (tipico di starck) ma assolutamente funzionale.

125,Hotel perfetto per vivere una Londra magica...,"Tipo di soggiorno: Business
Ho soggiornato 2 giorni presso questa struttura per alcuni meeting a londra. Avevo prenotato una standard ma mi √® stata upgradata a una junior suite, ottimo inizio!
Punti di forza:
- Posizione centralissima a pochi passi da Covent Garden e Piccadilly
- Camere molto curate e altamente tecnologiche, il bianco √® il colore predominante
- Ottimo servizio, doppia pulizia giornaliera
- Fantastico ristorante fusion Asia de Cuba, ottimo locale per aperitivi e disco vip nella stessa struttura
Punti di miglioramento:
- Un po' caro, soprattutto gli extra del minibar
- Poca intimit√† visto che le pareti verso l'esterno sono vetrate
In conclusione √® un'ottima scelta per vivere a pieno la magica atmosfera di Londra",5,2012,03,09
125,Lo excepcional tiene su precio...,"El hotel es una maravilla, tranquilo, c√©ntrico (desde la habitaci√≥n se ve√≠a Trafalgar Square), a pocos metros de una estaci√≥n de metro y con un buen servicio.

Lo bueno... se paga; el precio, aunque alto creo que puede estar justificado por ser un hotel en pleno centro de Londres y de muy ata calidad.

Si te lo puedes permitir, sin dudarlo. (ojo con las ofertas de su p√°gina web; por ejemplo, ofrec√≠a desayuno, exquisito, y Wifi incluido, que... merec√≠a la pena)",4,2012,03,02

125,"Spannend, aber vielleicht nicht f√ºr jeden interessant",Nach zahllosen √úbernachtungen in anderen Hotels wollte ich f√ºr ein Wochenende in London mal etwas probieren. Da bekam ich den Tipp f√ºr das St. Martins Lane Hotel - und es ist echt etwas anderes. Im Erdgeschoss wirkt es eher wie ein Club - mit lauter durchgestylten Besuchern der Bar und des Restaurants. Alles in weiss - dieser Trend setzt sich auch in den Zimmern fort - alles weiss - und leider wieder sehr klein (eigentlich zu klein f√ºr den Preis ... wie vieles in London). Die Lage in der St. Martins Lane ist super - man kann ohne gro√üe Wege zu allen Zielen in der Innenstadt zu Fu√ü gehen und es gibt diverse echt nette Pubs in unmittelbarer N√§he. Mein pers√∂nlicher Tipp: einer der Hausregenschirme - eine super Erinnerung an ein etwas anderes Hotel.,4,2011,02,04

125,Giovane e frizzante Hotel di Design,"Siamo abituali clienti dell'hotel durante le nostre permanenze a Londra. La nostra scelta √® data sia dall'eccellente posizione dell'hotel rispetto alle principali aree di interesse londinesi sia dal servizio immancabilmente impeccabile dei morgans hotel. Abbiamo soggiornato sia nelle garden che nelle standard rooms. Entrambe le camere sono spaziosissime (cosa rarissima a Londra); la pulizia, l'accuratezza dei particolari e il design bianco immacolato rende il St martens unico nel suo genere! Le garden rooms sono situate al primo piano, sopra il light bar quindi, le pi√π disturbate nel fine settimana in occasione di serate con musica. Il ristorante Asia de Cuba √® una vera delizia del palato ma non certo economico.

Die Bar ist sogar unter der Woche gutbesetzt. Wer wegen des Shoppings nach London kommt, ist mit diesem Hotel auch gut bedient. Picadilly mit dem Anfang der Regent Street ist ca. in 3 Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen.",5,2010,12,27
125,Mein Lieblingshotel in London,"Das ST Martins Lane ist mein absolutes Lieblingshotel in London. Die Zimmer sind zwar nicht besonders ger√§umig, bieten jedoch genug Platz bei einem kurzen St√§dteurlaub. Das Design (komplett wei√ü und sehr geradlinig) spricht mich sehr an. Insbesondere das Badezimmer ist super.
Die Lage ist hervorragend, nur wenige Minuten von Covent Garden entfernt.
Fr√ºhst√ºck im Asia de Cuba ist super.
Ich war bislang bereits ca 5 mal im St Martins Lane, bislang war es immer gleich super, sehr freundliches Personal etc. Nur letztes Mal war dies anders: Unsere Klimaanlage funktionierte nciht und trotz mehrerer Nachfraen bei der Rezeption schein man es einen halben Tag lang nciht der M√ºhe wert zu befinden, der Sache nachzugehen. Erst als mein Mann langsam ungeduldig und ungehalten wurde, wurden wir in ein anderes Zimmer umquartiert - jedoch keine Entschuldigung in Form eines upgrades oder √§hnliches. Wir waren zun√§chst sehr entt√§uscht. Einige Wochen sp√§ter erhielten wir jedoch ein Feedback auf unseren Fragebogen und eine pers√∂nliche R√ºckmeldung der Hotelmanagerin, die sich f√ºr die Unanehmlichkeiten entschuldigte. Nichtsdestortrotz blieb ein kleiner negativer Beigeschmack und man fragt sich, warum die L√∂sung dieses Problems in einem Hotel dieser Preisklasse nicht sofort anstandslos funktioniert hat. Insbesondere w√ºrde man sich als Stammgast erwarten, dass das ohne Probleme funktioniert und nicht stundenlange Diskussionen erforderlich sind.
Anzumerken ist weiters, dass die Zimmerkategorien mehr als verwirrend sind - so zum Beispiel verf√ºgen einige Deluxe Zimmer √ºber eine Badewanne, die n√§chstteurere Kategorie jedoch wiederum nicht, was bei mir ebenfalls bereits einmal zu einer Entt√§uschung gef√ºhrt hat. DIe Zimmer in den unteren Stockwerken k√∂nnen aufgrund zur N√§he zur Hotelbar recht laut sein in der Nacht.
weiters zu bem√§ngeln: kein GratisWIFI
Alles in allem jedoch nach wie vor mein Lieblingshotel in London!",4,2010,12,03

125,Zu viel L√§rm um nichts,"Vielleicht ist es das Dilemma mit Designhotels: entweder man mag das Design oder nicht. Ich fand es eher ungem√ºtlich, die Fahrst√ºhle waren dunkel, laufend liefen auf kleinen Bildschirmen komische Videoclips, alles sehr 90er Jahre. Die Zimmer waren klein wie Karnickelbuchten, die Lichtschalter undurchschaubar - und die Toilette ein R√§tsel.

125,Cuando el dise√±o se transforma en sencillez!,"Ubicaci√≥n muy buena, a dos pasos de Picadilly Circus, metro muy cercana y comoda para ir al aeropuerto (es la misma Picadilly line que llega a Heatrow). Restaurantes , tiendas (Covent Graden‚Äôs ) y bares al alcance. 
La entrada es espectacular, un dise√±o de lineas limpias, paredes blancas, la decoraci√≥n pone un toque de color‚Ä¶ sof√° y tamburetes muy modernos acojen los turistas (fantasticas la piezaz de ajedr√©z gigantes). El personal es muy amable. Las habitaciones est√°ndar son de un tama√±o bastante reducido, pero la cama es muy comoda (por fin buenos colchones!), hay una serie de almohadas puestas de distintas textura (y esto tambi√©n es bueno para poder descansar y elegir lo que mejor nos va), el ba√±o tiene dimensiones normales, la ducha es muy grande. En la habitaci√≥n todo es blanco, el color verde fosforito solo decora el interno de un arco de la pared que separa la entrada de la cama. Hay un mueble lacado blanco donde se esconde Tv de plasma, dvd‚Ä¶nevera ‚Ä¶, se a√±ade a todo una mesa de trabajo de marmol con luz debajo para iluminar.
As√≠ que bueno‚Ä¶.dise√±o de buena calidad‚Ä¶pero sencillo! Los amenitis son de una conocida marca de cosmetica natural, en la habitaci√≥n hay un lector con altavoces para el iPod.
Lo que no me ha gustado: el secador de pelo lo tienen ‚Äúescondido‚Äù dentro de un caj√≥n, en el armario empotrado de la entrada‚Ä¶ y despu√©s de ducharme entend√≠ el por qu√©: el agua inunda literalmente el ba√±o cuando te duchas, aunqu√© tengan mampara‚Ä¶as√≠ que la unica manera de no morir electrocutada es secarse el pelo en la habitaci√≥n‚Ä¶ donde hay enchufes (no hay ni uno en el ba√±o!) lejano del espejo‚Ä¶

125,"Ottima qualit√†, il prezzo certo non √® a buon mercato","Location:
L'hotel √® situato in prossimit√† di Trafalgar square a due passi dal Covent Garden e Leicester Square. Quindi ottimo se si vuole andare a Teatro, per esempio. Ma in pratica √® vicino a tutto.

Struttura:
La struttura √® uno stabile sito nella stretta St Martins Lane, rinnovato con un desgin molto accattivante: la reception √® disseminata di arredi un po' design e un po' retr√≤ (c'√® un sofa molto bello e delle seggiole a forma di pedine degli scacchi). Ci sono due ampi ascensori, con monitore e musica diffusa molto di tendenza. i corridoi sono lunghi, un po' bui e (volutamente) asettici com moquette, davanti alle camere la moquette ha colo verde o arancione, simulando un tappetino, sopra la quale √® riportato il numero di camera.

Camere:
tutte bianche. vetri a tutta parete. letto con luci dietro la spallier che si possono modificare a seconda dell'atmosfera che si vuole creare. Il bagno ha colori molto caldi con ceramiche color beige/ocra, doccia molto ampia e ammenicoli di varia natura. La televisione e in un mobile che bisogna aprire c'√® il DVD e la docking per Ipod. Forse il letto queen √® un po' piccolo se ci si dorme in due, specie per me che sono un po' un robusto.  L'armadio √® muro, chiuso unicamente da una tenda. Molto particolare

Amenities. 
C'√® di tutto, anche i profilattici. Non aggiungo altro. Per√≤ √® tutto molto caro. Evitare.

Colazione, Bar e ristoranti
Colazione eccellente, c'√® di tutto, specialmente sono da menzionare i danish pastries con la frutta fresca, i succhi di frutta, yogurt. Il ristorante  √® in stile asian fusion. Per chi ama la cucina senz'altro √® ottimo. A pranzo offrono dei box, dove si sono diversi assaggini di piatti (noodles, spring rollls, pollo o pesce fatto in qualche modo speciale, ecc). Il bar √® molto trendy ed √® molto con una bella atmosfera e ottimi cocktails, forse chiude un po' presto. Nota generale √® tutto abbastanza caro, anche se la qualit√† lo giustifica.

Staff.
Gentili a cooperativi, forse un po' spocchiosi, tipico di alcuni hotel trendy/design. Al ristorante o a colazione il personale si √® mostrato efficiente e cordiale.

Pollice su: design delle camere e la colazione
Pollice giu: i servizi sono un po' cari (colazione, ristorante, amenties)",4,2010,02,13

125,Semplicemente magnifico,"Il mio fidanzato ed io abbiamo trascorso il Capodanno 2008 a Londra e abbiamo scelto hotel. Non ce ne siamo pentiti. La mano di Philippe Starck √® evidente sin da subito e sar√† certamente gradita a chi apprezza un arredamento moderno e minimalista originale e non esasperato. Il personale √® molto disponibile e gentile. La nostra stanza aveva persino un piccolo giardino (sebbene il periodo non abbia consentito di poterne approfittare) ed era spaziosa, pulitissima e splendidamente arredata in bianco. La testata del letto aveva una luce il cui colore era modificabile ""in base all'umore""; la doccia ampia, l'armadio spazioso, fortunatamente avevo con me l'iPod perch√® a disposizione dei clienti ci sono le casse. Il ristorante dell'hotel, l' Asia de Cuba, √® stato una bella sorpresa (l'abbiamo provato a cena il 31), cos√¨ come lo splendido Light Bar. Forse vi sembrer√† perennemente di essere in un locale chic, con musica lounge onnipresente ovunque, ma a noi non ha dato fastidio, anzi. L'unico ""vincolo"" √® che √® pi√π adatto ad una clientela giovane (non ricordo di aver visto famiglie con bambini o coppie di nonni) ma a parte questo, e considerando la magnifica posizione nel cuore di Covent Garden (a due passi da Trafalgar Square, dai teatri, dai negozi e ristoranti della zona; la stazione di Leicester Square √® a un minuto a piedi verso Charing Cross) lo consiglio vivamente!",5,2009,03,16
125,Los detalles de las habitaciones son sensacionales.,"Este es un hotel de dise√±o de arriba a abajo. En la puerta ni siquiera pone que es un hotel, de hecho mas bien parece un Club. El hall tampoco parece la recepci√≥n de un hotel, por cierto, el restaurante con cocina fusi√≥n Thai-Cuba es una pasada.

Los ascensores tiene musica chill-out y estan ilumninados unicamente por la luz de unas pantallas planas que muestran videos relajantes. Los pasillos estan muy bien acondicionados para aislar el ruido, pero lo mejor son las habitaciones.

Me qued√® en la 634 en la √∫ltima planta.
La habitaci√≥n es un gran cubo blanco en el que una de las paredes es toda de cristal y da al exterior. Hay varias luces que se pueden atenuar para crear diferentes ambientes. La mesa es de marmol artificial y se ilumina junto con las luces relajantes de la cama, en las que se puede cambiar la gama de colores.

En definitiva, las habitaciones estan llenas de detalles, el mejor, la base JBL para escuchar musica con tu Ipod.

El √∫nico inconveniente fue la conexi√≥n a internet, que primero no funcionaba y luego era muy lenta. A pesar de esto, el personal del hotel se volc√≥ para ayudarme y al final ni siquiera me cobraron el servicio de internet.

Un hotel muy recomendable.",4,2008,11,13
