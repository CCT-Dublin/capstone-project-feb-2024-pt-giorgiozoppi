139,Great venue. Service not good enough and dampens experience.,"There were some great elements to our stay. The decor is really cool and the food in the Joia restaurant was outstanding, the steak as part of the chefs menu was the highlight. The rooftop pool is a great space with awesome views of the power station. Service from the hotel staff needs improving, I felt staff were uninterested and I had to chase several time when I needed something. I think for the price and star rating the service needs to be improved. One other small thing hi high was frustrating was the lack of iron and ironing board in the room.",3,2024,10,20
139,Hotel perfection,"Excellent hotel and such a new vibrant area of Battersea! The tube station is steps away, the bus just as convenient. The mall at Battersea Power Station itself had lots of shops and places to eat and the businesses around the hotel was amazing and so convenient.The staff was professional, quick to address any requests, you just have to ask, don't be shy, they really want to make your stay perfect. Room was clean, spacious and plenty of space to store our clothes. Bathroom, toiletries, robes (too small but they gladly brought us larger size after asking), everything was great, just wish they had a towel warmer in the bathroom. The heated infinity pool / hot tub was AMAZING with a priceless view of the Power Station. Loved our stay and would definitely return.",5,2023,05,09
139,Will now become our hotel of choice in London,"First time at the hotel and this will now become our destination of choice in London. From the immediate welcome from the concierge to the check in process to the genuine wishes of enjoying our stay, everything was first class. The area is vibrant and the whole atmosphere in and around the hotel is infectious. Please keep this up as you get more established and busier. A special mention for Jermaine who checked us in. He was excellent and a credit to your brand.",5,2024,10,20
139,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"A wonderful hotel with fantastic staff. The hotel is bright and modern. The location is perfect with Battersea Power Station literally on your step with the vast array of shops, restaurants and bars. The tube station is a 5 minute walk away.  The hotel has an amazing rooftop bar and pool plus an excellent restaurant. I  would highly recommend this hotel ! I have stayed many times before and will continue to return again.",5,2024,10,19
139,Our October 24 stay,"I liked the rooms.Mukarami and Jermaine has been wonderful to us.
I wasn‚Äôt so sure about room service. It was limited.
I liked the location as well. The door man was also very helpful.( the French guy)
The room cleaning can also be better.
But overall will recommend to everyone.",5,2024,10,17
139,Great experience,"Lovely modern Hotel, comfy bed & nice and quiet room too.  Loved the rooftop heated pool, fantastic views. Staff were really friendly & helpful. If you love to shop then this Hotel is perfect for you as it‚Äôs right opposite Battersea Power-station shopping centre.  Lots of nice walks by the river too.",5,2024,10,17
139,Believe the reviews that say service is poor.,"It‚Äôs such a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù stay. Style over substance. 
Location isn‚Äôt great but we have friends who stay on Northern Line so we opted to stay here sacrificing location for what we expected to be a fab stay. 

Rooms are lovely and clean. That is a positive.  Staff however are miserable and not very helpful. 

Save your money and stay somewhere less swanky with better service. 

Reception staff are miserable. No one says hello.  Staff are snobby and curt when you‚Äôre asking for help. No offers at reception to help to room with bags or recommendations for local area etc. it‚Äôs all very transactional. 

Seriously, save your money and stay somewhere that is friendlier.",2,2024,10,15
139,Awesome,Jermaine we appreciate your help this weekend! You was awesome! We will be back! Art otel hotel was beatiful and clean. The battersea area had plenty of places to eat and shopping. I love the Zara store here. It was very big! London owe us nothing !,5,2024,10,13
139,Average,"We did not have an awful stay at this hotel. The rooms are clean, great toiletries and of a reasonable size. The beds are average and the pillows are awful. We stay in a lot of hotels and it‚Äôs something we really appreciate but may sound petty to others. The other issue is that the rooms are very warm. Air con is noisy but ineffective. The rooms are very quiet and we were not disturbed at all by other guests. 
When ringing the front desk you sometimes have to try several times to get through to anyone. 
Concierge service is limited and not particularly responsive. 
The bar on the roof is nice. Slow service but good drinks menu. 
For the price point, based on other London hotels, it‚Äôs reasonable.",3,2024,10,05
139,Amazing,Jermaine was the best . He took care of my reservation and noted it was my birthday and went above and beyond for me and my friends to enjoy the stay . Beautiful pool and breakfast was really good . We will be coming back soon. Thank you Jermaine..,5,2024,09,29
139,Best staff in London,"I've been staying here since it opened and I've never had a bad stay yet.

 The rooms are lovely and spacious, the beds are large (like most Radisson properties they're quite hard but I like that). The rooms are well appointed with everything you need. 

The Tozi cafe for breakfast is excellent with a good selection of food that always feels freshly done. 

The Sauna and Steam room are lovely but hidden away in the basement with the gym. The lockers in the changing rooms I couldn't get to work but that's a small issue. 

The star of the show is obviously the rooftop bar and pool. The small Spanish style plates on the roof was excellent and it's a great place to meet a couple of mates in the evening during summer. The pool being open late is great as I love to relax there later in the evening.

Would also love to say a huge thanks to Justine on the front desk, she's absolutely amazing and is one of the reasons I keep coming back. Nothings ever too much bother and she's always got a smile on her face!

Also thanks to Jennifer for my welcome back gifts!

Will definitely be back, again and again.",5,2024,09,27
139,Better than your average Radisson,Great location if you want to be in the Battersea Power Station Development.  Good size room that was very clean. Great espresso machine.

139,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights with our two dogs and the hotel couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating. We were so well looked after by Mukaram on reception - nothing was too much trouble and he really went that extra mile. He‚Äôs a real asset and ambassador for the hotel. The room service was excellent, roof top pool gorgeous and the location is spot on for shopping. Beds were super comfy too. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,09,21
139,Perfect stay,"What a fabulous experience! Me and my son stayed for 3 nights and had the most fantastic time. We paid extra for a room with floor to ceiling windows on 10th floor and the room was amazing! Comfortable beds, everything was spotlessly clean, housekeeping were quick on the ball when we ran  out of toilet paper. Breakfast was great, too, lots to choose from. Staff were faultless, very professional and helpful. The area around the hotel is fabulous as well, with the Battersea Power Station on its doorstep. The heated rooftop infinity pool was such a nice bonus, with spectacular views. Would definitely stay again.",5,2024,09,20
139,A great vibe,"We cannot fault Art‚Äôotel, we stayed for 10 nights and it was fantastic. We will always stay there when we are in London from now on. 
Such a great location with a very easy to use new Underground station or you can take the Uber boat along the Thames. 
Lovely to do the river walk to Battersea park (about 8 mins) or the easy walk over the Bridge to Chelsea. Also heaps of  food options with good restaurants, cafes and a Marks & Spencer‚Äôs food store.  It was incredible to take in the views of London from the rooftop hot spa and the warm pool. Our room was great with a super comfortable bed and was also very quiet. 
But what made our stay extra special were the amazing staff who were incredibly welcoming and friendly. 
A special shoutout to Justine the reception manager. We had a long flight from Australia and she was so helpful arranging an early checkin. Justine was so hospitable, professional and made us feel very comfortable and right at home. 
Thanks Justine for making our stay special.
There is a great vibe at Art‚Äôotel Battersea and we highly recommend it.",5,2024,09,19
139,Daughters 18th birthday gift,"Kelvin Tanya & Prashi were absolutely amazing staff. Treated us like family. They went  the extra mile to make it the best 18th birthday for my daughter Sophia Grace. The spa team was fantastic, kind and so helpful. It will be one of our fondest memories, just being together for our 1st mother daughter spa weekend. It was the greatest gift I could give her was my time. AND the coolest music vibe,  hotel restaurants spa  and shopping. Everything you could want in one place. Art‚Äôotel",5,2024,09,18
139,Perfect Night,"Had a perfect nights stay , everything was fantastic.
Location is ideal , close to tube and yards from the power station.

Everything thing in room worked perfectly, safe, tv, really good air conditioning, fridge , lovely shower , coffee pod machine, hairdryer, clothes steamer , safe and the control panel for lights and aircon was really easy .
We had a  room on floor 2 with a view of the dogs home and railway , very interesting and no noise whatsoever.
The rooftop infinity pool has great views of the power station and across London, especially good at night . No need to use lift 109 .
Rooftop bar was great , pre dinner drinks in the autumn sunshine perfect ( that word again!)
All staff were helpful and courteous but never intrusive.
We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel as the power station has so many options but I‚Äôm sure that would have been lovely too.
Can‚Äôt recommend highly enough.",5,2024,09,18
139,Exceptional Hospitality and Beautiful Atmosphere,"We had a wonderful experience at this hotel! From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming.

139,Good service,"I had a wonderful time at the art hotel thanks to Sam and Ahmed who were incredibly welcoming and polite. I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to everyone I know.

Such a great experience overall",5,2024,08,27
139,The roof top pool is just the icing,"2nd visit..still impressed. 

We opted for a skyline view .. thinking we would see the iconic London attractions.. just a London skyline.

139,"Quirky luxury, amazing views and perfect location.","Amazing hotel in a fabulous area. Luxurious, quirky decor, immaculate rooms and great showers and what an amazing location. A bit pricy given the small rooms and the staff at the rooftop pool were the only bum note - could be more attentive (refused to get us robes, didn‚Äôt offer drinks, stood around chatting with each other at the bar most of the time while people were asking for stuff, generally a bit disinterested compared to the enthusiastic reception staff).",5,2024,08,23

139,Wonderful hotel in the heart of the new Battersea Power station area.,New hotel in the Battersea power station area with fantastic views across London from higher floors. We were on level 13 and was fantastic to watch the trains and life at the Battersea Dog and Cat. Good size rooms and the view from the pool is amazing. We arrived early flight and the team were fantastic to arrange early check in and very friendly service. Everything you need is close by with plenty of restaurants close by and the Northern line station gets you to London easily. Can walk across the bridge and are quickly in Chelsea and Sloan square for other tube links. And Battersea Park overland station around corner as well with links to Victoria or as we found quick ride out to Richmond. And then of course you have the power station it‚Äôs self which is amazing with its river side grassed area where can just sit and relax away from the busy tourist areas.,5,2024,08,17

139,"Short stay, expensive drinks","Cool hotel in a great location, was really impressed with Battersea.

Check in no issue, room was fine, nothing special, pretty standard, you definitely  paying for location, which was ok with me.

We used the pool on the roof, it was a nice way to break up the day before heading down to a bar on the Thames directly opposite the power station. The biggest downside to using the roof was having to buy drinks from JOIA, I have been to Mykonos and Dubai this year and this was more expensive than both of them places, i know everything seems expensive in the world at the moment but to pay ¬£20 for a small sized Vodka and soda is criminal, 4 drinks where costing over ¬£80, and we are not talking doubles or cocktails.

Unlikely to return to this hotel, but will return to Battersea for a bit of shopping and food.",3,2024,08,05
139,Modern individual hotel next to Battersea power station,"Clean modern efficient

139,Lovely rooftop pool,"Booked as a surprise for my bf‚Äôs bday. 
Service was good, a bit of a shame that the pool was so busy even on a Monday! We were v lucky with the weather, but I think something needs to be done to monitor how many ppl are using the pool at one time, or a system of one or two hours on the sun beds in v busy periods. 

Kristian did a great job though, thank you for the room upgrade and bottle of Prosecco.",4,2024,08,01
139,Worst in di -room ever .. üò°,"First of all lovely hotel design.. rooms are beautiful..

Staff are friendly but major shortages in staff..! 

Very  Slow housekeeping service ever you wait for long time.. but nataliya tried her best and she is nice ‚Ä¶ so maybe its shortage of staff .. !!! 

- no laundry available.. they had to send for outside guy to do it ..and told me to wait for 10 minutes and it took 2 hours to come pick my clothes!!

‚Äú- the worst experience that i faced is the 
‚Äúfood!!!!
I ordered from the kids menu.. to find a plastic tape in the food ( dirty) !! üò°and  when I complained no one make it up to me!! What a respectful way to show the guest !! 

- Very poor in room -dining menu..and breakfast ‚Ä¶ and they are keeping hang up phones..! 

- if you call Any service-button in the phone that on the hotel phone .. it‚Äôs take you to the reception And you have to explain what you want and wait the housekeeper to call or the dining.. waste of time !!!  

Definitely not recommended for anybody busy .. 
and this is my one & last time here  ..!",1,2024,07,30
139,Good hotel in a calm area,Clean modern and spacious rooms.  The hotel was quite new when I visited.  The restaurant/bar on the top floor has a nice view of London.  A bit far from the shopping areas but there is the subway station right across here street which is convenient,4,2024,07,30
139,Amazing drinks on the roof terrace,Ahmed was absolutely amazing - had such a lovely time and he helped us out lots! Can‚Äôt wait to come back :)))) we had drinks on the roof terrace and enjoyed the view of the skyline. Staff was super friendly and the cocktails were gorgeous.

Really friendly staff from the minute you check in to the time you check out. Perfect base to explore London from or to just chill !,5,2024,07,28
139,Great place but.‚Ä¶.,"I had a great time at this hotel. The staff was extremely professional and friendly, and I loved the restaurant food, especially the tuna tartare.

However, I was disappointed that the hotel closed the rooftop, including the bar and pool, for private events. I stayed at the hotel for 12 nights and was upset to find the rooftop jacuzzi closed for three nights. I chose this hotel for the rooftop jacuzzi to help with my back pain after long days of touring London. I was informed about one night of closure when I checked in, but the other two nights were unexpected and left me feeling upset as I had been counting on using the jacuzzi.

Our room was comfortable and clean. I especially appreciated the espresso machine and complimentary water.

On the positive side, Battersea is a new, safe, and clean area with a young and hip vibe. The hotel's location is convenient for accessing the subway and a water bus, which makes it easy to explore the city.",4,2024,07,25
139,A nice hotel,"Beatiful place, hotel, atmosphere, decor and people. But I recommend a better cleaning service as this is a hotel that hosts thousands of people so there is a certain standard I expected but did not receive. The room service was also not very helpful when needed (I asked for cutlery once and never received it despite being told it is coming). All in all I enjoyed my stay but these details disappointed me.",3,2024,07,24
139,Style over substance.,"It was so disappointing. After the initial WOW factor of the lobby area, location beside the former power station & the reception staff it goes down hill... quickly. Unlike the lifts. The lifts are the first problem- certain parts of the day it can take 35-40 minutes to get a lift. Even at quieter times you can expect to wait 10-15minutes. There's 16 floors and only 3 lifts. When I mentioned it to the duty manager (who was lovely but clearly under resourced) said it was a known problem since the hotel opened 16 months ago. 

Check in was at 3pm. But that means they'll take your luggage 2 colleagues had to wait for 2 hrs and got into their room after 5pm. Which meant they couldn't relax and make the most of the rooftop pool 

The rooftop pool is lovely but they closed it for a few hours on 1 of the loveliest days of the year for a wedding. A lot of guests were disappointed in this. 

We decided to eat on the rooftop bar on our first night. Again there wasn't enough staff and those that were working were too slow and untrained. 40minute cue at the bar and bar staff working in no particular order.

The food was unbelievably slow too. 

The weather was nice but I don't think the hotel can claim that. 

Bedrooms are quite stylish but have a steamer thing rather than an traditional iron. The oddest thing is that the heavy blackout curtains are great for keeping the room dark for a lie-in, BUT they're about 1"" off the ground so the pesky sun manages to get into the room- so they aren't black out curtains at all. 

On our 2nd night (Saturday night) only bar in the hotel after 11pm (btw it doesn't selling pints) was closed for a private function. There were no signs anywhere to say this but apparently there e-mails sent in advance of the stay... I've checked and we didn't receive that. 2 colleagues didn't realise it was a private function and went a bought 2 beers. The security was OTT and demanded they leave and wouldn't let them take the beers. 

The reception said they could order beers  in the reception area and when they did, the receptionist/night porter refused to serve. When my colleagues then tried to order room service again the night porter refused. This was Saturday night 12:30 in a pretty cool and vibrant part of London and you couldn't get a drink. A wedding party who were staying at the hotel ended up getting their own champagne & drinking it on the street. 

I've also been really disappointed with the hotel and the Radisson group with their response to the concerns I raised at the time & since. 

This hotel is never a 5 star. I've stayed in budget hotels with a better experience and customer care.",1,2024,07,24
139,Arousing,"The location ist stunning, epic and iconic. It is a great place tomdive into the culture of London and to feel the pulse of the city. The employees like Jermaine make the hotel come alive and feel you at home. And yes, the rooftop jacuzzi is the place to be",5,2024,07,20
139,Great hotel in a great location,"First time in Battersea and we loved it. Hotel was a great choice. Perfect setting very close to the river. Right across from Battersea power station mall. Did lift 109 and read about the history of the power station. Plus we shopped. , Walked  along the river and around the park, , uber  boat up the river to Greenwich , shopped in the mall , walked across Chelsea bridge through Chelsea up to BP stopping en route for breakfast. This gives you a taster of everything you can do on the hotels doorstep. 
Didn‚Äôt manage the roof top pool as planned as the weather wasn‚Äôt great. 
Had breakfast in the hotel one day . Very good and well organised. Room was very spacious immaculate and the hit for me we overlooked the cat and dog home so could see some of the activity there. 
All in all a smashing hotel in a great location. Tube through from T5 the Elizabeth line then changed to the northern line. Very easy.",5,2024,07,15

139,Best pool in London!,"I booked the Art‚Äôotel as a surprise for my partner‚Äôs ‚Äôbig birthday‚Äô and we both enjoyed our stay here, and exploring the new re-developments in Battersea. The hotel is easily accessible by tube, bus, train and Uber boat and there are numerous attractions and restaurants/bars in the near vicinity.
Check-in by app is easy and all the staff were welcoming, friendly and professional. We were upgraded to a larger room and the card and bottle of bubbly on arrival were a wonderful surprise. 
As keen swimmers, we were ‚Äòblown away‚Äô by the amazing pool and jacuzzi on the sixteenth floor. Simply sensational on a sunny afternoon, at sunset and first thing in the morning. We have recommended highly to friends and relations, and also hope to re-visit again soon!",5,2024,06,06

139,So many things had to be put right that we gave up in the end.,"We had to keep asking the hotel to put things right on so many occasions that we gave up in the end. I won‚Äôt be staying here again in a hurry . The hotel itself was lovely and most of the staff were wonderful but sadly we were let down by a number of things. Love Battersea shopping centre and the cinema . 
Hotel is in a lovely part of London. We will probably try another hotel next time",2,2024,05,27

139,Perfect bank holiday stay in Battersea,The service from the moment your arrive is excellent. Possibly the calmest and easiest check in experience and service at breakfast was top notch. Kelvin and Jermaine were stand out-  and do a great job at promoting the brand and we would absolute choose to visit a sister hotel. Roof top pool was an added bonus and beautiful views of the Thames and the former power station. We did venture to roof top bar but unsurprisingly was absolutely rammed so that was the only con-,5,2024,05,27
139,Wonderful hotel,"My sister kindly gifted me a stay at this wonderful hotel ( while we attended Chelsea flower show ) when we arrived our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready ,so chatting to the very welcoming Jermaine on reception.. it was mention about my big birthday (50th) and that‚Äôs why we were in London ( I‚Äôm from Cornwall ) as our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready Jermaine kindly gave us vouchers for drinks in the wonderful bar ..
Not long afterwards Jermaine appears saying our room was ready and there‚Äôs a few ‚Äú surprises ‚Äú in our room ..
All I can say is WOW.. we had a tray of delicious cakes /bottle of fizz and a room upgrade to a suite ‚Ä¶ Jermaine definitely made our stay 5 star .. brilliant hotel /wonderful staff - thank you xx",5,2024,05,24

Perfect location, super close to everything you need. We‚Äôll be visiting again in November, look forward to staying with you again. Thank you üôèüèª",5,2024,05,23
139,Customer service at top tier along with everything else you could hope for!,"Genuinely one of the nicest stays in London. From the moment you arrive all the staff are so welcoming, Mukaram on the front desk was an an absolute gem. Every question or request was no bother at all! 

We were a family of 3, 3 ladies in fact, staying in a king size room with a sofa bed and we had ample space for our 2 night stay. It was a process learning how to use the coffee machine, but a fun one and it was the nicest feeling laying in bed with barista standard coffee with the light coming in from the giant windows. The bathroom was also great and the button function was literally perfect! 

The hotel overall has an amazing decor, we loved taking in the different art pieces and sculptures, and definitely the smartest lifts I‚Äôve seen in a while! 

With breakfast included we ate in the cafe restaurant each day along with one lunch meal and all the food was amazing, cannot fault a menu that has marmite and cheese on crumpets either!!! Total British dish win! 

I used the spa facilities on both days and whilst there isn‚Äôt an indoor pool it was still nice to use the sauna room for a short while, although if you‚Äôre looking for a spa hotel it might not have all you would want. The gym was perfect! Great amount of equipment to do a strength or cardio workout, was a huge fan of the themed kettlebells. 

With the location right in front of the Battersea power station it‚Äôs an ideal location for shopping, eating, exploring as well as popping on the tube to get elsewhere across town. 

I will for sure be returning and highly recommend a stay here!! 

Thank you for the hospitality and the little extras carried out to make this a wonderful birthday stay for our mum :-)",5,2024,05,22
139,You must visit this hotel!!,"Wow! What an amazing hotel, we had the best time and I would highly recommend!
The customer service was 10/10 from the moment we arrived and they made every part of our experience extra special.
The rooftop pool has to be the best part of the hotel.",5,2024,05,19
139,Art'otel is a winner!,"What a treat! I know Battersea is still being developed so it wasn't very busy in the area/hotel when we went mid-week for 1 night. However, we really liked the peace and serenity of the area despite being in the middle of London. We felt safe to wander at night, take in the sights, eat at a local restaurant and still be close to the hotel. 
Some of the tech of the no-contact check-in/using the lift confused me at first but I soon got used to trying it this way. Think I would have preferred to check-in normally which I will do next time. 
We had a leak from the bathroom during our stay but how the hotel handled it at the time & contact made after we left, was flawless. Issues can happen but it's all about how problems are handled & good customer service that is important!
Well stocked mini-bar with a nice variety, helpful to have a fridge as we had done some local grocery shopping. 
Nice towels/toiletries/bed/pillows. 
We weren't expecting to have breakfast in the hotel but we had left it very late to sort our plans & they squeezed us in right at the end of service. Very tasty breakfast!
Amazing views from the roof-top terrace/pool. regretfully we didn't use the pool but will do next time. 
Lastly, the art... just beautiful and we really enjoyed taking it all in",4,2024,05,18
139,Trendy new hotel with amazing rooftop pool,"Trendy hotel in fantastic location, overlooking the iconic power station.

Excellent food served at JOIA, with five star service from Fabio, Steven and Christian.",5,2024,05,17
139,Excellent Arty Hotel in a Vibrant Area of Battersea!,"Jermaine at the reception was welcoming, very professional, helpful in his dealings and forthcoming in providing a great customer experience.

Art'otel London Battersea Power Station is an excellent arty hotel in a new, vibrant area of Battersea! The tube station is steps away and has a perfectly located underground car park. The variety of shops at Battersea Power Station are easily accessible. 

My room was clean and had plenty of space to store clothes. Bathroom robes and slippers were provided, which were ideal for popping up to the outdoor heated infinity pool and hot tub. This bijou pool is quite unique, considering most London hotels do not have a rooftop pool. Plus, there is a lovely cosmopolitan bar. I had a lovely stay and would definitely return.

I enjoyed a fabulous lunch at the Michelin-starred restaurant JOIA, which is located on the 15th Floor and offers amazing views over London.

Highly recommended!",5,2024,05,15
139,Best place to stay and enjoy the redevelopment Battersea,"Wonderful hotel and service. Mukaram at the reception was very professional in his dealing and forthcoming with providing a great customer experience.

139,Fab hotel- great location,"Lovely hotel, great check in service, fabulous room on the 8th floor, very comfy and modern . Nice rooftop bar with amazing views. Didn‚Äôt use the pool facilities. During the weekend day it is very very busy so was slightly put off by this but by 8 pm it had quietened down. 
Couple of things to note: the pool area is for hotel guests only but the sunbeds and area was being used by guests visiting the bar. There needs to be some control over this area maybe by a key card entry. 
Would have liked the small warm
Pool to be  a jacuzzi;
The lounge area, needs to be constantly monitored as a bit untidy - empty drinks bottle left on table, scraps of paper on flooring. 

Otherwise a fabulous hotel and will definitely return.",5,2024,05,13

Situated directly next door to Battersea Power Station. 

The staff at reception are amazing. Friendly and accommodating. 

The room on the 8th floor has great views with a modern art theme throughout. illy coffee machine, bottled water are available in the room.

We noticed the roof top pool and bar area are also open to the public. 

Drinks are expensive - 2 Gin & Tonics - ¬£40 but worth it when enjoying the views across London at night.

The Power station development is amazing with designer shops and restaurants!",5,2024,05,13

Difficult to pick anyone out, but huge thanks to Sala, Renata in Tozi restaurant who really looked after us at breakfast, and the reception team. One particular thank you is to Ahmed on the door - what an incredible man and massive credit to Art Otel. His smile and welcome and departing chat made our stay - he knows why. Thank you everyone.",5,2024,04,29
139,Outstanding Experience - Highly Recommended,"Wonderful overnight stay in this fabulous new hotel. The staff were all highly engaging and had the highest standards of service. A wonderful lady greeted us on check-in and took us through the process while exploring what we where doing - we say the same lady on checking out the next day, who remembered what we where doing and asked how how it went.  It's those little touches that make a stay so personal.  

Coupled with this, I had put a note in the booking that it was my wife's birthday,  and they really went the extra mile to make this so special.  Thank you!

The infinity pool is really loverly with amazing views - we spent a long time soaking in the hot tub while also soaking in the view.  It is quite a strange experience being close to the bar, with people coming and taking pictures around the pool of the view, but that didn't detract from the experience. 

Thank you - we could not recommend the hotel more highly - the staff, the room, the cleanliness, the pool, the bar, the drink, the food, all faultless.",5,2024,04,28

139,Weekend away in London,"Fantastic location and views from rooftop gardens. Rooms good size for London , comfortable beds and excellent amenities 

Staff helpful and pleasant 

Would certainly recommend

We are at all the restaurants and recommend early for joia to get a table with view, and breakfast was delicious",4,2024,04,28
139,Wonderful stay,"We had a very pleasant welcome at the reception by Mukarram who was very efficient and helpful in arranging a room for us per our request earlier than the check in time. We felt welcomed very nicely into the hotel. Friendly hotel staff is always appreciated. The hotel is beautifully designed. Rooms are comfortable, clean and designed really well. Good location close the tube station and the shopping mall. We had a very smooth stay. Looking forward to come here again.",4,2024,04,27
139,Location sells it.,"The location of the hotel is great, the staff were courteous and polite. The room was not clean enough though, there were finger prints on the walls and the dark furniture. the bathroom sink didn't drain properly. The bathroom scales were no adjusted and seemed to be there more for esthetic purposes, rather than functionality. 
The bedding was not great either but bathrobes and slippers were of a good quality. 
It seems that all hotel rooms are overlooking the raliway tracks. 
Overall, it was a pleasant stay but for 300 euros a night one would definitely expect the hotel of a better standard.	The location is definitely what sells this hotel.",4,2024,04,23
139,I so wish I could give this 5 stars,"The customer service is second to none   Mohammed at front of house made us feel very welcome and we found that was the same theme throughout the staff that we interacted with including the maintenance team.  
This was a special treat and we had one of their Junior Suites which was superb however it let itself down as when you open the curtains you see the ramp to the car park.  So disappointing and so surprised that a suite is on floor 1 and not on an upper level that has the sky line views.  
Would I recommend the hotel ? Yes‚Ä¶,, but my advice would be  save your money and go for a standard room with skyline views and spend that saved money in the local restaurants annd bars outside of the hotel. 
We had breakfast included but again this had a downside as the extremely friendly waitress explained that you could have a choice of 1/2 or 2/3 which in a nutshell meant you could have a continental with a hot breakfast or a hot breakfast with extras BUT if you wanted certain juices that was extra and if you want a second cup / glass of something well that‚Äôs extra too.  
As an example scrambled eggs on sour dough was included but as I chose a croissant then extra bacon (4 rashers streaky) would cost me ¬£7.50. I overheard a family trying to explain to their children why they couldn‚Äôt have cereal and eggs on toast with beans as the beans would be an extra! 
Overall the room, the hotel and staff were superb but I really can‚Äôt recommend their junior suite on floor 1 or their very over priced and limited breakfast choices.",4,2024,04,22
139,"The friendliest, unpretentious hipster hotel in London","Everything about this hotel rocks. From the entryway to the main lobby/check-in, it‚Äôs cozy, definitely artsy, but also incredibly welcoming with a cool atmosphere and wonderful staff. And if you‚Äôre lucky to be greeted by Justine at the front desk, you‚Äôll likely have one of the best check-in experiences you‚Äôve ever had. Sincerely. The rooms have great light, excellent shower (with intense water pressure), a more than adequate gym and a rooftop heated pool that looks darned inviting (will have to make that part of the next trip). Couple with some great restaurants, I just enjoyed every facet of this stay. Truly, a ‚Äòbest of London‚Äô kinda place. And the surrounding area has everything you need. Highly recommended.",5,2024,04,22
139,The Art of running a Hotel with the right name Art'otel,"I would just like to say a massive thank you to you and your team especially Justine (at front of house) we visited this weekend to celebrate my wife‚Äôs 50th Birthday and this is the very 1st time we have visited this area. The minute we walked to the door and greeted by the young man on Saturday taking what seemed such a small couple of manageable bags from us just gave us the impression that this was going to be special.

We then had the pleasure to be checked in by Justine whom saw it was a special day and interacted with us with such pleasure and humour that made us feel like old friends even though we had never been here before. Having been told that the room wasn‚Äôt ready, which we knew as we had arrived far to early (11:00ish) we were told we could leave our bags and wander off and these 9the bags) would be taken care of to the room.

Around 13:00 Justine called my mobile to say if we wanted the room was ready some 2 hours before we should have checked in so again yet another brilliant service form her and the hotel. We continued with our day and on the return about 17:00 we picked up the keys (more fun and laughs with another member of your team) we then had the lift opened by staff and taken to the room.

And what a lovely room especially with the surprise prosecco gift from yourselves to continue this celebration. We booked the Joia Restaurant that evening and service again spot on and finished the evening off with a nice nightcap looking at the view over London.

Check out again was so smooth and good old Justine was on hand again giving us a lovely farewell and laugh to end what was a fantastic weekend.

For us it was pushing the boat out on the costs however it was a special occasion and on the way back I suggested even though looking at the prices I‚Äôm seriously looking at a quick return as Justine and all the staff going this extra bit justified everything on just an overnight stay.

Again massive thank you for this weekend and please pass on big hugs and thank you to Justine.

All the best and we look forward to visiting soon.",5,2024,04,22
139,Excellent stay,"Spent two nights here for a birthday weekend.  Location is great, inside the new Battersea village with great shops and restaurants.  Convenient for either riverbus or tube.  Tube just a few stops to central London.  ",5,2024,04,22
139,"Fabulous stay, made us feel really special","The hotel was beautifully decorated and the facilities were great (just a shame the rooftop bar & 15th floor bar/restaurant wasn't open, but we knew this before arrival). The rooftop pool is amazing. Breakfast was really good. I had stated on my booking form that I was celebrating a forthcoming birthday and we were upgraded with fizz & cake and a lovely card waiting for us in our room. Most of all, the staff, everybody that we met were absolutely amazing. Not just corporate polite/efficient, but really personally engaging, friendly and super efficient.   ",5,2024,04,22
139,I think Miles Davis should be in every room!,"No better place to stay and experience the Battersea power station and its surroundings. Very cool, very friendly, and a very much appreciated free upgrade to a suite, so plenty of room for the kids, took great pleasure showing my age and teaching them the art of playing records!‚Ä¶..yes our very cool room had a proper record player with a great mix of classic albums, a nice touch, although I found myself waking up to some classic Miles Davis one Sunday morning thanks to my nine year old?! It was chilly outside but we got up early (thanks to Miles Davis) and went up onto the roof for a swim. It‚Äôs a must, if you have no bath robes in your room, give reception a call and they will bring some to your room but there are changing rooms next to the pool and plenty of towels. Finish it off with a session in the hot tub whilst taking in the views.
As a family we prefer a buffet style breakfast, but here it is table service, I would say the menu was extensive and my breakfast was to a high standard with excellent service. It is a comfortable calm and we found it a very friendly place to stay.",5,2024,04,20
139,Lovely hotel shame about the sleep üò¥,"What a beautiful hotel, friendly staff, spotlessly clean. The room was lovely, the bar stunning but we were shattered after long day needed a good night‚Äôs sleep as early start today and out at 06.45 after initially falling asleep woke back of midnight bed was like a brick had to take a look under the topper just to check there was a mattress üôà after trying sleeping on the pillows, the floor managed a few more hours - not the best start hoping breakfast is good when we return later.",3,2024,04,19
139,Great experience as per usual!,"We‚Äôve been to the hotel a couple of times and have always been welcomed warmly. The breakfast in the downstairs Tozi cafe is exceptional. 
We got a wonderful treat from hotel concierge Tiamael, who was super lovely and gifted us the two drinks we had from the mini bar  - this is how you build guest loyalty. :)

Thank you!",5,2024,04,17
139,Amazing experience and great service,"During my recent stay at this hotel, I was thoroughly impressed by the exceptional service provided by Olly, the lobby manager. His warmth and professionalism added a special touch to my experience. The rooftop views were truly stunning, offering a picturesque backdrop for enjoying delicious drinks. Whether you're looking for top-notch service or breathtaking vistas, this hotel delivers on all fronts.",5,2024,04,14
139,Tiamael's Art of Hospitality at art'otel Battersea,"In the living canvas that is the art'otel in Battersea, London, Tiamael, the receptionist, emerges as a masterpiece in the intricate art of hospitality. From the moment of arrival, it is not merely the contemporary d√©cor that commands admiration but Tiamael's radiant smile, which, like a stroke of light in a Vermeer, captures and elevates the mundane into the extraordinary.

With the poise of an artist, Tiamael curates each guest's experience, transforming routine interactions into moments of subtle elegance and mindful connection. His approach to service, marked by a tranquil demeanour and a watchful eye, resonates with the discretion of a gallery curator handling priceless works.

Tiamael's dedication and passion for service do not merely fill a role, they enrich the entire tapestry of the hotel experience, weaving his unique blend of talents and innate people skills into the very fabric of art'otel. His presence at the front desk is not unlike that of a signature on a fine painting, defining and distinguishing the establishment as a place where artful living and hospitality converge.",5,2024,04,13
139,Poor,Sadly you learn what real customer service is like when you cease to be a customer. We had a lovely stay at the hotel marred by the ¬£50 holding deposit that they haven‚Äôt returned. I contacted them by phone and got a fairly surly response and then e mailed them. They didn‚Äôt reply. We saved hard for this trip and could have done with not being effectively charged ¬£50 extra.,1,2024,04,12
139,Dog friendly best hotel in London,Travelling with dog choosing Battersea like very dog friendly place and of course have to stay in Art hotel  place was amazing with wonderful view and rooftop swimming pool ! Nice friendly people around had wonderful stay will return! Very nice touch is Prosecco bottle in room for celebration to my birthday thank you very much ! Only some of my concerns and recommendations to make this place better it‚Äôs controlling kids to visit swimming pool -will be great if some time it‚Äôs adults only in the pool ( I was reading in booking. com kids only allowed till 7 pm but I was 7.40 pm and many kids still swimming and that was ruining romantic atmosphere and rooftop swimming experience for adults ! Thank you,5,2024,04,11
139,Sarah is Terrific!,"Sarah at front desk was terrific at checkout. Attentive, efficient and very pleasant! The whole staff is Grade A in terms of politeness and professionalism. They bring the whole experience to life, making my hotel stay feel like a luxury vacation. Thank you!",5,2024,04,11
139,One of the best hotels in London!,"We had a lovey overnight stay for my Birthday in April 2024. Like others have stated there is the most lovely aroma when you walk into the hotel lobby. It's the most¬† sensational smell..hard to describe.

The facilities were amazing including the rooftop infinity pool and jacuzzi opened until 9pm in the evening.¬† The vibe on the rooftop with the bar and music was really nice too where food can also be purchased up until 6pm.

 The artwork and vibrancy of the d√©cor was another highlight of our stay.¬† The name of the hotel definitely lived up to it's name.  You can even take a guide tour of the facility and learn about the current resident artist. 

We opted for  an Art Room with Skyline View which had the biggest round mirtor I have ever seen. The room was spotless and we had a great view.¬† Nice touches such as the steamer and coffee machine made our stay even more memorable. 

The wellness and spa in the basement including a fully equipped gym didn't disappoint either.¬† Both the steamroom and the spa which I did use before breakfast could comfortably fit 6 people.

 In terms of the food, it was delicious and reasonably priced. We opted to eat in the Tozi resturant and I  especially loved the in-house banana ice-cream (chef's kiss).¬† 

Lots to do in the area too, so an ideal short break for couples and or families.¬† All this to say, that my husband is already planning our next visit.  And I for one can't wait. Art'otel Battersea Power Station gets 10/10 and is highly recommended.

¬†

",5,2024,04,09
139,"Location 10/10, pool experience 2/10","Excellent points:
The location could not be better. Close walk to the tube and next to the power station 1010.

We loved the arty decor and the hotel was incredibly clean. 

The breakfast was delicious - but be sure to check what is included in the breakfast so that you do not incur additional costs. This is not made clear at all by the staff and so you will need to ask! 

Not so good:

The shower water pressure was very, very poor in our room. When I spoke to front desk about this they were happy to move us rooms so we were very happy with this service. 

On our second day the pool needed to closed due to the issues with chlorine. To be honest, the pool was a key selling point for this hotel so it was a disappointment. I communicated this to the front desk and they apologised profusely which was appreciated, and we were offered complementary breakfast for the next day which was very much appreciated. Just a shame that the issue arose. 

Lastly, our biggest issue was that the pool and jacuzzi area was not the relaxing oasis we had hoped for. On every visit over our 2 day stay to the pool there were lots of children jumping and splashing in the pool, and taking up the whole jacuzzi. I appreciate that this is not an adults only hotel but hadn‚Äôt considered in an art‚Äôotel there would be so many children. Just something to consider if you are hoping for a relaxing visit to the pool as we had and if this is an important component to your trip.

Overall, the location is fabulous to explore Battersea and the staff seem to really care about guest experience. I would just say to anyone considering going that this is not an adults only hotel and to expect children in the breakfast area, foyer and swimming pool at all hours.

I think we would only stay again if the pool was adults only but we really appreciated the staff members that were so helpful during the issues that arose during our trip.",3,2024,04,09

139,Amazing hotel!,"My husband booked this as a surprise for my birthday, they honestly went above and beyond  for us, we got upgraded to the grandmaster suite which was amazing!! The rooftop pool and jacuzzi are a lovely unique experience for London and the kids loved it too, on Easter Sunday they put on a free Easter egg hunt which the kids loved and the staff just are lovely and approachable, the breakfast was lush and when we went to check out they had also made this complimentary, honestly can't rave about this hotel and staff enough.",5,2024,04,07

139,Glam.  Fab location loo is strange,"So this was a hotel of two experiences.  On the plus side.  It‚Äôs brand new.  It‚Äôs spotless.  We had an art king and it was VERY spacious.  Great hairdryer.  Lots of storage space.  Loads of plugs and USBs so really fab. Floor to ceiling windows.  Amazing roof top pool.  Amazing roof top bar.  Expensive but not stupid.  But, the hotel is a little too clever for its own good.  Not a single light switch.  It‚Äôs all on a pad.  Which lights up every time you nudge it which is great when you‚Äôre trying to sleep.   Not even a light switch in the bathroom.  It‚Äôs the bathroom that drove us nuts.  Fab shower.  Really simple to use.  But the loo has a really badly placed sensor flush.  Which won‚Äôt flush if the light isn‚Äôt on (see comment above about no light switch).  There‚Äôs no towel rack.  And the sink is ridiculously, and I mean ridiculously small.  It‚Äôs like the designer went for looks and never actually used it.  Bizarre !  Only other gripe was 15% service charge on drinks.  Even the ones you go to the bar yourself for.  Luckily that was removed on request.  Overall.  It got better the longer we stayed apart from that ridiculous loo and sink!   Oh.  And the windows don‚Äôt open at all.  Air con is good but not substitute for fresh air!",4,2024,04,02

Was there to attend a 7:30 appointment at the US Embassy so chose due to close proximity to the embassy and to enable me to have a look around the shops.  Everything was perfect, the hotel is extremely nice, staff very nice and helpful.   Location is fantastic.  One added advantage vs  staying in central London is how quiet the area is.  No traffic or sirens all night.  You could literally hear a pin drop.   Will definitely be returning.",5,2024,03,26

We enjoyed the set menu, which was very tasty, again with stunning night time views of London. 
Battersea Power Station is a minute away, full of shops/ restaurants etc. 
If arriving into Victoria I would recommend getting the 44 bus as it takes 5 mins, otherwise the tube is a much longer route.

139,If I could give this hotel more than 5 stars I would...,"This was an incredibly special trip for my fiance's birthday just before we get married... And our stay was above and beyond what we could have even have hoped. It was on a par if not more superior than experiences in the Shangri-la. Which ultimately comes down to how friendly and professional your staff are. 

Lazaros greeted us with warmth and kindness upon arrival. He even spotted an opportunity to upgrade our stay. We were full of gratitude for this. 

Kelvin was also extremely warm and friendly. Whenever we went past the reception we were met with the biggest smile and professionalism to ensure our trip was going as planned. 

Valentina and Eden made our dinner reservation in Joia extra special with where we were sat. And we're so patient when I had to adjust dates of the sitting. They managed expectations and made us feel like nothing was too much. 

Consulting on the digital marketing strategy of predominantly high-end hoteliers over the last 10 years I've been lucky to stay in many wonderful hotels. However what really sets Art'otel Battersea apart from it's competitors is it's culturally rich aesthetics and ultimately it's people. The whole hotel is full of personality and elegance and joy. We will 100% be recommending to friends and peers. 

Thank you for making this special occasion feel even more.so.",5,2024,03,22

139,Excellent new location to stay with a wow pool,"Beautiful European style hotel. Basic rooms fine and all things provided. 
Excellent and easily accessible location away from the tat of central London. But easily accessible for theatre and other tourist attraction using the northern line. Great facilities in the nearby power station. Restaurants galore. Still pretty undiscovered. Lovely walk to Chelsea. Hotel pool wow. Not sure how wow in summer with only 6 sun beds and nowhere to hang your lovely soft robe. Hotel let down by restaurant at breakfast. Poor service and poor  menu set up for what you would expect with breakfast included. All fresh and tasty though. Would recommend for what is a rare relaxing London stay. ",4,2024,03,16
139,Highly recommend,"This hotel was on my to do list and didn‚Äôt disappoint, the rooms are clean, spacious and the bed was very comfy, the pool is beautiful with fantastic views.

Popped into the gym which is fully equipped, probably the best I have seen in a hotel. We didn‚Äôt eat breakfast or dinner there so cannot comment on the restaurant or bar areas but we will 100% be back.",5,2024,03,16
139,Great weekend for a family wedding,"Three nights at the art'otel at Battersea were the backdrop to a family wedding weekend.  The bride, our daughter, was in a junior suite with her Matron of Honour and Bridesmaids.  

The front desk staff were absolutely exemplary with Bogdan leading from the front.  He and the others could not have been more helpful, going beyond  their responsibilities to manage every request and problem we had; and there will always be some of those on a wedding trip.
He, Bogdan, helped people relax when things got tense (we had transport issues because of a demonstration march in central London and near to the hotel) and even escorted people to the various transports available.  Justine certainly made me smile when I called reception with one enquiry I had; thank you to her.  I didn't get the names of the other front of house staff but they all are just what is needed.  Someone somewhere has selected and trained them, and are now managing them very well.

Our only very minor disappointment was the bar and restaurant on the 14th/15th floors were closed when we wanted to use them.  Not a major problem at all.

Overall this was a great stay, that helped to make our whole family wedding weekend run as well as it could.

PS The bride to be was delighted as well with her stay before and after her wedding.",4,2024,03,13
139,"A very enjoyable stay, but value for money ?  Perhaps.",Staff were without doubt all well trained and attentive. The hotel a ambience is just great and has a lovely feel.

Also the restaurant connected was lovely, everything is very aesthetically pleasing",5,2024,03,11
139,Nice staff but this stay was overpriced,"The hotel is run by the group that run Park Plaza/Radisson so it is relatively basic in service - staff are friendly and helpful however.

Room was a good enough size. Shower was not draining properly so I had to turn the water off mid shower to let it drain. 

The room had not been vacuumed properly from the last guest as I kept finding bits of confetti everywhere. Under bed had not been vacuumed at all.

My room looked out onto the railway line and was noisy. 

This booking was ¬£255 per night and did not feel like it was worth it.

The location is great - copious cafes, restaurants, shops and new underground station.",3,2024,03,09
139,Fabulous location and stay,"We had a fabulous stay here. 

We checked in and raced upstairs got changed and went straight to the rooftop jacuzzi for sunset. It was a little chilly but totally worth it.

Then we went for a stroll around the power station and had dinner in there. We had a nightcap in the bar and took in some of the art. We came back to our room for a quiet night. The bed was large and comfortable. We were on the 14th floor and overlooked the famous Battersea dog shelter.

The trains made a little bit of noise through the night. But not too intrusive. The shower and toiletries were good too.

We popped over to the power station again, this time for breakfast and the a tour up lift 109. We only wanted a light meal so chose to eat out rather than have room service or eat in the restaurant.  

We then sadly had to leave and walked over the bridge to Chelsea and Restaurant Gordon Ramsey for a very special lunch.",5,2024,03,09
139,Receptionist,"Ahmed was amazing with his customer services.  He‚Äôs was very helpful and polite with his services, I would recommend to stay with Art‚Äôotel people  that work here are great and polite. He also recommended us to using one of the Resturant on the hotel on 15th floor namely: JOIA Restaurant & Bar.",5,2024,03,07
139,Very chic hotel steps away from Battersea Power Staion,"The Battersea Power Station area is one of the hottest new areas in London. This hotel is 10 m from the main building, 100 m from the Tube station. It's very chic, very modern, with great service, sensational pool with London views and this unique feeling of a casual luxury.",5,2024,03,06
139,Beautiful stay during Christmas! 10/10,"Came with my husband as he had a conference nearby and I wanted to get out the house. He went to his conference whilst I chilled at the hotel and it was amazing. Went to the bar at the top floor and got to enjoy beautiful views sat next to a huge Christmas tree (with a whole bottle of wine to myself). Next day me and hubby went to the roof top pool which was stunning! Didn‚Äôt get to go in as hubby forgot his trunks but would defo return in summer for that alone! Also has breakfast at the hotel which was lovely! Amran at reception was an absolute pleasure also! So warm and welcoming. Thank you Amran for making our stay so pleasant! Rooms, service, vibes 10/10!",5,2024,03,05
139,Our new favourite hotel in London,"We fancied this for a one night staycation to discover the new excellent Battersea power station development.  Both the hotel and wider development exceeded our expectations! 
The hotel is a 2 min walk from the tube northern line, 2 mins to a Thames clipper boat stop and sits above a large underground car park (¬£26 for 24 hrs which is good for London). It's immediately opposite the power station a beautiful art deco masterpiece echoing Tate Modern now housing shops and restaurants . 
The hotel had friendly staff, a lovely lobby scent and stylish design.  Our room was new, colourful and had floor to ceiling windows looking out to Battersea dogs and cats home. It was joyful watching them exercise from our lovely room.  We also watched trains trundle into Victoria.  I guess rooms opposite are power station view. In my opinion there's no bad view here. 
The rooftop was sublime with a seasonal bar and seating area plus amazing loungers and an outdoor pool.  Best of all for our chilly winter Saturday it also had a bubbly hot tub  where we sat admiring the view. 
Our bathroom was spacious and I loved the Aussie brand Kevin Murphy products. The lotion smells like heaven so I took our little bottle home 
Sleep was easy with silent aircon and crisp bedding.  The TV had a video library and casting function for his sky sports game. Bliss. 
Breakfast was served in the ground floor cafe a la carte to order which was generous and delicious. 
We didn't want to leave! 
Last year we tried the rooftop pool of the Berkeley but honestly this is better and the hotel is a third of the price. 
The price point here is London Travelodge but you get a five star experience for it. Truly impressive and we're already planning our return once that lovely lotion runs out!  
Any issues? None. The coffee machine looks stylish but the instructions were hard to follow but when we tried to connect it pushing right instead of left  it worked. So my only tiny suggestion to the hotel is check the instructions card and think again ha ha 
But really,  this place has everything at a precovid happy price point. For tourists be brave and visit Battersea you'll have amazing photos to impress your friends and it's an easy tube ride to the usual sights plus you get to relax in a fabulous hotel",5,2024,03,04
139,Beautiful hotel with a warm stylish welcome,We loved our stay at this hotel. The interior design is something special. The roof top pool and jacuzzi offer some incredible views over the power station and it was warm enough for us even in March. The hotel has a timeless chilled atmosphere that really worked for us. The location is perfect with loads of shops and restaurants on the doorstep. Jermaine gave us a warm welcome at reception and made some special arrangements for us that made the stay even more memorable. We will definitely return,5,2024,03,04
139,very good,"very good hotel, beautiful location, good service, big enough room with coffee machine and coffee capsules, heated pool on the roof, bathrobes, slippers, shower accessories, beautiful bed linen, beautiful view of London from the roof",5,2024,03,04
139,Amazing Art‚Äôotel Battersea London,"Excellent hotel, excellent location and excellent staff.  Thanks to Mr. Jedi, Mr. Jermaine and Mr. Kelvin amazing well experienced professional staff thank you. Rooms was spacious, bathroom as well, very clean and very comfortable thnx",5,2024,03,03
139,Exceptional‚Ä¶ in every area,A 24hr hour visit and we loved every second. Starting with cocktails on the 15th floor .. dip in the pool .. out in London then back for more cocktails and a fantastic DJ. Battersea is a fabulous location ,5,2024,03,03
139,First stay,"My daughter and I stayed here for one night for her birthday celebration. Their service is exceptional, from the moment we arrived to the time we left every member of staff was professional and friendly. We arrived hours before check in to leave our luggage but we were told that there was a room ready and we could go straight to our room which was much appreciated. On the check in desk the staff takes us through everything we need to know for our stay, from the spa and gym to having a tour of the art work. I wished we had been staying for more than one night so we could have enjoyed the facilities. Our was beautifully presented and very clean. The shower was just amazing, it was lovely to have very large soft towels and great bathrobes and slippers. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,03,03
139,Honest Opinion,I stayed at this hotel for 1 night with my daughter in February.  There were a few issues which I decided not to put on trip advisor but to send an email to Customer Relations.  After a week of no reply I forwarded the email to two people at the hotel and to date - 3.3.24 - I have still not had a reply.  Not the sort of service I expect from Radisson Hotels let alone the issues of my original complaint which have yet to be acknowledged.  ,3,2024,03,03
139,Great place to stay,Cool property next to tube station Battersea with great & friendly staff. Bar on top of the building is cool with easy snacks and good cocktails. Thanks to Jedi for his friendly service at the reception. Area is quite artsy with nice architecture.,5,2024,03,01
139,Cool hotel if the location suits,Battersea Power station is very cool and this hotel is ideal to experience it. Nice pool and decent gym. Great breakfast restaurant. Not super central for classic London sightseeing but can get in on Northern Line tube,5,2024,02,29
139,Absolutely loved it,"Great hotel. Superb location, excellent staff, comfy, stylish room and a great breakfast. Had a great stay, I‚Äôd never visited before but I‚Äôll definitely be back. Great coffee in the room too. Though it took me a while to figure out how to use the machine!",5,2024,02,29
139,"Great hotel, fab location and friendly staff","Had a really great experience would highly recommend. The bar has an excellent view and wide selection of cocktails. The staff were friendly and happy to help with any questions. Lots to do in the area, situated opposite to the new Battersea power station development with lots of restaurants and activities",5,2024,02,25
139,Enjoyable and comfortable stay,"This hotel is very clean and very comfortable. I loved the decor and the style of the rooms. Our bed was a large bed and was very comfortable, the room was extremely quiet with a large shower room which was easy to use and had lovely toiletries. We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel but we did enjoy drinks in the bar on the 15th floor which has beautiful views of the Power Starion and the London skyline. We used the fitness center in the morning and it was clean, plenty of equipment and lots of space to work out. We did find parking in a public car park which was a short walk to the hotel. The hotel is opposite the entrance to the Power Station. ",5,2024,02,24
139,Great hotel. Impressive in every way,Loved the hotel. Friendly staff. Clean modern spacious rooms. Roof top pool amazing. Bar on 15th floor has spectacular views and lively atmosphere. Nice to have robes and slippers in the room. Room service was super quick. Thanks for a lovely stay ,5,2024,02,24
139,"Nice room, pool superb","Room nice and clean 
Location good with underground station a 5 min walk away. 
Area very busy Fri Sat night, so a tip would be to ensure you have a table booked for dinner. Everywhere was full. All other evenings were fine. 
Battersea power station area feels very safe to wander around at night",5,2024,02,21
139,Really nice hotel-however...,"Brought my wife here for her 60th birthday. Fantastic location and views from our 11th floor room were brilliant.  Loved the rooftop pool with the amazing views of the former power station and London.
Lots to do and see nearby.
However, the breakfast which we paid for when we booked is simply not worth it. What you get is very poor value for money and a hotel of this standard should be offering a great deal better. We would really have had a much better breakfast at the Pret nearby, not just in value but also quality. Plus breakfast being served in their top floor restaurant of the hotel would really be something but the ground floor cafe location is nothing special.",4,2024,02,20
139,"Good hotel, best in Battersea BUT things to note:","I've stayed here 6 times since it opened and I may stay here again: 

However I wanted to write a review for some things to be considered / noted:

- Your check in staff can be a little useless, cards not working, very long process some times, lack of info.
- Door team don't help with bags (Are they meant to here? if not, whats their role??)
- Breakfast : when included you can have any special coffee and some other higher value drinks such as smoothies etc, but you CANT have a bottle of water, water is extra lol hilarious. I Don't want your over the top coffee with my eggs this morning I just want some water and I dont want to have to carry my wallet to get some water with pre-booked breakfast. My advice is dont pay for breakfast, its really not even worth it here, eat in the other spots near by. 
- Pool Service - rubbish, and when its busy in the summer your pool is full of random people, you NEED To prioritise guests. 
- Consider valet parking into the car park next door
- Consider opening your pool to later 
- Ground floor (well lower floor rooms) are AWFUL, people can literally see into your rooms if the curtains are not fully drawn in the right position. 

Thanks",4,2024,02,19
139,Great,"Great hotel, great architecture, great location, great staff, great food, great art, great amenities, great restaurant, great bar, great infinity pool, great view, great room , great bed, great mini bar just great, great, great, great,",5,2024,02,19
139,Fabulous experience,"My husband and I stayed here to experience Battersea Power Station. We loved the hotel and the area. The rooftop pool is amazing, with great views. For lunch and dinner, it‚Äôs worth booking at the weekend, it gets very busy. ",5,2024,02,19
139,Birthday weekend stay.,"Our room on the 12th Floor gave an interesting view over the railway lines, roof tops and beyond towards west London across the river. The floor to ceiling windows made for a relaxing time just picking out various London sights in our view and watching the trains below coming and going quietly. 
It's a good base to explore the Power Station, Thames path and surrounding area, especially Battersea Park and down towards Wandsworth Bridge and across the river, through Chelsea Harbour, Chelsea and back over Chelsea Bridge.
Mohamed, in reception, looked after us very well at check in and check out, and was a cheery face as we came in and out through our weekend stay.",5,2024,02,19
139,Amazing rooftop pool,Excellent hotel with heated rooftop pool and jacuzzi. The staff were friendly and helpful. Room service was great and breakfast in bed. The views were perfect and sound proof rooms. Mood lighting in the bedroom was great. Thank you!,5,2024,02,19
139,Very funky indeed,"We booked the hotel to celebrate our anniversary and are delighted that we did. The whole area has a very modern, trendy vibe and the hotel is no different. Quirky chairs and artwork lead to the reception area where the staff were absolutely brilliant.. welcoming and very friendly. We received an upgrade and stayed in a skyline room with a great view. The room wasn‚Äôt the biggest, but was spotlessly clean, had a huge comfy bed and large walk in shower- more than what we needed for a one night stay. 
We had a quick dip in the rooftop pool/jacuzzi which was fun and used the cocktail bar on 15th and then the restaurant downstairs where again, the bar staff were really wonderful. 
All in all - a huge thumbs up. We will be back!",5,2024,02,18
139,"Absolutely stunning hotel, my favourite in London right now!","I consider myself and experienced traveler, and I have stayed in most of the top hotels in London, but value for money nothing can beat this, it‚Äôs new, it‚Äôs modern and the location is fabulous. 

Battersea is new development with so much to do locally lot of bars, shops and restaurant. The hotel is well located if you want to use the tubes, but it‚Äôs also located just near the river Thames if you want to explore Chelsea or enjoy a walk along the river. 

I need to mention to roof top pool‚Ä¶. It is amazing (big shout out to Arthur)  who keeps the temperature regulated, I stayed in the pool for hours‚Ä¶. It was a cool February day and It was so good.

Doorman Ahmed was friendly and welcoming. 

On checking in and out Jermaine and kelvin made the process smooth and easy.  

 The Joia restaurant is fantastic with the manager Salah making sure we had everything we needed.   

If you love dogs, you can see Battersea dogs home from some of the rooms, it was lovely seeing them being taken out for walks.

This was my second visit I give it a 10/10 and will definitely stay again.",5,2024,02,17
139,Decent enough hotel with a cracking breakfast,"Stayed for two nights, the hotel is very new and modern and I liked that a lot. Also smelt wonderful. 
The staff were very friendly throughout. 
The breakfast was incredible, excellent selection choices and value for money. 

Also made use of the sauna in the spa area, the steam room needs some work. The pool and hot tub on the roof have great views. 

My only negative is on check in  - the guy checking me in gave me an unprompted dialogue about giving me a complementary upgrade, only to quickly discover he put me in a room facing a glass wall with no view and right next to the lift. So that was quite annoying, as looking on their website, it definitely wasn‚Äôt an upgrade, which is cool as I didn‚Äôt ask or expect one, but a very false first impression of the hotel. 

I actually had to move rooms as the lift was so noisy, which was very inconvenient as I‚Äôd spent an hour unpacking and ‚Äúmoving in‚Äù. 
To make matters worse they moved me to an accessible room(only room available, sir), which meant having a shower was a nightmare as the bathroom gets soaked and I mean soaked, so you have to put towels down everywhere. 

So that put a bad mark on an otherwise excellent stay and I would stay again.",4,2024,02,17
139,"Super stay friendly staff, sensational view of Battersea from pool xxxx","Oh my ..what a gorgeous place ...really lovely facilities....the rooftop pool is out if this wold for views of the powerstation,night and day....the bar on the 15 floor is sensational....Kelvin on Reception was a star , so friendly ...and really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome on Valnetines day.leaving some treats for us to enjoy in the room ..Thanks Kelvin and all ..Will be back xxx",5,2024,02,15
139,A magical trip!,"My partner booked a night at art‚Äôotel as a surprise for my 30th. We got the river boat to Battersea, which was a fab way to arrive, seeing the power station from the river.

At the hotel, we were greeted by the friendly concierge who walked us through the amazing bright entrance and then into the art filled reception. The receptionist, Toby, was welcoming and relaxed. He talked through the details of the hotel‚Äôs bars, restaurant, pool and spa. After he asked about our day so far, Matt told him it was my 30th and that I had just proposed to him (and he said yes)! After congratulating us, Toby asked his manager if we could be upgraded. We were blown away when given the key to their top floor junior suite, plus two free cocktail vouchers.

The junior suite‚Äôs floor to ceiling windows were stunning. The decor and furniture continued the modern creative feel but also felt homey. The addition of a record player and box of records was a brilliant touch, which added to the magic! The shower was a generous size and the whole bathroom worked well. Loved the extra touches of having the Dyson hair dryer and Ariwrap. Other great additions were a yoga matt, built in box safe and lovely toiletries.

Kitted out in the Art‚Äôotel dressing robes, we headed to the rooftop pool! The infinity pool and hot tub, looked directly onto Battersea Power Station and surrounding city skyline. There was an outdoor shower, sun loungers and unit of fresh towels. The pool its self was cool, clean and just deep enough to swim and stand at both ends. There were outdoor speakers playing music.

Back in our room and getting ready for dinner, we heard a knock at the door. Matt answered it and a member of Art‚Äôotel staff brought it a complimentary bottle of Prosecco on ice with two glasses and a hand written card congratulating us on our engagement! 

Once ready, we took the lift down to the grown floor bar for our free cocktails. The decor here was darker and more romantic but still had lots of creative quirks. Instead of ordering something from the menu, we asked the waiter if he could make us two surprise cocktails. He was quick to agree and made a delicious twist on an Old Fashioned for Matt and a refreshing gin cocktail with cucumber for me. 

Once we came back from our evening out, we wanted to try art‚Äôotel‚Äôs upstairs bar. This was split over two levels and had a lush tropical decor. On the lower level there was a mix of seating from armchairs to beanbags. We found a table for two by the huge(!) floor to ceiling windows. I enjoyed a beautiful rose and elderflower mocktail.

The next morning, we headed down to use the sauna. Although it said, ‚Äòopen form 8am‚Äô, it was not switched on yet so we let the reception know and went for another swim to use the time. Heading back down, it was beginning to heat up but the water tap for the coals was not working so we didn‚Äôt stay too long. 

Checkout was smooth and luckily we saw Toby again, so we could thank him for helping to make this such a wonderful experience. 

Later that day, Matt got a notification that some money had been refunded to him by art‚Äôotel. He realised this was the extra he had payed to have a room on a higher floor. They had refunded it as they had upgraded us to the suite. Another great personal and professional touch. 

If you have got to the end of this long review, you will already know that Matt and I thought art‚Äôotel was brilliant and will be recommending to everyone! We would both like to come back in the spring/summer to try the restaurant and rooftop bar. 

Thank you to everyone at Art‚Äôotel for making my 30th and our engagement such a special day.",5,2024,02,14
139,Absolutely brilliant hotel,"We spent one night at this hotel and will definitely return. The facilities, cleanliness, decor and location were outstanding. The staff were unbelievably friendly, happy and efficient. The roof top pool and jacuzzi are glorious. We had a sky view twin room and the views were far reaching. A little bit of passing train noise but otherwise very quiet. Great location",5,2024,02,13
139,"So friendly, so comfortable what more do you need!","I love coming here. As soon as I arrive the wonderful doorman Ahmed remembers me. Nothing is too much trouble for him and he is ALWAYS smiling. It makes such a difference. Check in is always easy and the rooms are great. Being on a high floor is fun but the layouts are very similar and everything is to hand. 
The roof top bar restaurant and pool are the best. I love the tall ceilings in the bar and pale pinks‚Ä¶
Thank you Art‚Äôotel see you again next month.",5,2024,02,13
139,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent, convenient location","This is a beautiful, new hotel in such a convenient location. It is less than half an hour on one tube line into central London and the theatre district or to Euston station. The views from the bar were stunning over the power station and London. I would definitely stay again in future.",5,2024,02,12
139,The Joia bar is really a London jewel,"I recently booked a section of the bar for an event and the team far exceeded my expectations. Eden-Rae and her team made sure that everything was absolutely perfect. 

The guests were greeted with a glass of delicious Portuguese Cava, that it was so good one French friend of mine bought a bottle the next day.

The food they provided, Spanish tapas, were complimented by my Spanish friends, which can be quite particular about their food.

And the excellent customer service continued throughout the night, with the team always attentive to what my guests needed.

The cherry on the top? They kept my presents in a wonderful bag that was very convenient when I picked them up two days later.

What can I say, if the amazing views of the Battersea power Station are not incentive enough to come, do it for the food, the drinks and the amazing service.",5,2024,02,12
139,Never visit,"Terrible service, refused service at the bar at 9:26pm for hotel guests and a party of 6 there celebrating a 21st birthday. Staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. It is ridiculous that hotel guest can‚Äôt get a drink at the hotel at 9:26pm and no bars or restaurant were open. Would never stay or visit again",1,2024,02,11
139,Amazing Weekend at Art‚Äôotel.,"Amazing Experience. Champagne & cake greeted us in upgraded room. Bar & restaurant had incredible view, food & drink exquisite.

Praise the Lord!

As an early Valentines celebration i decided to book a hotel stay for 1 night here at the Art‚Äôotel and thanks to Kelvin i got upgraded to the Masterpiece suite, since my room with a view was still being used. The view is amazing! I will NEVER forget this amazing valentines day! Thanks to the team and the father God! Clean room with a competent TV‚ù§Ô∏è

139,Great views,Stayed here for three work nights. Room 1404 is very good and being on the 14th floor had an amazing skyline view westwards over London and Battersea Dog‚Äôs Home. If you don‚Äôt have breakfast included there are supermarkets close by and a plethora of restaurants in the vicinity catering for all meals. Make sure you pop up to the 16th floor to see the spectacular views of the Power Station and beyond. The water is super soft so don‚Äôt use too much soap in the shower or you‚Äôll be rinsing it off for ages!,5,2024,02,08
139,Fantastic Stay at a Stunning Hotel!,"I stayed in Art'otel for four nights, with my family (2 small children).

139,Beautifully Designed Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend, and it really made the trip! The hotel is stunning with a lovely hotel bar overlooking Battersea power station, and the cafe/restaurant on the ground floor did an excellent breakfast. The hotel also has a heated rooftop pool and jacuzzi, which we went to early one morning and added to the experience. The hotel is also in a prime location, surrounded by the buzz of shops bars and restaurants , and also a short walk into Chelsea which we took advantage of. All the staff were so friendly and efficient too, and we just felt so comfortable and happy at the hotel. It was nice to stay in a different part of London, and it be so easy to still get to Euston and the city too. We will definitely be staying here again when we come to London, and we can‚Äôt wait to return!",5,2024,02,04
139,"Good, cheerful looking hotel with happy staff","This was my second stay here and again it was quite enjoyable. 
Traveled for business and the office is across the road from the hotel with makes it an obvious choice. But even if that wasn't the case it would still be a nice, colourful hotel with pleasant staff. Easy to get to by public transport, 15 minutes of underground away form the city centre ... but you don't need to go there as there's plenty of shops and restaurant in the neighbourhood.
Very good breakfast.",5,2024,01,30
139,Great hotel,This hotel is amazing. Right in the heart of the up and coming Battersea Power Station life. The interesting artwork is great.

139,Jewel in battersea power station,"Lovely stay. Staff are excellent.  Only issues we had were the coffee machine in the room
Is style over substance.   Seemed erratic eith a mind of its own .   There were no towels by the pool On the roof and theres not enough space to hang robes by the steam room and sauna which was oversubscribed despite a booking system
The Joia restaurant was wonderful. Attentive staff , great view and Highly recommend the tasting menu.",5,2024,01,28

139,Kelvin was awesome 5*,"Had the privilege to stay  in hotels all around world including some of the finest. 

For me I just want a down to earth, honest, and friendly experience. 

From the minute I met Kelvin at the desk to a little later on, his service was outstanding. Helpful, friendly, just enough info and made me and my son feel at home. 

It's very hard to train that level of professionalism and kindness and when it's not genuine you can tell. 

Thanks Kelvin, you made our first day here and solely on that interaction I would happily come back.",5,2024,01,26
139,Heated rooftop pool,Amazing views of the iconic Battersea Powerstation from the rooftop infinity pool and the top floor bar... which also serves delicious cocktails. My room was spacious and immaculately clean. Meeting rooms were pretty average (and the service in the meeting toom area could have been better). I came for work but will be back for leisure. ,5,2024,01,25
139,Superb staff and great hotel,"We stayed for one night. From the doorman through reception staff and waiters, all were confident, attentive, professional.  The staff appeared to enjoy their job and this shone through in great communication and helpfulness.

139,from the moment i arrived just lovely atmosphere and naturally pleasant attitude of the staff,"what a fabulous place and how helpful and considerate were the staff?! very! particularly those in and around the reception area .. the restaurant/bar areas upstairs were an odd layout, not very comfy and we thought although very nice too it was on the pricey side and the food choice wasn‚Äôt easy .. i think a couple more traditional flavours would have been good",5,2024,01,17
139,Excellent stay at the Art Hotel!,"Jermaine on front of house was super helpful, really attentive throughout my stay.

139,Trip with Teens,"Perfectly located hotel for all the amenities of the Power Station. We had three rooms for our family for teenage birthday celebrations and everyone had a great time. Rooftop pool is fun at night, bar on 15th floor has great views and it‚Äôs a few steps from everything else - bars, shops, restaurants, ice skating, chimney lift 109 etc.  Reception team were very helpful (Mohammed in particular was super).  Room views could be better and had to wait for a few things (luggage collection, a room clean) but otherwise really enjoyed ourselves. Thank you.",4,2024,01,06

139,New Year‚Äôs Eve 2023/4,"Spent a wonderful New Year visit to the hotel and area for the first time. The hotel was excellent, loved the modern art and quirky NYC vibe. The location was perfect for stunning views of the power station and huge selection of shops and restaurants in the area.
Spent New Year‚Äôs Eve in the bar area with great music and dancing, and yummy/plentiful canap√©s. 
Visited the roof top infinity pool prior to evening event and the views were amazing.
All the reception and event staff were very friendly and looked after us well. Shout out to Bogdan who went over and above to help us with any queries or requests.
Slightly disappointed that even from the roof top it was only possible to glimpse the London fireworks at midnight but the evening celebrations more than made up for it",4,2024,01,01
139,Disastrous Stay at Art‚Äôotel Battersea Power Station,"From the moment we checked in, our experience spiraled into what can only be described as a nightmare. Initially given an accessible room, we found the bathroom setup far from ideal. Recognizing our discomfort, the hotel staff moved us to a regular room. However, this was just the beginning of our troubles.
Despite having the whole day to prepare our new room, what greeted us was a scene of utter neglect and filth. The pillow covers were visibly dirty, and the bathroom door was marred by unseemly brown stains. Shockingly, we even found remains of grape stems near the TV, a clear sign of the room‚Äôs lack of cleanliness.

Hoping for a swift resolution, we approached the reception where the manager assured us that housekeeping would be informed and the room thoroughly cleaned. Yet, upon our return at night, it was evident that their version of ‚Äòthorough‚Äô cleaning was far below any reasonable standard. The only changes made were the removal of the bathroom door stains and the replacement of sheets and pillow covers. The grape stems remained untouched, the toilet roll was not replaced, and the extra comforter sheet was thrown onto our suitcase. Furthermore, the connecting room was left in a complete state of disarray. Although they were called and asked to come clean the room, no one from housekeeping showed up the whole day. 

This was our second visit to this hotel, and the drastic drop in service quality compared to our previous stay was deeply disappointing. Unwilling to tolerate these unacceptable conditions any longer, we immediately checked out and relocated to another hotel.

Our experience at Art‚Äôotel was not just disappointing; it was a stark warning about how quickly standards can fall. I strongly advise potential guests to reconsider booking a stay here.",1,2023,12,31
139,Refined Hip in amazing Battersea,"Battersea area is beautiful with easy tube access.

Great environment and friendly helpful staff.  Nice well layers out room w lots of storage for our longer stay. Nice workout area, steam and suana .

139,Experience,"Lovely hotel located in beautiful South West area of London, Amran was very knowledgeable and recommended lift 109 which we loved. She gives us directions to where to shop. Me and my partner are hopeless when it comes to maps and Amran provides such an accurate informations, she was friendly and did not seem to mind our cluelessness.  

See you in February, we can‚Äôt wait to celebrate love with you all.",5,2023,12,30
139,Very clean,"The rooms are really clean and the views were nice for London. The staff was lovely one called Amran really took care of us. I will definetely come back. Price is reasonable and the decor is modern, station is close by so easy travel to central London",5,2023,12,30
139,Christmas Morning,"Shout out to Amran who made our Christmas morning super duper special. Our kids would not stop talking about her, especially presenting them with surprise gifts like Santa. Fair to say this hotel become special to us all, due to Amran‚Äôs empathy and kindness we will definitely be back. Top tip if you are a creative and artistic person this will no doubt be the place for you. ",5,2023,12,29
139,Simply superb suite!,"I stayed in the fabulous suite earlier this month and had an incredible stay all thanks to the wonderful reception team! I lost the name of the young man who helped me on reception but he was joined by his colleague Jermaine who was equally friendly and helpful. 

The complimentary drink at the bar was a brilliant touch and I loved the suite! I work across from the hotel but stayed over for an event in central London. I ended up leaving late listening to the vinyl records in the room and getting ready in the large bathroom. 

The breakfast is a la carte and very quick. It wasn‚Äôt amazing but was good. This is not my first stay, I stayed in October also but this was my first time in the suite. I will stay again so a huge thanks to the reception team for making my stay so special (Jermaine can hopefully help with the name of his colleague - next time I‚Äôll save it in my phone!!!)",5,2023,12,28
139,Excellent service and facilities.,Exceptional facilities with fantastic customer service particularly from Amran and another nice lady (who gave us complimentary late checkout).‚Ä®‚Ä®My girlfriend was really happy with the quality of the bedding. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The room was excellent with a great 10th floor view of the skyline and my Radisson premium membership was honoured with a complimentary room upgrade.‚Ä®‚Ä®The view from the pool was amazing (we did not bring swimming gear) but we certainly will on our next stay. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Thank you Art‚ÄôOtel and Amran! See you soon.‚Ä®‚Ä®5 star establishment!,5,2023,12,26
139,A  truly wonderful and friendly place to stay at Battersea Power  Station,"From the moment we entered  thie service  was excellent. Amran checked us in,  in a  very friendly manner. The room was delightful clean and spacious with a super sized shower.   My only  problem was that  it was not mentioned that I needed  to use my room key card to use the lift., but a fellow guessed  put me right. A nice touch in the room was that the screen saver showed the painting on Van Gough.",5,2023,12,26
139,The view!,"Amazing views from the rooftop pool and jacuzzi, excellent cocktails and vibe at the bar and a sanctuary of a room to relax and restore in!  Vibrant neighbourhood with excellent transport links.   Loved my stay, and I can‚Äôt wait to go back.  ",5,2023,12,26

139,art'otel Battersea,"This hotel provides a super location at Battersea Power Station.  Room 614 overlooks the railway line in and out of Victoria and the cat & dog home.  Some train noise but it didn't stop us sleeping well in the very comfortable room.  The highlight is the rooftop pool and hot tub, simply stunning day or night.",5,2023,12,23
139,Awesome reception staff! ,"Amaran was the warmest host when we checked in and out! She gave us advice on what to do in the area, and looked after us very well. The hotel itself is lovely - I‚Äôm a Brit living in the US and I haven‚Äôt been back since this area of London has changed- it‚Äôs quite some transformation, and this hotel is one of the best parts of that ‚ô•Ô∏è",5,2023,12,22
139,Excellent location. Mediocre hotel.,"There seems to be a trend with hotel groups to create these ""concept"" hotels that are big on ideas but cheap on execution. I'm looking at you Moxy. This results in the guest paying a higher price for something ""modern"" but not very good. While this hotel is in a great location ‚Äì right next to Battersea Power Station, it doesn't match up to the quality and vision of the surrounding area. For the price, I expected more and was disappointed. Also the staff in the Tozi cafe were slow to serve and prioritised guests who arrived after us, leaving us waiting too long.",3,2023,12,22
139,Super Hotel,"Positives - Lovely hotel, great pool, great location, helpful staff.
Negatives - The family studio room was a little small and some of the tech not terribly user-friendly. What's wrong with a light with an actual switch, instead of a panel with all sorts of buttons which don't really work when you're trying to keep some lights on and turn some off - e.g when doing kids bedtime...",5,2023,12,21
139,Celebration Birthday  Weekend ,"A warm and friendly reception awaits. A suburb hotel. A room with a view which is welcoming and with a high level of finish and detail. As a lifelong Bowie fan the A to Z Bowie book for bedtime reading was a lovely touch along with Andy Warhol Art. The art work throughout the hotel was captivating.
Two nights stay allowed us to have the time to space in the atmosphere and use the Spa to Roof Top Swimming Pool with views. 
The Tozi Grand Cafe for breakfast with exceptional choice set us up for the day. 
A special mention to Amran on reception with her warm and friendly welcome a beautiful smile and wonderful customer service. 
Lydia in Tozi Grand Cafe exceptional and professional customer service greeted us each day for breakfast with an attentive and courteous manner with a welcome like meeting up with a friend. Recommend the Chocolate Croissant which was most delicious.

Adjacent to Battersea Power Station Designer Outlet,  Control Room B, Lift 109, Gordon Ramsey Bread Street Resturant. Battersea Pier with River Taxi to London Bridge and VIP Tour of The Shard.
Weekend finished with tickets to ABBA Vovage. A memorable and wonderful celebration weekend.",5,2023,12,17
139,"Comfortable, fun and everything you need","The theme of the hotel was the initial appeal, but this is more than a novelty hotel. The area itself is new, with exciting and interesting surrounding buildings and plenty of amenities, shops and restaurants.
The hotel decor is perfect for art lovers and they offer art events and the option to partake in creating artwork.
The facilities are great: a restaurant; large lounge area; a heated rooftop pool and jacuzzi with a bar and a great view; a spa and sauna and the rooms are comfortable, large and quiet. 
The staff were friendly, inviting and very helpful. 
Next to this hotel are plenty of restaurants and the Battersea Power Station shopping centre, so it is ideal for staying in the area, rather than having to journey to the more central part of London. However if you need to, the nearby tube station connects you easily enough to the main lines. 
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, for comfort, fun and vibrant decor and the ideal location! A great stay and we will definitely be revisiting.",5,2023,12,15
139,"Fabulous hotel, let down by poor breakfast!","We arrived a little early for our room and were greeted by the most warm welcome we have ever received courtesy of a fabulous lady named Amran. What an incredible ambassador for the brand! Amran gave us a voucher for a courtesy drink at the bar and our bags were taken to the room when it was ready. Amran even called us when our room was available.
The hotel has a modern and contemporary design with meticulously clean rooms and tasteful art throughout.
This was easily one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in while visiting London, even better than the 5 star May Fair hotel.
We paid for breakfast in advance, based on our experiences at other Radisson hotels which we have stayed at, but sadly the breakfast was very poor. The server was very friendly and polite but the food was extremely disappointing. We ordered almond and chocolate croissants which had an unpleasant flavour and smoked salmon and scrambled egg served on toast that was so hard the Canadian ice hockey team would have been delighted to use the slices as pucks!
My wife ordered pancakes with bacon and maple syrup, but the pancakes were very dark and inedible.
There is no buffet style breakfast available and you were only permitted to choose one item from the main breakfast menu.
We would definitely like to visit the hotel again, but would opt to have breakfast elsewhere.
 ",4,2023,12,15
139,Not awful but‚Ä¶,"To be clear, this is not an awful hotel, but there were elements that really let it down. 

For starts, on booking they advertise the minibar as having complimentary soft drinks, but when checking with reception they confirmed that the fridges have pressure plates and anything removed from the minibar would be chargeable. Now I would not ordinarily make a fuss over a ¬£3 diet coke, but if something is advertised as included, then it should be so. 

Further, the TV is dreadful, the Chromecast didn‚Äôt work at all, and the sound quality was really bad - like a cheap ¬£200 off-brand TV. 

The main light in the room emitted a horrible buzz and needed to be turned off, and the electric socket supplying the coffee maker had failed. This latter problem was very promptly fixed when reported though, which is positive - though it‚Äôs disturbing that the fuse at the consumer unit had tripped and needed to be reset as this suggests an electrical fault. 

The presentation of the hotel was good though, the rooftop area was great, the best was comfortable, and the room well soundproofed. 

Unfortunately though little details make a big difference and lack of attention to detail made the experience poor.",2,2023,12,12

139,A stylish hotel on the verge of resting on its laurels.,"A stylish hotel conveniently located next to the Battersea Power Station complex but on the verge of resting on its laurels. It's comfortable with an excellent heated roof-top infinity pool. The rooms are perfectly adequate but the decor will age quickly. Most of the power sockets in our room did not function, and no attention was paid to my request for repair. The room lighting has fancy controls, but did not in the end provide very practical lighting programs.Good arrangements for early check-in and late check-out. All in all, an average stay for a fairly smart London hotel.",3,2023,11,28
139,Not Exceptional but great position.,"Relativly new hotel but the only one in the area. Lean tidy and efficient staff. Rooms were goo although upgraded (we were memebers) overlookked railway and not iconic Battersea PS. So check before you pay to UG.
Dont bother with Italian restaurant is aweful. Dont know about fine dinning one on upper level, but the bar there was pretty good and not too pretentious.",3,2023,11,27

139,The most phenomenal experience,"From the moment we walked through the door we have had the most incredible stay. Whilst the location is breath-taking - you MUST use the rooftop pool and then head down for a sauna - pictures do not do it justice, the proximity and view of Battersea Power Station is phenomenal. The beds are comfy and the interior decor beautiful, but the staff make it spectacular. Everyone could not be more helpful or welcoming. Special shout out to Jermaine who, after an issue with our aircon, could not have been more helpful or accommodating. He made sure we ended our trip on an absolute high and could not recommend the art‚Äôotel enough! ",5,2023,11,26

We were greeted by Jamaine on arrival who is very polite ,friendly & professional- when we got to our room there was an unpleasant smell in the shower area, we went out & on our return it had got a bit worse, by the morning it was awful we reported this to Jamaine when we went to breakfast by the time we had finished eating he had arranged for us to be moved a few rooms along ,we went to gather our stuff & maintenance were already in the room dealing with the problem/ shower drain. From then on  Jermaine was very attentive & made sure we were happy when ever we saw him -5 star treatment he is an asset to this hotel ",5,2023,11,22
139,"Fantastic stay, highly recommend",We stayed for 1 night (2 adults and 2 teenage children) in 2 inter-connecting rooms which was perfect for our family.  We had a brilliant stay: the rooms are very stylish with comfortable beds; the adjustable heating worked well (as we like the room to be cool at night); the staff were very helpful and friendly; the roof top swimming pool & hot tub were completely amazing and even though the weather wasn't brilliant (as expected as it was mid October!) the pool water was warm enough to enjoy it. We had a great a la carte breakfast on the Sunday morning and a delicious dinner on the Saturday evening - we all really enjoyed the food (a treat for the parents and enough variety on the menu for fussy teenagers!). We highly recommend a stay.,5,2023,11,22

As the name suggests, the hotel has a chic, arty design with well planned, vibrant, contemporary furnishings. Bedrooms are spacious & cheery, with floor to ceiling windows & uplifting decoration. Comfy bed, great shower, tea/coffee making & good sound proofing are other plus points. I didn‚Äôt use the spa but the heated rooftop pool is a fab feature & the views from up there, spectacular.

The bath robes in our wardrobe were damp, the bathroom flooded every time we had a shower, terrible pillows, pitiful & shocking lack of food allergen awareness despite forewarning them about my daughter‚Äôs peanut allergy (to the extent that she didn‚Äôt feel safe eating in the restaurant at dinner or breakfast)‚Ä¶..really really disappointing and massively over-priced. ",2,2023,11,15
139,A wedding stay to remember,"We chose this hotel for our entire wedding party to stay in after my parents having stayed here several times and thoroughly enjoying their stays. What can I say, from the point of arrival to when we left, the service was absolutely second to none. Every single member of staff at this hotel from the porters at the door, to the reception staff, the restaurant staff and at the bar were all absolutely fantastic. A special thanks to Justine and Amran from the reception team as well. I didn't catch the name of the guy who checked us in but he was fab also, we had had a stressful journey to London and I felt instantly at ease once he checked us in. A lovely porter called Ahmed made a real fuss of my son who's a toddler and helped keep him entertained whilst everybody else was sorting transport. They handled room service for us whilst getting ready the morning of the wedding, they handled storing decor for us prior to and after the wedding, delivered my bouquet to the room for me on the day and they'd upgraded us to a beautiful much bigger room so that we had the comfort of 6/7 people getting ready in one area with plenty of space. I don't think we will stay anywhere else in London now, they honestly made the weekend for us and we will likely return each year on our anniversary. Cannot recommend this hotel enough. It's worth every penny. Thanks again.",5,2023,11,14
139,Jermaine is the best as is everyone at the reception ,"The staff is very helpful. I want to give a shoutout to Jermaine at reception who is always calm, cheerful, and willing to help.  The vibe is friendly of everyone there.  I hv stayed three times already and every time it is a very pleasant and welcoming staff. ",5,2023,11,13
139,Fabulous hotel in a fantastic location ,"Fabulous hotel with lots of amenities. We booked this for our sons 16th birthday celebrations and had interconnecting rooms. We dropped off bags early ready to take in everything at Battersea returning just in time to get ready for our evening dinner. We did have a slight issue on arriving at the rooms in that the boys room was not set up as a twin as had been requested, and the birthday cake we'd asked for was also missing. Despite this hiccup, Jermaine at reception quickly arranged to rectify both issues for us, even going as far as to add a complementary bottle of Prosecco. Thank you Jermaine and team for changing this round quickly for us. We had a fabulous stay, the rooms are excellent with fab views (skyline rooms), service and staff were all wonderful and it made for a fantastic birthday celebration. We would highly recommend the hotel and will be back ourselves.",5,2023,11,13
139,Couldn't fault it,"Super hotel in great location - not central but in the buzzing, upmarket area around the iconic Battersea Power Station.

When we first entered the hotel the staff were so friendly and greeted us, we were especially impressed by the man at reception (unfortunately didnt manage to catch his name), he made such an effort to help us feel welcome and instantly said we had a free upgrade to our room, as well as giving us a complentary free drink voucher each, and a free neck massage voucher. We really felt like we had the luxury treatment. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, the price is also really reasonable for what you get.",5,2023,11,08
139,Very Happy,"I spent two nights at the art‚Äôotel at Battersea Power station. The rooms, the restaurants and facilities are excellent quality. As ever, it‚Äôs about people, and the staff were lovely from the smiling doorman to Jermaine who checked us in and made sure our stay was a great one.

The Bar on the 15th floor was lovely. So close to everything. We will definitely go back! Didn't include breakfast as I'd see previous comments. We were on the 9th floor overlooking the trains and Battersea dogs home, my son loved it! We will definitely be back :-) ",5,2023,10,30

We will be returning to the hotel at some point. ",5,2023,10,29
139,Pre-Paid Breakfast a Con,"We pre-paid ¬£45 for our breakfast at time of booking & were then charged an additional ¬£50.51 for breakfast at the hotel due to only limited items on the menu included which was not not made clear. For example we were told afterwards that Bacon, hash browns, pastries, mushrooms were all extra costs & not included in a full breakfast. This is misleading as prepaying ¬£45 you would expect at least a full English breakfast to be offered. This is a shame as otherwise the hotel is very good not cheap considering its location & would now put me off from making another booking at this hotel.  ",3,2023,10,27
139,Superb London Location,"The architecture on this site is superb. Battersea Power Station is worthy of the RIBA top award for enduring architecture.

139,"Good Stay, Lovely Jermaine","The room was bright and clean.  Mattresses comfortable.  
From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Jermaine who went out of his way to be helpful and kind we felt looked after. 
I would definitely stay here again, the area was good for shopping and eating and getting around. 
A quick easy walk to the boat or underground.
Didn‚Äôt use restaurants so can‚Äôt comment on those.
Pool has amazing views and slightly surreal being up there in the dark!
It was good that there was a small section of the room fridge which we could put our sandwiches in. 
Only criticism on rooms were‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
1)Cups for tea in the rooms were like dolls tea cups!! Maybe they could be at least a small mug???
2)We did think it was weird that you only get bottled water on the first night and not successive ones if you were staying longer.  Why?
",5,2023,10,24
139,"Lacking service, warm welcome, going above or beyond, just another transaction.","Frustratingly disappointed. 

Maybe we were unlucky given the other reviews, but the service was very lacking.

Was looking forward to a beautiful stay with my partner. Booked a king room, only to find the room we were given was a twin bed. Not what you want after a long travel.

Rang reception to change, who said they would send someone to zip the beds together. Whether this is how it's done or not, the whole idea of this having to wait for someone to come up and zip beds together is such a vibe killer. No one came in 1st hour so had to chase up again. We had plans, so had to trust someone would come and do this with our stuff in the room, received no confirmation of it being done or apology.

Was never offered another room, or anything for the inconvenience. Just a really poor experience when you're spending good money on a nice hotel.

One side is next to the railway so is probably worth the Battersea power station view if a light sleeper, but wasn't too loud.

Also requested a table at Joia, 8:30 was the earliest which is fine, only to arrive and not get seated until 9:30. Recommend just turning up early so you start this process sooner.

The rooms and hotel are beautiful in design, the beds comfy and lovely shower. Can connect phone to radio speaker or tv, but the sound is average.",1,2023,10,23
139,Poor customer service and amenities need to improve ,"Hotel location is a great, however hotel service must improve and majority of staff should learn how to be more friendly. 

Waited a long time for room orders. 
When you visit the cafe downstairs, service is very poor, they need to learn more about customer service. 

Breakfast wasn‚Äôt that great, and  took years to come. Coffee was cold. 

Lastly, swimming pool and jacuzzi temperatures will let you down, we were looking forward to swim but we didn‚Äôt last 10 mins,  water was way to cold for this time of year, spoke to staff but next day was exactly the same if not worse. 
We did not enjoyed our stay as we were hopping to. ",3,2023,10,23

139,"Amazing location, Modern but a bit pricey","Stayed here for a night with work and had a great stay. Amazing location, right over the road from the power station which is lovely and surrounded by great eating and shopping places. 

The rooms are very modern, clean and with some quirky art/design choices. They are very spacious for the central location and have decent views of the area.

Only slight areas of criticique were to do with a slightly slow checkout experience with one member of staff at peak checkout time. There also always seemed to be a bit of a wait for the lift which was a bit odd and the place is a little bit overpriced. 

Overall, would be super happy to stay here again and would definitely want to use the heated rooftop infinity pool next time!",4,2023,10,14

From the minute you walk in and smell the lovely scent until (reluctantly) dragging ourselves home, it feels like you‚Äôre in another world. The rooms are great- lovely bathroom and very comfy bed and the options for eating and drinking without even setting foot outside the hotel are fab.

139,Style over substance but a great location.,"Left feeling disappointed.

The hotel is in a great location for Battersea Power Station and Park. The views are great from the hotel restaurant. The rooms are clean and comfortable. These things make it worth it. 

The niggles are all first world stuff but I would expect more at ¬£360 a night.

Things like the room not being ready on arrival, (or an hour after in our case), the reception staff not really knowing what they are doing, the room view being a railway track, the roof top coffee bar not being open and dirty glasses and ashtrays left out. The tech not really working like the flickering TV screen. The room refills not being done. 

The room upgrade, at least in our case, was not worth it, 

Just enough to make me feel the whole thing is style over substance. I would not recommend it, 

However, the location is great.",3,2023,10,01

139,Very much in need of some staff training,"I recently visited the hotel to spend an afternoon as I had been given a gift voucher for the hotel. I was very excited to visit as the hotel looked great on the website. I decided to use part of the voucher to use the spa and tried to get in contact to book a treatment. I was told that I had to email rather than speak to someone, then a few days later I received a reply to say they had a session in the afternoon. I confirmed it worked for me and then heard nothing.  A few days before I followed up to see if it was confirmed, they emailed back to say it was but yet still no official confirmation that you would expect, with date, time, treatment etc.  I arrived at the hotel in good time as I wanted to spend the whole day there.  I made my way to the spa but couldnt find any staff there.  I looked in the changing rooms and it appeared that you needed a key to operate the lockers. I went to the main hotel reception and said I couldn't find any staff and was told there is one person who does the treatments and looks after reception, so if they were in treatments all day then nobody is on the reception. I said no problem but i would like to use the steam room but cant operate the lockers, the receptionist said I have no idea either.  I then asked if there was a bar i could get a coffee and they said yes on the roof, so up I went.  It was empty apart from 3 tables, however I still had to wave to get someones attention to get served.  There is a rooftop pool which looked nice, however I was told unless I was staying overnight, I couldnt use it.  I spent 40 mins on the roof and then made my way down to the spa where the lady was now at reception, she asked me to take a seat but the two seats in reception were both in use. 
When I got into the treatment room, she had me down as a completely different treatment to what I had booked but we soon sorted that out. The treatment itself was good and the room was really nice. After the session I said I have a voucher to pay for the treatment and I would like to use the remaining balance to purchase a product from the big display behind her. She told me she did not have a price list and so I should go to main reception to do this. 
When I went back to main reception the first person could not help me, seemed very confused and said they would get the manager. A man came out and asked if I was here for a treatment, which I explained the story again. He said he would look for a price list.  He came back to say he couldnt find one and could I come back Monday when the spa manager was in, I said I don't live locally. He went back in the back office. He came out again with a piece of paper with the spa managers email address. I explained again that I just wanted to use the rest of my voucher as was unlikely to be back anytime soon and as it was a hotel voucher and not just the spa voucher I was looking to have lunch to spend it. He said I should email the spa manager and so I decided to just leave. 
I emailed the spa manager on Monday as was told and received an out of office email to say they were away, with an alternate email to someone who was covering. I emailed that person and still no reply.  I tried to contact the hotel via Instagram to ask where I could get help and no reply. I then contacted the hotel again and was told I should send my feedback to guest services email, which I have done and still no reply. 
Having travelled a lot and stayed in many different level hotels, the customer service at this hotel is definitely the worst I have ever experienced. The staff have no idea about how the hotel runs, they don't seem interested and I am upset for my friend who spent good money on a gift voucher for me, that I have only been able to use part of. 
The hotel really needs to look at its customer services skills and also the training of its staff.  The hotel itself seems really nice created and centrally located but will fail massively if it doesn't sort out its staff.  I am just so pleased that I was not staying overnight at the hotel and was happy to walk out, as it was a really stressful and unpleasant visit. ",1,2023,09,28

The hotel has a lovely vibe to it, very stylish, great location and amazing food / drink options (Joia was had  delicious food & drink and the weirdest ice cream I've ever tasted). 
On balance; the lifts were rubbish - spent a lot of time waiting on these especially going up to the roof terrace as the stairs don't allow you to walk up that far.   The infinity pool was a bit gimmicky, very cool but no where to hang your stuff and only a handful of loungers - mostly a photo opportunity spot. The rooms although very cool were more style than function in some areas. Would still recommend and stay again. ",5,2023,09,22
139,Couple Stay,Very nice hotel within walking distance of the new Battersea power station. Great furniture and decor throughout. Really great rooftop bar and pool with great views. Staff extremely helpful throughout stay,4,2023,09,19
139,Great location,"A very modern hotel, so might be a bit ‚Äúmarmite‚Äù for some!  But the bed was supremely comfortable which is always a must for me. Bathroom was great, easy to use shower.  My only drawback was not having a mirror in the bedroom. There was a huge mirror in the hallway but the light wasn‚Äôt good enough. 
We arrived on a Saturday on a beautiful day so the hotel was busy and there was quite a long wait for the lifts. They didn‚Äôt appear to be all working?  We used the stairs a fair bit. 
The rooftop bar was lively, fantastic views and friendly staff. Could have spent all day there!  The cocktail bar on the floor below was great for a nightcap and again the staff were lovely. 
Our only criticism was breakfast, more specifically the drinks. They took forever to arrive and we did notice the girls working there spent more time chatting than making drinks.  The food was very tasty and came promptly although extra toast was missed but did eventually turn up. 
Overall we would stay again.  The whole Battersea Power Development is amazing, so much to see and do and easy access to other parts of the city.
Big praise to the staff, very friendly and welcoming, we were impressed. ",5,2023,09,18
139,Perfect stay in London,The hotel is conveniently situated at just a few 100metres away from the Battersea tube station. The hotel is brand new and very welcoming. The rooms are very luxuruous and tastefully decorated. The (heated) pool on the roof is just brilliant with a magnificent over the old power station (especially if you're a Pink Floyd fan like myself). I plan to book this hotel again as my future base evry time I retun to London.  ,5,2023,09,18

The area felt safe and comfortable as a ‚Äògated community‚Äô with the attraction of the new Battersea Power Station retail and leisure complex providing a vibrant focal point alongside a range of bars, restaurants and tremendous views of the river and city. 

Locationally it was close to  Battersea Park but somewhat detached from the wider city. As such most journeys required an Uber potentially a bus from Chelsea Bridge or river boat. 

The hotel itself was extremely comfortable and the staff could not have been more attentive. Few if any criticisms of Art‚Äôotel - a bit overboard with technology perhaps (a key pad to work the lights in the room.. difficult to find the right part of a blank key pad when it‚Äôs dark .. ). The prices in the hotel restaurant were somewhat excessive ( I‚Äôd like to have eaten more there but in principle not ¬£80 for a few coffees, two plates of pasta and a cake ).  In terms of the art, I‚Äôm a huge fan, the hotel was exciting, colourful and vibrant but it felt quite corporate and staged. I‚Äôd rather see the work of local up and coming artists on display or work from local Art College emerging talents..",4,2023,09,15
139,Art‚Äôotel. Thank you.,"The hotel is amazing, great price good facilities. Gaz in the Gym is the best PT I‚Äôve ever visited. Jermaine on Reception is so helpful and friendly. Simone in the bar/resturant is a credit to the hotel. Well done all.

I visit weekly and my stay is always a pleasure. The rooftop bar feels like your holiday.",5,2023,09,14
139,Don‚Äôt book before checking pool is available!!,"Stayed here when it first opened and had a wonderful time enjoying the pool. Rooms were clean and nice, and had no complaints regarding service. 

However, we had booked to stay a second time this weekend to enjoy the last bit of the summer in the pool again - knowing we have to be staying at the hotel to make use of the pool. Spent money on trains to get into London and to Battersea only to be told when checking in that the pool was unavailable and had been hired out. Disgraceful. We had not received an email to inform us of this when or even after booking‚Ä¶ so both time and money wasted. Where is the customer service to inform guests!? And why would private events be allowed during the weekends shutting down the pool when people are staying at this hotel for use of it!? It‚Äôs complete disregard for everyone else staying at the hotel. 

Won‚Äôt bother again.",3,2023,09,11
139,Lots of potential to be great,"We visited the hotel on one of the hottest days of the year so this may have contributed to the Chaos! 

The check in desk staff were lovely and our rooms were ready when we arrived at midday. The rooms themselves are a good size, nice beds and clean. There is a mini fridge but no pricing to indicate charges. We later found out it wasn‚Äôt complimentary. We had tried to call ahead and also emailed to see if we could book our rooms on the same floor. ( (Travelling with teenagers) We got a response to our email mid-stay, they were not able to arrange this.

Now for the chaos. As guests we were question over 10+ times in 3 hours about whether we were guest and asked to produce our key cards. This happened multiple times on the rooftop bar/ pool area. It started to get embarrassing and made us feel uncomfortable. There were lots of people drinking in the pool and the staff struggled to manage the crowds. They were unsure about who were guests and who had just walked in off the street. They need better systems in place to identify paying guest, either don‚Äôt allow anyone access without a key card or offer a ‚Äòpool‚Äô area wrist band, rather than constantly asking to see key cards over and over again. 

The lifts! They don‚Äôt work, take you to random floors and we got stuck in one, raising the alarm with no response. Waited 5 mins and the lift began working again. 

The area is great, and I can see real potential for a fantastic hotel experience if they could just iron out these issues. Unfortunately not worth the price tags at the moment. ",3,2023,09,10
139,Glorified Travel Lodge,"Staff are poorly presented and unprofessional. Someone walked up to us wearing a t-shirt at the door of the hotel on arrival and demanded to see my phone. Later turns out he was a member of the check in staff (check in is via an app), but no introduction. They were very unhelpful at the front desk when enquiring about use of the pool and also when we needed to charge a mobile phone after losing the cable. Furniture is cool and arty in appearance but has the quality of IKEA flat pack. Do not be fooled by the rooftop infinity pool. It is small and very poorly organised by staff with a few sun loungers. Guests are allowed to lie all over the decking. Very unappealing. Definitely not what you may have seen on the hotel marketing or Instagram. Very expensive and not a 4* experience. Hotel is however clean and I had a very good night‚Äôs sleep. However, we were due to use the pool area for the Saturday as we had a late flight out of London. After we saw the pool area we checked out in the morning and went elsewhere. The hotel app allows you to book use of the pool for 45 minutes. This is just nonsense in the app, and not adhered to.",1,2023,09,10
139,Worst hotel,"Glorified travel lodge! One the worst hotels I‚Äôve ever been to. Staff are unhelpful. Superficial hotel and no substance.

Handful of sun lounges. People are allowed to put towels down on the decking and you can‚Äôt even walk around. 

Would never return. Looks nothing like the pictures.

139,Can do more,"Hotel is nice it‚Äôs new staff at the front and reception very friendly but roof top very slow and 1 rude waiter thinks he is  in top boy !

Genders why not have this for bathroom and halal food for the guest who are Muslim ",3,2023,09,08
139,Such a shame ,"Everything could have been amazing , the hotel is so beautiful and the swimming pool is amazing , and so are some of the staff. 
Me and my partner have gone there for our anniversary, we are a young couple , everything was okay at first however in 1 day that we stayed there we were asked maybe 5 times for our names and room we stay in , even when we were surrounded by so many peopl members of staff would just come to us randomly asking for our names and room number as if we wasn‚Äôt staying there like everyone else . My partner was in the swimming pool when a random staff member asked him in front of everyone for a name and room number then just left , I can‚Äôt express how uncomfortable that make us feel , it felt like we were singled out from everyone just because we looked younger as we didn‚Äôt witness this happen to anyone else . These situations made us feel uncomfortable and we didn‚Äôt even use the restaurant we just ordered food from the outside and ate in our hotel room . It started to be embarrassing to be asked in front of other people like we weren‚Äôt also staying at the hotel . Such a shame as the hotel itself was so beautiful ",3,2023,09,07

139,"Great hotel, just skip the breakfast","Really liked the hotel, all staff very friendly and helpful when entering and checking in. Room was a good size, clean and comfortable.
Roof top bar and pool was a great space to spend some time.
Only downside was the breakfast, bland at best, and while our waitress was very friendly and attentive she seemed like the only member of staff that wanted to be there though.",4,2023,09,04
139,Great experience ,"Loved the bedding, so comfy. Amazing views. Min bar, cool decor. Great staff. View from swimming pool amazing. Cool area. Loved everything about my stay at this funky hotel. Didn‚Äôt use all facilities as only stopped the one night .",5,2023,09,03
139,Great hotel but we didn‚Äôt get what was advertised,"We really enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The rooftop pool really tops it off. As you walk in to the hotel it is bright and modern and smells beautiful. We were checked in by a really welcoming member of staff who really made us feel welcome. And we were able to check in early. 

We had a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us which was very kind of the hotel. 

We had booked a Art Room Skyline View King room which was meant to include as stated on their website ‚Äú‚ÄùI know to come customers it‚Äôs pennies but it was a treat for us.  Enhanced amenities include a complimentary soft drinks & snacks mini bar, Dyson hair straighteners and your own yoga mat ‚Äú‚Äù but we unfortunately only had soft drinks in the room. I did bring this up with the team and they kindly delivered a packet of crisps to the room. But I felt we didn‚Äôt get the enhanced amenities and we should have saved our money and booked the cheaper room as I feel we didn‚Äôt get anything for our money. No one seemed to know what should have been included either in terms of snacks. By this point we didn‚Äôt want to anything out of the fridge just incase we were charged. And there were no hair straighteners. So we were a bit deflated as it was a waste of money as the hotel.  

We went up to the rooftop bar after spending the day in London and the view across the pool and Battersea Power Station was amazing. 

I do highly recommend the hotel. It‚Äôs in a perfect location for transport links and it‚Äôs fresh and modern.",3,2023,09,03

139,Great location - Avoid the truly terrible room service!,"Well located hotel next to Battersea Power Station. Good breakfast and great rooftop bar and pool. Good local amenities nearby, which is just as well as the room service was truly appalling. Nearly an hour wait for some overpriced luke warm food. When the problem was raised I received a ‚Äòsorry‚Äô as the staff member walked off. 

After raising the issue with the hotel I was asked to ‚Äòexpand‚Äô on my complaint. I only ordered room service once during my two night stay, so there really is nothing to expand on‚Ä¶..",3,2023,09,01

139,London Trip,"Modern clean hotel in a great location for seeing the rest of London . Next to the iconic Power Station that must be visited.

139,"Great venue, stop allowing non-residents in","Perfect rooms and great views from the top. 
Stop allowing non-residents in to the rooftop bar. Because of crowds coming for a glass of water and a selfie, guests are not being timely served, cant use overloaded lifts and cant use pool area properly, because people are accessing pool area in a dirty shoes for a selfie",4,2023,08,27

139,Best London hotel stay,"My young daughter and I stayed here in a gorgeous room on the 14th floor. 
The room was spacious, beautiful, exceptionally well appointed and very clean. The weather was muggy outside but the hotel was beautifully air conditioned.
I loved having my room key on my phone and being able to check in remotely. The wiFi throughout the hotel was very good.
The staff in all departments we met were very friendly, knowledgeable and truly dedicated to providing the perfect customer experience.
The surrounding streets are very well looked after (footpaths were hosed down daily) and there are lots of interesting upmarket shops and eateries. Unlike much of London the area has little traffic and no crowds of people. I have to say we felt very safe walking around during the day and at night.
We were so busy we didn't get a chance to visit the pool but hopefully we can visit again soon",5,2023,08,26
139,Wonderful stay in Art‚Äôotel Battersea,"We stayed 4 nights with friends and had a wonderful time. The Hotel is located at the heart of the Battersea Power complex and has stunning views across the city from its rooftop terrace and pool area. Staff were excellent, friendly, helpful and polite. Rooms are modern clean and well appointed and our room on 14th floor had stunning skyline views. We enjoyed food and cocktails at the rooftop bar and the pool is a nice touch. Breakfast in Tozi has a great selection and was very good, staff were attentive and very polite/ welcoming. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will soon be booking for a return trip. Finally a shout out to Justine and Bogdan who made our stay extra special.",5,2023,08,26
139,Fantastic Stay,Recently stayed for 4 nights with my wife. From our check in to the time we left everything went perfectly. Whether it was the professionalism of all the staff we interacted with or the hotel itself we could not be more satisfied. Room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The shower was one of the best we have experienced on our travels. The rooftop poll was absolutely fantastic. Swam there every morning and the pool temperature was perfect. The views from the pool are spectacular the highlight being the view of the Royal Hospital Chelsea. ,5,2023,08,23

139,enjoyable stay,"The best thing about this hotel was the location - right next to Battersea Power Station. 
comfortable rooms, great food, very good service.

The design of the hotel was very modern and  minimalist which not everyone would like, but  we did. Can't fault it really.",5,2023,08,22
139,Weekend in Battersea ,"Great hotel, great location, and great staff, but something is stopping it from being excellent. We stopped for a two night break and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The room was very comfortable, well equipped,  very modern, lovely bathroom and toiletries and we slept very well. My wife said the hairdryer was amongst the best she had used when provided by the hotel.

The rooftop terrace with a pool and hot tub is a delight. We really enjoyed this at the hotel.

So now the biggest negative, they just haven't got breakfast right  the options they have all taste okay (the ones we had) but paying the rate we paid why reinvent a simple wheel, just offer buffet style continental and English breakfast. Don't limit the drinks guests can have to just 2, and stop with the somewhat pretentious current breakfast options.

We didn't eat at the hotel other than the two breakfasts, nor did we use the coffee shop, but it did look nice enough.

The credit to the hotel really is the staff. There is a relaxed, comfortable style, and they are incredibly helpful and friendly. Also, a bizarre comment but one in my opinion worthy of mentioning, the lobby area smalls amazing! Apparently, it's a fragrance the hotel has had created for them, and they are still working on it. In my opinion, stop now. We all loved it! ",4,2023,08,20
139,Fab stay at the Art'otel Battersea,"Had a perfect stay at this lovely hotel. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful.  The bedroom decor was contemporary and very tasteful.

I've stayed in London a lot, even though it was a little further, the tube and boat were really handy...you will not be disappointed I promise!!!",5,2023,08,19
139,Great view of Battersea Power Station,Staff overall were friendly and welcoming. Rooms and reception areas nice and clean and well decorated. Breakfast was really nice. The roof pool is a highlight and has fantastic view of Battersea Power Station but I believe it should be Adult Only as on our visit it was full of children splashing about which doesn't feel right in that kind of space. ,4,2023,08,17
139,Fantastic hotel and service.,"A really unique experience, particularly for the summer. The garden, roof bar and swimming pool on the roof are amazing, if you are lucky to have a sunny day it‚Äôs an amazing view and experience. The staff were fabulous and a special mention to the manager Bogdan who gave us exemplary service. Breakfast is good and you have multiple choices and the staff in the restaurant were excellent. Rooms are spacious. We had a large suite which enabled us to have a sofa bed for our children. Decent space.

139,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel and was a little worried at such few reviews since booking.  Concerned about the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù from the neighbouring  train line.  We had a room overlooking the train track and, yes you could hear the trains *but* in no way was it a disturbance - just a dull background noise at most.  Stayed with our 2 children and they loved the outlook - just past the train line are the kennels for Battersea Dogs and they watched them being walked and trained.  

Service was as involved as needed.  Remote check-in and out meant that if arrival times were obscure then you could make your way to your room with a digital room key.  We could come and go with comfort and, although quite a trendy area and hotel, we didn‚Äôt feel like our kids were a nuisance around the hotel.  The rooftop pool was lovely and luxurious- which could mean some trepidation with our young children but no one made us or them feel unwelcome.

Close facilities like the power station shops and the underground meant access to pretty much everywhere.

Downsides? Digital key was difficult to work sometimes - especially with accessing our floor in the lift.  Slight hiccup with the fire alarm being set off once in the middle of the night - but this could have happened in any building.

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back with friends!",5,2023,08,03
139,Book bed and breakfast,"Our second visit as we came for the soft opening and pool, restaurant and bar were not open on that occasion. It was our wedding anniversary and wet so the pool bar was closed, and we learned on arrival that the restaurant was closed Sunday evening. We braved the pool in the rain, and the following morning early and it was fun- quiet too due to our current summer! We booked a high room again which was lovely, but I do wish there was somewhere to sit and do makeup and hair. This time only 4 stars as the service in Tozi was patchy- and we are past the opening phase- the young staff just need a little more time and training perhaps? Hope to visit again soon.",4,2023,07,31
139,A beautiful restaurant,Just been to Joia restaurant and it is amazing from the moment you walk into the hotel to the restaurant. The service was fantastic the food was excellent and the service from Shaan was above and beyond. Thank you Shaan for making a afternoon perfect. And last but not least the the rooftop is a must. Was a beautiful day to spend my birthday,5,2023,07,29
139,Great hotel terrible bfast,Great hotel terrible restaurant. We stayed for almost a week. Hotel staff are very nice and helpful. Rooms are nicely decorated and clean. The breakfast place is terrible. Crowded and half of the staff dreamt about having another job. It takes ages to order morning coffee and a good 15 minutes just to order food. Everything is with eggs so after a while we started to bring own meals.,3,2023,07,25

Overall hotel exceeded our expectations & we are very likely to chose it for any future London visits
Just 2 minutes walk from tube station and restaurants and large shopping mall just beside hotel. 
Before I went there I saw someone mentioning train noise. Yes they pass very close to hotel but you'd need to be in incredibly light sleeper to even notice",5,2023,07,17

139,One night stay,Nice room but we were disappointed that we had the railway line outside our bedroom window. Bed very comfortable and air-conditioning was quiet. No where to to do hair and make up!  So many hotels fail on this. Small but nice bathroom. Too much light in the morning need better curtains. Breakfast was ok .. staff were all good. Had dinner in the restaurant great service nice food but very expensive.,3,2023,07,15
139,Disappointing,"Was very excited to check out the new art'otel which is in a really fun and cool area of London. Unfortunately, overall the staycation was underwhelming for a few different reasons. 

Check in was great, Jude was super welcoming and helpful which was a great start, as well as the gentleman who was greeting us by the door - very friendly and accommodating. Appreciated the dog amenities placed in the room. 

Had a steak for room service lunch which came extremely well done and overcooked like rubber so for the hefty price of it, this was disappointing.

The bar on Saturday evening was busy and nice, perhaps slightly understaffed since they had too many orders at once, making it take some time to get drinks but overall a nice atmosphere.

What particularly ruined the stay was the behaviour and rudeness of the staff on Sunday at the bar by the pool. The man at the bar would barely look at guests around him and once I finally got an order in, I had to come back 30 minutes later from the pool to check on the order to which he rudely said the margarita machine would be ready in 20 more minutes. That's fine, but the bar opened an hour ago so communication would have been appreciated because then we would have just ordered something else instead of waiting 50 minutes for a drink. 

When the drinks finally came, they were the wrong drinks so we let the waiter know but told him not to worry about it but it's not what we ordered. 

Shortly after, a woman came really rudely asking us what the problem was. It was weirdly hostile and we just explained that we waited nearly an hour and then got the wrong drinks and she basically told us we got what we ordered and that if we want anything else we need to go back to the bar to re-order. Just a really strange situation in a hotel where you would expect a friendly level of service to meet the value you're paying for the room. After waiting an hour to get drinks and then encountering rude and hostile staff members was a buzz kill so we decided to just leave and explore the town instead. 

It also took nearly an hour from when we sat down to when we got our food at breakfast and we got the wrong item again. It was difficult again to get the attention of staff.

Feedback was given in an internal survey but no one acknowledged this which was disappointing except for a very generic response.

",3,2023,07,10
139,Amazing experience,"Reception staff was absolutely amazing:) so polite and helpful. Rooms are beautiful and clean. Ask for stefy and she will help with anything.
Overall great hospitality and experience! Would absolutely recommend.",5,2023,07,05
139,The Cover is Better than the Book,"‚ÄúThis is like a nightmare.‚Äù  That‚Äôs what my wife said after only a few hours following check-in at the Art‚Äôotel.  In that short amount of time, we were moved from our first room because of electrical problems.  Our second room was not clean to the standard you‚Äôd expect for $600/night, and housekeeping had to come change the bedding.  Finally, around 11pm my wife woke me up to tell me there was no water for her to shower after her workout.  I went to the front desk to show them videos of the issue, and it wasn‚Äôt long before they realized the issue was affecting the whole building.  I will say the staff at the reception desk has been kind & apologetic while trying their hardest to fix the issues.  But if this is day one, I‚Äôm almost certain we‚Äôll find another option for our next stay in London.  The most disappointing part is we chose this stay to celebrate my wife‚Äôs 45th birthday, and sadly I think it‚Äôll be remembered for the wrong reasons.",2,2023,07,05
139,"Has potential, just not now","The one good feature of this hotel is the heated pool and hot tub on the roof. Of course it is always crowded but early morning dippers have a chance.

Apart from this one feature I really do not know what to say. I can only put down the poor customer orientation to the fact that it is a new hotel and at these times of employee shortage they have probably just hired who they could.

One example will illustrate ‚Äì One of the lifts was faulty. It would allow passengers to go in, but it would neither move not open the doors. Effectively anyone entering was trapped till the next person came in. We were also duly trapped along with two others who had entered before us. I hit the emergency alarm and the hotel staff got me out. When I asked, the casual response was ‚ÄúOh that has not been Ok for a while now‚Äù. Then why is there no signage? Why is the lift even powered on? (It hadn‚Äôt been fixed 5 days later as we checked out.)

We received a breakfast order of Mushroom on Toast without the Toast! We had to explain to the service person what was wrong!

I realised now the lots of little things that we take for granted in an established hotel with experienced staff.

I am sure some months from now, if the staff stay on and the hotel internalises all this feedback it will become a good property. For now I will avoid.
",2,2023,07,04
139,Terrific but scary,Best hotel. Great facilities. Great staff. Pool bar on the roof is terrific. Why do you allow the local suburban gang to run riot in the rooftop bar?  It was threatening.

139,Just a couple of meters away from a busy railway,"Although the hotel looks trendy and seems to enjoy a nice reputation so far, half of it faces a railway. When I shared with the Receptionist that I was concerned about my sleep and asked if I could change a room, I was told that the hotel was fully booked and provided with a box of earplugs (!)
So if you can sleep with trains passing by every 10 minutes, the place should be ok. Otherwise, my advice is to stay away ..",1,2023,06,11

139,Family Stay,"Excellent Hotel, location, staff and Cleanliness. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this property to families and for business travelers. The only disadvantage is the pool is too cold to swim, would have been great if it were indoors/ covered.",5,2023,06,04
139,Nice location for Chelsea Flower Show,Average hotel experience but great location for the Chelsea flower show. The pool area is small but the view to the Battersea Power Station and surrounding areas is amazing. Would suggest a visit to Lift 109. ,3,2023,05,31
139,A great central London hotel,"We were hugely impressed with the hotel, its condition, its facilities and its people. We had a really enjoyable break for my wife's 40th birthday. The roof top pool and bar was excellent.We hope to be back soon.  ",5,2023,05,31
139,"Great pool, the rest needs time to improve","We stayed here as a familty of four - my husband and I and our 7 and 5 year olds. Overall a positive stay, with the pool the highlight.

 We stayed in a familty suite which was small but perfectly ok for a night as we spent little time in there. The room was well finished, although the mini bar was empty and there was very limited tea etc. Mega comfy beds and bedding etc. 

The highlight was the pool, and although I'd worried the kids might not be welcome (I even called beforehand to confirm) they were absolutely at home there and the vibe was relaxed, inclusive. Pool temperature is lovely and the view is incredible.  Towels were hard to come by both times we went up there and despite asking at the bar and even going down to our room to call down and request some, they took a long time to come (30 -45 mins).  

Because we hadn't really known how the day would go we didn't plan an evening meal in advance - as Londonders we should know better! Local restaurants  were so busy we couldn't get in anywhere so we ate at the hotel which was disappointing. Service was slow, the food was average to poor and it felt really over priced in view of those things.  Breakfast was much speedier and the choice was broad enough to keep us all happy.  The kids enjoyed their pastries and fruit, I enjoyed my eggs but the pancakes tasted almost of nothing which is near impressive. 

Overall the hotel was welcoming - particularly to the children - and has a huge draw with the pool. Service will likely improve as the team find their feet and at worst was slow, not poor. However, I'd steer clear of eating at the hotel. ",3,2023,05,31
139,Unique,"This Unique hotel has the great Location , amazing View of a historic Landmark and if your lucky enough with the English weather the Crown Jewel is  on the roof which is best enjoyed to yourself for a morning swim when the Tourists are not up at the Bar ",5,2023,05,30
139,Very good for a treat!,"Would recommend for a night away but expensive!  All positives for the location, room etc.  breakfast was a little busy as table service so took time for food to be served.  Roof top infinity pool is great.",4,2023,05,30
139,Nicer hotels to stay in.,"We stay in London on average 3 times per year. We decided to stay in Battersea to visit the Battersea power station so the art o‚Äôtel was the perfect location. We arrived at 3pm to check in to be told our room wasn‚Äôt ready, absolutely no apology. I told the person on reception that we had a reservation for a restaurant at 4pm. The room was eventually ready at 3.25pm, no apology whatsoever. 
The room was ok. Stains on the carpet made me feel that maybe the room wasn‚Äôt as clean as it should be!! Good quality bedding and the bed was comfortable. 
There are much nicer hotels to stay in in London. We won‚Äôt be staying again.",3,2023,05,29
139,Disgusting dirty scrunched up tissue under the bed,"It started so well with the app check in and the key card on the phone what could go wrong? Try going up and down in the lift 4-5 times each time you get in it and with no stairs accessible you have no choice, you hold your phone near the control panel a bit like you do when you pay for something press 7 and it goes past because someone wants to get in on 9 and so on and on. 
My daughter being inquisitive looked under the bed to find a scrunched up old tissue we left it there not knowing what could be on it and told reception on our way out to dinner, he said he would send someone up straight away. Later when we got back the tissue was still there with a tired kid and WhatsApp the only way I could see to contact them I messaged them they didn‚Äôt seem that bothered they said what would you like us to do, I said nothing it‚Äôs to late now my daughter is in bed, I didn‚Äôt sleep that well it was on my mind how clean actually was the room? Had they even changed the sheets? Couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there manky tissues under the bed it‚Äôs disgusting",1,2023,05,28
139,art'otel,"Had a fantastic night, wish I had booked for longer, location is next to the old power station, the staff were all friendly and very helpful. If you stay here make sure you take your swimwear as the rooftop pool and bar are amazing. The bar and restaurant on the 15th floor was excellent and lively.
Its not the cheapest hotel around, but great value for a central London location, only a short walk to the Uber boat terminal so getting to other London landmarks is easy.",5,2023,05,28
139,Wonderful stay ,"
Gorgeous hotel full of color, reception team were amazing, food in Joia very tasty. The view from the rooftop and the pool are¬†exceptional.

139,Wonderful stay with fantastic rooftop experience,".

Our stay at Art'otel was simply wonderful, starting from the moment we stepped into the lobby. The staff were incredibly friendly and efficient, and made us feel right at home. We highly recommend visiting the rooftop bar for its fantastic food and cocktails, and of course, the breathtaking view of the city.",5,2023,05,24
139,Magical Art Hotel,"Being a born and bred Londoner, it was a treat  staying next to such an iconic landmark as battersea power station. The hotel and staff were wonderful in every respect. The view from the rooftop lounge feels like you‚Äôve been transported to magical realm. I will definitely being coming back soon for summer sun fun. Thank you!",5,2023,05,24

A big thank you to the reception team for their help and recommendations and for making us feel at home!

We had a wonderful stay and we‚Äôll definitely return! ",5,2023,05,24
139,5 star stay!,"Wow! What a find! The hotel is stunning!

We revived a wonderful welcome from the staff on reception and the views from the roof top are world class! 

Great for any occasion.

I cant wait to go back again! 

Thank you Art Hotel for making my stay so memorable.",5,2023,05,24
139,"Unprofessional staff, rude night management ","Very bad service from night staff manager rude and unprofessional after being charged for a non refundable booking I had asked the night manager for an early check in which he refused and said I needed to pay the amount again meaning I would pay twice which was very frustrating for as I was tired and needed to sleep, I only book 5 star hotel because I expect a professional and understanding service, it‚Äôs a shame because the hotel is nice but the staff are very unprofessional a big shame I was turned away and left out of money 614 pounds. Which is considered stealing. ",1,2023,05,23
139,Music Video Shoot - Excellent!,"We used Artotel Battersea Creative Rooms for a Music Video shoot and I couldn't be happier with the service. Mai was brilliant at coordinating with me and offering help every step of the way. On the day, Matteo was spectacular. So friendly and helpful. It was a difficult day for him and the crew as there were lots of moving parts. Loading kit from the loading bay to the creative space, organising key cards for us to get around the building, moving the doors and changing the lights at specific times, keeping lunch warm for us as we ran over slightly. He was always on call and just brilliant to work with - we couldn't have done it without him! Thanks Mai & Matteo!",5,2023,05,23
139,Battersea,Cracking Hotel! The view was amazing and I loved the a la carte breakfast. Make sure you use the pool and rooftop bar. The rooms were great and the staff were excellent! Would recommend for a romantic weekend.,5,2023,05,19
139,"Spacious and clean, modern decor",Overall very comfortable stay although there is a bit of glitching in TV and phone and the internet connection to my ipad.  Shower drain gives off a bad smell.  The staff are very welcoming and responsive when anything is requested.,5,2023,05,18
139,Very pleasant stay,"This hotel was just opened and everything is brand-new. It is very conveniently located 4 min from the underground station. The area is nice, new, and safe. There are two pleasant food stores 3 min walk from the hotel. the hotel offers a nice restaurant, and there are several cafes in the mall across the road from the hotel. The rooftop swimming pool at the hotel is a must (heated water, plus a hot tub). The staff is very friendly and ready to help. My wife and I stayed there for 7 days in May 2023 and we are so glad we have chosen this hotel. Oh, forgot to mention the hotel art / decoration, very innovative colorful, and cheerful.",5,2023,05,18
139,"Great location, lots to see and do","Outstanding service from the start (thank you Naomi) and the room was excellent.  We felt like special guests and nothing was too much for the staff.  The meal at the upper floor restaurant was delicious as was the extensive choice of breakfast in the lobby restaurant.  Visiting the Battersea Power Station was a real eye opener and whilst we only had a few hours to spare, we felt we could have spent all day and still had more to discover.  It genuinely deserves 5 stars across the board!",5,2023,05,14
139,Great Stay! ,"Fabulous hotel. large comfy beds (although the thin pillows really need upgrading!) , quiet, excellent staff. Very cool vibe. Excellent location for all south of the river galleries etc. Highly recommended for a luxurious break ",4,2023,05,14
139,Not got it together yet and who the hell designed the bathrooms!,"We booked a Twin room as shown on the photos, reasonable sized beds with reasonable distance between them, which means a reasonable sized room overall. In spite of asking the sullen female receptionist three times that is was the twin room we booked I was given a key to the following: Small room with a double bed with two mattresses both of which had been made up separately. However this does not constitute a twin bed even with separate sheets as they are shoved together as a double bed. And the room too small to move them apart. The front of the room was right opposite the lifts and associated noise and the view from the window was of a railway track. The bathroom had no towel drying rails causing us to have to lay our clean towels on the floor. There were no shelves at all upon which to store our own cosmetics or bathroom essentials. The sink was about the size of a sink found on an aircraft toilet and was at the height of my knees. I am 6'3"" and trying to bend down to wash my face meant water going everywhere. Then we found no mini-bar or fridge in the cupboard that was clearly designed to house one, an overly complicated coffee machine with only one single coffee capsule between two of us and no milk to go with a cup if we tried to make one. Otherwise a few horrible sachets of powered coffee. When I gave feedback to the reception and reminded the female receptionist that I had asked her repeatedly to make sure it was a twin room all I got was a scowling face and attitude leaving it to a male colleague to step in and try to help us. We travel to London very often and this was our first visit time with this hotel. It will certainly be our last and I would not recommend the hotel at all to anyone.",2,2023,05,05
139,great great great ,"fantastic big room, comfortable bed, views to die for, service so good(receptionsit left us a nice welcoming postcard), convenientent to underground station, excellent breakfast included with room, service at the restaurant great, drinks at the br complicated and not vert tasty - overall amazing ",4,2023,05,05
139,Very Very Good,Brilliantly situated with informal restaurants & bars on your doorstop and ideally located to walk on the Thames walk to Putney and Hammersmith and in Battersea Park without it being rammed with people the a relax in the roof top jacuzzi,5,2023,05,02
139,High end facilities and perfect and location,"Class hotel with great facilities and a stunning rooftop bar/pool. Perfect location to explore ‚Äònew Battersea‚Äô. staff were very welcoming from the doorman, to reception to very friendly breakfast and rooftop bar staff. ",5,2023,05,02
139,Nice little bit of luxury,"my sister & I went to London for a couple of days for our Birthdays so we splashed out on this luxury hotel yes its  more then you would want to pay but it was well worth it .The weather wasn't the best but we managed to get in our swims in the amazing roof top pool with the added bonus of the hot tub lovely warm robes that were needed for after. The breakfast that was included in the price was vey nice all made to order( no buffet )witch I I liked better.the rooms are very comfortable . the area around  Battersea is very nice for a little stroll & the shopping mall is nice to walk around & get a coffee we also visited the dogs home & signed the book of condolence for Paul O'Grady .If you want a bit of luxury in a not overcrowded area the this is the place to go .Lastly the staff at this hotel are very friendly ,informative & so very helpful",5,2023,05,02
139,Lovely hotel. Some things to iron out,"We had a great stay here. Checkin staff are excellent, the bed was one of the most comfortable I‚Äôve ever slept in, and the pool really is the icing on the cake. Spectacular setting! The main issue we had was the breakfast service was completely shambolic (shame as the food was nice). Tozi are completely letting the hotel down. We waited an hour for our food and it just ended our stay on a bit of a sour note. Otherwise I would really recommend this hotel!",4,2023,05,02
139,Explore Battersea in style,"Lovely hotel, well thought through. A bot pricey for what and where it is but we'll worth a visit as an alternative to the usual London hotels. The rooftop pool is amazing! Checkout what to do at the Power Station before you travel - there's lots to see! The extension of the Northern line is really useful for travel into London. ",4,2023,05,02
139,An excellent weekend in London,Great hotel with a lovely feel and friendly staff. Rooms were clean and well maintained. A fantastic location with great views. Loved the rooftop pool and jacuzzi - was great even in slightly cold April! ,5,2023,05,01
139,Family weekend,Had a weekend away with the family. could not fault the hotel. We loved it and staff very friendly and helpful. Also good location for tube and getting around. Swimming pool was a great extra and views fab,5,2023,05,01
139,Best hotel in london,"We had the most fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. 
The staff were so lovely and the roof top bar was gorgeous. 

Rhea in the roof top bar was such a brilliant waitress and looked after me and my wife so well. She always had a big smile on her face and she is great at her job. 

Simona in the roof top bar made our stay so enjoyable and so welcoming . He did everything possible to make me and my wife have a fantastic anniversary weekend away. We couldn‚Äôt thank him enough. 

The reception staff were also fantastic and they are probably one of the best reception team we have ever come across. 

We couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more highly. ",5,2023,04,30
139,very modern and  lovely staff,"The team of front team staff were wonderful. The left luggage most helpful. Very well equped rooms but too high tech for older guests. roof top swimming pool is a wonderful feature. Tasteful, artistic decor through out.
",5,2023,04,29
139,Great design led hotel,"Really amazing hotel. Design led rooms with great facilities and in room features, Dyson hairdryers and styling. Vinyl player. Cocktail station. 
And the restaurant is great. Still finding it‚Äôs feet but still great!",5,2023,04,29
139,Great place,"Love the hotel, the location, the room, the check in service, the atmosphere, the breakfast. Didn‚Äôt see the pool, but may be next time. I loved my stay, it was a pleasure. Highly recommended. But be aware that the breakfast is not included.  ",5,2023,04,28
139,Art'allright,"It is a great experience to sleep in good proportioned bed with the great views over the city of London. The staff is top in professionalism and kindness. The touches of art everywhere are a must for those who appreciate and even to the others as it is impossible to miss the vibrant energy that exhales from the dozens of pieces on the site. Tozi is also a must-visit. The only downside for me is the room windows completely hermetic and locked. Apart of that, five stars from top to bottom.",5,2023,04,27
139,"Fabuolus location, superb facilities and amazing customer service","Loved this hotel. There wasn‚Äôt anything standard about it. It was very modern, relaxed but luxurious. Every person we interacted with was so professional and helpful. Location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing. Rooftop pool had amazing views and the sauna and steam room were an added bonus though these are in the basement not near the pool. Nevertheless they were both easy to get to via the lifts. 
",5,2023,04,26
139,"Lovely Hotel -early days, lot of potential",Great looking hotel with friendly staff.  Just in it's infancy so learning as they go.  Will be a true London highlight come the summer.  Good brand and top location.  Swimming pool was a must but I think it will be very busy in the warmer months.,3,2023,04,26
139,Anniversary stay,We stayed for one night for our anniversary and the staff made sure it was an excellent evening for us providing champagne and flowers in the room upon arrival. The room was great with a nice view across London. Would highly recommend ,5,2023,04,26
139,London Marathon Stay,"Very nice stay, great location with the power station facilities as well to enjoy, public parking locally available, we were able to arrange an early check in which was appreciated, friendly staff throughout the hotel",4,2023,04,26
139,Fresh and funky!,"Had a blast at art‚Äôotel! It‚Äôs fresh, funky and fun. The infinity pool is certainly the icing on the cake. Swimming in the rain overlooking the London sites was an experience not to be missed or taken for granted. Friendly reception staff and loved the bar. The only slight downside was the breakfast at the Tozi restaurant. Apart from one member of staff, all others looked bored and the food choice was limited. However, this must not detract from an excellent stay at a wonderful hotel. ",5,2023,04,26
139,"Amazing beds, dreadful breakfast","The beds are amazing with decent pillows and the shower was really excellent - the staff are first class on the whole and the rooms very clean but... we didn't have the advertised free mini bar, I tried to check out from the room and couldn't, reception was busy but the man Tok my room number and said that's fine and waved me off - I am still waiting for my invoice which is worrying. The breakfast is BAD! SO slow -20 minutes yesterday in a quiet restaurant to get a drink... and the cooked options... no thanks. They need to get their act together because the breakfast team and offering lets the whole place down",3,2023,04,20
139,"Fantastic for families, and couples alike.","Fantastic Hotel, staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. Kids were welcome in the amazing rooftop pool which has something of a star quality about it. Great area to visit for a weekend, splendid stuff. You might choose to leave the kids at home, we didn‚Äôt and although not cheap it was worth every penny.",5,2023,04,16
139,Absolutely top class service and stay ,"The most fantastic stay . We were extremely lucky with the weather and got to enjoy the roof terrace , pool and jacuzzi with truly spectacular views of the iconic tower . The hotel itself is so beautiful , modern , cool and not so big that you don‚Äôt feel like just a number but a valued guest . The breakfast was lovely fresh juices and lobster Benedict . We also used the sauna and steam which were obviously brand new and we were the only ones in there .Rodrick on reception was first class , super friendly and helpful. The regeneration of the power station is fantastic and was lovely to stroll around the local area which feels safe and cosmopolitan. This hotel will be a regular on our go to list of london favourites and I shall be telling everyone to visit ! Thank you art‚Äôotel !!!",5,2023,04,08
139,"Ahmed Adam, Front of House",Such lovely staff here. Went above and beyond to help and make me feel welcome. I can't wait to visit again. Thank you. The pool and jacuzzi on the 16th floor is amazing with fabulous views of London.,5,2023,04,05
139,"Great Hotel, Poor Breakfast","Excellent new hotel at Battersea Power Station.

From the minute we arrived staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds and an excellent shower.

Viewings of the Power Station were great, especially from the roof top pool.

Great cocktails in the 15th Floor bar.

My only negative is the Tozi Grand Cafe where they serve breakfast. The food was bland and tasteless and service chaotic. If you stay at the hotel on a room only basis, use another venue outside hotel for breakfast.

I would definitely stay here again.

139,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel, location, new, clean, quiet, best of all the staff - all staff were smiley, happy and helpful ! In order to meet the ridiculous 200 character minimum review length on this website I'll talk some rubbish.
Will be back thanks.",5,2023,03,20
139,Two sides,"I'm a carer I don't get away that often and this was my treat but it didn't feel like that at times. Firstly I think there was a mess up with my room, plus I paid for a upgrade on a view it isn't a view it's a railway line! 
Moved rooms, then it was the service charge for drinks! Be aware 2 gins with tonic cost my sister ¬£40! And we couldn't book at the restaurant. None of this was explained to us at check in. 
The bed was lovely but the pillows were very hard. 
The breakfast was lovely the eggs were very tasty but they don't offer a full English. The coffee was great.
But what is really good was the rooftop birds eye views of Battersea and beyond. And sat in a jacuzzi in the morning. That was lovely. ",3,2023,03,20
139,Good but not quite great yet!,"Many of the points I could make have already been made by others as I think this hotel is still finding its way. Its a beautiful hotel, very modern and luxurious and my Junior Suite for 2 nights last week was amazing despite a few issues. It was room 120 so on the first floor (no view!) and the photos on the website are not exactly what you get when it comes to the complimentary mini bar.  The snack tray was completely empty and the fridge had no choc or anything to eat at all ... was a long journey and I wanted to snack!  I did ring down a few times and someone came up with coffee pods and when I asked for snacks she obviously didn't understand me and just shrugged!  Eventually someone came on the second day with crisps.  Its not a biggie but these little things leave an impression.  As with others' comments the lifts were an issue sometimes with only 1 of the 3 working, some of the sockets didn't work and the bedroom light flashed on and off at random times during the first night. I also tried to use the app but was told this wouldn't be live until the official opening in April. The staff at the desk and in the restaurant were lovely and the food and drinks were very good, if pricey.  On checking out I asked for the bill to be printed but this proved impossible so it was emailed instead.  On checking later in the day I saw I had been charged ¬£60 for water from the 'complimentary' soft drinks mini bar!   I have emailed twice to guest relations in the last week (no reply) and didn't get the promised call back when I telephoned which is really disappointing.  I do like the hotel but at ¬£740 per night was it worth it?... probably not!  With so many really good hotels in London (although the location of this one is fantastic) I think I'll wait a while before staying here again and give them a chance to iron out their issues.  Hopefully it will be amazing in all respects eventually.",4,2023,03,13
139,"modern great location , shame not all good yet !","Room really nice modern clean , not all the plugs in room worked , problems with the lifts not going to correct floors , but the worst bit is bar service really slow , was charged ¬£25 for a glass of house champange ! and the barman just poured it out so it over flowed in glass no holding the glass at an angle ! shame as all looks so nice but they need to sort service out , the main bar guy did sat they just not got enough staff . but it not a cheap hotel so should sort it , best but is the roof top pool warm and great views . ",3,2023,03,05
139,"Amazing pool - good hotel, will soon (hopefully) be great!","Stayed for one night here and was very impressed.  Lovely and new - but a bit of a feeling that they‚Äôre still ironing out snagging issues.  
The front reception chap was very friendly, as was the doorman in the lobby.  The room was trendy and comfortable.  However, the pool was sensational - especially as we ended up having it to ourselves.  Amazing view and will soon become very well known, I‚Äôm sure.
Only three gripes preventing five stars:  the lifts seemed to not be programmed correctly and was a pain getting one, and then going to the right floor.  The night room service menu options were dreary beyond belief and the app to order them didn‚Äôt work on either of our phones anyway.  Lastly, the light in the wardrobe wouldn‚Äôt turn off which was an issue due to massive gaps between the doors, and it being right next to the bed.
I‚Äôm sure these three gripes will be ironed out over the coming weeks - when they do, this hotel will be sensational.",4,2023,02,28
139,Luxury hotel,"Great hotel, modern decor, hotel smells amazing. Rooftop pool & jacuzzi was amazing with great view of power station. 
Only issue was that fire alarm went off at in night which was frightening. Someone had been smoking in room we found out next day 
Great hotel & great position on the river.",4,2023,02,20
139,Fantastic pool and Hot Tub on the roof!,"We stayed here for the weekend for my husbands birthday and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. It is a little expensive but it was a treat. All the hotel staff were very friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome. I like the relaxed atmosphere but did find it a little unusual that staff didn‚Äôt have any kind of uniform to identify them as staff not fellow guests, but it didn‚Äôt distract from their great service. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The bed was without a doubt the most comfortable we have ever slept in and we both had a good nights sleep. I was slightly worried about the train line as I‚Äôm a very light sleeper but I couldn‚Äôt hardly hear it. The rooftop pool and hot tub were open and that was a nice surprise, great views and definitely a great addition to the hotel. We booked breakfast and unfortunately that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt give 5 stars, the service in there was poor. The staff were all very polite and welcoming but you just seemed to be sitting there waiting and waiting and waiting while all the staff were busy but nobody seemed to be watching to see who was ready to order. Unfortunately this happened on our first morning and was then worse on our second morning, we sat with a coffee for almost 40mins before my husband got up, the staff were very apologetic but unfortunately it‚Äôs already spoiled the experience if you have to be asked to be served. Unfortunately if you book breakfast in with your room rate you have already paid in advance and so you can‚Äôt even refuse to pay or leave and go somewhere else. A real shame and not a great way to end our stay.",4,2023,02,20
139,"So good, I didn‚Äôt want to leave üåü","I booked this hotel as soon as I saw it was fully open, it is just a moments walk from Battersea‚Äôs new tube station. This first thing I noticed was it‚Äôs amazing new smell along with its own unique hotel scent, we were checked in by a lovely friendly lady, front of house called Weronika, we were early but she allowed as check in an gave us an upgrade to a higher floor, the key card didn‚Äôt allow access to the roof top pool, so a young man call Jude came to our room and took us up, he checked we had towels before leaving us, the open heated pool was absolutely fabulous, I spent hours in it.  
  
My room was spacious with a modern feel, the bed was super comfortable and the room had everything I had learn to expect from a Radison hotel. Mini bar, coffee machine, hairdryer and steamer. Perfectly silent air con/ heater.   

We had a drink in the bar before heading out to take a look around the newly developed Battersea and Battersea power station.  

The staff were all so nice, they gave the impression they genuinely liked working at the hotel.  

This will be the place to been seen by the body beautiful and Instagram influencers in the summer, it is has a great atmosphere with space to have a summer to remember.",5,2023,02,19
139,"Excellent stay in first class hotel, away from the crowds","Great stay on a weekend in Feb '23. Rooms are clean, spacious and modern with great views of the Power Station and across London on higher levels. Beds are so, so comfy and huge with crisp white linen and the rain shower is enormous with complimentary premium shower, soaps etc. 

We didn't try the restaurant but the bar served excellent cocktails.

The rooftop pool, bar and lounge-deck will be amazing when it warms up soon, the the hot tub was amazing in Feb with great infinity-views.

The staff that we engaged with were really friendly and helpful.

Would def stay again if needed to in the area. It's a little awake from the crowds and sights of central London but that's a bonus is many respects. It's stone's throw from the Northern Line and the Uber boat pier. Def give it a stay for a first-class luxury stay, away from the madding-crowds!",5,2023,02,18
139,Art meets Battersea!,We were interested in the look of this new hotel and decided to stay after a theatre trip. Lovely lobby and decor. Our room had a great view of Battersea Cat and Dogs which was fun and trains which my husband loves so he was pleased. Nice and quiet still though. We had a meal and breakfast. Some interesting dishes and a shout out for our server the lovely Louis. Love to visit again when Pool etc open.,5,2023,01,29

139,NYE & Birthday Celebration.,"We stayed here 31/12/22 so where do I begin...
A few days before we actually stayed at the hotel we popped along to have a look as we live close by.
We were greeted by a lovely young lady by the name of Serina who offered to give us a tour of this brand new hotel. The hotel opened I believe on the 12th Dec 2022 so its still in the ""soft opening"" phase,
I personally thought it was a really nice gesture offering to show us round considering our room was already booked so it wasn't like they needed to sell it.
Starting on the roof it has a nice sized pool & jacuzzi with a close up view of the power station, so close you feel like you could touch it. The roof has a bar with plenty of seating & I can imagine when its fully open its going to be a cool spot to hang out & have a drink or two.
The gym & spa are really nice too, there are a few therapy rooms along side a sauna & steam room which we made full use of during our stay. As it is still in the ""soft opening"" phase they didn't have any therapist however we was offered the option of a mobile therapist to come in and do treatments which they would happily arrange.
Next was a peek at the hotel signature restaurant ""JOIA"" its not open yet but should be come February,
personal opinion really classy space with floor to ceiling windows. I for one can't wait to book and try it out.
So fast forward a couple of days we arrived around 2pm and was told our room was ready which was great. We were greeted like old friends, the staff are all young and come across really friendly and you could just tell they wanted your stay to be great experience.
Upon check-in we were given an upgrade to a ""Art Room Skyline View"" nice touch.
The room is hip if that's the word, decor was nice and a good size. Bathroom has a shower only but it's nicely done. The room has a espresso machine along with tea & biscuits, loved the fact I could have espresso absolutely hate instant coffee so again another plus.
Within 20mins of being in the room there was a knock at the door & Serina along with a waiter kindly came with a bottle of prosecco, a bowl of clementines & a birthday cake curtsy of the hotel really nice touch & I felt rather spoilt. ""Thank you Serina""
We opted to have dinner at the hotel ""TOZI GRAND CAFE"" Service was impeccable and the food was great.
to start we had calamari along with crispy sage & salted anchovy (crispy sage was delicious).
For main we had the lobster linguine for 2 and it was to die for. Would I come back 100% yes.
The NYE entrainment was up on the roof to watch the fireworks, tickets were ¬£100 per couple which included a bottle of prosecco. Not the greatest view of the fire works as the chimneys of the power station obscured the view however the atmosphere was good & everyone seemed to be having a good time regardless.
We booked bed & breakfast and opted to have it in our room instead of downstairs at TOZI purely because we knew we would be nursing a hangover!!! Breakfast was great we both had smoked salmon & scrambled egg, along side chia porridge, buckwheat & mixed nut granola, a choice of fresh juice or a smoothie ""Detox Zing"" to be precise was our choice, again trying to combat one to many Prosecco's from the night before, oh & before I forget a perfectly made latte.
The breakfast menu had a good choice, I think it has something for everyone. Next time I'm going for the ""Lobster Benedict""....
Well our time came to an end even with a late check-out, we genuinely was sad to leave I could have definitely done with another night!!!
So all in all we had an amazing time,  WELL DONE art'otel I wish you good luck for your future here in Battersea
& to everyone working at the hotel especially Serina keep up the good work & enthusiasm we had a blast. Janine & Paul xx",5,2023,01,10
139,Fantastic Stay and Lovely Staff,"Seriously stylish decor accompanied with extremely comfy bed, glorious shower and totally delicious breakfast. I had a very tiny baby with me and I got into a pickle at one point with some bits and bobs and the staff there really pushed the boat out to help. I couldn't recommend this hotel more - just fab.",5,2023,01,08
139,Interesting ultra modern hotel.,"We were some of the first guests at this ultramodern hotel which is a two minute walk from Battersea Power Station. Spacious public area and generously sized rooms. The wet room is also excellent. Railway lines going in and out of Waterloo and Victoria are close by but any noise is very well suppressed. Some of the high tech stuff is a little confusing. We forgot to tap our key card on entering the lift and went nowhere until we remembered. Young staff obviously inexperienced but very enthusiastic. They will soon grow into the job. We were on a B&B deal that, astonishingly, did not include orange juice, for which we paid ¬£12 for two glasses. A pathetic piece of penny pinching that may put us off returning!",4,2022,12,15
139,Very noble very modern. Nice rooms and friendly staff,Very modern hotel with nice ambience. All noble. Breakfast a bit confusing a la carte and not perfectly organized but still delicious. The rooms are very clean and the staff friendly. I would come back and book without breakfast,4,2024,10,03
139,Pretty.,"The hotel is located within a beautiful well-kept and controlled area, with restaurants, bars and a fantastic shopping centre. Overall it's cute, with the Seventies decor typical of the Radissons, but I won't go any further. Far enough from the heart of London, an Uber from the hotel to Piccadilly costs ¬£14/16: a regular 21/22 taxi.",3,2024,09,10
139,Hotel genial y perfecto.,"Excelente hotel en una zona pr√°cticamente nueva, estuvimos hace 15 a√±os, visitamos el barrio y estaba todo desolado, ahora da gusto estar all√≠, con parada de metro nueva y magn√≠ficas conexiones.
Volver√≠a sin pens√°rmelo!",5,2023,08,29
139,Good but not great,"Hotel with an elegant and modern design.
Well-kept and comfortable common areas.
High expectations given the cost per night, disappointed by the less than perfect cleanliness.
Visible marks on the wardrobes of the rooms
Not enough cosmetics in the bathroom and poorly stocked. (we had to ask for shower gel several times, nothing.... it arrived after several days of reminders for additional shampoo)
Well at least the water, for the cost per night, should be for free at least every day.
Let's say large areas for improvement",3,2023,08,20
139,Hier bleiben keine W√ºnsche offen,"Wir hatten einen rund um perfekten Aufenthalt in diesem neuen und wundersch√∂nen Hotel. Eingerichtet mit vielen spannenden Highlights des bekannten spanischen Designers. Bereits der Check in verlief herzlich und unkompliziert. Vom Zimmer aus hatten wir einen fantastischen Blick und jeden Morgen wurden wir mit einem sehr leckeren Fr√ºhst√ºck belohnt. Hier besteht die Besonderheit, dass man das Fr√ºhst√ºck aus einer Karte ausw√§hlt und sogar Spezialit√§ten wie Eggs Benedikt dabei sind. Restaurant und Bar haben wir ebenfalls ausprobiert und wurde nicht entt√§uscht. Der Fitnessbereich sowie des Barbereich sind ebenfalls empfehlenswert. In diesem Hotel kann man sich wirklich wohl f√ºhlen und zu haben wir haben die Tage in London sehr genossen, was auch an diesem wunderbaren Hotel lag.",5,2023,03,04
